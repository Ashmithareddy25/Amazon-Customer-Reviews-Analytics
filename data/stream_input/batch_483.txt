B00003CXC6|5.0|Not only is this DVD a treat for the industry wannabes, it is a lesson on film making for its audience.  With the special features in this Criterion Collection, one gains an insight into the over hour-long interpretation by Japanese-film historian Donald Richie.  An interpretation certainly is helpful to a film that has little dialogue and is rich on visuals.<br /><br />Director Robert Altman speaks about the film and influences from Kurosawa.  And one of the more informative features is an excerpt from \\"The World of Kazu Miyagawa, the film's cinematographer.  This, too, is a wonderful lesson on the skill used in shooting this visual masterpiece.<br /><br />A booklet is included, no page numbers, but it includes the full-length dialogue from the source stories \\"In a Grove\\" and \\"Rashomon\\".<br /><br />The story is based on four people's interpretation of what happened to a man who was murdered and his wife raped in the woods.  The movie leaves the viewer without any concrete answers; it allows the viewer to decide who is telling the truth, or, if the truth is even spoken.<br /><br />Picture quality is excellent as well as subtitles and it also provides optional subtitle or soundtrack choices.<br /><br />If you have seen this classic foreign film on VHS, choose the DVD Criterion Collection.  It is plentiful.  ....Rizzo
B00008O89K|5.0|Few scores are as powerful as this classic masterpiece. The movie kinda sucked but the music makes it watchable.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I purchased this cd more than 2 weeks ago and it is still in my cd player! If you are a fan of Michael, you have to buy this album. It is great for that Sunday morning when you have your cup of coffee and read the paper. Michael's voice is amazing! The cd is great. Buy it. If you are a fan, will not be disappointed with this album.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Usually the second album by the artist, especially if the debut was a hit, isn't as good.  This one is definitely the exception to the rule.  I think it's nearly as good as her first album.  I remember seeing her on the MTV Video Awards in 1984 prancing around in a wedding dress, and thinking \\"Wow, that is so cool.\\"  I thought it was especially cool (and disturbing to the parents) that the word 'virgin' was in the title.  Back then, it was almost considered to be dirty.  So I went out and bought this album on tape soon after.  Like her first one, I was not at all disappointed.  I loved nearly every song, especially her cover of Rose Royce's \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\".  Usually a cover version isn't as good as the original, but hers blew Rose Royce's version out of the water.  This was one song I rewound and listened to several times.  That one and \\"Angel\\" which I really liked too, and thought didn't get nearly enough airplay as it should have.<br /><br />I wasn't as crazy about the last three songs--\\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\", \\"Pretender\\" & \\"Stay\\" but I'll listen to them anyway.  I recently bought the CD version so I could rip the songs and put them on my MP3 player.  Of course, like twenty years ago (Holy cow, has it really been that long?  It seems like yesterday to me!) I still enjoy the songs.
0425152251|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and i am so happy that he did! <br />This book is written in the style of a novel and the lead character is a little girl named Sophie who gets introduced to the history of philosophy by a mysterious person who writes to her though letters delivered through a mysterious dog. <br /> Through this remote method of teaching , the philosophy teacher , excites the mind of the young girl about various questions that philosophy first formulates and then attempts to answer .  <br />Page after page we learn about the great philosophers and their philosophies , in a very interesting manner . The writer manages to create interest in this rather dry subject. <br />At times in this book the writer employs some good pedagogical techniques to clarify some concepts of philosophy . <br />All in all i would like to give this book a 5 start because it successfully manages to tell a reasonable history of philosophy to the layman in a very readable manner. <br />i would highly recommend this book <br />
B00005JN2Z|1.0|If you are in your 40's or 50's as I am, have an above average IQ and appreciate music, avoid this film. Jamie Fox was impressive in an ubelievable character. Too many flaws to count; as an example expert shot Tom Cruise misses Jamie Fox in the Metro Rail shootout, yet Fox hits him. Fox uses two shots on a glass door at the office building but only one on dangerous Cruise. Most of the sound track was probably an elementary school percussion class.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|How people can just arbitrarily say what constitutes good acting and bad acting?  I've heard a great deal of people say this and that about Carey Elwes' performance in this film.  Most people say he overdid it.  Well sorry to say this, but I highly doubt any of them have ever seen how someone would behave in that sort of situation.  Overdoing it would be Jack Nicholson (Oscar winner)in the Shining.  He'll even admit it.  I think these days people are looking for reasons to hate any movie that is marginaly original.  Or even worse...when they see one, they get confused, then a little frightened and lash out at it.  \\"That movie outsmarted me! How dare it!?\\"  In this..the golden age of REMAKES, Saw was a brilliant whiff of originality.  Sure, comparisons could be drawn to a bunch of other films...but at least it's its own movie.  No remake of the 1976 \\"classic\\" here.<br />No fetch and borrow from some piece of Japanese crap either.  Think about that when you go see The Ring2.<br /><br />(edit and rebuttal)<br /><br />Ok, I can see that some of the other reviewers failed to understand what I meant when I said that they don't know how someone would act in the situation Cary Elwes' character was in.<br /><br />While I admit I've never seen anyone who's been locked in a subterrainian bathroom and held hostage while his family is being threatened....I do know how people act in situations where their families are threatened and they are powerless to do anything about it.  I work in a hospital where people who've been in fairly bad trauma situations come.  A recent example would be a pretty bad shooting spree in a church group meeting.<br /><br />Without going into details too much, the son/brother of a group of victims arrived at the hospital a while after the attack.  He lost his father and younger brother.  His mother was still in very critical condition.  While this isn't the same thing that happened to Cary in Saw, his reaction and behavior was almost the exact same thing.  Held back tears, and the look of someone who could vomit at any second.  I hate to get all depressing, but this is the best way I can think of to illustrate my point.  I'll agree that the other actors in the film may have given a sub standard performance, but Elwes did a fantastic job of portraying a helpless man whose family was in mortal danger.<br /><br />So while I've never been chased by robots with drills for gentials either, I do know the difference between ridiculus acting and a performance that is either misunderstood, or too real to be believed because its too unsettling.  I think because the scenario and performance of the others in this film requires a certain suspension of disbelief, his all too realistic portrayal may have seemed out of place.
B00063MBU8|3.0|First off, know that I'm not a avid music buyer/listener/whatever, and have not heard SP's first CD.  To be honest I often carry the CD case around with me when I listen b/c sometimes I can't tell what song I'm on because it sounds very uniform throughout the CD, well except untitled.  Aside from that the songs are very enjoyable with sing-along choruses.  The themes usually revolve around teenage discontent with the world/his love life/parents etc.  I especially love the CD cover art. <br /> Overall it is quite decent and is worth the money; although, I sometimes have to take breaks from the uniformity of the songs by listening to something else.  Disagree with me? That's fine; this is my opinion.
B000007T1M|5.0|Not many bands find their feet as quickly as System of a Down did with this, their self-titled debut, released back in 1998. Of course, it helps when you have super-star producer Rick Rubin (Slayer, Beastie Boys) working for you, but I think this debut is the main reason why System of a Down have so much respect and credibility in the music world, after less than a decade on the scene. There are a wide range of influences weaved throughout this album. Yeah, they definitely carved a niche within the nu-metal movement that was going on at the time, but their music is so skilled and original that they are one of the few bands left standing that earned their survival. Afterall, with a singer as flamboyant and distinct as Serj Tankian, it's hard to forget what you've heard. There has always been a political undercurrent in Serj's frantic rants, but he also balances those moments with a sense of humor, a combination that can bring anyone from any walk of life into their world. \\"Peephole\\" is one of the most memorable moments, a drug-ballad of sorts that sounds like it came straight out of the circus. \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\" is probably the most politically charged track of the bunch, and shows S.O.A.D. at their most dead-pan and passionate. Elsewhere, songs like \\"Sugar\\" and \\"Ddevil\\" are downright bizaare, and \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Suggestions\\" explore a more subdued, melodic side. There is, no doubt, an abundance of variety. If you love heavy metal, you got it. If you're leaning more towards alternative, you got that too. I really can't think of anyone I know who doesn't dig System of a Down's music. It's hard to find something negative in music that is this honest and this special. If you got started with their more recent work, and you still don't own this, you're a fool. It's easily one of the best albums in my collection, and owning it for six years now, I can tell you it stands the test of time.
B0002858YS|5.0|By far my favorite album of all time. I rarely ever like more then two or three songs on an album, on Hot Fuss i liked all but two. <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside - what can i say, its perfect. The music just flows, and makes you want to dance like crazy. The lyrics are original and inventive, and the Rock Synth combonation is a refresing break from the generic rock scene. <br /> <br />Jenny Was a Friend Of Mine - a bit slow for my tasts, but still great <br /> <br />Midnight Show - Almost as good as Mr. Brightside, the lyrics are great and the music just makes you want to dance. The synth combonation works really well here. <br /> <br />Smile Like You Mean it- another great track <br /> <br />On Top - Sounds great, really catchy <br /> <br />Any Your a Star - By far one of the most original songs i have heard in a while. I really love this one.  <br /> <br />If you dont like the Killers, you really are missing out on amazing stuff. If they keep producing albums of this calibur, They could be one of the greats in no time.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Unless you've been living under a rock, you already know that Sky Captain is 99% CGI.  Everything except the actors.  Well, it shows.  The visuals are stunning, nobody can deny that.  If they do they're worthless curmudgeons, but I only wish the Director let the actors in on what their characters were seeing a bit better.  You can tell right off that Paltrow and Law are straining.  Paltrow isn't the worlds greatest actress, but Jude Law is proving more and more that he's not just a pretty boy.  Anyone who may have seen him in Road to Perdition can attest to that.  The guy's got skills, but I think (rightfully so) that he needs to have something to interact with.  If Joliee were playing Polly I think the movie would have come off a bit better.  She seemed to have little difficulty in the complete CGI enviornment.  But bouncing off of another person who's having as much (if not more) difficulty than you are in imagining your surroundings hurt this film.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Thank god we have a guy like Kayne West around today. This album definetly saves rap.  College Dropout is one of the best new rap albums of the recent years in my opinon.  In this album Kayne isn't rappin about violence, drugs, sex, and bling.  He is rappin about education, relegion, etc.  Don't get me wrong he does mention bling and sex, but not a lot.  Every song on here is good.  A lot of the songs on here are not hardcore rap, some are nice and calm, Kayne isn't tryin to act hard on this album.  This album is by far better than any of 50 Cent's albums, Lil John's albums, Nelly's albums, and all the other fake rappers albums.  Believe me, your doin urself a favor if u buy College Dropout.     <br /> <br />Favorites: <br />1.) Never Let Me Down <br />2.) Jesus Walks <br />3.) We Don't Care <br />4.) Slow Jamz    <br /> <br />In addition to this album, I also recommend: <br />2Pac - All Eyez On Me <br />2Pac - 7 Day Theory <br />2Pac - 2Pacalypse Now <br />2Pac - Me Against The World  <br />(can't go wrong with a classic Pac album) <br /> <br />NWA - Striaght Outta Compton <br />Dr. Dre - Chronic <br />Snoop Dogg - Doggystyle <br />Bone Thugs N Harmony - E. 1999 Eternal
B000002JSN|5.0|There's not much to say about 'Physical Graffiti' that hasn't already been said.  It is, quite possibly, my favourite Led Zeppelin album and with good reason.  This 1975 effort is spread across two discs and contains a mixture of material recorded in 1975 and material from the archives.   <br /> <br />To the eyes of the uninitiated, this would seem like a slapdash approach but that is not the case.  The songs showcased here show how diverse Led Zeppelin was and how many different types of music they were capable of playing.  I was absolutely blown away by the depth and majesty of this material.  From laid-back ballads, to symphonic arrangements, to swaggering blues; it's all here.  'Physical Graffiti' is perfect on every conceivable level.
B000084T18|5.0|I have to say I have misplaced this album three times and I continue to rebuy it. All the songs are good with the best I think being What Up Gangsta. Overall I could take a beather and not get pissed off when I would waste money on a CD I thought was going to be nice. I could calm down and not have to skip over any tracks. They are all good. It is The best CD and it will never be beat by the G-Unit except the Games Documentary comes in a close second. With Lloyd Banks Straight Outta Cashville in third. Followed by Hunger for More than the Massacre. Also when is Stat Quo coming out with a solo album. Also when is Yayos Cd coming out?
B0001NBMBC|1.0|this is not metal.. this is faggot as- nu-metal crap. this band is horrible its just mainstream mall metal garbage. [...] go pick up a black dalia murder or canibal corpse cd if you want real heavy stuff. this couldn't compare to slayer or any other real metal band. peace mall metal losers.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I can't say I know anything about the story of J.M Barrie and what led him to create the immortal classic story of \\"Peter Pan\\".  I just went into the film just to be entertained. I wasn't really concerned with how much or little truth to the story is. I just really wanted to see if the praise over the film is worthy.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays the struggling playwright James Barrie whose plays just never finds the right audience. His overactive imagination doesn't find an audience. Radha Mitchell (of \\"Pitch Black\\") plays his wife Mary. One day Johnny meets the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys in the park. This quickly leads to a close friendship thanks to James' vivid imagination. Of course this does not sit well with Mary or Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie) who wants Sylvia to remarry into high society. She also does not care for J.M Barrie. She feels that a man his age should not be playing with children, as does J.M's wife. The four boys are precocious as is James Barrie. The five have a rollicking good time together. In the beginning the second youngest son Peter is wary of James Barrie because he is still mourning over the loss of his father. With a little gentle prodding, James manages to get Peter to open up.<br /><br />I immensely enjoyed the film. It had that same whimsical feel that I would get from a Tim Burton movie (like 2003's \\"Big Fish\\"). While his British accent wasn't completely convincing to me, Johnny Depp still managed to put in a superb performance as James Barrie. His chemistry with the young lads were hilarious. I especially loved the scene when they were in the country pretending to be pirates. I loved the vivid scenes of the actors on the pirate ship but I especially loved the last ten-fifteen minutes of the film which involved a performance of \\"Peter Pan\\". I didn't think it was possible but Kate Winslet managed to put in an even a more incredible performance in this film after last year's wonderful \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". Her final scenes in the film literally brought tears to my eyes. Julie Christie was brilliant as Sylvia's overbearing mother. The young lads in the film were a delight to watch, especially Freddie Highmore as Peter. I think we will be seeing more of Freddie in the near future after this film.<br /><br />Despite Johnny Depp's unconvincing Scottish accent, I pretty much found \\"Finding Neverland\\" flawless. I forgot the last time I became so emotional during a movie. The last fifteen minutes of the film was so heartbreaking I found myself all choked up. I was truly moved. \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a great film for people of all ages. It is certainly one of the best films from last year that I have seen.<br /><br />The bonus dvd features are excellent. I especially loved the outtakes which I found to be hilarious. The behind the scenes footage was equally wonderful. I especially enjoyed watching the actors discuss their roles in \\"The Magic of Finding Neverland\\". There are also a few deleted scenes included. I am rather glad that they were deleted from the film because I personally found those scenes pointless and not very interesting.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\".

B000067CPX|3.0|I don't know, I still think this is a good album and very listenable but it just didn't 'grab me' like their other work.  It's as if something is missing and the rawness has been replaced by a polished radio-friendly feel. 'By the Way' left me feeling kind of empty.  There has always been a sense of danger, an experimental edge, about the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I can't help but feel as though that edge is gone.  Where's the funk? <br /> <br />Please don't think for a second that I'm putting the band down, I'm a big fan, I just wasn't particularly excited by this album.  Don't hate me.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|when buying this album, i was expecting something like their earlier album, \\"Oceanborn\\", but when i popped this into my CD player i got everything thats on \\"Oceanborn\\", and more! this album is heavier, the guitars are refined, but sadly enough, Tarja doesnt sing quite as operatically, which first got me into the band. Dont let this stop you though, this is a very powerful album, with my favorite song being the ten minute orchestral masterpiece \\"Ghost Love Score\\". so if youre a returning Nightwish fan, dont hesitate and buy this, but if youre a newcomer to the band, check out their older stuff first.
B0002DB50E|5.0|David Cronenberg's 'Videdrome' is a dark and surreal film, dealing with the nightmare of the human body, boredom, and the media's pervailing control upon the mind.  The Burroughs-esque world portrayed here by Cronenberg is dark and stark, providing the perfect ambience for this sinister story.  The film entails Max Ren (sic?) brilliantly brought to life by James Woods as a low-budget cable television programming director, bored with life and seeking kicks through violent video stimuli.  He happens to stumble across the violent and sadistic 'Videdrome'. As a consequence, his life is slowly transformed into a hellish and surreal nightmare.  Deborah Harry is perfect as the hot-blooded and kinky Nikki Brand, a thrill-seeking sexed-up radio talkshow host.  This is a very atmospheric film that had me mesmerized and enthralled.  The topic of media control of the mind is always relevant, and explored very creatively within the frames of this film. This movie was a lot better than I had expected, and definately stands amongst Cronenberg's best films. If you enjoy dark psychological science fiction, you will love this movie. Very interesting.
B00066N8JS|5.0|For a Nine Inch Nails fan, the extras are not enough to purchase the album again simply  because a  Nine inch nails fan already found ways to get all the extras, paying for an entire soundtrack cd to get \\"Dead Souls,\\" and \\"Burn\\" off of the crow and natural born killers soudntracks, and getting the various remix cds that also include most of these tracks. But despite this, you will find that almost every hardcore Nine Inch Nail fan owns it anyway, because Reznor has had such an influence on their musical perception, and maybe even their whole life. THere are three small extras that were on no other release, and that is the demo versions of three of the Nine Inch Nail songs from the downward spiral. Yes, they were worth the wait, as you will see many a harmony you didn't even directly know existed before thanks to all the layers of music thrown on top of the sound. Also, this is mixed in 5.1 surround sound, bringing clarity to the multilayered NIN sound. To those who only recently discovered NIN (with their new single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" surfacing and hitting radios everywhere) or those who have been a fan for years but almost somehow forgot, this album will rock your world. This is the most important Nine Inch Nails album you could own. That is, until With Teeth comes out.
B00003W8NM|5.0|if you can get past teh violence and look to the real movie's meaning this movie has the ability to change your life.
B00005A0N5|5.0|This CD was my introduction to Nightwish and the Power Metal genre, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles of music. The songs on \\"Oceanborn\\" are powerful and moving, with \\"Stargazers\\" as the opening song which gets everything going with great violins and vocals. then stargazers flows into \\"Gesethemane\\", which i have to say is the song here i like the least, but nevertheless, it still has its ups. \\"Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean\\" has the fastest drumming on the CD with some male vocals for a little vareity. \\"sacrament of Wilderness\\" has my favorite intro on the whole album and very cool guitars. \\"Passion and the Opera\\" was actually the first nightwish song i heard, and Tarja is at her best here. the next song, \\"Swanheart\\" is a rest from the guitars and drumming, but right afterward, prepare to take the plunge into \\"Moondance\\", which has a folky air about it. \\"The Riddler\\" has got be my favorite song on here, because of the wonderful chorus. \\"The Pharoh Sails to Orion\\" is the orchestral piece on here that just blew me away, especially the ending of the song. \\"walking in the Air\\" and the bonus track , \\"Sleeping Sun\\" are both a quiet end to a very epic and moving album.
B0006U4UAU|5.0|As of this date, March 27, 2004, \\"Daft Punk is playing in my house\\" is currently number three on college radio, and I helped. Being a DJ at a college radio station we stay away from Top 40 and stick to indie stuff. No needless to say we get a lot of bad bands.  <br /> <br />Let me tell you though...LCD SOUNDSYSTEM is not a bad band. From \\"Daft Punk is PLaying in my House\\" to \\"yr City's a sucker\\" this album is solid. Well their are down-falls, well only one that I can think of, that is it can get reptitive. But who cares! This is on ROCK/TECHNO not PUNK/TECHNO. Techno gets repetitive. Some reviews I have read said the lyrics are not so good. Lyrics are not the name of the game here, its all bout the beat and melody.  <br /> <br />Pick up the album and you will not be dissapointed. It is quite a challenge to listen to actually, because oncec you start listening all your motivation do do anything else will be over, except to dance of course. <br /> <br />
1400034779|5.0|A truly NICE book, what might serve as a definition <br />of 'heartwarming'. The fact that Ms. Ramotswe is a <br />detective is secondary to the insight the book <br />provides into Africa. One of the previous reviewers <br />mentioned that Americans in particular don't have much <br />of an idea what Africa is like. I am guilty as charged... <br />Any one book (even Micheneresque) would have a hard time <br />remedying that, but the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency <br />books (collectively) come close. Not only do they convey <br />a non-politicized view of everyday life, they inspire <br />a search for further 'Africana' type material. Mr. Smith <br />will no doubt have a hard time filling the demand, LoL....

B00000HYXB|5.0|This was my first Blind Guardian CD, and wow did it blow me away. i had heard about them before and how they were the best in the genre, but when i listened to this album, i didnt expect it to be as masterful and epic. in fact, i thought this would just be another typical power metal band. i guess Nightfall proved me wrong there. anyway, ill name a few of my favorites on to the album itself. it starts off with a dialogue between Morgoth the Dark Lord and one of his servants, im not sure which(in case you dont know, this is based off Tolkeins book, The Silmarillion). right after, it throws you into the song Into The Storm, which hits hard and fast, and makes you want to listen to the entire CD all the way through nonstop. The Curse of Feanor has some brilliant work with guitars, drums, and vocals, which can go from smooth to agressive in a blink of an eye. Blood Tears starts off softly, and is just an overall beautifully done song. Mirror Mirror, their single has some of the most epic guitar work ive ever heard, and an awesome chorus to go with it. towards the end of the album, the track When Sorrow Sang is probably the fastest track on here with some great bass drums. this album is just breathtaking and epic. its hard to capture the overall air about this album in a review so if youre remotely interested, id highly suggest going out and buying this album, or borrowing it from a friend. enjoy.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute. Masterpiece!!!Each song sounds like it belongs on this record, and in the place it is. I love how they make there songs flow togther, which they incorprated this on de-loused, But really took it to another level with frances. The flow is perfect. Everyone i preach to about mars volta, i tell them, the best way to listen to frances and absorb it all and take it all in , is with headphones, and multiple listens. Theres alot to absorb/take in/discover/enjoy with this record. Also ive told everyone, its mars volta sound, but its a totally different record from de-loused.I love both of them equally, (well maybe de-loused just a tad more), But its nice to see a band progress foward, and not retread places they have already been with past efforts(albulms). I mean whats they point in making a second albulm just like your first one, none at all to me. In closing I highly recomend frances, to any and everyone, i constantly tell people about them, on the sites im on. <br /> <br />peace <br /> <br />~S~

B00005JSGK|5.0|John Wayne shined in this Africa Safari. Wayne and his crew of sharp shooters and africa tribe people go and capture animals that are order from zoos in the United States. yet, still Wayne has to put up with a female photgrapher that the Indian gave permission to come to Africa to take photo's of the crew and what they do. Two questions need to be answered in the classic. First can this crew get the animals that are order without getting hurt and the second question is what will the crew do after the season over. I like this movie just for the fact that I will never make it to Africa and this was as close as I would get. I give this movie 5 wessel stars.

And you have to admit, even if you hate Green Day, this is one super catchy album.<br /><br />It starts off with Burnout, a super fast catchy song and it continues on that way for the rest of the CD pretty much. It includes Green Day classics like Longview and Basket Case which you must have heard religously on your local rock radio station at one time or another. One complaint is that all the songs sound the same. But despite this, its still worth your time.<br /><br />In closing, even though this disc is what basically fired off Green Day's career, it isn't their best. If you are looking for Green Day's best pick up Nimrod. But if you are just looking for a fun, catchy sing a long punk CD with great replay value, pick up Dookie. You won't be disapointed. Even after 10 years, its still as good as ever.
B000777J2S|1.0|<br />On a first listen I was kind of ashamed that Antony was so constantly trying to sound nina-simonesque <br />throughout the entire CD, since he fails \\"dramatically\\" at his attempt I can only say: he wished. <br />What nobody seems to have noticed (let's be frank, nobody really wants to mention) is that half the time <br />he resembles Mick Hucknall (Simply Red singer), and that latter comparison goes for the music as well.  <br /> <br />besides the simone pretentious emulation the album is pretty dull and  <br />the compositions are medioccre. How this kind of music is getting so much hype is beyond my mind: nothing new, <br />a wannabe that barely reaches a 1 out of 10 as an imitation of the one and only Nina Simone, ... but well, i think we'll <br />have to put up with lots of pitchfork readers and the unwanted chain of press reviewers that originally read <br />pichfork, they will all be appraising this for a little while, none of them would  <br />of course give a damn about the best of Simply Red or Tindersticks anymore, they won't give a damn <br />about Antony as soon as Pitchfork rates one of his next albums a 4.9. If you want to buy some music by <br />astonishing singers, then get some real Nina Simone, Bryan Ferry, Jeff Buckley or David Bowie instead, too much <br />class for the average pitchfork believer, i suppose.

B000002G1Y|5.0|Ask a fan of John Hiatt's about their favorite Hiatt CD, and there's probably a 90% chance he or she will pick one of the \\"trilogy\\" - \\"Slow Turning\\", \\"Bring the Family\\", or \\"Stolen Moments\\".  These are all great albums, but the argument could be made that \\"Perfectly Good Guitar\\" is Hiatt at his best.  Hiatt always infuses his songs with a sense of fun even when singing about the pitfalls of life, but he really seem to cut loose on this album with some terrific guitar work and some of his most clever lyrics.  The title song is one of Hiatt's best - a rock anthem that would be rated with \\"Born to Run\\" and other legendary rock songs if Hiatt got the credit he deserves.  This is as good an album as any to pick for an introduction to Hiatt - his clever lyrics will captivate \\"newcomers\\" and leave them wanting more.
B000002GFT|4.0|\\"Liege and Lief\\" is an undeniably important album and the word \\"seminal\\" cannot be overused in describing it.  The album virtually single handily launched the genre of British folk/rock, inspired founder Fairprot member Ashley Hutchings to form Steeleye Span and, well the rest is history. <br /> <br />Nevertheless less this very solid album is not Fairport's best.  The title belongs to their magnificent third album \\"Unhalfbicking\\" with their wonderful second album \\"What We Did On Our Holidays\\" checking in in second place. <br /> <br />Part of what keeps \\"Liege and Lief\\" from displacing those two are the occasional moments that come of just a mite contrived.  The idea of kicking this off with a \\"calling on song\\" was a clever one give the albums concept of fully blending late 60's rock and roll with traditional British folk idioms, but that opening tack, \\"Come All Ye,\\" well technically well accomplished comes across as more of an academic exercise than anything else.  Nice try but better luck next time. <br /> <br />A smilier situation exists with the all instrumental track \\"The Lark in the Morning.\\"  Yes, jigs and reels are an important aspect of traditional music, but the execution here, while impressive, doesn't quite prevent the urge to hit the skip on the CD remote. <br /> <br />Much of the rest of the album, however isn't just exciting, it is damn exciting!  The traditional \\"Matty Groves\\" is a harrowing epic of lust, betrayal, and murder that, in movie form, would have a difficult time getting on TV in these oh so Puritanical times in which we live.  For all the songs strengths (and it has plenty to burn) it's pinnacle is the astonishingly passionate vocals from lead singer Sandy Denny who delivery terrifies me each and every time I hear it as she spins this mighty yarn and I've had this album in one form or another for more than 20 years.  (Almost as compelling is the ghost story \\"Tam Lin\\" which also benefits from Denny's flawless delivery). <br /> <br />But the real highlights are two unbelievably gorgeous ballads, \\"Farewell, Farewell\\" and \\"Crazy Man Michael.\\"  Neither of them are traditional -- the first was written by then band member Richard Thompson (yes, *THAT* Richard Thompson) and the later by Thompson and band-mate Dave Swarbrick -- but you would only know that be reading the song credits as both sound like they could be traditional British Isles ballads that date back to the 15th century.  Both are unforgettable and \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" just may be the bands single finest moment.  A timeless classic for the ages. <br /> <br />So \\"Liege and Lief\\" is an excellent, but slightly flawed album.  It's minor flaws are more than made up for by its heights, but those flaws do prevent it from being Fairport's finest moment, even if the album remains, unquestionably, its most influential moment.
B000002J1U|5.0|The typical review for Led Zep's third album released in October of 1970 would go something like this: \\"After heavily borrowing from the blues on their first two records, Led Zeppelin decide to go country\\" or something to that effect. I guess what I mean to say is that this album took many people by surprise whether they bought when it first came out or when they got around to discovering Zeppelin in their teen years like myself. I had heard \\"Immigrant Song\\" on the radio and was instantly intrigued. Still one of my favorite three Zep songs of all-time, thirty five years have done nothing to diminish its power, \\"hammer of the Gods\\" indeed! Discovering the album's other hidden gems was quite an experience as well. \\"Gallows Pole\\" is very cool, with Bonzo, per usual, giving the song its extra kick about halfway through. \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is probably the second most famous song on the disc and partially notable as the bands first real \\"original\\" blues song, with great dynamincs from Plant and Page. \\"Out on the Tiles\\" and \\"Celebration Day\\" are the other two great heavy tracks and are better in the fact that classic rock radio hasn't played them a million times, which is the case with many Zeppelin classics. The reason this album is \\"controversial\\" is due to most of the second side being acoustic. I am sorry but if you don't love \\"Tangerine\\", \\"Pole\\", and \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" then you don't love Zeppelin! \\"Stomp\\" is just an insanely catchy tune. \\"When you're old and your eyes are dim, there ain't no Old Shep gonna happen again\\", that line kills me and should have special meaning for anyone who lost a pet. Pet lovers and hard rockers, acoustic folkies and laid back stoners will all find some texture of 'LZ III' that will give them a nice warm feeling in their hearts and souls.

0393312836|4.0|'A Clockwork Orange' deserves its place right up there at the top of dystopian fiction, a superb and thought-provoking piece that is amply cynical about government, media, the police and the prison service while remaining pleasingly sceptical of the alternatives (the damning indictment of the opposition towards the end), but without getting overly preachy, usually operating by suggestion rather than overt political statement. More broadly it sets up the philosophical dilemma over free will and its moral ramifications, coming down on the side of liberty but thoughtfully maintaining that no solution is perfect. For me the ending (not in the original) is a tad odd and seems to be an attempt at justifying Alex's choices, rather unsuccessfully. The book is more nihilistic where no solution works - Alex returning to his original state is endlessly depressing, for instance, however much we may have opposed the state's action against him.  <br /> <br />The really brilliant thing about Clockwork Orange, however, is the language use. Not only is the language of nadsat an inventive device which is deployed brilliantly, but the whole style of prose is searing, incredibly original and frequently humorous. The book has the capability to be vivid, shocking and simultaneously worryingly amusing in its attitude. Overall, combined with the power of its nihilistic force, it makes a huge impression on the reader.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|That being said, most critical QOTSA fans can find at least 4 tracks on the CD that they love. They rest of it, hopefully, will grow on me. The interesting thing about this album is that it does really seem to draw from previous releases. Even Josh said that this album would be as close to the first album as they would probably ever get and it's apparent on a song like Medication who would be the logical sister companion to Regular John. Someone's In Their Wolf would sounded just great on the last album but part of me just longs for the smoky, rich sound of Lanegans vocal. That is the missing part of QOTSA that I miss the most. Sure, Nick's presence probably helped create some more focued stuff but even with Josh is obviously cabable of 80% which is about what I would rate the album. It's too early to say how this will rate against the other 3 albums so it wouldn't be fair to go ahead and rank it. I think it's a great album that could have been made even better with the help of Oliveri and Lanegan. Combining those three forces created some of the best modern music I have heard in a long time.<br /><br />Obviously I would buy this album because I am a die-hard Queens fan and I think you should support these guys anyway you can. But don't be too bummed if you don't hear what you want on the first couple of listens. That's usually the mark of a good album in the long run.

B000005RFI|5.0|Paranoid (1970.), Black Sabbath's second studio album<br /><br />'Paranoid' was a work like no other at the time of its release. The quartet of Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Toni Iommi (Guitar), Geezer Butler (Bass) and Bill Ward (Drums) after their self titled debut at the turn of the '70's put together this heavy-metal work of art. Black Sabbath are rightly credited as the main band which pioneered the heavy metal sound - their style was very revolutionary for its time. They were light years ahead of quite a lot of bands and their heavy, powerful style was something which only became more commonplace towards the end of the 70's/start of the 80's. Perhaps the only contemporary early 70's bands which came close to their style was Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin (with some of their more heavier stuff) and a handful of other bands.<br /><br />You've gotta respect this band for the changing musical direction they started. At the time, they were heavily criticised by plenty of rather 'conservative' critics who really didn't know what to make of the band's music. Black Sabbath at the time were and sometimes still are misinterpreted as a band of devil worshippers when the reality is that the message they really portray in their music is that of a reaction to war, crime and plenty of other issues that trouble the world. People who often view Black Sabbath in a negative and suspicious light haven't listened to them (especially their lyrics) carefully enough and simply write them off. True, their style is quite dark on the whole but it is the ideal way to create the atmosphere for the lyrics. Atmospherics are definitely a strong point of Black Sabbath and you'll feel this when you listen to them and they have a very good knack at leaving gaps in their music (done to perfection in parts on Paranoid) which gives their music great suspense. There's very little to say about Ozzy Osbourne that lots of people haven't said, the man is a legend - unique as a vocalist. Couple this with the amazing power chords of Toni Iommi's guitar, the ever present bass lines from Geezer Butler and the great 'War Drums' style from Bill Ward and you have a much more than capable line up.<br /><br />Onto the album music itself. 'War Pigs' is a powerful, moving 8 minute opener about the ills of war and the 'game like' attitude of politicians. There's plenty of memorable riffs in this tune alone, great effects too and rounds off at the end with a whirlwind finish. 'Paranoid' follows this, a track that even people who have the remotest intetest in rock have heard. For me, this track is equaled by at least 4 other tracks on the album but its stands still as a testament to the heavy metal sound with Ozzy's echoing vocals sounding around a great but remarkably simple guitar riff. 'Planet Caravan' follows this and we have a change of mood here - Ozzy's vocals are more mysterious here and it makes a very haunting track. The song rounds off with a brilliant guitar solo - I can't understand why a lot of people diss this track, it adds another dimension to a great album and has great atmospherics. If things couldn't get any better, 'Iron Man' follows this - you hear the thudding at the start, followed by that ripper of a guitar chord then 'I AM IRON MAN!' brilliant - a great riff (again) characterises the track from then on with great vocals.<br /><br />The first half of the album is a monster start and then we have 'Electric Funeral', a bit downbeat in tone at the start but develops into another heavy rocker with some wailing guitar work in time to Ozzy's vocals. 'Hand of Doom' is more thoughtful but build into a good climax - listen out for the anti war references again - Ozzy makes his views heard on the Vietnam war, which was still happening at the time of the album. 'Rat Salad' is a drum showcase, reminiscent of 'Moby Dick' from Led Zeppelin II. A good break up track with some very good drumming from Bill Ward. 'Fairies Wear Boots' sounds out the album, a track which cleverly develops into different parts, a bit catchy - listen out for some great bass playing making a great thick texture to this track.<br /><br />As you can see, I have plenty to say about this album - cos its so so good. Never pass off this band, like other 70's bands, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, these guys are pioneers of a changing direction in rock and you never get tired of listening to them. A must for any metal fan.a bit catchy - listen out for some great bass playing making a great thick texture to this track.

B0001LJC2K|3.0|this CD was very..different! Being an old(er) headbanger, I was not DISsatisfied with my purchase. Sonically, this CD covers a very wide range of spirit and intensity. You'll hear soft piano's and strings out the wazzooo, and it all sounds VERY GOOD. <br /> <br />Absolution reminds me of the movie Jacobs Ladder. When that movie was over, I sat there for a while, thinking.. OK.. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?.. then realized it was really an overthetop/great/strange/mindblowing movie. If you watch that movie a few times, you'll see how your interpretations can change. Musically, this is my Jacobs Ladder.  <br /> <br />Heavy to hard music lovers may not like this CD, but for those who like music with multiple moods, jump right in and sample the bites supplied by Amazon.. I felt they really provided an accurate assessment of the entire CD.  <br /> <br />The reason I only gave them 3 stars, was due to the fact they DO sound like another band musically (not just the singer), and I dont feel 4 or 5 is warranted just yet. The next CD they put out should give me a better understanding of what direction they are going to go.. but I have a sneaky suspicion it will sound very good.
B00000DR5D|4.0|I didn't even know Ricochet was a live recording when I first bought it, and believe me it really doesn't make any difference.  There's a smattering of applause at the beginning and end, otherwise you wouldn't even know it's live, and the album-length composition was new, so Ricochet slots right in with the band's other 70's studio recordings.<br /><br />TD followed a far spacier path than most Krautrock bands, having more in common with Pink Floyd than Can or Neu! or the other German bands of the era.  Ricochet featured the use of some real instruments like drums, guitar and piano that are uncommon on Tangerine Dream albums.<br /><br />Part One, after setting up the requisite synth atmospherics, takes off on a simple but effective guitar riff and an almost conventional space-prog sound before turning to a more electronic midsection.  This part shows just how much of a debt is owed to TD by today's techno and trance acts.  The synths eventually find their way back to the main theme originally played on guitar, tying the whole thing together nicely before a long coda with mellotron, sound effects and weird percussion.<br /><br />Part two opens with a quasi-classical piano part that serves as a perfect interlude amid all the electronics.  The trademark sequencer starts up and a synthesized horn fanfare announces what sounds like a variation on the theme from part one, though this part was recorded at a later concert.  The middle is spacy and avant-garde sounding, like Ummagumma with sequencers.  Then the pace quickens, the synth lines are circling and diving all over the place while those sequencers ping-pong away in a musical translation of the album's title.<br /><br />The whole thing winds down to a flute (or synthesized flute) section that serves as a breather before the finale.  This last section builds in intensity before winding down to a mellotron enhanced fadeout.<br /><br />The use of some real instruments and the near-symphonic arrangement make Ricochet a good choice for the \\"regular\\" prog fan who wants to pick up some Tangerine Dream.  This group influenced everything from trance and techno to Ozric Tentacles to club music, all while making classic \\"headphones\\" albums for the space-prog set of the 70's.

It must have cost Fox a fortune to make this series, and I can't imagine why they decided to throw it all away.
B00005A46T|3.0|Slipknot is a great band, don't get me wrong. However, this disc can be hard to follow by at times. The only song I know of that I can easily follow to on this record is \\"Left Behind\\". Guitar work and such is great. \\"My Plague\\" is a song that's harder to follow by, and \\"The Heretic Anthem\\", that tends to get boring at times...<br /><br />I'd just download a few songs off this album. It's really not worth your money. \\"Vol. 3\\" is a great album, since it has the guitar solos and it's easier to follow by.
B000002H33|1.0|I watched the MTV Icon show honouring Metallica so I figured \\"Hey, these guys must be good if they're on MTV!!\\". Needless to say I heard some of the songs of st. Anger and Reload - as well as a couple of the \\"Metallica\\" album and was quite impressed (although the latter album sucks overall). So I decided to check out some of their older stuff from the 80s. Big mistake. Back then these guys were just a bunch of goths telling you to take drugs and kill yourself. Also the songs are too long. Some of these are over 8 minutes!! If a song goes longer than 3 then it's boring. Thank god they woke up and decided to play on MTV and learnt how to actually play.

B000003TA4|5.0|Kurt Cobain is one of the greatest musicians ever and saved the music scene. Thanks to him, we now have great music and great guitar work dominating the airwaves. I was reading an article by Rolling Stone magazine the other day and it listed Kurt as a top 15 guitar player of all time, so it must be a fact. The reason they didn't include talentless posers like Andres Segovia, Paco De Lucia, Vai, Holdsworth, Petrucci, Satriani, Friedman, Al de Meola, Steve Morse etc is because they suck and because no one's ever heard of them. Cobain on the other hand is all over the TV and is called a legend. The solo in Teen Spirit is better than anything those unknown losers ever recorded put together. Also he plays amazing riffs - and when I say riffs, I don't mean crappy riffs that hair bands such as Metallica, Black Sabbath or Symphony X play - I mean riffs that are actually good. Thanks to Kurt, bands who can REALLY play and make REAL music rule the world nowadays, and the aforementioned manufactured crap is gone.
0525457585|5.0|I have been an avid reader since I was a small child, and I have always loved fantasy stories.  When I was 12, I went to see \\"The Neverending Story II\\" in the theater, and I was instantly entranced and intrigued.  I'd watched the first movie when I was about 8 and images from it never left my mind.  When I realized that both were based on a book, I knew I had to read it.  And so began my quest to find it.  Once I finally did, my hands shook as I took the book home and read it.  I couldn't stop.  From the very first line until the last, I was hooked.  The characters, the images, and the story stayed with me long after the last page was turned.  There were even times when the characters were so real to me, I felt as if I could literally see them! <br /> <br />I won't go into a description of the plot since so many have done so already.  Suffice it to say that this is truly a bibliophile's dream!  And you simply MUST get the hardcover with the red and green text.  When the book was originally published in Germany, that's how it was printed, and even to this day, German versions are still printed with the colored text. <br /> <br />Now, at 26 and beginning my career as a children's/young adult librarian, I have made it my mission to purchase the hardcover version of this book for every library I ever work at. (Unless they have it already, of course.)  It is an essential and classic work of children's literature that has had a profound effect on my life.  It encouraged me to think, to dream, and to wonder, but also to remember that while books are important, one shouldn't forget to live life in the \\"real\\" world as well.  Good fantasy, like this book, encourages children to stretch their imaginations and grow.  And that is a truly wonderful gift. <br /> <br />Whenever anyone asks me about my favorite books, this one is always on the tip of my tongue.  I love it dearly and am thrilled that so many share my passion for it as well.  Read it and remember: truly great books defy age categories and touch us no matter how old, or young, we are.
B00076ZZ84|3.0|Let's be honest. \\"Under My Skin\\" is something of a borderline album to begin with. It didn't have the hooks that Avril's first disc, \\"Let Go\\" had, and the sales showed that the public didn't enjoy this material quite as much as they did her first album.    That being said, there is something very nice about the Dual Disc concept, which seems to be the music industry's response to file sharing. Will this become the standard for all recording artists? Could be. Videos are still being made, though people rarely sit through them. Even on MTV's famed \\"TRL,\\" or Fuse's \\"Daily Download,\\" they never play a video in its entirety! Perhaps this will be the way an audience can see a video if they want.    The problem is that the audio CD for this album came out in 2004! At this point, even Avril's webmasters and fan club members must be asking the people at RCA/BMG... who cares? If this had been the CD/DVD release when the material was new, it would have been a worthwhile package at a pretty decent price. Now, it's just an excuse for fans to purchase an album they already own.    But let's talk about this particular package. On one side of the disc, you get the audio version of the album. On the other, you get the audio version again, in enhanced stereo. The difference might be more noticible for other genres of music, like Classical, Opera or Jazz, but here, the improvement of the sound quality is negligible. So, no big points for that.    However, it's nice to get the videos for Avril's singles: \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Nobody's Home.\\" And a promo piece that follows Ms. Lavigne and her band around the British Isles while she's on tour is pretty entertaining. It aired in edited versions on both MTV (under their \\"Diary\\" anthology series) and on Fuse (as a special), so if you wanted to have a nice copy of that, it would be worth getting this disc. The MTV version had more footage that wasn't included here, so you don't get everything possible, but it's still an amusing trip... if only to hear Avril's brief a cappella cover of Outkast's \\"Hey, Ya!\\" In the midst of it all, or her other goofball antics, like sneaking onto the grounds of Kensington Palace with her Starbuck's latte, or reading some tabloid mag with a story about her at a petrol mini-mart.    If you already have the standard CD version of this disc, and you don't care about the video extras, you should completely skip this.
B00074CBMY|5.0|Joe Cocker, for 35 years, has always sung from the depths of his soul.  And this project clearly is full of soul but encompasses much, much more!!  His voice now brings out MUCH rougher and MORE raw sounds of joy, pain, agony, and exhilaration.<br /><br />The musical arrangements bring contributions from the WHO'S WHO of musicians in the world!  Just a few who add their brilliance are Michael Thompson on guitar, Jeff Beck on guitar, Eric Clapton on guitar, Steve Lukather on guitar, Chris Botti on trumpet, Jerry Goodman on violin, Mike Landau on guitar, Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter on guitar, Rafael Padilla on percussion, Bruce Eskovitz on sax plus many other talents.<br /><br />In the collection of songs are some written by such artists as John Lennon, U2, Paul McCartney, James Taylor, and Marvin Gaye.  Joe sings a fantastic and varied repertoire of songs that were originally recorded by music icons Tom Jones, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, David Bowie, Robert Palmer, Rose Royce, and R.E.M.<br /><br />\\"One\\" has 2 versions on the cd, the opening number which was recorded in the studio (a GORGEOUS weave of soul and subtlety) and the other that closes the album sung live in concert (with STIRRING sensitivity).  Joe's vocal on \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" is NOTHING short of a soulful anthem.  \\"Chain of Fools\\" is argueably the most glorious version ever recorded!  No singer has EVER gotten inside the song \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" with the sensitivity that Joe has done.  He builds this song to a frenzy!!  (McCartney must be THRILLED.)  \\"I Keep Forgetting\\", a cooking and edgy number which builds up to the next BLOW-OUT VERSION EVER RECORDED, \\"I Put A Spell On You\\".  This haunting vocal pulls out ALL of the stops!!!  The engaging arrangement with Eric Clapton's infectious bluesy guitar solo is INCOMPARABLE!  Joe gives a wrenching vocal on \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\".  \\"Jealous Guy\\" is a funky tribute to one of John Lennon's songs.<br /><br />Joe has taken these songs and his other legendary numbers on the road.  Most recently when playing the West Coast, he completely sold all of the venues out.  WHAT MORE CAN I SAY???

B00005JNDZ|4.0|Bridget is back and not at all terrible. The first movie was downright a keeper for life, so it was hard to imagine them re-creating the same atmosphere and level of hilarity as the first. While there are parts that are omited from the book and replaced with other situations,it is understandable why. For example,Cleaver is hardly in The Edge of Reason, but he's in the movie for a fair amount.Another involves her trip to Thailand. <br />All the original actors/actresses are back which is key to pulling off a authentic sequel. The music, situations, &quot;Bridgetisms&quot; are all wonderful, if not at times better than before. And it is rewarding to know that her interview with Colin Firth did not go overlooked. Can't wait till I have enough money to buy this DVD and upgrade the original from VHS to DVD. Not as great as the first, but a worthy sequel.
0316172324|4.0|In \\"Blink,\\" author Malcolm Gladwell explores \\"post-modern\\" decision-making. In modernism, we decided based upon logic: the analysis of factual data, as much of it as we could gather. In post-modernism, we decide based upon the synthesis of sensed experience, as small a slice as we can focus upon.<br /><br />Fortunately, Gladwell does not lean exclusively toward an either/or approach. That is, he recognizes the necessity of facts, while emphasizing the way the brain works to process information.<br /><br />What Gladwell writes in pithy narrative, psychologists have discussed for decades in what is known as HIPT: Human Information Processing Theory. Their model overlaps with Gladwell's main focus: to make wise decision we need the ability to think holistically-to envision seemingly disconnected puzzle pieces as a beautiful mosaic.<br /><br />I've applied his thinking to areas as diverse as a fantasy baseball auction draft, to a counseling session. In fantasy baseball, I've always been the most informed participant in our group of 14 grown-men who spend a day in April acting like boys. However, Gladwell helped me to detect my \\"information overload.\\" I had all the facts, ALL the facts, but not enough of the feel. Not enough of the intuitive sense that gathered the data, related it to our group, and adjusted quickly to changing scenarios.<br /><br />As a professional counselor and counselor educator, I've always practiced and taught that we must add relational competence to our theoretical understanding. We must skillfully intuit what is happening in me, in my counselee, and in our relationship. In essence, this is counseling by \\"blink.\\"<br /><br />For those who desire more (and in some cases more accurate) information on how the brain functions and how we can discipline our minds and emotions so that we relate well and think with discernment, I would recommend Daniel Goleman's now classic work, \\"Emotional Intelligence.\\" Use it hand-in-hand with \\"Blink\\" and you just might win your fantasy baseball league!<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"eviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"
B0007OCG4W|5.0|It's about four Londoners (the men are homegrown; the women transplants from the States) who, over the course of four years,  fall in and out of love with one another, in remarkably quick and often devastating fashion. If this sounds a tad shallow, it should be. Mike Nicholas's lucid adaptation of Patrick Marber's acclaimed play (Marber also wrote the lacerating script) doesn't pretend its selfish, chilly, deluded characters are doing anything more than feigning the moves of true love on their quest for narcissistic gratification. The film is composed of the beginnings (all coy words and sweet nothings) and the ends (where wit is filed into verbal darts to be hurled at the most vulnerable moments) of their relationships, love winnowed to a nub for a speed-dating world. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and particularly Clive Owen check sentiment at the door and deliver diamond-sharp studies in ennui, rage, arrogance, and emptiness. I'm not spoiling anything when I say that none of the four achieve the intimacy of the title, but it's nasty, wounding fun watching them sabotage one another (and ultimately themselves) along the way.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The blueprint of this film is the well known true story of a polish-jew concert pianist who survives the War in hiding and eludes the death camps at the 11th hour when he is voilently seperated form his family.<br /><br /> From the moment of seperation onwards, the film is a lonely and tense story of a man struggling to survive, remain anonymous and make sense of what is going on in his own city as he can only view varied acts of random, horrific violence from his window. He has no feedback as to what is going on and who is killing who. One feels the anxiety, pain and hope of his family returning or survivng their fate. His struggle is expertly documented, I found myself confused, tense and anxious at each turn of events; much as the central character does.<br /><br /> He is steadily taken from sophisticated young man to a half starved, half crazed, vagrant and heathen. The survival race takes another bizarre twist as the story nears it's end.<br /><br /> Brodie is excellent and silently portrays this mans degridation, he seems to do this with great emotional resonance and a sadly beautiful, wasting physicality.<br /><br /> The support cast are amazing, Fox as the central source of aid is emotive and couragoues. Lipman and Finlay play the elderly parents with tenderness and realism, the scene when the family share a last chocolate is one of the most emotive displays of solidarity and hope I have seen. Brilliant and a MUST see.
B0007P3582|2.0|great beats. and that's what it is, strictly beats. i'm gonna be a good sport and congratulate 50 cent on his 10 million albums + sold. however, i'm just telling it like it is. seriously 50 cent is so weak lyrically. i can't believe he hails from new york, home of jay-z, nas, biggie, big l, grand puba, mos def, jadakiss, krs-one...etc. i mean how did he survive in this climate? i give props to lloyd banks though cuz he is definately a lyricist. i just don't see how they're on the same squad. how do you let ja rule beat you up with a crutch and a garbage can? seriously! (no disrepect ja, though, cuz he can whoop 50 in a lyrical battle) ja at least had a story and he said that 50 punched him so it's believable. 50 doesn't have a story so that shows what the truth is. anyway, i know people criticize ja for singing and all but 50 sings too! hello....\\"many men\\" \\"disco inferno\\" \\"candy shop\\"...etc. and i know that people say ja is trying to be tupac and i see why they say that cuz of \\"so much pain\\" but c'mon 50 steals pac's flow in \\"the realest killaz\\" plus he did \\"his\\" version of \\"hail mary\\" and also his 2pac strategy. no disrespect to pac but 2pac had that crazy strategy of going out looking for beef; he must've been beefing with like 30+ rappers prior to his death! 50 is doing the same thing! starting beefs with people who don't even say anything to him. and don't diss jada cuz jada still lives in the hood, not cuz he's broke but cuz he's keeping it real. he doesn't snitch like 50 did on murder inc. and 50 c'mon stop dissing murder inc, tah shot you, ja beat u with a crutch and garbage can, the murderers killed your bodyguard, and black child stabbed you. you even have a restraining order on irv gotti! lol what has 50 done in return? no shots fired. honestly i don't know how 50 got so popular. i will always wonder why. true he signed with dre and em but is that all? oh that's right he stole mase's voice, makes the replica shoe of s.carter, acts like 2pac talking about his approaching death, he took 2pac's no shirt style, he makes the most predictable rhymes, and he travels on commercial airplanes not jets (all factual ask my friend about the airplane thing)hey i'm just telling it like it is, congrats 50 cent but this is who you really are
B00005JMJG|5.0|In the modern world, we've come to rely on technology as a means of deadening our pain and mitigating the unpleasant realities of our lives.  We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness.  But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us?  Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all?  It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings?  Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real?  These are just some of the questions posed by \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, \\" a romance-cum-science-fiction tale that is yet another demanding, provocative brainchild of Charlie Kaufman, the man responsible for \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and \\"Adaptation.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Eternal Sunshine,\\" Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man.  However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences.  In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory.  When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her.  The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.<br /><br />The synopsis for this movie fails to do justice to the sheer brilliance of both the concept and the execution, as we are taken through a cascading cavalcade of reality and fantasy, memories and recollections, all highly revelatory of the relationship between these two people.  The movie is like a glorious kaleidoscope in which the writer and director, Michel Gondry, continually twist the picture in such a way that we never know what the next image or concept will be, yet with their hands so firmly placed on the instrument that we always know where we are at all times.  Even if we don't always understand every single scene or image at the moment we are seeing it, we know that it will all make sense once the full scenario has played itself put.  If \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" reminds us of any one movie, it is most likely Stanley Donen`s \\"Two For the Road,\\" that great 1967 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney that also used an ingenious structure of interlocking time periods and events to show us the growth and disintegration of a romantic relationship.  \\"Two For the Road\\" did it while operating solely on the level of conscious reality; now, Kaufman, by delving into the subconscious world of half-remembered incidents and ephemeral dreams, ratchets up the concept a notch or two higher.  Even though \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" keeps shifting the planes of its reality, the audience never loses its bearings for a single moment.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have never been better than they are here, creating characters who are compelling, likable and utterly believable as they make their way through this convoluted but wonderfully challenging maze of a screenplay.  It's amazing how believable and touching Carrey and Winslet manage to be in the midst of all this seeming disorder.  They root the film in the human reality all fantasies need to be compelling.<br /><br />Towards the end, as the film brings all its disparate elements together on a single plane of reality, the movie asks us to ponder yet another difficult and challenging question:  is it possible for two people in a failed relationship to drift apart for awhile, then reunite successfully if they go into the renewed relationship fully cognizant of those elements that drove them apart the first time around?  It is just one of the many intriguing ideas to consider in this brilliant, creative and thoroughly fascinating film.<br /><br />As with Kaufman's  previous cinematic mindbenders, \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" occasionally feels a bit too cute and a bit too clever for its own good.  However, this film suffers less from this malady and feels to be more of a piece than his earlier works.  With a Kaufman film - and with \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" in particular - we know we're getting something original, unique and intellectually demanding, which is far from the normal state of affairs when it comes to mainstream American moviemaking.  \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a film for the ages.need to be compelling.

B00005JNQQ|2.0|This is going to be a short review, but I don't want to spend that much time on a mediocre film. The voice-overs were bland, the animation was dull (with the exception of one \\"wow\\" sequence), the story has been done a thousand times over, and some of the characters were flat-out gratuitous (namely Halle Barry's). On top of all of this, the writing was cliched, broad, and immature; in no way would any of it appeal to kids above the age of eleven. As I see more of these animated films from companies other than Pixar, I'm seeing less and less intelligence. To me, great animation is thoughtfully and respectfully made for all ages. The best example of this would be last year's \\"The Incredibles\\" (yes, from Pixar, the only non-anime company to turn out great work in the genre these days). It contained both simpler messages for children and more complex messages for adults (specifically married couples). \\"Incredibles\\" was an animated film to which I could respond, \\"Deep stuff.\\" It was real and honest: a near-masterpiece. But besides the afore mentioned anime companies and Pixar, studios --like Disney-- continue to dumb down their work (and quality of animation) to give us crap like \\"Robots,\\" which in the end is the cinematic equivelant to setting a pile of money on fire. It's stuff you forget in twenty minutes' time.
B00000163G|5.0|Personally, being a huge rock fan, and not listening that much to rap, there's one artist that I dig, and that's 2Pac! In my opinion, the only really great rapper of all time! There's so much sh*t out there, atleast nowadays, 50 Cent & his friends for example, and there will always be. The only respectable rappers from this day are Kanye West, Twista, Eminem (used to be good) and perhaps Ludacris (he's funny)...But 2Pac beats them all. Yes, Pac had some clichs in his songs too, corcerning material (cars, money, hoes...)but, he had a lot to say in many songs too, he had awesome beats, melodies and a great voice! He also was a good actor and, outside rap, a poet! \\"All eyez on me\\", is a double album with 27 great songs, and no interludes included (which often suck and just fill the album), there's music only! Guest rappers too like Snoop Dogg, are here to express themselves. There's deeper songs, there's more love-like songs and there's pure party songs, and almost every of the 27 tracks are really neat, and sound different from the previous. The biggest hits from the album are \\"California Love\\" (with Dre), \\"All About U\\" \\"How Do You Want It\\" & \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\" (with Snoop), the title track \\"All Eyez On Me\\", is perhaps my favourite song of all, although hard to choose just one. Quality beats quantity, we all know that, and this album succeeds in that, more than well, with 27 songs, sounding all good and well-worked! Pac isn't here to fool anyone, he's made a monster of rap album, remaining a rapalbum must-have to this day! No one, I mean no one, can call themselves a true rap-fan if 2Pac isn't among your favourites!
B00005R1N3|5.0|Brrrrrr. The absolute scariest slasher/horror ever made. The death scenes are unique, and atmosphere is unmatched (even by Halloween), and the killer is crazy in the true sense of the word. And the ending. ooohh, the ending. It may dissappoint some, but I think no other ending would have worked for this film. I believe this came out four years before Halloween, six before Friday 13th (two excellent movies), and they owe quite a bit to this movie. Yes, it is underratted and overlooked. Good! Let those movie snobs miss out on a truly terrifying film. Go watch Scream or something. Go tell yourself that is scary, because you know it really isn't. This is scary. I was literally frozen in terror when the first person died, and how it kept showing the body in the attick. And the murderer's raves are nothing short of horrific. In conclusion, if you want a truly shocking and terrifying horror picture, I without hesitation reccomend this to you. If you are open minded enough and \\"cool\\" enough to be looking at old horror movies to give a shot, then you deserve to watch this film. You deserve a fun fright. Enjoy it, and, one more thing, don't watch this without a pillow and blanket handy, you will regret it if you do.
B000003TAR|4.0|Okay, Cobain's lifestyle obviously reflects the music of Nirvana, that's true, but it's so annoying to read a review talking about a 'heroinist who killed himself', and blaa blaa, what an assh*le Cobain was, come on that's very childish! That he did use heroin is nothing original in rock, but suicide isn't that common. But when I listen to Nirvana I don't have to automatically think about how Cobain ended his life ! I can just listen to it as a good rock band! I don't wonder from song to song if he's high during the recording or what, I definitely think about Kurt's life too, and have read about him, and know pretty much 'bout him, but damn, it's possible to listen to NIRVANA, not NIRVANA, THE BAND WHOSE SINGER SHOT HIMSELF! And don't you morons know that there's plenty of evidence showing that he had gotten killed, not killed himself!? Well...'Serve The Servants' is a pretty Beatles-like song with ironic lyrics about the Nirvanas success obviously, it's pretty enjoyable. \\"Serve The Servants\\", a very twisted and ugly song, very manic, very Kurt! but it's tolerable, although it's garbage, but atleast he's being himself, see, Kurt Cobain isn't here to please anyone, he's there to show his real emotions!! \\"Heart Shaped Box\\", one of their best songs, just so great! \\"Rape Me\\", well, what it says, probably about the people raping his values, and what \\"Smell Like Teen Spirit\\" did to them, because the guitar intro is almost identical to \\"SLTS\\". From the rest of the songs there's a couple of highlights like \\"All Apologies\\" & \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", both excellent! The rest are mediocre, but nothing that horrible. A good album, but doesn't beat \\"Nevermind\\"...
6301763041|1.0|This is the worst movie ever produced. This movie is a waste of time to make. Johnny Depp is a fair actor and this is not one of his best. The rest of the cast is a bunch of low rate actors and shouldn't be allowed to be on the small screen, let alone the big screen. I wouldn't waste my money to buy this movie to burn it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|IT IS REALLY GOOD. I WATCHED FOR AT LEAST 3 TIMES. SOMETIMES I WISH THE STORY WILL LONGER. THIS IS REAL STORY AND REAL GOOD DVD. I REALLY LIKE IT. I BET YOU WILL LIKE IT AFTER YOU WATCH THIS DVD.
B00000JRTX|5.0|One of the best romantic comedies ever, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" follows a close-knit group of unattached British thirtysomethings whose major diversion is attending other people's weddings (while hoping to find their own true love during the course of four weddings). <br /> <br />Romantic connections are made, lost, and rediscovered amongst the guests at the weddings plus a tragic funeral.  These entanglements are buoyed by a funny, observant screenplay which includes references to David Cassidy and the Partridge Family as well as an hilarious stretch in which a nervous novice minister adds a new twist to the nuptials by referring to the bride-to-be as an \\"AWFUL wedded wife\\" or by concluding the rituals \\"in the name of the father, son, and holy GOAT\\". Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean plays the bumbling minister to side-splitting perfection. <br /> <br />This is the movie that elevated Hugh Grant to major stardom and familiarized American audiences with a strikingly beautiful,  gifted young actress named Kristin Scott Thomas.  Miss Thomas, elegant, witty, and world weary steals most of the scenes she's in.  The entire cast is superb.  They negotiate the movie's comic and melancholy turns masterfully. <br /> <br />\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is a serious delight.  See for yourself! <br />
0316172324|3.0|I was first caught by the title and cover of this book.  It was fairly plain with \\"Blink\\" written boldly across the front.  I read the blurb on the inside cover about what it was about and thought I would take a chance at reading it.<br /><br />The book starts out great with a few stories about people making snap decisions without knowing they were doing it.  That drew my attention and I kept reading.  The theories that the author was giving seemed to make sense and were interesting to think about.<br /><br />However, towards the middle of the book the tone of the writing changed.  I am still not able to put my finger on how it changed but it almost seems that the author was hurried to get the book done and to the editor and so he became less thoughtful and more erratic in his theories and explanations.<br /><br />The worst part of the book is that it just ends abruptly.  There isn't really a review of what was talked about and how it all fits together.  The last theory is given and the book ends.<br /><br />If you have time on a plane to read the book, it might be worth it.  But I'm not sure I would sit down and read this book for fun knowing what I know now about it.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" is an excellent album and a welcome breath of fresh air from all that Emo, rap, and nu-metal crap that has been popular the last few years.<br /><br />If you took the Cure, Oasis, and A Flock of Seagulls, and mixed it in a blender, you'd end up with The Killers. The Killers have a modern Brit rock sound, akin to Oasis, but loaded with synthesizers.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" has undeniably catchy songs with good hooks. It's easy to get into with just one listen. Of the first eight songs it's hard to pick a favorite.  \\"Jenny was a Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Andy, your a Star\\" are probably the highlights. The first 3/4 of the album are really all potential radio singles. Singer/frontman Brandon Flowers has a strong semi-baritone voice and carries all the songs well. Guitarist Dave Keuning is a solid player and he keeps the album fresh with infectious hooks and solos.<br /><br />My only gripe with \\"Hot Fuss\\" is that the album begins to run out of steam about 3/4 through. Towards the end of the album, the songs start to sound monotonous. The last three songs, while good, aren't quite up-to-par with the first eight.<br /><br />Despite loosing a little momentum towards the end \\"Hot Fuss\\" is an excellent debut album. The Killers are a rising star and will probably only improve over time.
B00000JXZ7|2.0|You can do much better for the Mendelssohn and Bruch. You may have to get them separately, but Isaac Stern does them much better. I find Ms. Chung's playing to be uneven, choppy and full of seams. The phrasing is not smooth. Her vibrato is also very sloppy in places. Frankly, having listened to several recordings of these two pieces over many years I would have to keep these<br /><br />discs out of the running entirely. I would recommend Stern or<br /><br />Francescatti in the Bruch and Stern in the Mendelssohn. You get<br /><br />the tops Tchaikovsky performance as well if you get Stern (with score cuts in overly repetitive measures).
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Did somebody say this was supposed to be punk? It sounds more like Britney Spears trying to sing while playing guitar with her feet. Hey Avril, there are other ways to sell out. Have you tried posing nude or selling thigh cream? I'm sorry, this is just too easy. Avril Lavigne is to punk what nutter butters are to peanuts. A cheap, fake, nutritionless, valueless version of it.
B0007O38F8|4.0|From a producers perspective, I give the producers 4 and a Half mics collectively. 50 could have done better but his overall performance does not over-shadow the great tracks. Like \\"Piggy Bank\\", undoubtedly Hate it or Love it\\" is a classic. The diss is My overall impression is that this album, in all enerst, will grow to top \\"Get rich or die tryin'\\".
0780619951|5.0|THE CAST WAS SUPERB, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS SUPERIOR. THE PLOT A CLASSIC....WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK OF A FILM?
B000069AUI|4.0|This album is a great example of how well music can be in a simple purist form. It is made up of just mostly piano,drums and guitar, and the haunting voice of Chris Martin. The lyrics along with the music compliment each other beautifully. It is a perfect harmony.  I think this is a great album for people wanting to dive into the indie rock scene. As all things new should be done in baby steps, this a great place to start.   The way this album makes you feel when listening is phenomonal. Its haunting and magical sounds make you feel as if you are floating in space. It is an emotional journey. By far, \\"Clocks\\", \\"Amsterdam\\", \\"Politik\\", and \\"The Scientist\\" are some of the best songs on this album, and maybe by far in comparison to other artists songs. I reccomend this album to anyone who likes this type of music or is wanting to try something new.  I also highly recommend their first album \\"Parachutes.\\" I am looking forward to when \\"X and Y\\" is released this June. I am hoping to lives up to their past two albums. This is a great band worth checking out!
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|as stated on the back of the dvd case by Andy Jones. I was holding my breath and finding it hard to blink throughout the movie. What a lucky night, the night I was flipping through channels and happened to catch this movie kinda still in the beginning. I honestly thought I would never like any sci-fi/horror movies (not at all my type of movie) but this movie proved me very wrong. Not only I had my jaw dropped at how awesome this movie is, but now I am the proud owner of both Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse which are always a treat to watch. I sure hope that there will be Resident Evil III, IV, V, VI, VII and so on!
0316172324|4.0|still a really, really intriguing book. gladwell does not disappoint.
0767834739|5.0|This is so not the type of movie that I like, yet, when I watched by chance the first Resident Evil I was in complete awe of how thrilling it was. I have never played the video game, actually: I hate video games, period. But I am very thankful for the Resident Evil game for giving birth to the idea of the Resident Evil movies. (So I guess I should say I hate all video games that are not Resident Evil?)  <br />I was very afraid of watching this second part... afraid of being disappointed, because I loved the first one so much. But rest assure, and what a great relief: this second one is just as awesome!! I love the Resident Evil movies so much that I never grow tired of watching them - and this is a person that doesn't' like one bit watching the same movies more than once. When it comes to Resident Evil, no rules can apply. <br />ps- Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez both RAWK
1400034779|5.0|This is the first of a series set in Botswana (located immediately north of South Africa) telling the stories of a woman who sets up a detective agency with the money she has inherited from her father.  The charm comes from the stories of life in Botswana, about the culture there, and the differences between Botswana's traditional culture and Western values.   <br /> <br />The stories are loosely connected, but each chapter could without much rewriting stand alone as a short story.  Each is a little pearl, with an African Miss Marple using her cleverness to solve mysteries. <br /> <br />I've read a later book in the series and thought this one was quite a bit better, although I enjoyed the later one also.  I intend to read more in the series.
B00005JMYI|5.0|for all of those who gave this movie less than 4 stars, you guys really don't have any sense of humor! yea this movie is stupid but HELLO! that is the whole point! its SUPPOSED to be stupid! that's what makes it so great! if you don't like funny movies i wouldnt watch this because it would waste your time, but if you really like a good laugh, defenitly check this one out. it's hilarious! i love it!
B00008OLYN|4.0|This is a great album. I'm sure many metal heads bought this who are fans of the bands other material. Other reviewers have praised this album left and right so I will keep it simple.  Basically, if you enjoy calming or quiet music this is an album for you. You do not have to be a deathmetal fan. This is the bands most accessable album to date. Anyone can enjoy this.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Not only is this a great movie, but everyone I've shown this film to has liked it enough to buy it for themselves.  Very popular with the teen anime crowd, although kids like it too. <br /> <br />Although there are some rather disturbing things in this film, I think all anime viewers should see this film. <br /> <br />This is perfect for AMVs.
B0000634EV|5.0|Consisting of members from Crowbar, Eyehategod, Corrosion of Conformity and Pantera..Down can somewhat be termed as a Super-Group of the Southern Metal scene. They combine the sound of every band i just mentioned, and create a different sound all of their own, and it's truly amazing.  <br /> <br />This would be most enjoyable for fans of Crowbar, CoC, Eyehategod and Pantera of course, but also to fans of Acid Bath and even Sixty Watt Shaman. Phil Anselmo's vocals have always stood out to me, and i'm sure to so many others. He's a gifted singer/vocalist for the music he plays, and this band, Down, i believe to be his best 'side-project' band without a doubt. <br /> <br />The songs on this album, much like on their previous album \\"NOLA\\", are flawless. The most standout songs would be \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession\\", \\"There's Something On My Side\\", \\"The Man That Follows Hell\\", \\"Stained Glass Cross\\", \\"Ghosts Along The Mississippi\\", \\"Beautifully Depressed\\", \\"New Orleans Is A Dying Whore\\", \\"The Seed\\", \\"Lies..\\", \\"Dog Tired\\" and \\"Landing On The Mountains Of Meggido\\". ..And if you notice, that's nearly every single song on this album. That's how flawless this album really is. You're guarenteed to enjoy this if you are a fan of Phil Anselmo and Pantera, or any of the other bands i have noted in this review. <br /> <br />In saying all of that, some parts of this album, like \\"NOLA\\" as well, is quite slow and not 'heavy'. Down are a very melodic-sounding band, and on such songs as \\"Lies..\\" or \\"Landing On The Mountains Of Meggido\\", their melodic talent really shine through. I honestly can't stress enough how great this band, and this CD really is..which in my opinion is their best (I know not everyone would agree..\\"NOLA\\" to me, is also a 5 Star album though..) <br /> <br />Really, if you are already a fan of Phil Anselmo, or Kirk and Crowbar, or Eyehategod, or Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity..You can't go wrong with this album. There is so much talent in this band, and it's quite obvious seeing the line-up. Do not hesitate on buying this great album.  <br /> <br />Totally 5/5.
B000066AXC|5.0|I loved this movie ~ as an advocate for the individuals diagnosed with mental illness this movie points out several forgotten parts to a \\"mental patient\\".  Most individuals have lives before - during - and after- their illnesses are stabilized. This poignant and true movie shows that individuals with a mental illness or diagnosis are capable of functioning in society and being production when given support and understanding. A must see film for all.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is undeniably a great film because it engages you intellectually and emotionally.  If you want to see the latest Hollywood Blockbuster don't see this film.  If you want Special Effects Extravaganzas don't see this film. Citizen Kane was made in the 1940's and its style in both the screenplay and direction have continued up to the present.  The Simpsons steals heavily on Citizen Kane.  Camera angles and even scenes are lifted out and are used for much the same effect as they were used in the original film.  So the influence this film has on those in the industry today is staggering.   <br />   On \\"Rosebud\\": A journalist interviews all who knew Kane in order to find out what Kane's dying words meant.  At the end of the film we know who or what \\"Rosebud\\" is but is it significant or not?
B00030590I|5.0|Fist of all I would like to say wow! When I watched the film for the first time it was like looking at a beautiful painting for the first time. It felt like pure art and that is exacly what it is. Art. The film is about a warrior who has defeated the three most threatening assassins to his king. In return for his efforts he is awarded money, land but most of all the privlige to sit within ten paces of the king. As the warrior tells the king of how he defeated these three brilliant assassins we go back in time and get a quite stunning visual interpretation of the warriors story. However the king is not convinced of this story as he knows of these assassins and almost lost his life to one of them. What we get now is the story from how the king thinks these events unfolded and this includes the king thinking this warrior has defeated these assassins because he knew he could get close enough to the king to kill him himself. Is the king right? I don't want to give anything away because this was an absolutley incredible experience for me and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The movie has many layers and unfolds very exquisitey bringing out almost every emotion we have as human beings. Not many films can do that. <br /> <br />Now time for me to explain the tittle of my review. What is an orb? We know they are in the shape of a ball, small and fast moving. They are also sighted in areas that are \\"haunted\\" or areas that have a lot of history or/and both. Orbs are not visible to the naked eye and they are either caught on camera and rarley captured on home video. Nobody really knows what an orb is. Some say electricty causes them and some say they are a form of ghost. Either way I have seen a lot of movies and never in my whole life have I seen an orb captured in a motion picture. Untill now.  <br /> <br />The first couple of times I did not notice it. But earlier today I watched \\"Hero\\" and noticed something in the corner of the screen. I thought nothing of it at first but I wanted to be sure so I skipped back a scene and watched very carefully. If you want to see this orb skip through the movie untill the time passed says exacley 1 hour 26 minutes and 39 seconds. This object which I believe is a orb is visable for exacley one second and it starts off at the top right hand corner of the screen and ends up in the bottom middle of the screen. When the dvd is on pause I suggest you zoom in as much as you can and press the pause button another nineteen times and you can see the path it takes from start to finish. Now that's something you won't find in the special features.
B00001QEE9|5.0|When I was five I cried as my parents took me out of the cinema.  I wanted to go back and see it all again!  I had to wait thirty years and I was right!  Pinocchio is probably my favourite Walt Disney film.  No money was spared as scene after scene of this 1938 film blew me away with all the detail on screen.  The scene with the clocks in Gepetto's house has some of the best animation ever drawn.  When you look at later films like The Rescuers, The Great Mouse Detective, Sword In The Stone... you can see that masterpieces like this could not be sustained (and nor could the budgets).  Only with The Little Mermaid in 1988 did the Disney renaissance begin.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|This movie was released in 1983 soon after the release of the Roger Moore Bond film \\"Octopussy.\\"  While fans may have welcomed Sean Connery's return to the screen as James Bond, this \\"unofficial\\" Bond film falls somewhat flat, and ties it with some of the weakest Bond films in the series.  This movie is a re-working of the 1965 film \\"Thunderball.\\"  This film proves the adage of leaving well enough alone.  While there are plot aspects of this movie that are improvements over the original, this movie does not have the depth or quality of the original.<br /><br />We remember the essence of the plot.  Bad guys steal two nuclear weapons from the good guys, and black mail the good guys for their return.  Jack Petachi is the greedy drug-addicted U.S. Air Force officer who aids S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in stealing the nuclear warheads.  Jack's sister Domino is played this time by Kim Basinger.  Largo masterminds the theft and is effectively played by Klaus Maria Brandauer.  Brandauer's Largo is psychopathic compared to Adolpho Celi's business-like Largo.  I found Brandauer's Largo scarier because psychopaths are scary people, but I have always wondered how much any organization, even criminal organizations, could trust a psychopath.<br /><br />In the tradition of other James Bond movies we have Fatima Blush, played by Barbara Carrera.  Fatima is a good match for Largo in this version.  She enjoys killing, but around Largo she seems almost like a dog on a leash.  Felix Leiter is African-American in this version, well played by veteran actor Bernie Casey.  M (Edward Fox), Q (Alec McCowen) and Miss Moneypenny (Pamela Salem) are also present.<br /><br />This movie feels as though it is from some other dimension.  When Bond visits Q it is as though there have been no double oh agents for a long time.  There is an air of budget cuts.  Q's lab, quite excellent in the \\"official\\" films, appears to be a machine shop in the basement of some building, looking cheesy.  When Q asks Bond whether there will be gratuitous sex and violence, I was not sure whether I was appalled or annoyed.  I got the impression that early portions of this film were snubs or poking fun at the \\"official\\" movies.  M's character in this movie was absolutely awful.  In the other Bond films M is always quite dour, focused on the interests of Great Britain.  Edward Fox's M seems somewhat pompous and political; this may be another snub that I did not understand.<br /><br />There were portions of the movie that I liked.  Largo's boat in this movie was extremely sophisticated, though it did not split apart like Largo's boat in \\"Thunderball\\" did.  Bond's motorcycle was also cool, though the cars in the other Bond films were better.  I also thought where Bond and Domino were taken in North Africa was well done, and the auction for Domino was excellent, as was Bond's rescue of Domino.<br /><br />There were a few other unusual items in this movie.  The cave set near the end looked more like Indiana Jones than James Bond.  There are also a few places where the movie drags just a little, very unusual for a Bond film as they are usually plotted for continuous action.  There were also strange things that the movie failed to explain.  For example, where did a U.S. helicopter come from to drop Bond into the well?  It should have been an aircraft carrier, but in this Bond film the producer did not bother to explain the details.  Another question, since when do U.S. submarines carry cannons?  The gun firing from the submarine did not look very realistic, since it was more than likely drawn in after the fact.  The whole discussion of budget with respect to Q's branch was likely to help explain why the movie had so few special effects, but it makes the movie come across as cheap.<br /><br />Being a completist, I had to have this Bond movie.  However, it is one of the lesser movies in the series.  The movie has moments that keep it solidly in the three star range, but there is a lot of two star materialhere.  Even the DVD release was cheap, with only a trailer on my edition, though the version I have is in widescreen.<br /><br />This movie probably should never have been made.  Those who are collecting the Bond films will want it, as will those who want all the Sean Connery films.  However, there are better Connery Bond films, and there are much better Connery movies.  I admit that I have watched this movie several times, but it always fails to impress me.tar material here.

068987474X|5.0|when did people start forgetting that?   <br /> <br />I'm a married woman and even I enjoyed this book. Eveything I expected from my husband before marriage, this book reinforced. <br /> <br />I wanted to read it because my sister in law is going thru some issues with her live in boyfriend.  Basically, everything I have been telling her about her boyfriend... the author agreed  with me in the book.  And since the author is a MAN, it helped her see the light. <br /> <br />What people are missing about the book in the previous bad reviews I read, (granted I didnt read all 400+ reviews) is that, the book is NOT saying, all men are bad.  There has been mention of lumping all men in one catorgory.   <br /> <br />The title says it all \\"He's just not that into YOU!\\" Meaning, he's not into YOU. Once he FINDS that right person, he will treat her with love and respect and do the things people in love do.   <br /> <br />I have seen in past reviews people saying \\"What about communication, and working it out?\\" Why do you want to waste your time with a man, you have maybe only known a few months? You shouldnt have to work anything out in the beginning.  You shouldn't have to work anything out period. Are there rough times? Sure. Can men change... yes.  But, what the author is saying is, if you get warning signs, early on. Leave. And if the guy wants to change, he'll persue you and change.  Why pine for someone who can't take TWO minutes out of his day to call you? <br /> <br />Funny thing is, I read some of it to my guy friend over the phone. He's single, and has a few girls he calls for um...\\"together time\\" and thats it.  His comment was \\"This guy is busting our game. If this book gets out, I'll never get anymore girls to just bring home\\"  It struck fear in a single guys heart. <br /> <br />I think the book is dead on.  Its simplistic writing makes the book hit home even more.  Because, its the simple way and the simple answers that are the right ones.  People forget love is easy.  It was never meant to be hard, and worked at. If two people love each other, it will be wonderful.
0393317552|3.0|I would be surprised if any other readers have read the 1988 book by University of Texas Professor: Richard Newbold Adams; The Eighth Day : Social Evolution as the Self-Organization of Energy. <br /> <br />Diamond does a fine job of ripping off and popularizing a wonderful idea. The principal idea is that grain based societies as oppossed to vege-culture societies had a great advantage in warfare. (How many potatoes can you carry in your sack?) <br /> <br />A fun read but let's have some kudos.
B00068NVI4|5.0|It figures.  With all the recent DVD's released by Yes, all of which are somewhat unexciting and released promptly, they have to keep pushing back the release date of one of the most hotly anticipated ones. <br /> <br />This is hands down the best Yes concert I've ever seen.   Mainly, the fact that the order and song choice were not the most predictable.  <br /> <br />They've been pulling some serious punches with their setlists over the last 15 years, either resorting to predictable \\"greatest hits\\" sets or completely wild sets like the one displayed at the Masterworks show.   This one was a perfect mixture of the shorts and the longs, and features one that I NEVER thought would see the light of day onstage, which is the stunning, recent (1996) epic  piece \\"Mind Drive\\" which I love just as much as the classic material.  Here, it is bookended by South Side Of The Sky and Turn Of The Century, and just when you thought they had abandoned Mind Drive altogether they come around and blast you with its stunning finale.   <br /> <br />It was also incredible that they had managed to pull out a couple from the first two albums which they haven't done in quite some time.   The one-two-three punch of the openers was the best I had ever seen them open with.   <br /> <br />The band were in fine form and although the Roger Dean stage was most definately on a budget it was the most visually pleasing Yes stage I got to witness in person. <br /> <br />The vibe at the show was amazing (never seen a Philly Yes show and it wont be my last now that I'm a resident) and I can't wait to see the DVD.  I know it will be good. <br /> <br />Will they f*uckin' put it out already!??!?!?!?!!? <br />
6305144176|4.0|Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty.
B000063DFQ|5.0|When I first bought this album, I thought it was alright, and it became just another CD in my collection. After a while I decided to listen to it again and now I am so glad I did. I can't believe how I missed out on songs like \\"Revelations\\" and \\"Still Life\\". Now that I have listened to this CD more than once, I've realized that it is a really good album, and definitly worth buying.
B00003CXDB|4.0|This is Oliver Stone's disection of inside trading on Wall Street and the road to big bucks. Charlie Sheen plays the young broker who sells out his father by revealing some inside information to wheeler dealer Michael Douglas. It's an old-fashioned morality play, though, with Charlie trying to mend his ways. It's a hard-hitting, very well-acted drama - and effective because Stone incorporates all the old ideals of repentence and \\"crime does not pay.\\" It's a two-actor movie, however, which limits what it could have been.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Play is one of my absolute favorite albums of all time. It is absolutely incredible how songs like Southside, Natural Blues, Find My Baby, and even something as seemingly simple as Rushing develop. The songs always felt like they were going somewhere... with PERHAPS the minor exception of the album's eighteenth track, \\"My Weakness.\\" The long synths or violins (or whatever they were) in the background always drew out the music to great melodic levels. Here, on \\"18,\\" they seem to, well, flounder around. They don't tend to build with the songs as well. They seem too indifferent, too neutral even. They seem to just be there for a relaxing feeling, which would be fine except that the repetition of such sound is too much. \\"In This World\\" makes a decent use of soulful vocals but I had the feeling Moby could've done something more for it. \\"In My Heart,\\" though, brings back good memories of Play. It develops fairly well right up to that beautiful ending. Good to sing along to as well.  <br /> <br />Where he really separates from Play and possibly even any music he's made before is \\"Great Escape.\\" Strings and smooth, smooth vocals from Azure Ray. It's an extremely peaceful song. Maybe that's what I don't like most about \\"18\\"---it's basically completely peaceful, except for maybe \\"Extreme Ways.\\" \\"Signs of Love\\" has nothing on \\"Porcelain\\" but it's a very sincere-sounding song from Moby. \\"Love & Strings\\" from the album 18: B-Sides, though, has basically the same music without vocals and with a faster tempo. It sounds slightly better. Now there's a problem here: Starting with \\"One of These Mornings\\" the album's getting a little repetitive. That line \\"And I'll be gone\\" repeats a bit more frequently than is necessary. Thankfully, this song is only 3:12.  <br /> <br />Then it just gets strange with \\"Another Woman.\\" It's somewhat hypnotic but \\"You've got another woman somewhere around...\\" repeating over and over isn't too soothing.  <br />\\"Fireworks\\" is a nice break in the album justlike \\"Down Slow\\" and \\"7\\" and \\"Rushing\\" were in Play. It's a good thing Moby chose to put \\"Extreme Ways\\" after this track because otherwise \\"Fireworks\\" would've sounded like just another slow track. <br /> <br />And now it's time to type about \\"Extreme Ways.\\" It starts off a little slowly, actually. The main problem with this track is that Moby's too reluctant to venture outside of the soft sound of this album. The chorus is a bit embarrassing lyrically. Hell, it's mostly embarrassing lyrically. The guitar is nice but is overpowered dynamically by the other instruments and I'm not quite sure why. I hope it's not like that at concerts. It seems to be the Southside of this album, but it really can't compare to Southside. <br /> <br />\\"One thing's for sure... well we got soul.\\" Or is it \\"Moby got soul\\"? Whatever it is, it's a pleasant sort of hip-hop dance distraction from the rest of the album and it's well-needed. MC Lyte raps and does a good job, and you can't go wrong with the voice of Angie Stone. I wish MC Lyte said more, though. She only has two verses in the song, and then the song just seems repetitive. Not as good as \\"Bodyrock\\" from Play because it lacks something in terms of instrumentals. I'm making a lot of comparisons to Play not only because there ARE a lot of musical similarities, but mainly because the albums have the same amount of tracks. And whereas it's clear in Play that the album is half-upbeat and half-downbeat, 18 is pretty much all downbeat. <br /> <br />\\"Sunday\\" develops nicely, with a good piano line. The part later in the song when the vocals change is especially notable. Then the album still gets slower, with the twelth track, \\"18\\" which won a Grammy for best instrumental track, which was kind of random. \\"18\\" is a very simple track, and it lacks the sort of generic drum part that Moby uses for songs like \\"Sunday,\\" \\"In This World,\\" and \\"One Of These Mornings.\\" It actually might've deserved the award since the track is so incredibly relaxing.  <br /> <br />\\"Sleep Alone\\" has the same sort of strange mood that \\"Another Woman\\" has. I don't particularly enjoy either of those tracks. <br /> <br />Then two nice songs in a row--\\"At Least We Tried\\" (which, ironically, quite a few Moby fans said didn't really fit in with the album) and \\"Harbour\\" with Sinead O'Connor's vocals. The vocals of the former hit you just like those of \\"Natural Blues.\\" Genuine is the word for \\"At Least We Tried.\\" Just when you think it's about to go nowhere, a synth sound that I don't think appears before this track on the album comes up. The best thing about this track is that Moby doesn't get lazy and repeat the same sample for the chorus each time---The singer sounds especially different after that new synth kicks in. With songs like \\"Harbour\\" you wonder why Moby even goes back to using his own voice when he can do so much with other voices. <br /> <br />\\"Look Back In\\" isn't much of a track. A nice refreshing song is the higher-BPM \\"Rafters\\" and then the album ends with \\"I'm Not Worried At All.\\" It's a bit of a slow ending and also not too great of a track. <br /> <br />What's interesting is that \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" has very little to do with the rest of the album. It's a decent pop song. <br /> <br />Overall, it's good for relaxation but lacks action, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how much you like chilling out.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I hate drama and romance, but if I had to choose one right now, the first that would come to mind would be this. Second, would be Say Anyting. He's got that way about him, John Cusack, he has a unique romance side about him, at least the character he portrays in his movies do, but since he made them, the real him shouldnt be that too far off I dont think. Back then Beckinsale was a new comer, now shes done all that \\"accent\\" stuff, like the gypsy with wolverine and patsy cline with that fly boy. In Serendipity, these two actors make a nice flick. The eyes work, but they wouldnt make a couple in real life. Not like James Van Der Beek and Katie Holmes if it werent for that show they did, what was it? Another cheese ball corn job drama. I hate dramas but since Im here right now, I'll recommend them to you. If you dont agree, then go watch the Last Action Hero or something.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I still haven't decided which is the better movie: Monsters Inc. or The Incredibles. Both are fantastic movies. Monsters Inc. represents Pixar's most original story so far, and what we are treated with is a hilarious look at what it's like on the other side of the closet. Monstropolis is on the other side, where the two main characters Sully and Mike live. They work for Monsters Inc., where the scariest monsters are matched to their ideal kids and they scare them. This provides the energy for all of Monstropolis. Sully(voiced by John Goodman) is the top scarer at the company and Mike is his assistant. Randall, another monster, is Sully's biggest competition and will do anything to beat Sully. So one day when Randall tries to cheat his way to the top, something goes wrong--a child gets through the door into Monstropolis! Humans must never touch Monsters because they are thought to carry germs (23-19, 23-19!). Sully and Mike are then plunged into a hilarious and touching adventure.  <br /> <br />As with the other Pixar features, the extras are a huge part of the dvd release. And there is a ton of material here. From deleted animation to gag reels, from a tour of Pixar studios to behind the scenes featurettes on the process of bringing the film to life, this dvd entertains long after the movie is over. Also included the made for dvd short, Mike's New Car which is hilarious in it's own right. Expect the best audio and video quality as with all Pixar movies. There is so much more in the way of extras that I haven't mentioned so be sure to check it all out, it's very interesting. This is now my favorite Pixar movie and I suggest you see it if you enjoy quality animation.
B00005JKES|5.0|Mr Lynch, is one of my favorite directors. I didnt know at first when I saw this series, but it all made sense later. No wonder it was so awesome. This is by far, in my opinion, the best tv series to hit the tubes. Like one reviewer said, it blends art with tv. Magic with reality. It doesnt mean that reality meets magic, its raw, you say that it cant be real but you get sucked into the dialogue and eccentricity of it all, you come out somewhat of a person who believes that there is \\"something\\" out there. Never analyze a film if its the first time watching, especially this series, just go along with the ride, and I promise you wont be dissatisfied. I believe if this series were brand new, and broadcasted its pilot this coming fall, it would still be the hit it was, if not, even more. Just look at the cult following. Need I say more? X-files was good, but that screamed ALIENS you know? Twin Peaks had/ has strength in its subtleties.
B00000JTB2|3.0|Albert King is my all time favorite male bluesman/guitarist.  I was lucky enough to be exposed to his music as a teenage kid around 1967 and have been listening ever since.  Also, I'll admit my bias -- while I enjoy Stevie Ray Vaughan, I could never quite elevate him to the \\"Guitar God\\" status he seems to have with most people.  So, I am beginning to feel a bit like the kid who noticed the emperor wore no clothes:  the Aussie and the earlier reviewer are correct --  Albert King's guitar is woefully out-of-tune on this album.  For all I know, he was sitting in a radio station recording booth and could not hear how things sounded.  Whatever.  This fatal flaw spoiled an album I otherwise would have liked.      Absent that overwhelming glitch, I would have given this recording at least four stars.  It is still probably worth having as an interesting curiosity piece if you are a big fan of either performer -- but this is far from the best work by King or Vaughan.  Have to call it like I hear it. My suggestion would be to forget this album and just buy some Albert King and some Stevie Ray Vaughan (apart from each other) if you want to enjoy their music.

B0006IIKS0|3.0|This documentary of the latest chapter of the former heavy metal kings existance is informative, you'll learn some things you didnt know before , like personal info from certain people you only imagined (when Dave Mustaine shares shares his thoughts and speaks his mind )<br /><br />Its a funny movie at parts , like when there are arguments between band members ( there isnt that many real bad arguments, only one that is not violent or frightening, ...just a heated irratable situation that boils some band members over )<br /><br />Parts involving Jason Usted are cool , becouse you get to hear what he thinks and feels.<br /><br />You get to see some of the band members kids, thats cool, if you never really gave thought to the fact that they are married and have kids (James and Lars ...while Kirk is just married as of yet) you get to see their wives and children sometimes.<br /><br />The part when Rob Trojillo , the new member of metallica, gets offered 1 million pasos (...dollars , i mean , or leera, or whatever)to officially join the band, is really cool. Its nice cuz one can feel the joy of getting such an opprotunity to join Metallica. You might end up feeling very happy for him.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie doesnt suck , but its dissapointing becouse its not raw....it has a honesty that most popular famous things lack, but its not \\"fist-fight\\" honesty, its not as deep as it is touted to be. It is rather light, and you dont sense the type of uncomfortable ackwardness you would feel in a confrontation that might result in something physical. Thats not in the movie.<br /><br />Its honest in ways....but its still soft.<br /><br />Personally...concerning the music being developed through out the film ( St.Anger) .... i know it is best to have your own self saved than makeing masterfull music and end up destroying yourself in the process with drugs and sex. but even though Metallica is on the Lesser Of The Worst Evil paths, so to speak, it doesnt give them the same powerfull ingenious inspiration.<br /><br /> You see that type of genious trying to surface when Kirk Hammet finally loses his cool over the fact that there wont be any solos in the music. When he trys to plea his case that the band might be trying things too trendy, if that where the case , and that though the idea of no solos was in part to not be stuck to traditions of trying things new...he still didnt wanna follow what other bands did and what as trendy....<br /><br />However Kirk is the least egotistical of the three and his desires get put aside in a way to just do the music for the music. Or whatever.... its suppost to be all done without anyones ego envolved.<br /><br />All this honesty is good , and not being egotistic is good, but originally Metallica was honest....yes, they were honest about being selfesh; and even though with big egos, they still created great music, becouse it was for real, it was raw, it wasnt over calculated , they didnt discuss it through therapy sessions, they didnt have to sit and tell eachohter how they \\"felt\\" all the time. They just acted....and even though it was destructive, thats what spawned metallica in the first place. That negative horriable expression.<br /><br /> Now Metallica is supposivly \\"REBORN\\" ... so metallica died, and now came back from the dead and has a goal to perhaps create great music using positive energy and spirit.<br /><br />Can it be done. Yes it can. But will it be done. I dont know. Before i saw this film i would be more enclined to say yes, they will; but after i saw this, i start to have more doubts now.<br /><br />But overall, the movie is ok, its a must have if you really wanna learn more about metallica and see how they look and behave nowadays. stuff like that. or if you can afford it and it doesnt matter.<br /><br />well, thats what i think , latert doesnt give them the same powerfull ingenious inspiration.  <br /> <br /> You see that type of genious trying to surface when Kirk Hammet finally loses his cool over the fact that there wont be any solos in the music. When he trys to plea his case that the band might be trying things too trendy, if that where the case , and that though the idea of no solos was in part to not be stuck to traditions of trying things new...he still didnt wanna follow what other bands did and what as trendy....  <br /> <br />However Kirk is the least egotistical of the three and his desires get put aside in a way to just do the music for the music. Or whatever.... its suppost to be all done without anyones ego envolved.  <br /> <br /> <br />All this honesty is good , and not being egotistic is good, but originally Metallica was honest....yes, they were honest about being selfesh; and even though with big egos, they still created great music, becouse it was for real, it was raw, it wasnt over calculated , they didnt discuss it through therapy sessions, they didnt have to sit and tell eachohter how they \\"felt\\" all the time. They just acted....and even though it was destructive, thats what spawned metallica in the first place. That negative horriable expression. <br /> <br /> Now Metallica is supposivly \\"REBORN\\" ... so metallica died, and now came back from the dead and has a goal to perhaps create great music using positive energy and spirit.  <br /> <br />Can it be done. Yes it can. But will it be done. I dont know. Before i saw this film i would be more enclined to say yes, they will; but after i saw this, i start to have more doubts now.  <br /> <br /> <br />But overall, the movie is ok, its a must have if you really wanna learn more about metallica and see how they look and behave nowadays. stuff like that. or if you can afford it and it doesnt matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />well, thats what i think , later <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|All I can envision with this man is a beautiful combination of Otis Redding's gravelly-voice, Van Morrison's delivery, and a little bit of Ben Harper to make him accessible to today's music buying public. This is an exceptional album, albeit pretty serious, it's just a very solid disc altogether.
0671775308|2.0|This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article. Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on... <br />But I am glad I read this book. <br />There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth? <br />I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book. Instead, it looks like the \\"pursuit of wealth\\" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Slow paced and low-key, about the only thing I liked about TROY were the impressive computer generated battle scenes.  Brad Pitt plays Achilles and Eric Bana his arch foe Hector.  Instead of projecting larger-than-life heroes out at us, they're instead mopey, brooding, and pensive.  This approach may be appropriate for the slacker generation they represent, but it doesn't do much to stir the viewer's adrenline.  Someone forgot to swash the buckle on this one.<br /><br />  Just alright and quickly forgotten.  Glad it was a rental and not a purchase.

0743454529|2.0|The novel had an intriguing premise- one sister being created solely to keep another sister alive.  It was also written in a clever style- each chapter through a different character's perspective.  However- both the completely predictable romance and the completely unrealistic/ridiculous ending had me frustrated that I spent time reading this novel.  I had high hopes for the interesting subject, and was very disappointed!
B000066C87|4.0|This story from the onset seems to become an old-fashioned English murder mystery. The guests arrive at an English country house for some hunting. The man of the house is the benefactor of most of the family and they rely on his money for survival. Allowance is what they live on. Some want to invest, but it's always he who has the last word. This of course leads to some friction. <br /> <br />It's also about two different groups living in one house: the nobles and the below-stairs servants, but they have ties in more that just the servants way. <br /> <br />The most interesting characters are two Americans. The vegetarian (and gay?) movie producer played by Bob Balaban and his help/actor played by Ryan Phillippe, who starts out as his servant by playing a scottish guy. <br /> <br />The patriarch gets killed without us really knowing who did it. Then Stephen Fry enters the movie and we suspect he will solve the mystery, but he doesn't really...  <br /> <br />It's a movie that is more interesting then at first seems, there are some subtle differences with other movies. The acting is superb, somehow playing a servant or a stiff upper lip English noble are roles that everyone revels in. <br /> <br />I was intrigued but left with a strange feeling of not exactly knowing what I just saw or what had happened. Think I'm going to have to see it again...
0060594888|5.0|Quite frankly, I bought The Success Principles because of the more than $1000 bonuses (as a promo) which I hoped to receive. I thought that this was just an ordinary self-help book with a great author behind it.<br /><br />But when I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down. I found the mini biographies of successful men featured in the book simply amazing and the success principles, quite sound.<br /><br />The Success Principles is not a unique book. In a way, its principles resemble other self-help books. But for the most part, the book has been an inspiration.<br /><br />It's refreshing to know for instance that his very successful Chicken Soup for the Soul was rejected more than a hundred times before being accepted by a relatively small publisher.<br /><br />In addition to being an eye-opener, this book is a real guide for those who want to succeed and no doubt an inspiration for those who  are in the midst of business and personal difficulties.<br /><br />I strongly recommend Jack's latest project to everyone. In fact, I'd like my children to master this book when the right time comes.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|before i saw this movie i heard both good and bad reviews from friends. this seems to be a movie you love or hate, there does not seem to be much middle ground. i understand why some might not like this movie. yes, it is slow...in a way. there is no action. no big excitement. it seems almost a bit mundane. but, these people are sitting in a hotel day in and day out. there stay in tokyo is relatively free of action, excitement and is kind of mundane. this allows you to better identify with the characters.  <br /> <br />which brings me to one of the things i loved about this movie...the character development is fantastic. i seldom watch movies becasue i find many to be one-dimensional, transparent, and shallow. these charaters do not talk too much. when they talk, they have something to say and it is usually gives teh viewer an insight to who they (the character) are.  <br /> <br />along that vein, there is not excessive dialogue in this movie. the dialogue is well placed and thoughtful. the music score and visual cinematography contribute to make a beautiful and flowing movie. <br /> <br />so, while yes, this movie is \\"slow\\", it is pleasantly slow...not at all painstaking for me to watch. in fact, after i saw it the first time, i wanted to immediately watch it again but did not due to the fact that it was 1am.  <br /> <br />as for the anti-japanese opinions expressed on the reviews, i saw none. japan is a very different culture from ours and, as another reviewer stated, for this film to work these characters really need to be strangers in a strange land. what could be mistaken for japan-bashing is really just empahsis on the differences in cultures and societies. nothing in the film should be taken as degrading or insulting to the japanese culture. in fact, the film portrays japan and tokyo beautifully and makes me want to visit the land and the people, something i never really cared to do before seeing this film. <br /> <br />i guess the best thing to do is watch the film and see what you think. i hope you like it.
0440180295|1.0|In this novel by Kurt Vonnegut, the main character's name is Billy Pilgram. He is a war veteran who survived the firebombing of Dresden. The novel is very choppy, and switches from different parts of Billy's life. I found it very difficult to follow, and not very enjoyable.  <br /> In the novel, they often speak of a planet called Tralfamadore, where he was displayed in a zoo with a former movie star by the name of Montana Wildhack. I thought that the very concept of a man who was kidnapped by aliens was truly unbelievable and a tad ludicrous. I did not find the idea of aliens kidnapping a human and putting them in a zoo very plausible. While some of the tralfamadorians concept of death and living in a moment would be comforting for a war veteran, I found it relatively odd. I do not believe that an alien can kidnap someone and house them in a zoo for years at a time, while it is only a microsecond on earth. I also do not believe that a person has seven parents; I feel that two are a sufficient amount, and all that one person really has. Though Kurt Vonnegut was extremely creative with this story, and I usually enjoy creativity, this story was a tad bit to far-fetched for me.  <br /> I also did not enjoy hearing about Billy's relationship with his wife, and daughter. I felt that there was an extreme lack of love between them, and that is not the type of family I want to read about. I would have much preferred them to hold a more important role in Billy's life.  <br /> The only part of this story I enjoyed reading was the part about Dresden. I found it rather interesting and compelling. It was an extremely sad story to read and it was the only part of the novel that evoked any sort of emotion from me. I also enjoyed hearing about the author's view of Dresden, and his experience there. Throughout the story, I felt myself wishing that the author would stop talking about Billy, and share more of his own story.  <br /> While this novel had potential to be enjoyable, and some may have even liked it, I did not. I found it deplorable to read and I would not suggest it to anyone, ever.
B0000E6XKF|5.0|There aren't many bonus features, and the audio isn't going to sound studio quality (which is good I think), but this DVD is everything you would want from a Chili Peppers concert.  There are nice menu graphics that give you an outdoor concert feel, the chapter cuts are timed well, the intro music is great, and the menu music uses \\"Venice Queen,\\" one of their best songs. <br /> <br />Some great things in this DVD are the matrix-like sweep cuts when Kiedis jumps; the clothing the band wears is individual and priceless (i'm thinking flea's skeleton suit), all easier on the eyes than strategically placed socks; and the transition from late afternoon light, to dusk, to darkness.  The crowd is enormous, and watching them bounce inflatables and sing adds to the experience.  The band is older, though they show no loss of energy, and play music mainly from their last two albums. <br /> <br />I've seen a couple of other concert dvds, and if you would like something like that to be on while you play cards, or if you just like watching concerts on tv, this is one of the best you can get.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Man. Do I love this album. I just got it yesterday, and I am speechless about the College Dropout. I loved it so much I signed up on Amazon to tell you guys how great it is. You won't find any \\"hardcore\\" rapping in this album. All the kanye West haters out there, pick up this album, or listen to a few of the tracks in it. Guarantee you, that you will love it. <br /> <br />Everything in this album is a masterpiece. Just like what I said, pick up the College Dropout today if you don't have it, cause you're missing out on one of the best albums of all time.
2070364232|5.0|The author who cowrote the Asterix series once again transcends cultural barriers with his innocent, warm, boyish humor.   <br /> <br />This book is an absolute delight.  While it seems to be marketed to mature kids, I think that the older the reader, the more it will be liked, particlarly for those nostalgic for a bygone era.  Anyone who speaks French at an intermediate level can get through it.  However, you'll appreciate it more if you've achieved some fluency and if you've spent some time in France. <br /> <br />I challenge anyone reading it to refrain from smiling, or even laughing out loud.  I can't wait to read the other books in the series. <br /> <br />
038572179X|4.0|What a beautifully written novel.  Truly a work of *literary* fiction.  It makes all the other pulpy stuff seem embarrassingly trite.  McKewan creates a wonderful meta-narrative at the end, that cleverly satiates the reader's desire for a happy ending while making the reality of the book all the more poignant and beautiful.  The writing is crisp, spase, intelligent, very British.   This was one of the best reading experiences I have had this year.  The first chapters are slow-going but it is definitely worth it.
B000000P17|4.0|The last studio album released by Guns n' Roses seemed to have everything missing when it came out, as Izzy Stradlin' had left the band, every track found on the album is a cover, and the music is punk rock. This being true, it was understandable that alot of Guns n' Roses fans would want to avoid this album, expecting it to be far different from the Illusion albums, GNR Lies, and Appetite For Destruction.<br /><br />Although, it is distinctly different in sound, it still offers some very heavy, energetic and exciting punk rock tunes that many GNR fans can appreciate. If you are a fan of punk rock, this album is a great buy because  it gives covers of some classic punk rock groups and artists and gives a poweful, more alternative look at punk rock music with generally heavier guitar riffs.<br /><br />The album kicks off into the delicate, beautiful power ballad, Since I don't have you which is the single off the album. This song has a great flow to it, with an impressive lyrical delivery which never leaves you bored with the song. To follow the first track, Guns n' Roses leaps into the heavier stuff, first with New Rose, and then with the heavy, evil lyrics and riffs of Down on the Farm. As the album moves on, we hear GNR stay fairly consistent with their punk rock selections, despite having a few tracks being weaker than others, in my mind most notably Black Leather.<br /><br />To conclude, I would highly recommend this album to any punk rock fan, since the crew made some excellent choices for the proper songs to cover, and for the most part, gave very strong musical deliveries of each of them. As for Guns n' Roses fans, I myself am a huge fan of their music and am fond of this album, so it certainly wouldn't be a bad idea to give it a try.

0446677450|4.0|First of all, you have to realize that this is not a business book, but more of a self-help or inspirational type of book.  Kiyosaki doesn't give the reader any business advise or investing tips here.  Basically, he's trying to help people readjust their thinking.  In this consumerist society, people often think that having things makes them rich.  Having a big car or a big house will prove to the world their wealth.  However, in doing this, they drive themselves into debt.  Kiyosaki's basic message is that to gain wealth, one must buy assets rather than liabilities.  This seems like a very simple idea, but many people have misconceptions about what an asset is and what a liability is.  For example, many people consider their homes as an asset, but in reality it is a liability.  By helping readers readjust their definintion of these terms, Kiyosaki helps them on the way out of debt. <br /> <br />This book is a fast and interesting read.  The writing style is very casual, but on the other hand, sometimes seems a little repetitive.  Readers who are thinking of getting out of debt or who are thinking about investing for the first time will find this book very interesting.  People who are already investors, however, will find this to be a little simplistic since it probably covers things they already know and perhaps paints an overly simplistic view of investing.  If you're such an investor, give this a pass.  If you're not, give it a try.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites. Yes I have heard people say that it has no plot, but I think that was the point, to make a movie with no plot. Anyways, this movie is awesome and if you haven't seen it, you should rent it or buy it.
B00009ATKS|4.0|I imagined that music from a band with the name \\"Mogwai\\" would be inventive, playful and strange. After listening to \\"Happy Songs for Happy People\\", I found that, while right about the \\"inventive\\" and \\"strange\\", I was wrong about the \\"playful\\" part. The songs on \\"Happy\\" are very pensive, melancholy, atmospheric and subdued. Downbeat, but not depressing, expansive but not pretentious. I dug it. I think I'll check out  \\"Come on Die Young\\" next.
0743454537|5.0|This book is about every parent's worst nightmare: a child with a terminal illness. Kate is diagnosed with a rare form of Leukemia at the age of 2. Her parents--Brian and Sara--\\"engineer\\" a so-called designer baby that will match Kate. The baby, whom they name Anna, has donated blood and bone marrow numerous times by the time she is 13. Her parents are now trying to convince her to donate a kidney, which she doesn't want to do. So she hires a lawyer, and takes them to court.<br /><br />I thought the author did a good job of portraying what it's like in a family with a chronically ill child. It was so easy to imagine myself in the parents shoes, and to think about how I would react in that situation. The book is unrealistic in a few parts; for example, Anna and her Dad move out of the family home and into the local fire station, where her Dad works as a fire fighter. I'm pretty sure that fire departments have rules regarding people (especially 13 year old girls) LIVING in the fire station. In one scene, Anna goes with her Dad and another fire fighter on an emergency call. She rides with in the ambulance, and then helps him move an elderly patient onto the stretcher (???!!!!). There's no way in heck anybody is going to be letting a teenager \\"helping\\" the EMT's do their job. There are several other little things throughout the book that just don't fit right. But if you can overlook that, it is a wonderful (and fast!) read.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Nifty special affects, a massive budget, big stars and bared flesh do not make a film worth watching if the characters do not interest me. And the characters in \\"Troy\\" are about as flat and two-dimensional as they come. Vain, horny Trojan Prince Paris (pretty Orlando Bloom) falls for sulky, kept-woman Helen (almost-as-pretty Diane Kruger), which pisses off her husband, Spartan ruler Menelaus, and gives his megalomaniacal brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox, always playing the a-hole) an excuse to invade Troy. Achilles (a buff Brad Pitt) agrees to help, not because he cares, but just because he has a hang-up about having his name in the history books, and Paris' brother Hector (studly Aussie Eric Bana) and father King Priam (a dazed and confused Peter O'Toole) both sacrifice their lives and happiness for the sake of Paris' bratty antics.<br /><br />\\"Troy\\" glorifies violence and aggressiveness, while dubiously suggesting that love and family are what's really important. With the exception of maybe Bana's Hector, the \\"great\\" and \\"epic\\" characters are all arrogant, whiny and selfish brats. All this I could forgive somehow, if \\"Troy\\" didn't commit the worst sin of all when it comes to big-budget, Hollywood films ... being boring.
0788821075|5.0|<br /> Richard Gere and Julia Roberts star in the 1990 instant classic Pretty Woman. Nominated for a Academy Award for Best Actress, Roberts shows off her winning smile and wonderful wit as Vivian, a down on her luck prostitute and Richard Gere plays multi-millionaire Edward Lewis, who is a hard nosed real estate tycoon that puts the screws to other people by ripping their businesses out from under their noses.  <br /> The story begins as Vivian leaves her apartment avoiding her landlord looking for rent money and Edward is finishing his talk with his lawyer about the upcoming meeting with the head of one of the businesses they are trying to take over.  Neither of them realized that the lives that they were escaping from would never be the same the next morning.  <br /> They meet as Edward stops at Vivian's street corner. He is having trouble driving his lawyer's sports car. As Vivian is pushed towards the car, Edward realizes that he is also lost and needs to find his hotel. Vivian starts this modern day tale of Cinderella by asking him if wants some company.  Edward brings her into his carriage and asks if she would like to drive. Seems that she likes sports cars and knows a little bit more about the car than what he does. He tells her that he never drives because he is chauffeured around in limousines. She tells him of her tales from home and the boys she learned about cars from. The movie progresses as Edward hires Vivian to be his companion for the week as he visits Los Angeles.  <br /> Edward sends her out to buy more conservative clothing more befitting a woman of her beauty and charm for the rest of the week that they would be together.  The rest of the movie details how they spent that week as Vivian is introduced into the world of big money. I can't explain the rest of the story without ruining the movie but I can tell you that its' genuine appeal as a classic is due to the acting performances of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Julia Roberts' performancefor 119 minutes as Vivian is something that most women can relate to in this modern day fairy tale.  I give pretty woman 5 stars for its story and its' ability to make my wife cry. <br />
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Out of all the C.D.s in my collection, I treasure Get Born the most. Having been greatly attracted to Jet's \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" which I often heard on the radio, I checked Get Born out of the library to see how it was. I found that I enjoyed plenty of other tracks on the C.D., especially songs \\"Rollover DJ\\" and \\"Get What You Need\\". I soon fell for their sort of Beatle-esque hard rock themes, and eventually began to like the ballad style songs on the disc (such as \\"Look What You've Done). It's easy to get excited as you listen to Get Born's energetic progressions and vocals, yet it's also soothing to listen to their more peaceful ballads. Jet is off to a great start with Get Born, and I highly recommend this C.D. for its superb style of rock and the energizing feel that it supplies. <br />I recommend: <br />Last Chance <br />Are You Gonna Be My Girl <br />Rollover DJ <br />Look What You've Done <br />Get What You Need <br />Get Me Outta Here <br />Take It Or Leave It <br />Lazy Gun <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I usually don't like R&B, I'm more of a hip hop fan, but John Legend has a hip hop flavor that makes him a quality artist.  I don't think there is a song on the album that I don't like.  Quality stuff.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This C.D. is definitely one of my top three favorites. I had originally checked it out from the library to listen to track 9 (Breaking The Habit), yet upon hearing some of the other tracks I was surprised to find that I liked a good many other tunes on Meteora also. Linkin Park shows great skills at sampling on this disc, and each song is significantly different than the others. Also, the lyrics have clearly been thought through, as they flow well and also convey some interesting notions. Hard guitar and drumming added to these components adds to the grandeur of Meteora by getting you into the music, and for all these reasons and more I give five stars to Linkin Park: Meteora. <br />I recommend: <br />Don't Stay <br />Somewhere I Belong <br />Lying From You <br />Faint <br />Figure.09 <br />Breaking The Habit <br />Numb <br />

B000059XUT|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best animated film, there is!  I saw this classic in the movie theater, with my 5 year old,  and we both loved it! Finding Nemo, and Shrek, were really  good, but don't compare to this one. I'de like to buy Toy  Story on dvd, but you have to buy, Toy Story 2 with it, and  it's $60.00, and not even in widescreen format! Oh well, I'll  have to watch it on the vhs tape I have for now.

B00005R24G|5.0|I first saw this movie when my grandmother rented the VHS for my brother and me.  I don't think we sat through the whole thing, much less appreciated what we would have seen.  Having bought the DVD recently, the black copy, I can see why I, as a 12 year old, had trouble sitting through the entire movie.  It's over 2 hours of suspense, intrigue, double crosses, witty and funny dialogue, and really challenges the viewer to pay attention and follow it very closely.  Now I watch it every few weeks, always finding something new, and always finding something else to analyze or laugh about.  Moreover, there are a lot of one liners that are as funny (and witty) now as they were then.  Everyone should own this movie, for if no other reason then to have proof that great filmmaking doesn't need a lot of violence and nudity to keep you glued to the screen.
0316168815|2.0|Perhaps the most overhyped and overrated novel I have read since the Da Vinci Code.  <br /> <br />Simply put, the book is boring. The characters, though developed, are unappealing and fail to register empathy. The somewhat likable characters are brushed aside, while Sebold focusses on prodigious teenagers or overly-weak middle-age parents. Needless to say, I felt nothing but apathy for nearly her entire cast of characters. <br /> <br />Often, Sebold digresses into rambling observational stories that are neither insightful nor relevant to the plot. What began as an enjoyable read quickly became a chore. Any hope of redemption in the final chapters goes by the wayside as Sebold cranks up the banality. <br /> <br />Having finally finished this book, I will not look back upon it fondly. Moreover, I will not look back upon it at all. Rather than lingering in my mind (as several of the quotes on the back of the cover claim it will do), I imagine it will disappear completely - much like Mr. Harvey's safe.
B0007QJ1MK|1.0|After several listening attempts I'm convinced that all the songs on this cd were leftovers from the last desert sessions.  Nick was, without a doubt, the creative force in this band and his lack of presence is noticed on every song.  Songs for the Deaf offered a glimpse of great things to come, but all good things come to an end. An exteremly boring and average desert sessions, then a slightly less boring and average Eagles of Death Metal, and now this.  I can only be thankful that PJ Harvey doesn't moan and wail on this cd.  Keep your finger near the fast forward button, or just stick with the old stuff.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|The whole gang's back.  Bridget, Mark, Daniel and the rest are in for another year of heartbreak and adventure.  This sequel could have been a disaster in the making. The Thailand angle could have broke the film.  The difference were the performances of Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  They give plausable performances and this film probably would have failed with someone else.  Though not as great as the original, it's still fun!
B00006DEF9|5.0|Hollywood musicals don't get any better than this one. This a  perfect movie when you need your spirits lifted.

B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Just to bring to your attention, Mark Lanegan DID contribute to the album, bringing lyrics to Lullaby, Burn The Witch and backup on a few others.  <br /> <br />Each QOTSA album has it's own identity. That is truly what makes this band so incredible. Other bands you can hear one album and describe their entire collection because it all seems to run together and sounds exactly the same. Each QOTSA album brings a new tone. \\"Self Titled\\" was more of a laid back stoner feel, \\"R\\" i describe as organized chaos, \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" was in your face rock, and now \\"LtP\\" brings a dark subtle sinister feel to it. Josh said himself this is \\"night-time music\\" and I couldnt agree more. Ive never been let down by QOTSA and definitely wasnt here either. I just feel bad that the world is too caught up in crud bands to notice the genius of Josh Homme. But the other disposable crap they play on radio will never be remembered, QOTSA will stand the test of time and in 20 years Im sure they will be regarded as one of the best rock bands of this era.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|If you've at all been a fan of this band, there really isn't any reason to shrug off picking up this album.  It's as good as anything QotSA have accomplished up to this point, which is to say that it is an interesting listen for the discriminating ear and knocks several out of the park by any standard you approach it with.  There aren't many bands in the mainstream consciousness today that anyone can honestly say that of.  The rock throne of today is not quite QotSA's yet, but this certainly brings them closer to that more than anything else.  Either way, they'd be a cult favorite for long to come. <br /> <br />Beyond that, agonizing over minutia or trying to figure out how the loss of Nick Oliveri fits into all of this is largely a waste of time.  It's pretty apparent at this point that Josh Homme is one of the better rock musicians we've seen in a few moons and that it doesn't matter who he has around him.  All he needs are a few capable players around him and this act is good to go. <br /> <br />The album itself?  Well, they've taken to telling you what you're going to get.  Songs for the Deaf were just that; songs so loud you'd have to be deaf not hear.  But those were not entirely the soul of what makes the band.  On this, you get more artful with allusions to dark fairy tales and the like.  But just as Dave Grohl too has the knack, Josh Homme is capable of writing a song that you'll want to listen to over and over again in his sleep.  He doesn't always give it to you, of course, but make no mistake that it is never not what it's supposed to be.  I know *I* don't doubt that anymore.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I don't normally do reviews that often and I wasn't goin to review Damien Rice's \\"O\\" until I ready the two posts below mine and got disgusted because neither of them could get the song titles right.  It's not \\"The Blower's Wife\\" or \\"The Blower's Sister.\\"  It's the freaking \\"Blower's Daughter.\\"  I felt I should say something before the song became \\"The Blower's Real Estate Agent's Half Sister's Dog Walker's Adopted Son.\\"  Sheeesh. <br /> <br />Great album, by the way.
6302293553|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. BUT- already having the tape and getting the DVD for Christmas was a disappointment. I suppose that I am one of the few people that do not own a widescreen TV and find looking at a movie through a slit very annoying. In this case, the ability to select favorite scenes on the DVD is compromised by losing about 30% of the picture. Why is there no full screen version available, not only on this, but on many other classic films?? Anyone have the answer to this?
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Lullabies to Paralyze is not going to be what all the kids are listening to on the radio. Rolling Stone does not think very highly of this album, for what that's worth. However, I can honestly say that this album is extraordinary in ways that are impossible to convey to mainstream rock. This is the soundtrack to a pagan sacrifice, thumping in circles, swirling around a fire, still chomping down on peyote, blurring the lines between the real and the surreal. Simply put, this is a masterful conveyance of rock at its most primitive and fearsome. Beginning the CD with the acoustic \\"Lullaby\\" and soon breaking in to a frantic set of falsetto and guitar crunching, this album begins with a jump in its step and a wolf on its tail. Soon after we arrive at the ceremony itself, a swirling mix of heavy drums, rhythmic guitars, and screeching lyrics. This is interrupted by \\"Little Sister\\", which feels a bit out of place on the album, but it still an excellent single, probably the only song worthy of almighty Clear Channel. The rest of this CD is simply too dark, too certain, too dangerous to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting public. Although it is surreal as Dali on acid and conveys a land as foreign as Stonehenge, this is the most powerful and unabashedly badass rock album of the year, and a must buy for those about to rock...
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Mutilating zombies has never been funnier than in Shaun of the Dead. Taking a page from the Evil Dead franchise, this film provides plenty of blood, guts, and gut-busting comedy. But what's really brilliant about it is that it doesn't limit itself to comedy and zombie-killing, but also makes subtle commentary about real-life zombies: us. <br /> <br />The main character, as the title tells us, is, of course, Shaun (Simon Pegg), a 29-year-old slacker who works in an electronics store with a bunch of teenagers and spends his nights at the Winchester Tavern, getting drunk with his buddy Ed (Nick Frost), who is also crashing at his place, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), whose patience with his general apathy is wearing thin. <br /> <br />One night, Shaun fails to make proper dinner plans, and Liz dumps him outright, so Shaun and Ed go to the Winchester yet again to drown their sorrows. The next morning, a severely hungover Shaun walks to a nearby convenience store in a trance, not even noticing the carnage around him that has been caused by the walking dead. When he gets back to his house, Shaun and Ed finally figure out that these pale-faced creatures are not, in fact, just drunk, but are actually deadly zombies, and so, after some failed attempts to dispel them by throwing bad records and other such household objects at them, Shaun takes up a cricket bat, and Ed a shovel, and the two of them start whacking zombies. Shaun comes up with a plan: (1) steal roommate Pete's car, (2) pick up Liz, (3) pick up Shaun's mom and kill his step-father who has been bitten by a zombie, (4) go to the Winchester, which is somehow secure, (5) ummm... wait until they go away? Okay, so it's not the best plan in the world, but nobody else seems to have any better ideas. <br /> <br />Shaun of the Dead successfully lampoons every bad zombie movie that was ever made, by taking the cliches from them and turning them on their heads. For example, when Shaun procures a shotgun and starts firing on the zombies, he can't hit any of them--of course he can't, he's never even touched a shotgun before! And the screenplay is smart: these characters react as people really would react; they don't immediately know all the answers and they don't come up with great plans for destroying them. They come up with bad plans and then have to figure out step by step what to do to keep from being bitten and becoming zombies themselves. <br /> <br />Writer-director Edgar Wright and his co-writer (and star of the film) Simon Pegg decide to take their time in the beginning of the film to establish the characters and their quirks, and this is an excellent strategy, because it sets up everything else that follows. When Simon's strategy is to set up camp at the Winchester, well of course it is, because we know that that's how he thinks. I laughed hysterically for nearly the entire length of the movie, especially so at the end when the fate of the zombies is revealed. It's the perfect ending to an excellent film.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is the story of a man who doesn't want to grow up, and writes the story of a boy who never does. The boy is Peter Pan, and the man is Sir J.M. Barrie, who wrote his famous play after falling under the spell of a widow and her four young boys. That Barrie was married at the time, that he all but ignored his wife, that he all but moved into the widow's home, that his interest in the boys raised little suspicion, would make this story play very differently today. Johnny Depp's performance makes Barrie not only believable, but acceptable. And he does it without evading the implications of his behavior: The movie doesn't inoculate Barrie as a \\"family friend,\\" but shows him truly and deeply in love with the widow and her boys, although in an asexual way; we wonder, indeed, if this man has ever had sex, or ever wants to. <br /> <br />The movie opens in 1903 in a London theater where Barrie, a Scottish playwright, has seen his latest play turn into a disaster. He needs something new, and quickly, because his impresario (Dustin Hoffman) has a lease on the house and needs to keep it filled. In Kensington Gardens, Barrie happens upon the Davies family: the mother, Sylvia (Kate Winslet), and her boys Peter, George, Jack and Michael. As he watches them at play, a kind of spiritual hunger begins to glow in his eyes. They represent an innocence and purity that strikes him so powerfully he's unable to think of anything else. <br /> <br />He becomes friendly with the family. Sylvia has recently become widowed and is not interested in a new romance, but then, curiously, nothing about Barrie's behavior suggests he's attracted to her in that way. He idealizes her, he obsesses about her boys, and when he talks about his own unhappy childhood we get a glimpse of his motivation; when his older brother died, his parents started calling him by the brother's name, and perhaps he felt he lived his brother's childhood and never had his own. <br /> <br />He plays games withthe boys. He wrestles with a big stuffed bear. He leads them in games involving pirates and cowboys and Indians. He dresses in funny costumes. The children like him and Sylvia is grateful for his attention, especially since she has developed an alarming cough and he helps take care of the boys. The only holdout is Peter, played by Freddie Highmore in a remarkable <br />performance; if Barrie never grew up, Peter was perhaps never a child. He is wise and solemn, feels the loss of his father more sharply than his brothers, and boldly tells Barrie: \\"You're not my father.\\" Nor does Barrie want to be; he wants to be his brother. Sylvia's condition worsens, and when the boys stage a play in the <br />family garden, it's cut short by her coughing. The boys are reassured that nothing serious is wrong, but Peter is sure they're lying to him about her illness: \\"I won't be made a fool!\\" <br /> <br />Two other women regard this situation with alarm. Barrie's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) rarely sees him at home and is understandably disturbed about his relationship with the Davies family, although she is not as angry as she might be; there is the implication that she has long since given up on expecting rational behavior from her husband. He lives in a dream world, and to some degree she understands that. Not as sympathetic is Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), Sylvia's mother, who as the widow of the famous George du Maurier moved in sophisticated circles and is not amused by a 43-year-old man who wants to become the best playmate of her grandchildren. <br /> <br />It is Barrie's innocence, or naivete, or perhaps even a kind of rapture, impervious to common sense, that steers him past all obstacles as he begins to form the idea of \\"Peter Pan\\" in his mind. The boys are his muses. He tries to explain his new play to his impresario, who has just closed one flop, doesn't want to open another, and is less than thrilled about a play involving fairies, pirates, and children who can fly.Depp in his scenes shows Barrie in the grip of a holy zeal, his mind operating on a private, almost trance-like level, as the play comes into focus for him. He knows, if nobody else does, that he is creating a myth that will powerfully involve children. His masterstroke is to invite 25 orphans to the play's opening night and scatter them through the audience, where their laugher and delight stirs the adults to see the magic in the play. <br /> <br />For Depp, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is the latest in an extraordinary series of performances. After his Oscar nomination for \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" (2003), here is another role that seems destined for nomination. And then think of his work in \\"Secret Window\\" (2004), the Stephen King story about the author caught in a nightmare, and his demented CIA agent in \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\" (2003), and wait until you see him in \\"The Libertine,\\" as the depraved and shameless Earl of Rochester. That the flamboyance of his pirate and the debauchery of the Earl could exist in the same actor as the soft-spoken, gentle, inward J.M. Barrie is remarkable. It is commonplace for actors to play widely differing roles, but Depp never makes it feel like a reach; all of these notes seem well within his range. <br /> <br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" is, finally, surprisingly moving. The screenplay by David Magee (based on Allan Knee's play) and the direction of Marc Forster (\\"Monster's Ball\\") manipulate the facts to get their effect; Sylvia's husband was still alive in the original story, for example, and her illness had not taken hold. But by compressing events, the movie creates for the Barrie character an opportunity for unconditional love. What he feels for the Davies family is disinterested and pure, despite all the appearances. What he feels for his wife remains a mystery, not least to her.

B00005JNDZ|3.0|You ever have the kind of friend where for a long time you shake your head in admiration and then gradually realize you're shaking your head in despair? Bridget Jones would be a friend like that. <br /> <br />She's hopelessly lovable, and she's always going to be your friend no matter what, but, really, who but Bridget, with her guilt-ridden diary entries for alcohol and nicotine units per day, would manage to get jailed in Thailand on drug-smuggling charges? <br /> <br />Bridget of course is not a drug smuggler, but being Bridget she did the one thing no tourist should ever do, and that is to carry in her luggage a souvenir given to her girl friend by a guy. But Bridget has pluck. In no time at all, she's traded her pink bra for cigarettes, organized her prison inmates into a Madonna class, and they're rehearsing \\"Like a Virgin.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is a jolly movie and I smiled pretty much all the way through, but it doesn't shift into high with a solid thunk the way \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" (2001) did. In the first movie, things happened to Bridget. In the sequel, Bridget happens to things. <br /> <br />As the story opens, Bridget is happily involved with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who to her astonishment became her boyfriend in the earlier film. Plump Bridget, in love with a hunk! She's still working as an on-air personality for a TV show which seems to be running its private version of \\"Fear Factor\\" just for Bridget; surely this girl is not ready to sky dive? Or ski? Or manage a romance without getting unreasonably jealous of the quality time Mark seems to be spending with his colleague Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett)? But she loves the guy. Who else could keep him standing outside her door while she finishes leaving a message for him on his answering machine? Especially when the message is, essentially, that he is standing outside even as she speaks? <br /> <br />Bridget depends as before on the wisdom of three friends whose advice is infallibly dangerous. They are Shazzer (Sally Phillips), Tom (James Callis) and Jude (Shirley Henderson), and they support her when she and Mark have a completely unreasonable fight. Bridget flies off to Thailand on assignment and discovers that her former boyfriend Daniel (Hugh Grant) is already there. This is a man she should never, ever, have anything to do with, but because she is mad at Mark she allows herself to be maneuvered into a position where Daniel can cry with glee: \\"Please! Please be wearing the giant panties!\\" <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger is lovable to begin with, and combining her with Bridget Jones creates a critical mass of cuteness: You don't want to just watch her, you want to tickle her ears and scratch under her chin. She has that desperately hopeful smile, and the endearing optimism of a woman in a dress two sizes too small. When she embarrasses herself, it's big-time, as when she single-handedly causes Mark's table to lose the annual quiz at the Law Society Dinner. <br /> <br />The scenes in Thailand, it must be said, venture beyond contrivance. Bridget is the kind of woman who is more at home dealing with the sorts of things that could happen to anybody, like dropping a rock Cornish game hen down the front of her dress. She isn't made for cocaine busts. And it's a little mystifying why Daniel and Mark, two relatively important and successful men no longer in their first youth, have another brawl over her. Their motivation, I think, is that the fight in the first movie was so funny. Hugh Grant is so good at losing his dignity that we forget what skillful acting it requires to assure us he has any. Colin Firth plays the basically good guy, never a plum role; rascals always have more fun in comedies. <br /> <br />Standing back from \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,\\" I can see that the perfection of the first film has been replaced here by a series of comic episodes that could as easily be about anything else. The movie doesn't have the dire necessity of Bridget 1's quest for true love. If we didn't know better, we'd suspect that Bridget 2 subtly engineers her way into pickles because she knows how cute she looks when she gets in trouble. <br /> <br />Still, at the end of the day, I left hoping there will be a Bridget 3. Long may she squint and bravely smile and keep tugging her neckline up and believe in love.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's American Idiot album is, I think, the best album in history! The song American Idiot is such a good introduction into the punk opera. The songs like Are We the Waiting, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Wake Me Up When September Ends also create a more peaceful mood for those who don't enjoy loud, true, punk rock. Over all, this is THE BEST Green Day album so far.
B000003TA4|5.0|Alright, folks, here it is.  THE album of the nineties, and the album that defined a generation.  Since the end of the Vietnam War, popular music had been stagnating.  There were great underground movements, such as punk and industrial, but music on the whole became more and more about posturing and posing.  As became painfully obvious with the hair-metal of the eighties, rock had lost all of its urgency.  It wasn't about saying something that needed to be said, but rather about pushing product.  The record companies were consolidating, using the power that afforded them to create rubrics for musical acts to fit into.  And it worked, because the only reason people made music was for fame and fortune.   <br /> <br />That's why the mad scramble of the record companies in the beginning of the nineties is so funny.  Nirvana hit with Nevermind, and all the sudden it wasn't cool to be corporate or prepackaged.  The scramble of the record companies allowed for such bands as Live, Alice In Chains, Weezer, and many more to have mega hits.  All of a sudden, music listeners were being offered quality music that came from the heart with the kind of quality that big studio bucks and major label backing could afford.  Before this album, we never would have heard Lightning Crashes, or Buddy Holly, or Rooster. <br /> <br />But Nirvana weren't stars, and never wanted to be.  They just put out music.  Despite how well this album sold and how popular they were, they didn't want the limelight.  In the end, it killed Kurt Cobain.  So don't write reviews like you've got some sort of grudge against them for being so popular.  If Kurt Cobain can't play guitar as well as Robert Fripp, who cares?  He wrote music to supplement the song - not the other way around.  This isn't prog-rock; it's just rock and roll, and the reason it's so successful is that every second of music, especially on this album and In Utero, is infused with the emotion that Kurt put in to the song.  It's not about being popular, and it's certainly not about appeasing your jealousy or whatever it is that inspires your grudge.  If you don't like it, fine - but don't try and make it into some weird personal thing. <br /> <br />
B00064AM6C|5.0|The grainy visage of this film perfectly mirrors The White Stripes approach to music......down and dirty. By stripping their rock down to it's basic elements, taken a step further by the absence of a bassist, Jack and Meg White manage to create a curiously powerful racket, that translates quite well in this live setting. From the first fuzz-bathed chords Jack strums on his guitar, you can tell your gonna be in for a pulverizing ride. The dim lighting and splotchy video only add to the primal mystique of the bands incendiary performances and with an assorted batch of tunes from all their studio albums the White Stripes prove themselves to be arguably more compelling in their crude live incarnation.     Often, the band shows off their improvisational skills which frequently find Jack White playing his guitar with a blues-possessed ferociousness that was only hinted at on record. Couple that with Meg White's seductive drumming and it's easy to see why this band has garnered such buzz and attention. From \\"Fell in Love With A Girl\\" to the dramatic reading of Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene\\" to the raucous medley that finally dissipates into \\"Seven Nation Army,\\" the Stripes prove that they're no sloutches. With a superb filming job, this DVD gets you about as close to the actual feeling of being in attendance as one could imagine. While it's a great snapshot of a great band taking care of business, it's also a testament to the power of The White Stripes gritty version of rock and roll and one truly terrific concert film.
0140177396|5.0|I have read a few other Steinbeck novels over the years.  Except for the Grapes of Wrath, I have found them too long for the point they are trying to make.  Of Mice and Men is much more concise and yet provides a real punch.  The punch is not so much in the ending as in the character development.  In such a short piece, we have the priviledge of seeing the power of a true friendship that is based on caring and respect.  The setting is vivid and intense - much like the country where it takes place.  This is an excellent, quick read and I highly recommend it.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi Hendrix's sophomore release may not have been as explosive as ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?, or as lavish as ELECTRIC LADYLAND, but AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE certainly packs an impressive wallop of it's own.  Although \\"Little Wing\\" supplies the album with it's resplendent signature tune, there's plenty of other tasty rock n' roll treats scattered throughout.  Heavier on funk and groove, this album boasts a more pronounced soul and r&b influence than before on \\"Wait Until Tomorrow,\\" \\"Up From The Skies,\\" and the strutting \\"Little Miss Lover.\\"  However, the incendiary \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" and \\"If 6 Was 9\\" could easily go toe to toe with Hendrix's previous psychedelic hard rock anthems as they shake the foundations with nasty fuzzed-out riffs and blazing guitar pyrotechnics.  And, as usual, there's a multitude of mad-scientist-like production flourishes (underwater guitar and back-masking to name a few) to keep any listener on their toes.  Hendrix was certainly the consummate artist, and although not as many revere this particular album, there's still plenty of evidence here to prove why Jimi was such a rock n'roll heavyweight.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|I hated, hated, HATED this movie!  It ate two hours of my life, cost me almost $9.00, and left me angry for having listened to the pinheads who recommended this drivel. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp, in one of his worst film roles, mumbled his way through this exercise in tedium.  I've enjoyed Mr. Depp in other roles, but the material here was lacking in, oh, maybe EVERYTHING necessary to be interesting.  The movie plodded along and I mentally checked out after 20 minutes.  Had I not been there with a friend, I would've left. <br /> <br />The less said about this borefest, the better, but if you have any questions about what I thought of this waste of film, please re-read my first sentence.  Also, if you decide to see this movie and can't tell who is going to die after the first half an hour, then you are in the minority. <br />
B000001GS0|5.0|Not much one can add to the reviews below. This is a great set. <br /> <br />Whoever was responsible for the selections in \\"The Originals\\" series and this recording is one, thank you. Priceless items were pulled from the Deutsche Gramophon back-catalogue that, in some cases, have been out of print for half a century. The remasterings have been exceptional. Many recordings I'd only heard about and never hoped to hear--this set, Sanderling's 1956 Rachmaninov 2nd, Fritz Lehmann's Brahms German Requiem, Jochum's mono Bruckner recordings to name a few--have been released. Add to that many exceptional recordings from the early stereo era and one can safely say that \\"The Originals\\" is possibly the greatest batch of Classical releases ever. Period. <br /> <br />Why buy old and sonically limited mono or early stereo recordings over something new and digital or worse? Simple. These are often interpretations by conductors with deep roots in the European classical tradition--the music is in their genes. Many knew the composers of pieces they are conducting, or studied under pupils of other composers or legendary conductors. Bruno Walter recorded a wonderful performance of Mahler's Second Symphony--he was Mahler's assistant when he was younger. Many premiered works that are now standards--Pierre Monteux conducted the first performance of The Right of Spring and 50 years later recorded it in stereo. The orchestras from these eras were often exceptional, primarily in their belief in the music. Some were ruled over with iron fists but subsequently played like demons. Stories abound of musicians being emotionally overcome by the music they were playing. (And one wonders if that happens at all these days) <br /> <br />So what you often lose in terms of high-tech sound (and often it's not as much as you'd imagine), you gain in fervor and commitment. Personally, I believe that's a grand understatement. When you hear the chilling savagery in the allegro of an old mono recording of Shostakovich's 10th (conducted by Mitropoulos) you're hearing an orchestra of probably largely immigrants, most of whom were touched directly by the horrors of Hitler and Stalin. You hear both their rage and Shostakovich's. German orchestras performing Brahms, Mozart, and Beethoven in the 50s and 60s are heaving everything they have into banishing demons. A legendary wartime performance of Beethoven's Ninth conducted by Furtwangler has been seen by some as an anguished attempt at an exorcism within the Reich itself. Danish orchestras, in the same era, performing works by Carl Nielsen are consciously working to bring his radiant light into a darkened world. The Sanderling Rachmaninov recording I mention was made only a few years after the end of the Stalin era and the relief is almost palpable. You will seldom experience such examples of belief in the spiritual power of music than you will in this era. <br /> <br />So if you're young and interested in Classical, maybe one of those lucky ones with great ears who's already realized no one will ever top Billie Holiday, or Ella, or maybe \\"The King\\", or Miles, or the Beatles, or Edith Piaf, or Charlie Parker, then you should give stuff like this a try. If those names resonate then you're probably already working with your own passion, music isn't wallpaper or mere lifestyle accessory for you. Bravo, prepare for a lifetime of great experiences! If you're older and allegedly wiser toss these older recordings at the young 'uns but, please, only with lots of humility. I'm often awestruck by the musical artists of early to mid Twentieth Century but especially by those of the post-war era.
B0001O3YEE|4.0|I saw the \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\" before this movie, and that may be a reason I liked Pitch Black better, because I had an idae of who he was.  Anyone else might have found PB somewhat vague on Riddick's character, but I think that's the idea of the series: he's a creepy murderer (his crimes left up to your imagination), and we're only supposed to see his redemption over the course of the entire Chronicles (Vin Diesel said there would be 2 more sequels after the Chronicles of Riddick!).  This is a pretty good movie, that has next to no B-movie moments except a few (diminutive) plot holes.  Vin Diesel is awesome as Riddick, Radha Mitchell played her complex character very well (she was the only somewhat noble character in this movie, despite what she  tried to do at the beginning), Hauser played a good loser/jerk, Jack was pretty funny, but I'm afraid the Muslims were nothing more than dog food and some \\"deep\\" philosophical stuff (although it did have a few good, Christian overtones).       Here's the basic plot: a crew journeys space in cryo-sleep (suspended animation), housing some travelers, a cop, an a dangerous convict who is locked up and blindfolded.  When their ship is hit by a meteor shower (the meteors are baseball-sized, go figure), the ship comes apart and crashes on a dried up desert-like planet with three suns.  They come upon a civilization that was wiped out by...something.  One of the crew  members (an overtly expendable Aussie at first sight) gets sucked underground by..something, and our stranded characters (Fry the pilot, Johns the cop, Paris something or another the British archeologist, the aforementioned Aussie, the boy Jack, a British/Australian woman who something of a mystery as to why she's on the ship in the first place, and Richard B. Riddick, the convict who broke his chains and has eyes with a mysterious power) find that they are not as alone as once they thought.  I won't go into the plot anymore, as I want  you to find out the twists for yourself if you watch it.       Overall, it captured the essence of Riddick (or is that old, bad Riddick we never saw much of?) as gritty, dirty, and slightly sadistic.  This is a solid movie, with good acting, no problems there.  The \\"something else\\" I spoke of, yes, they're aliens  (only \\"spoiler\\", as if everyone else hadn't told you).  In the words of about fifty trillion other reviews, they bear similarities to hammerhead sharks (hammer-like bone protusions on its face, is attracted to blood, and has fin thingies),  pterodactyls (on account of their wings) and bats (they use a sonar to \\"see\\").  The overall look of the aliens in Pitch Black bear little to no resemblance to those of Alien, except for the broad face and no eyes.       Overall, a really fun movie which was a little subdued in terms of fright factor, although there are some typical gross offages of various worthless cast members.  However, the movie was not supposed to be a fantastic special-effects ride (like I sorta perceived the Chronicles of Riddick to be), but an insight into how Riddick and the core characters (Fry, Jack, Imam, and Johns) reacted to each other and sets the surviving characters up for the sequels, which gets into the meat of the Chronicles of Riddick.  No sex scenes, but loads of cussing, so parents might want to take that into consideration.  Definitely worth watching (I'm buying it), at least if you're interested in the toal history of Riddick.  Good movie!
B000089CJI|1.0|it is so saccharine, making me want to check my pulse and my insides to make sure i havent melted into cheesy mess. this band demonstrates why i tread carefully around all things indie pop.

B000002KCC|5.0|This ranks among Neil Young's best albums though it is probably one of his least commercially successful.  And for good reason. If you are looking for the Neil Young of CSN&Y, this ain't it.  Looking for Hank Williams' Neil? Stay away. If you are looking for techno-rocker Neil, stay away. Grunge Neil? Nope.<br /><br />\\"Tonight's the Night\\" is Neil Young at his most raw, despondent and powerful. Most of the tracks  - \\"Speakin' Out\\" \\"Look Out Joe\\" \\"World On a String\\" \\"..Downtown\\" have an edge and sound that conjures up images of Neil Young and his band playing in a roadhouse along the Mississippi delta. Not a lot of time was spent in the studio over-producing this album. And it is that raw, elemental rock quality that makes this cd so sturdy.<br /><br />For fans of Nils Lofgren, this is an opportunity to hear some of Nils' best stuff (albeit in a supporting role) on about half the tracks. For those who consider themselves Neil Young fans but who have not heard this CD, you owe it to yourself to give it more than a few listens.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I just saw this movie with one of my younger sisters for Easter, and we were both very moved by it. It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie, in a way, has brought me closer to Jesus, and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie, however, and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt, so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us. I think this is a movie everyone should see because it is a real reminder of the wonderful love Jesus has for all of us. The movie was all in Hebrew, too, with subtitles, so it was very realistic and quite faithful to the Gospels. Mel Geibson did a wonderful job sharing with us a very realistic glimpse of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.

0385510454|4.0|News Flash:  John Grisham, like all of us, is Getting Older. <br />And, like all of us who are getting older, his priorities are changing. If you've read his earlier books (and I'm sure you have), he has always hinted that the pace of modern life, especially an attorneys, is conducted at breakneck speed: work, work, work, deals, deals, deals, money, money, money, sex, sex, sex. These are the priorities of many twentysomething attorneys, and his protagonists are no different. <br />But, after fifteen years of writing about these characters, maybe he's realized that it's time for one of his protagonists to do something different, as, indeed an older person would do: stop and smell the roses.  <br />Joel Backman is a highpowered Washington attorney and power broker (not stockbroker) who tries to sell a multimillion dollar satellite system to the highest bidding country. He runs afoul of the law, gets several people killed, pleads guilty, and is imprisoned for a number of years. He is granted an early pardon by the lame duck president, and is packed off by the CIA to Italy, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting him, but in reality to make him an easy target for enemies who want revenge. <br />So far, this sounds like the plot to a classic Grisham tale. However, as I have noted earlier, Grisham himself is getting older, and his protagonist is now 52 and has just spent six years in prison. Backman is a smart man, and he figures out that the CIA has dumped him in Italy to get rid of him. So, while pondering his next move, he sits tight, studies the language with a tutor, enjoys good food and wine at the local cafes, meets a sympathetic professor and a potential love interest, and bides his time until he can figure out how to stay one step ahead of his assailants. This middle portion of The Broker is slow and easy, as relaxing as good coffee and companionship. One cannot imagine Mitch McDeere, workaholic protagonist of The Firm, \\"wasting\\" his time in this manner, but remember Backman is 52, not 24. He realizes that time can be an ally at this point, the better to familiarize himself with Italy: the cities, the language, the people, and, most important, the passageways and back alleys so that he can one day soon slip away and make his escape. The action picks up in the last third of the novel with a typical Grisham climactic chase and a hilarious news conference with a skeptical (but still willing) reporter.  <br />Bottom line: If you basically want a novel that merely  replicates the nonstop action of The Firm or A Time To Kill, then don't buy this book. But if you want a first-rate read with many of the same good qualities as earlier Grisham books, plus an excellent, slower-paced midsection where the hero (and the reader) learn to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, particularly as lived in a timeless nation like Italy, then you may want to give The Broker a try. For, although some of us don't like to admit it, we are all getting older and there are beds of roses and everyday joys aplenty to be savored.
B00004Y87O|4.0|This is one of the better efforts from director John Carpenter.  There is a dynamite premise here and he sets it up well.  The sets showing the decay setting in on Manhattan is excellent.  Kurt Russell contributes a memorable anti-hero in Snake Plissken, former special-forces commando gone bad.  Lee Van Cleef as the hard boiled warden Hauck has not skipped a beat from when he was making spaghetti westerns with Sergio Leone.  Ernest Borgnine offers good comic relief as Cabbie.  Carpenter even composed a decent score for the film.  If I am to find fault with the film is that it is just a little too much style over substance for me to give it an unqualified rave.  As the film's nominal heavy, Isaac Hayes may have the look but not the acting heft to pull it off.  In conclusion, \\"Escape from New York\\" entertained me but didn't overwhelm me.

B00009W0U4|1.0|The only good thing about this movie is the way it was shot.  The trick camera work is this film's best asset.  The retribution scene at the Rectum is not really that big of a deal.  The thing which makes this movie intollerable is the long and horrible rape scene.  I think this is the most horrible thing I have ever seen in a movie.  This scene makes the rape in I Spit On Your Grave seem timid by comparison.  (Even the notorious razor-blade rape in the Stendahl Syndrome is comparitively tame.)  Many people were disturbed by the rapes in Blue Velvet and The Accused; the latter are G-rated compared to this irresponsibly long, realistic, and sickening (simulated) sexual assault.  I'm sure the real sickos out there would probably get off on this one.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|If you are expecting a great movie for the adult audience forget it, this is a great movie for the little ones, my 4 year old son had a blast! he really liked and enjoyed the movie, as soonest the movie comes out in dvd I will buy it, every time a new animated movie comes out, my first expectation is that my son likes it, if I also like the movie that is a plus, in this case I can say that the movie is not that bad, it actually made me laugh a couple of times, but AGAIN, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE KIDS
1400034779|5.0|This book is a joy on several levels.  As a series of mysteries solved by the inimitable Mma Ramotswe, who invariably puts her size 22 finger on the crux of a mystery and solves it, the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is satisfying; but unexpectedly rewarding are the glimpses into the manners, habits and prejudices of another culture. Smith's writing style is exquisite; deceptively simple, but with little gems such as his description of the language used in the South African mines:\\"...a language for giving orders, push, shove, do this, do that; but no words for friendship, love, or the sound the birds make in the morning.\\"  This is a book to read and reread, and make cherished friends of Mma Ramotswe and her circle.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|As an avid hater of Anime cartoons and having a bias against the majority of films which fall into that category, I must say...Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind is definately an interesting flick.  Prior to viewing it, I had watched two other Miyazaki films: Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke, both of which had blown me away. When I saw his name on the cover of the dvd, I knew it couldn't be too terrible.  Luckily, it wasn't.   <br /> <br />In Nausicaa, Miyazaki displays the same attention to detail that has always placed him a notch above other animators.  Even now, with all the leaps and bounds in animation that computers have made, they still struggle to equal the quality that is present in Miyazaki's work.  One can genuinely see the emotions on the characters' faces.  The many environments which are shown in the film also never fail to convince. <br /> <br />One thing I noticed was the similarity between the basic storylines and elements which made up Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke.  Were you to replace the toxic jungle of Nausicaa with the forest of Princess Mononoke, replace the giant insects which live in the jungle with the giant animals which live in the forest, replace the warring villages with the warring samurai, and move the time period back about 1400-1600 years, then you would have the overall shell of Princess Mononoke.  However, similarities are to be expected when the same author created both stories.  Yet that's not to say that the story is bad or that the movie is not worth watching.  Far from it.  Although the same level of depth isn't present in Nausicaa as it is in Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa remains an excellent film, never-the-less.  In fact, you'll probably be left wanting more after you finish the film.  If that is the case, then there is a series of Manga which go beyond the film, as the film covers less than half of the full story. <br /> <br />The full manga are available here.   [...] <br />And, while I despise anime, I must confess, I have been convinced to order all of them.
038073186X|1.0|The story was a little confusing, I constantly had to reread the prologue to try to figure out what exactly was happening and who the characters were.  The story was suspenseful and interesting but the ending was a complete cop out.  I would never buy another book by this author.  Its just like any other psychological thriller, confusing and unsolvable.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|Don't verbally abuse this film because it outsmarted you and you actually DIDN'T see the twist at the end coming from a mile off.  This was wonderfully original (with the one esception of Se7en, which also was wonderfully original, and therefore makes this one wonderfully original as wee) The acting wasn't bad, and the score was excellent (thanks to the brilliance of NIN's Charlie Clouser) and the \\"reverse beartrap\\", while over-theatrical in appearance, is something I would like to see happen to someone... But thats beside the point.  All in all, it was a pretty good movie, at least spend the $3 to rebt it.
044651652X|2.0|Reactions to this book are likely to be strongly polarized; some people will love it and others hate it. It is a simple story of tragic love, with no profound insights or surprising twists. The story itself is genuinely moving, and I am not ashamed to admit to shedding a tear or two. But Waller's writing style is very poor, full of cliches, and with embarrassingly clumsy attempts at lyricism. If you want to know what a real writer can do with such a theme, read Edith Wharton's 'Ethan Frome'.<br /><br />'Bridges' is a short story padded out to make a novella, using interminable details about loading a truck and taking a photograph. 'Set lens to f/8' we are told. Fascinating stuff, which must have made for a great movie. It is incredible to think that Waller actually squeezed a sequel out of it. I will not be reading that.
0783225792|5.0|In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Quintessential Scorsese.<br /><br />In this compelling film Scorsese never pulled any punches in breathing life into his ideas. If there's an obvious weakness in Casino, it's that it occasionally seems derivative of Goodfellas.<br /><br />During its three-hour running time, Casino tells the story of two men's intermingled lives. \\"Back home years ago\\", they were friends and co-workers. Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro, in his eighth acting collaboration with Scorsese) was a gambler who never lost. He researched all his bets carefully, and rarely made a bad pick. His winning tendencies gained him popularity and favor with the local mob, who used Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to shadow and protect him. Now that Ace has moved to Vegas to manage the Tangiers Casino, Nicky isn't far behind. And, while the two gravitate to opposite sides of the law, with Ace keeping his fingers clean and Nicky taking over the local crime scene, their paths continue to cross, and their encounters become increasingly less friendly. Stirred into the mix is Ace's girlfriend, Ginger (Sharon Stone), an expert hustler who attracts men like flies. Although she agrees to marry Ace, she continues a liaison with her former pimp (James Woods) while encouraging Nicky's affections.<br /><br />As usual, Scorsese obtains excellent performances from his leads. Joe Pesci, essentially reprising his Goodfellas performance, will probably get all the attention, since this sort of flamboyance attracts raves. Actually, though, it's De Niro's more subtle, better-contained acting that's riveting. Casino is supposed to focus on both Ace and Nicky, but, despite nearly equal screen time for each, our sympathy is drawn towards the former. For this, De Niro's portrayal shares equal responsibility with the screenplay.
B0000041DZ|5.0|I like the way Brendal plays the Beethoven Sonatas. I think that the first 10 (or so) sonatas are some of the best I have ever heard played. I do however think that Ashkenazy has the best set of Beethoven Sonatas. I say that because he plays them all well and he has the right amount of power (I think Beethoven needs power). Also I love the way Ashkenazy plays my favorite sonata (the Waldstein) I love the way he plays these sonatas though, I just think Ashkenazy is the best. Even though these aren't my favorite you can not give someone who records all of the Beethoven Sonatas less than 5 stars because they are so damn difficult and anyone who records all of them has done tons of work to do that.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|What I think it boils down to is that \\"Robots\\" could have been a smart, witty satire of discrimination and media's manipulation of what one \\"should\\" look like, but it ultimately ends up with a cheapened, cliched message of \\"Never give up.  The end.\\"  There were moments when I thought the creators could have continued expanding on the ideas they touched on, but it seemed like they never went beyond scratching the surface of the aforementioned themes. <br /> <br />In a nutshell: <br /> <br />Pro's <br />- animation <br />- creativity (creation of robot city, variety of characters, etc) <br />- fun/enjoyable/cute... definitely a kids film <br />- it had it's funny moments (especially with its incorporation of pop culture references & puns/play on words) <br />- some memorable jokes/scenes <br /> <br />Con's <br />- shallow, cliched message <br />- seemingly no time/energy put into development of theme/message/story <br />- voice-overs (not bad, but certainly nothing spectacular) <br />- quite a forgettable story <br />- humor could be crude and obnoxious <br /> <br />Despite its (many) weaknesses, it's enjoyable enough to see once, especially if you have kids.
B00005NC66|5.0|Numerous reviews, essays, and books have dedicated much thought and contemplative work on Jean-Luc Godard's film Breathless.  So where does one begin this review knowing that many have already dissected his film?  Perhaps, we should try to understand why this film has received so much commotion.<br /><br />Contemplating the society when Breathless was shot and comparing it with our current society might not be the best approach.  It is also silly to think that a young audience will get all the references to older films, which Breathless intends to shove aside with a refreshing style.  For example, jump cuts are something that today's youth have seen millions of times.  If people watch MTV or any other television channel they will see the infamous jump cut in action in both recorded and live format.  So why bother watching Breathless?  Well, to fully appreciate Breathless the audience should watch films from France and the rest of the world that were made before, let's say in 1955.  In this way the audience will build an idea of how stiff and structured films were without much visual surprise, which big production companies still depend on occasionally as they use them as a safety net in fear of having a bomb at the box office. <br /><br />Breathless is actually a refreshing breath of a new wave that hit the world of the cinema in the 1960s.  This fresh idea helped develop film and cinema into what it is today, and this is why Breathless is such an important film.  The film broke the cinematic rules that were in use by the production companies.  For example, Godard wrote his shooting script during his morning coffee while probably inhaling his nicotine fumes, scenes where not rehearsed and the idea of how to frame a shot came though the motion and the making of the film.  Cinematography used handheld cameras a long time before it became common through lightweight cameras.  Contempt was expressed in regards to meticulous lighting.  The filmmakers tossed the old ways out through the window and began to create a new form of visual expression, which was only a natural progress for cinema just as art has advanced through history.<br /><br />Breathless takes place in Paris where Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) seeks refuge in the masses after having killed a traffic policeman in a moment of fear.  Wanted and hunted Michel takes short cuts to find money by stealing money from old girlfriends and trying to get back old debts, money Michel needs in order to leave the country.  However, he has also made new acquaintance in Paris that infatuate him, the beautiful American Patricia Franchini, a Iowan girl by the name of Jean Seberg who sought refuge in France after a couple of box office bombs in United States.  Michel seeks Patricia as a means to find shelter and possibly affection.<br /><br />The chemistry between the Michel and Patricia generates a certain mystique, as Patricia always seems to be full of astonishing revelations.  For example, she tells out of the blue that she is pregnant and that she requires her freedom.  Michel on the other hand is an uncomplicated guy with a tough façade that he seems to borrow through his hero Humphrey Bogart--style he mimics by having a constant cigarette that is hanging of either one lip or squeezed in between.  The character's differences could maybe be a result of the individual styles of acting, but also on Godard's rejuvenating style of directing.  This mystique keeps lingering in the air through the cinematography and the performances of the actors.<br /><br />Regardless of how the mystique is generated, the film provides a wonderful cinematic experience, as it is full of surprises and leaves the audience in a breathtaking, yet quirky visual journey.  This further evolves on how Godard makes the film a little more interesting in a cerebral way in regards to cinema.  For example, Godard efficiently uses the director Jean-Pierre Melville, to perform as a famous writer that Patricia interviews while Michel uses one of Melville's films, Bob le Flambeur (1955), as a reference of who would pay a debt.  Ultimately, the audience has experienced an interesting cinematic expedition through Breathless, especially in a historical perspective.  The story is not intricate, yet it is the simplicity that Godard employs that makes this film so wonderful.cia interviews while Michel uses one of Melville's films, Bob le Flambeur (1955), as a reference of who would pay a debt.

0385510454|3.0|Having read all of John Grisham's work, I rate this as middle of the road at best. Any action or perceived \\"thriller\\" became engulfed in Grisham's Reader's Digest history of Italy. One might expect a typical page-turner from the king of legal thrillers, but from about 50 pages in to about 50 pages from the end, the book completely bogs down in English-Italian translation. <br /> <br />Joel Backman, a Washington, DC, power broker, gets a controversial presidential pardon after 6 years in the slammer for trying to hawk a satellite jamming software to the highest bidder. The CIA worked the pardon in order to see who might be interested in killing Backman, giving them a lead on who was trying to purchase the software. Much of the book takes place in Italy, where Backman was hiding and forced to learn the language and customs to blend in. <br /> <br />While some of the Italian history was interesting, the pages upon pages of language tutoring was simply too much and too boring for a typical Grisham work. <br /> <br />Backman could also be one of the more forgettable protagonists in Grisham's body of work. We'll see what Hollywood does with him.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|As I slept dreamily on my lazy boy in the family room, I awoke to the most pure sound I have ever heard as my mom watched this program on pbs.  I immediately awoke and was captivated by the power and purity of their angelic voices.  singing my favorite songs such as \\"may it be\\", \\"marble halls\\", \\"Jesu joy of man's desiring\\" (beautiful harmony by the way) and \\"You Raise me Up\\".  I sat on the chair teary-eyed as they spoke to my soul through song.  I recommend this cd for anyone who loves to get the chills with the power of beautiful, pure, tonal, and unforgettable music.
B00005JNEI|2.0|<br />I went to see Fahrenheit 911 last year in theaters, very wary about the fact that even its supporters did not regard it as objective.  Yet I was willing to go see it if it showed footage from the war in Iraq that I could not find in the mainstream media.  The movie does have genuine clips of Iraqi civilians who were bombed, and for this reason alone it should be seen.  The palpable grief of Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, is also moving, as is the grief of all mothers who lose children, whether in necessary or unnecessary wars.  But after that, the virtues of the movie diminish and start to be overshadowed by its problems.  Sticking just to the question of war footage, Moore himself seemed to imply before the movie's release that he had footage of Iraqi prisoner abuse older than the Abu Ghraib photos, yet there is nothing so raw and clear as that in the movie.  There is only a scene cut and presented in such a way as to imply sexual abuse, when actually the footage may be about something quite different. <br /> <br />Dave Kopel's online essay, \\"59 Deceits in Fahrenheit 911\\", describes how problematic Moore's style really is.  \\"59 Deceits\\" has its own problems, but it provides links to other pieces defending Moore's movie, and to critiques of Kopel's own piece, including point-by-point rebuttals.  Having compared Kopel with his critics, I would invite other fans or critics of the movie to decide who does a better job of transcending their own problems, for instance by inviting the opposite side to respond and not merely dismissing their views.  I find it significant that Kopel does invite Moore to respond, and this should be no surprise, since Kopel is a lifelong Democrat who, like Moore, supported Ralph Nader in 2000. <br /> <br />It's impossible to see this film and not be moved by the suffering depicted in the U.S. and Iraq.  It's also practically impossible, unless you hold Michael Moore's political views, not to feel infuriated thatsuch suffering should be presented in a movie that was openly made for political purposes.  In short, if you agree with those purposes, you won't feel manipulated, but if you disagree in any way with Moore's politics, you'll feel manipulated toward his views, rather than genuinely persuaded.  Considering that the American public was largely manipulated into supporting the invasion of Iraq, a movie like this hardly leaves you hopeful. <br /> <br />But manipulative politics is not the chief problem with the film.  I find some things in Moore's political worldview attractive, especially when Fahrenheit is shining a light on problems at home, and drawing attention to how those problems might be linked to war.  The greater problem for me while watching the movie was not that I was listening to someone with radical politics, but instead a feeling that certain facts or realities - and yes, certain sufferings - were being systematically kept from me, as if I could not be trusted to make up my own mind.  Michael Moore has written that Americans are essentially stupid:  \\"Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet....in thrall to conniving, thieving, smug pricks.  We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing.\\"  Not that Fahrenheit 911 cares to show us anything about what it's like to live in foreign countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq.  The movie assiduously avoids trying to educate us about life beyond our borders, besides showing us sweet scenes of everyday life that go down easily.  No doubt Moore feels that Saddam Hussein's police state was already highlighted enough by the mainstream media, and that his job as a film-maker was to point out the dark side of American involvement.  But in this way, his movie unwittingly argues that the mainstream media is doing a good job, or at least a passable job, of educating Americans about Iraq.  It clearly is not.  The Bush administration may have rightly called attention to certain living situations far beyond our imagination in our democracy, but neither Moore nor I would assert that the White House has fairly educated us about what Iraqi society was like before American intervention.  If that's a problem, and Moore says our ignorance is a problem, you'd expect Moore to try to address it.  No attempt is made.  Perhaps he doesn't trust us to make up our own minds.  Maybe he thinks Americans have been kept fully in the dark about their negative impact on other countries and cannot be trusted to hear anything else right now, even if hearing other things would help make an emotional connection between Americans and Iraqis.  Perhaps he doesn't feel the oppression in Iraq was really something worth looking at right now.  Any of these attitudes is a serious problem, and would be in any individual.  All the more is that true for someone who calls his films documentaries, and who does call in his films for compassion. <br /> <br />And there are many inconsistencies here.  Fahrenheit is very respectful towards the horror of the 9-11 attacks, but it uses the attack on the Pentagon as a sight gag, despite the fact that a third of the people who died were civilians on an airplane.  He has said this about the Lila Lipscombs of our country: \\"I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end.\\"  Finally, Moore has publicly excoriated U.S. support of Israel, yet he says nothing about Israel in Fahrenheit, presumably because he did not want to lose the large Jewish vote on the left when it came time to unseat Bush.  No doubt, too, since he wants to paint U.S. foreign policy as being in Saudi Arabia's pocket, he doesn't want to analyze how that nation, besides rarely agreeing with Israel on anything, actually opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Nevertheless, it's a strange issue to omit, because U.S. support for Israel is widely reviled in the Middle East; it's something that Americans do need to look at; and talking about it would be a great way to indict Bush.  Moore attacks Bush, his personality and his politics, in every possible way, but says nothing about Israel, a country right at the heart of Middle East violence. <br /> <br />As noted, both fans and critics agree that the movie is not objective.  Fans of Fahrenheit 911, and even some critics, often say that it wasn't meant to be \\"that kind of movie.\\"  The fans say that it was meant to show the side of things which runs against the mainstream, and if it doesn't attempt anything else, so what?  But then why call it a documentary?  If a movie known as a documentary raises questions about whether, for instance, the film-maker is playing fast and loose with the documents or the material he is trying to document, then the movie is \\"that kind of movie.\\"  Any movie purporting to be factual is going to call up such questions as whether facts were documented and presented in context, and whether there was misleading or deceit going on.  So why is the movie's lack of objectivity said to be a non-issue?  That attitude is a serious problem.  What it really says is that the question of deception is not so important as the question of who will sit in the White House, or in this case, the objective of unseating Bush.  The lesson being taught here, whether fans of the movie are aware of it or not, is that truth is not so important as political victory.  I am fully convinced that this is the attitude that got us into war in the first place, and is no way to avoid future wars. <br /> <br />Michael Moore is a dragon-slayer, not in the traditional sense of someone who might actually be doing something good, but in the contemporary sense of someone who is willing to deceive (by careful selection and omission) in order to get his man. <br />
0440418569|3.0|First a comment on some of the other reviews.  Perhaps some of these people read the books but just weren't paying attention, I have a feeling most of them have never read the books and are of the ignorant, close minded book burning ilk who rant and rave about Harry Potter being evil.  First off there is nothing anti-religion or satanic about these books, the Authority and his Regent that are destroyed were FALSE GODS, the book CLEARLY states they were Angels who were pretending to be the Creator, so what is overthrown are power hungry and sadastic false gods and their sadistic followers in the form of the Church.  Second two pre-pubescent teens don't have sex, again book clearly states that the only ones who can see the Specters are adults, or teenagers who have reached puberty.  By the last couple of chapters Lyra and Will are clearly seeing the Specters so draw your own conclusion.  They kiss and grope maybe but nothing ever says they had sex, and MARY was playing the role of serpent, how does that add up?? <br />I do agree that these books, especially the last one, aren't appropriate for children under the age of 14, they are just too complicated. <br />And this last book was a HUGE dissappointment, it drug on and on and several plot points just didn't make sense.  It wasn't as well written as the first two books which I enjoyed.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is a very cool album, while it is very loud and intense at some parts it's also very quiet and relaxing at others which make it really special. Lots of metal bands out there today just make noise and scream but \\"Toxicity\\" isn't like that by any means, it's very musical. I suggest it for anyone who likes hard rock/metal, because although people who don't like metal would enjoy some songs other songs would be a bit much. <br />Higlights: <br /> <br />Prison Song <br />Chop Suey! <br />ATWA <br />Shimmy <br />Toxicity <br />Aerials <br />
B00070QXL8|4.0|I enjoyed the 2nd as much as the 1st!  Bridgett is a bit more annoyingly stupid, but the movie is cute, and there's even more of Colin Firth.... to which I say hip, hip, hooray!  What a fabulous actor.  His character is so totally different from Hugh Grant's that sometimes Mark Darcy can seem really boring and dull.  The love scenes with Hugh Grant & Renee Zellwegger were definitely much steamier than the airtime between Firth & Zellwegger. <br />I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office.  Our only comments negatively, are that the star, Renee Zellwegger did not look as cute as she did in the first movie, and she is perhaps even chubbier and less attractive, and sillier and bubble-headed.  A very annoying character indeed.
B0006213WG|3.0|This album really is OK, it's quite boring though. I don't like how sum 41 copied other bands on their songs, like how they copied Linkin Park on \\"No Reason\\" (even though I hate LP), Metallica on \\"Bitter End\\", Coldplay on \\"Pieces\\" (according to previous reviewer) and System of a Down on \\"We're All To Blame\\". <br /> <br />If they came up with some original stuff I'd give them a better chance.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I bought this album before &quot;Take Me Out&quot; had hit the radio and I was disappointed from the beginning.  Being a fan of the BritPop/Rock scene I thought I'd found a new gem, but this album is nothing but a boring, ho hum effort.  I don't understand why this album has garnered so much attention and critical aclaim.  The only standout track is &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, and the rest did nothing to inspire me or really even catch my attention.  I had a tough time &quot;getting into&quot; the album and gave up after 3 or 4 plays through. Franz Ferdinand just doesn't do it for me.
6305692572|1.0|and this isn't one of them.  She's just too cutsy and clean not earthy enough.  She's better off with lighter subject matter so she can show off her cutsy.  I didn't believe for 1 second that she was a drunk.  Besides why would anyone need a drink if they were married to super sexy Andy Garcia.  I could think of better things to do with him.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Despite the obvious Joy Division similarities, it's still a fantastic album. 80s post-punk, maybe. But since when is 80s post-punk a bad thing? I have to admit that it's one of my all time favorite records, but I can understand how one may not enjoy it. And that's fine. But don't go around putting one star ratings just because Interpol totally ripped off Joy Division. I honestly don't think Ian Curtis would mind, people.  <br /> <br />It's really too bad \\"Antics\\" is so mediocre.
B000002J03|5.0|im sick of people hailing zeppelin 4 (Zoso) as the best zeppelin ever. This album in my opinion is the best Led zeppelin has to offer. at first they were just good seventies rock and rollers with I, but with II they made it clear that they were not one hit wonders. every song on this album is great. the tone and artistry on jimi pages guitar playing on songs like Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, and Moby Dick solidified him as a master of clasic rock gutiar. these songs supplied the heavy grinding party rock zeppelin is good for, and the rest of album, ussually more toned down, provided for the easy listening led zeppelin fans. bassically, every song on this album is great, and in my opinion better then most of any other album of theirs. And if you dont trust my opinion take a listen for yourself.

B00004ZB9D|5.0|If you don't have this CD or any of his CDs, I recommend picking this one up. It has all his best known songs. It also includes a never before released song called Again that I am sure you heard back in the day and loved. It also has the song American Woman from the Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me soundtrack and from the rerelease of his previous album to this called simply 5. Those are the two of the reasons to get this thing. But there are many more reasons and many more great songs off of this. My favorites besides the previously mentioned somgs are Are You Gonna Go My Way, Fly Away, Rock 'N' Roll Is Dead, It Ain't Over Till It's Over, Mr. Cab Driver, Always On The Run, I Belong To You, and of course Lenny's first hit Let Love Rule. I enjoy every song, but those are my favorites. I am sure you will have favorites too, because this is a great album. So pick it up and enjoy it as much as I do. You won't be disappointed at all.
0393035158|3.0|Harris obviously just got out of a neuroscience program at Stanford and wants to impress us all with how much h learned.  His thesis is simple: The world's major religions are all predicated on ancient texts which contain outrageous and barbaric tenets, and therefore all religion should be banned. <br />He is especially hard on Islam, basically saything they are in a stage of development akin to the Catholic Church at the time of the Inquisition.  Regrettably he takes 250 pages to say this over and over.
B00005N83M|5.0|I really enjoyed this Jennifer Lopez album. For those of you who like Jennifer Lopez you guys are off the hook and for those of you who don't like Jennifer Lopez you should like her. In general, this is a pretty good album and I would recommend it to any Jennifer fan.
0399241515|5.0|I have read all six books and they rock. I liked this one the best because their is alot of action in this one.
B000002HJR|5.0|This album is an example of what the Gestalt stated: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />I came across this album accidentally. I was taking a look at a record store and saw this all black cd, with a sarcastic image of Jesus (?) smoking a cigarette. <br /> <br />The name Down seemed also interesting (and obvious) enough to make me take a listen. I had no idea of what could come from that dark pacakage(in fact I thought it was probably a boring deathmetal album) but I took my chances.  <br /> <br />From the very first moment I was blown away. Temptation Wings stars with an awesome riff that grabs you by the neck and takes into a heavy metal journey like very few. <br /> <br />Then I heard a voice that was way familiar but I thought I would have known if Phil Anselmo had another band. So I took the CD sleeve and started to dig for information. <br /> <br />Well, not only Phil Anselmo was in there, but also COC's Pepper Keenan. I guess it was just one year after Deliverance came out and it was all too good to be true. But, gee, it was damn true! <br /> <br />Song after song I couldn't believe what was coming into my ears. Hi quality headbanging heavy metal in its best form. <br /> <br />It was a no-brainer. I took the CD immmediately, after all, it was there, only import copy in town, waiting for me. <br /> <br />This is one my all time favorite albums, along with And Justice for All, Vulgar Display of Power, Deliverance, Badmotorfinger, Meantime and others. <br /> <br />If you like heavy metal this is a mandatory item in your collection. It's just a dream come true. Get it now!
0671027387|5.0|Deception Point has an unbeatable and brilliant plot. As I started reading the book, I was drawn into the story so intently that I couldn't put it down. I guess this is one major characteristic of all Dan Brown's books - once you pick it up, you can't put it down.<br /><br />Not only Deception Point was a throughoutly thrilling book, it is also very informative regarding to the US military technologies. I learned a lot from this book about what US government and military is truly capable of, given the writer's claim that all technologies described do exist.<br /><br />Last but not the least, Dan Brown is truly the mater of suspension. He can have you guessing until the last page of the book.<br /><br />Reading this book has been entirely a thrilling experience. If you are looking for a good book, please don't miss out on this one.<br /><br />Purple_Garden
B0007LXJDM|3.0|This is a great movie with some excellent performances, with child actor Freddie Highmore stealing the show. However, this DVD contains a Pontiac ad that you cannot get out of sitting through. I found out from the internet that it's called a Prohibited User Operations (PUO) ad. This is the first time I've come across one and frankly I got so mad it took me awile to start watching the movie without spitting bile. <BR>Imagine paying almost 30 bucks for a DVD and being forced to watch an automobile ad every time you pop in the DVD. It's enough to turn you into a raving conspiracy theorist. <BR>Anyway, Johnny Depp's incredible as usual, and Barrie's story is a poignant one. Don't miss it, but I wouldn't recommend the DVD.
B00008OLIO|5.0|This cd is not one of the Crue's best but as a debut, it is great. \\"Live Wire\\" you just cant beat the fast-pace ass-kicking raunch to that song. Get this cd. You'll want this cd!
0684857219|5.0|To be honest, I was a powerlifter for over 12 years, but injuries slowed me up quite a bit.  After taking some time off, I was itching to get back into it.  This book did not teach me much new information, however, it helped me stay strict to my routines and my diet.   <br /> <br />Whether you are just starting out, or you are a competitive bodybuilder, this is truly the \\"bible\\" for bodybuilding. <br /> <br />Well done!!!!
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Alright I saw this movie the day it came out, with two of my friends.  I have never laughed so hard in the movies my entire life, and I'm not just saying that.  The humor in Eurotrip is funny, clever and yes, exaggerated but its still a good time.  I've seen a lot of reviews who have bashed it because they didn't film on location.  Who cares?  It bugs me when they do something like that with Cold Mountain, a film about the American civil war filmed in Austria (I think), but Eurotrip is a comedy, I'm not going to be looking for every tiny detail.  Let's save that for the historical films.  Eurotrip in short is a very funny film to watch especially with friends.   <br /> <br /> The extras here are great too, but the unrated title throws you off a bit.  First off, none of the unrated stuff is included within the film itself, its all about the actual extras and menus and stuff.  There is a Nude Scene index just for kicks.  But my favorite extra would have to be the Chinese Bootleg, which they threw on for a variety of reasons, the directors talk about it, but the main reason its there is because its just so dam funny to watch, it's absolutely terrible.   <br /> <br />My Name is Scott and judging from the title of my review, the only thing that I do not like about this movie is the whole Scotty Doesn't Know song.  After this came out nobody, made a big deal about it, but a few months afterwards, everybody started singing it as soon as I walked into the room.  One could imagine it can be very annoying, especially when someone does it and they think they are the first to do it.  Yes it's quite original.   *sarcasm*  <br /> <br />Despite the song being annoying, the fad of singing it has seemed to have died out, so I have nothing against this film any more.  It's odd because most of the teenage sex films like American Pie just annoyed me, but this one had something to it.  The characters, or at least most of them were believable.  And it is a bit of reflection of the world's society as how one interprets another.  Heck the creepy Italian guy thought there was nothing wrong with what he did, he was just behaving as he always does, but then again his character is highly exaggerated.  I'll cut to the point; my review is as long enough as it is.  Buy or rent today, and get a crowd of friends together as you watch it, you will not be disappointed in the slightest.   <br /> <br />P.S. Watch out for Soccer Hooligans.   <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am confused. I am very confused because all of the \\"good reviews\\" I've read of this movie have absolutely nothing to do with the movie's content. Giving a movie 5 stars because the man who directed it is expressing his right of free speech isn't reasonable. It's still a crappy movie. Please email all of your complaints on the banning of this movie or anything to do with free speech to a government official instead of raping this forum with it. This place is for MOVIE reviews, not people reviews. <br /> <br />Now, as for the movie, seeing people burnt to a crisp and their mothers crying in pain about it is not a form of entertainment for me. Moore is just using it for the emotional effect to prove some point that it really has nothing to do with. It does not say anything about whether or not we should have gone to war. War happens. It sucks, but it happens. Get over it. <br /> <br />Also, I personally cannot stand hearing Moore's voiceover throughout the whole movie. I think I may have developed a tumor in my eardrum bigger than Michael Moore's ass.
B000683VI4|4.0|Just as a precursor, my wife and I rented the video and then didn't hesitate to buy it and add it to our collection.  She loves the movie, and I really do like it quite a bit.<br /><br />The love story between the two main characters is the driving force of the film, and it's outstanding.  I particularly enjoyed the love story between the elder versions of Noah and Allie more than the tumultuous origins of their younger versions, though the younger couple was certainly enjoyable.  The comparison most people are bound to allude to is with the love story in \\"Titanic,\\" with the poor young man and the well-to-do young lady finding their love across the chasm of society and class, and indeed, time itself.  It works.  This one can indeed put a lump in one's throat.<br /><br />The only complaints that I have -- and they're not major complaints -- are for Nick Cassavetes' uncanny ability to turn a powerful scene quickly into melodrama; in my opinion, there are several times that he does this in \\"The Notebook,\\" and it turns an otherwise very real, emotional scene into something unreal and plastic, like putting far too much makeup on to a lovely face; pretty soon, you no longer have a beautiful woman.  You have Gene Simmons from KISS.<br /><br />The other complaint is that the story is solidly two time periods; the young couple and the old, and I felt as if I was missing a great deal of the story by not having a very clear expose of the years in between.  As James Cameron did in Titanic with the camera scanning a collection of photographs through Rose's life, Cassavetes does in The Notebook with Noah and Allie.  It didn't really sate me.  But again, I think this is a minor complaint.<br /><br />Overall, I found myself very attached to the characters -- even to the sometimes unsettling quirkiness of the young Noah -- and to the film itself.  James Garner, usually associated with his Maverick and Jim Rockford characters, really won a piece of my heart in this film for his performance in particular.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good love story and a bit of a tearjerker, I certainly recommend The Notebook for a spot on your DVD shelf, and I'd be curious to know if anyone else feels the same way about my minor criticisms.  Don't let them keep you from enjoying a very enjoyable film!  :^)is performance in particular. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good love story and a bit of a tearjerker, I certainly recommend The Notebook for a spot on your DVD shelf, and I'd be curious to know if anyone else feels the same way about my minor criticisms.

B000007UXD|4.0|Extremely good! i only took 1 star off because a couple of songs were about 8/10 (or 4/5) so... anyway, I love punk and metal (bkack sabbath, motorhead, the clash. sex pistols, etc.) And i don't listen to just rock, but when my dad got me this cd i have been really into rock and acdc and playing the sngs on drums. YAY!!!
0312995423|5.0|I have read all the books by Dan Brown. And though Dan Brown is most famous for his Book The Da Vinci Code, I personally like Digital Fortress the best. This book starts with a digital security concept that can never be reached practically and then different people blowing their head off finding how was it achieved. Like its name the main concept is regarding digital security. A person seemed to have developed an encryption mechanism which can NEVER be breached or hacked. And the National Security Agency (NSA) people madly want to break this encryption algorithm because if this algorithm is released to common people, the NSA will have no control over normal peoples communication. Whether it be telephonic, email or pure textual chat.  <br /> <br />This book is bound to get you by your horns if you have the tiniest bit interest in digital security. The concept is very inspiring. And the book is the usual Dan Brown novel, that means that once you have started reading it, you cann't take your mind off it before finishing it. I am not going to spoil your fun by telling you more so I am leaving you with the words \\"Happy Reading\\". I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is a really great CD IMO.  Mine has tracks 18 & 19, but I don't think it's a limited edition import or anything.  Anyway for those of you who are strictly limited to fast up-beat alternative or heavy metal you need to think outside the box and listen to some Gorillaz: The Ultimate Chill Out Music!  My favorite song on this CD and probably overall of Gorillaz is Tomorrow Comes Today.  It's got a really great beat and the tune is really catchy.  That's one thing about Gorillaz.  You can't listen to an entire CD of theirs and not walk away with one of their songs stuck in your head.  No matter what album this will happen to you.  Other songs I find particularly good are Clint Eastwood (of course), Man Research, Double Bass, Sound Check, Latin Simone, 19-2000, Rock the House, and Left Hand Suzuki Method.  I'm not sure why but the Soulchild remix of 19-2000 and the Ed Case version of Clint Eastwood aren't listed for this CD.  They're really good (The soulchild 19-2000 is the theme song for a Fifa game and is on an Ice Breakers commercial).  If you're interested in thinking outside the rock n' roll box than definately check this CD out.
B000000H4V|5.0|1993's \\"Chaos A.D.\\" found the Brazilian based Sepultura at their apex.  It also found the band taking a more politically charged turn in their music as well, which is apparent on \\"Biotech is Godzilla\\", co-written by former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, as well as the instrumental \\"Kaiowas\\".  Also, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" found Sepultura taking a bit of a departure from previous classics \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and \\"Arise\\", as Max Cavalera and co. go for a more melodic thrash sound instead of the death metal vibe so apparent throughout their early career.  The title track, \\"Slave New World\\", \\"Nomad\\", and \\"We Who Are Not As Others\\" are classic songs that found Sepultura looking to go to new frontiers, but unfortunately, the following \\"Roots\\" would be the last Sepultura album to feature singer/guitarist/founder Max Cavalera as he departed and would form his much lacking Soulfly in 1998.  All in all, just like \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and \\"Arise\\", consider \\"Chaos A.D.\\" essential metal listening.
B000003TA4|5.0|By far Nirvana's best work.  I'd have to go with Lithium as being my favorite song at least on this CD.  It's a combination of their sad sounding and loud rock n' roll styles.  Otherwise the songs in this CD are pretty much divided into 2 categories which is how i usually classfiy Nirvana: Loud fast rock, or Slow quiet.  If you've never heard much Nirvana and would like to see how you like it I guarantee you'll like at least something on this CD.  If you're a fan of Nirvana already and don't already have it, you're insane.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This cd is a wonder cd. The music is exciting and calming.. good for any mood ..deppression,happiness,pissed, or whatever...My Chemical Romance made a kick ass cd that you can listen to forever and never get bored of plus My Chemical Romance is a great band to see live.
B000003TAB|4.0|I think this is probably Nirvana's worst.  For some reason 3 is always the worst.  At least 99% of the time.  Check it out if you'd like.  In movies and music.  The third movie or third album.  With all three of my favorite bands the third album is the least.  That is System of a Down, Gorillaz, and Nirvana.  Anyway this has some very VERY uneven stuff on it.  Kurt doesn't always sound like himself.  There's 6 different band members spanning the recordings which range over a long period of time.  Big Long Now is probably the best song on here IMO.  It's one of their slow quiet + rock n' roll.  Sort of like Lithium, but less commercial.  I say if you're a casual fan you can get this.  You don't need to be hardcore or anything.  If you don't really know Nirvana and you get this you might be a little confused.
0792844882|3.0|Ok so we all know this film isnt oscar material or anything, but its got a very sexy appeal to it. The movie (made back in 1995) was given horrible reviews and poor Elizabeth Berkely was slaughtered for her portrayal as Nomi, even though in all honesty I really didnt think she was too bad! The movie may as well be classfied as porn, in my video store its under 'erotic thriller', but even so I love this movie! So many classic quotable moments and hilarious scenes, I would classify this as a comedy rather then porn. Despite the negative reviews this movie has a cult status and i consider it a classic. Its got the whole 'Its so bad its good' concept working for it, and i think it works pretty well. The film has a somewhat decent storyline, good acting (i think anyway) and VERY is well cast (Elizabeth Berkly and Gina Gershon have very sexy chemistry), the dialouge is at times laughably bad but it makes for good quoting as its so funny, a golden scene is when Nomi is showing off her new 'Versace' HAH! So all in all this films allright, good for a laugh.
B0000035E7|4.0|If you're just gonna pick up a Nirvana CD to have some of their music in their library than this isn't for you.  Don't expect Nevermind or In Utero here.  You can tell that this is very experimental and raw.  The only song I find very unique and outstanding is About a Girl.  It sounds like a Beatles song, but that doesnt' detract from it.  Recommended to fans of Nirvana.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is truly a magnificent film, my all time 2nd fave. Upon first viewing i wasnt familiar with Lynch's work, that is to say I didn't know anything of his films, I went in to watch this film as it were made by any other director, and that is why i got utterly confused. When the credits rolled I was left scratching my head. Intially I shrugged it off and just thought it was a strange film that has no intention of making any sense what so ever. One night I looked up the movie and read all the raving reviews that It had gotten, I decided that a movie that didnt make any sense couldnt have possibly been given such good reviews, so I decided to dig futher and figure out the film. After reading many theories and clues etc and re watching the film many times I now feel like I have an understanding of it, I think It's amazing how you really can dig deep into this film and find out exactly why every little scene is significant and that everything has a meaning, David Lynch is definetly an amazingly talented director. This film is stunning in every aspect and everytime you watch it you discover something new, many people will watch It once and critise It as they wont understand and wont put In the effort to figure it out, and I think thats a shame because once you have an understanding of the film I feel you can really appreciate It. This is truly an amazing film and after seeing this I feel like I simply must see the rest of David Lynch's work, and I only hope It Is as good as Mulholland Drive.
B000003TAR|5.0|First of all this isn't a PA CD even though it says \\"[EXLICIT LYRICS]\\".  Rape Me is pretty much the only song that would merit a PA.  Anyway this is by far Nirvana's 2nd best CD.  If you just wanna get a Nirvana CD to have a Nirvana CD it's either Nevermind, or this.  All Apologies if my favorite song on here.  It's a slow soft with a good tune.  Other songs you've probably heard are Heart Shaped Box and Rape Me.  Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle is also a great song dispite the strange title.  This CD is worth up to $20 IMO becuase it's very good, but I doubt you'll have to pay that much, as it came out in like 1993 or something.
0440180295|3.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a pretty good book.  It is also a tough read, though. I was thrown off of the main storyline of the book many times, by its random skipping to different people and time periods. <br />  I was kind of confused, especially at first when Vonnegut changed from talking about himself to talking about Billy.  All together it was an interesting book with a generally interesting story.  Although, it was a good storyline, I am still brought back to the fact that it was overly confusing to me.  Another part that confused me a lot was when Billy was drugged and then woke up after the war.  This was then followed by Billy waking up back in the war.  The book has a lot of random time skipping, which bothered me and sort of made me not want to read it.   <br /> While the skipping around and general disorder of the book threw me off and turned me away, I stayed with it because of its general nature.  It is a World War II story, and I love reading about World War II.  That was probably the only thing that kept me reading it.  Another thing that I did like was the way that he made war seem almost stupid and he said that there was nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.  That caught my attention probably more than any other lines in the book.   <br /> All in all I would have to say that I would not recommend this book to someone who doesn't like trying to figure out writing that is confusing, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about World War II.
B0000029DD|5.0|An untimely death often leads to an unjustified glorification of an artist's life. A mediocre artist can become a significant figure in musical history. <br />One man who deserves all the praise that is bestowed upon him and much more is Jeff Buckley. <br />Grace goes beyond the traditional boundaries of rock music. Buckley's powerful vocals, creative arrangements and mysterious lyrics make this album the timeless classic that it is. <br />His music is so extraordinary, in fact, that it's impossible to put this album on in the background without being drawn into its psyche. <br />Tracks like mojo pin, grace, lover you should've come over and lilac wine are enchanting and their lyrics are poetic. <br />Dream brother, the last song on grace, is by far the best. Buckley's enchanting vocals and exceptional guitar work make up the perfect end to the only studio album he ever made.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Who knew that merging two totaly different but classic bands like Soundarden and Rage Against The Machine would result in one of the best albums and bands of the last 15 years? Not me, I know that much. Tom Morello's revolutionary guitar playing complaments Chris Cornells vocals perfectly. The rythem section is one of the strongest I have ever, ever heard. One of the best touches on the album are the biblical lyrics used by Cornell through out.<br /><br />The Album opens with one of it's strongest songs, which was also the bands first single 'Cochise' filled with a hard hitting riff and vocals that could peal paint of the walls! the intro leads onto one of the best hard rock songs you have ever heard. Next is what I concider to be the best best song, well so far at least. 'Show Me How To Live' is a hard rocker with a killer chorus. \\"Nail in my hand from my creator, You gave me life now show me how to live\\" I mean what better lyrics have you ever heard?? Truly one of the all time best songs I have ever heard! 'Gasoline' is next. There is nothing very special about this track but it is still a really good song, just nothing two original. 'What You Are' from what I have read has gotten mixed reviews but I love it. The lyrics are really cool and they are about getting out of a distructive relationship. Cornells vocals sound really cool during the ore chorus. Also any true guitar player or just fan of Morello will love his chord voicings and progressions on this track. Next is probley the hardest and heaviest song on the album, 'Set It Off' is such and awesome song. The drumming on this song is really cool. I love the lyrics to this one, I remember hearing that they were about a battle during biblical times but Im not sure which one, but anywys the point is that this is a really rockin' song. I havent met anyone who didnt like the next track. 'Shadow On The Sun' has all the right ingrediants to be a killer song. compelling lyrics, awesome chorus, change in mood and tempo, amazing guitar playing from another world and a rythem section that will blow your mind. This is easily the second best song on the album. 'I Am The Highway' is a slow acoustic ballad. One of the best songs on the album if you ask me. 'Exploder' is such a cool song. Chris Cornell has such an amazing voice. It is not even fair how good this man's voice is, I got chills up and down my entire body the first time I heard this song. The next song 'Hypnotize' is a pretty cool song every once in a while, but it's not something I can see myself skipping ahead to hear or wanting to hear more then one time in a row, ever. The next couple songs are kind of boring and well relly not that good. Tom Morello plays a reall guitar solo on one of them (without effects mind you) but its really bad. 'Light My Way' is the last good song on the album and boy is it good. The biblical lyrics are amazing, it could almost be concedered a worship song. Once again Cornells voice gives me the chills, every time I hear this song I stop what I am doing and just listen, I love this song and so will you. The last few songs are just filler.<br /><br />After reading my praise of this album how can you not want to go out and buy it???? This is truly a five star album, even though it has a few dull moments the rest of the album more then makes up for any missteps they made during the making of this. So do yourself a favor and buy this soon to be classic album.po, amazing guitar playing from another world and a rythem section that will blow your mind.

B00005JNQQ|5.0|We went to the movie today and with the ratings in Amazon, I expected a less than steller movie.  We loved it , my 4 and 6yr were both glued to the screen.  Ignore the poor ratings, we will buy the DVD when it comes out.   <br /> <br />Clean fun, but some humour for us adults as well...  Take your family, they will enjoy it.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|To quote a line from the mighty \\"Lochness\\" (track 10): \\"This LEGEND lives through centuries evoking history's memories\\". <br /> <br />This is undoubtedly one of Priest's finer efforts.  The sound quality is fantastic.  The production: spot on, hands down -superb (Roy Z).  <br /> <br />The two stellar tracks are, without question \\"LOCHNESS\\" and \\"HELLRIDER\\".  Other standouts include \\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Wheels of Fire\\", \\"Demonizer\\", and \\"Angel\\".  The only two tracks that really don't fit are \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Worth Fighting For\\". <br /> <br />Remember, you just can't beat that age-old recipe of the twin-turbo axe attack of Tipton/Downing and the commanding vocal presence of Rob Halford.  This recipe is the foundation of true metal - it can't be copied. <br /> <br />Buy this CD (limited edition version).  As a matter of fact buy 2!!! Twenty years from now you'll be able to sell an unopened copy of \\"Angel of Retribution\\" on EBAY! <br /> <br />Hopefully, the winey, grungey, \\"can't sing\\" 90s alterna-punks will learn a lesson from these metallic masters.  This is how it's done, folks!

B00004RFCM|5.0|Great show!  I am a 22 year old male who for the past three or four years have sneered at Sex and the City, even though I knew many woman, men and even my dad who were all addicted to.  I just couldn't buy the hype, finally I was home one night about a month ago and I caught an episode on TBS and I was completly blown away!  The writing was so smart, and the show was just really funny and intriging. Having no idea which season I was in I began watching episodes and becoming familar with charecters such as the lovely ladies and Mr. Big, so I did the only logical step and I bought the first season, which was awesome! It is a great show for the cynic or the hopeless romantic, dealing wit the politics of what else...sex and the city!  Also if your familar with the New York scene you can completely relate. Great show, I'm so glad I didn't become a fan untill all the seasons were out on DVD, now I don't have to wait!
0975991477|3.0|Dr. Lipton writes in a simple and fascinating fashion within his field - that of cellular biology. When I had finished reading his book, I was absolutely convinced that he is on the right track in his analysis of how we perceive and function. However, he didn't complete the book by telling one how to unleash the \\"powers\\" available. See Rob Williams work for that! <br />An excellent work on biology - with little to do with self-help.  <br />
B000053GTK|5.0|5   Stars says  it all. Probably the best progressive band of all time. I never got a chance to hear them live and only recently (last 10 years) really got to appreciate this band. I own 8 of there CD's and plan to purchase the rest.Glad I purchased this one.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a wonderful movie - sweet, touching, evocative and imaginative. It's not a blockbuster kind of movie, but it will stand the rest of time. Years from now, when many of today's hit movies may be viewed as quaint and laughable, this movie will still be enjoyed.  <br /> <br />This is the movie version of the events that inspired J.M. Barrie to write the classic play, \\"Peter Pan\\", over one hundred years ago.  <br /> <br />James Barrie [Johnny Depp] was a popular British playwright. He was devastated when one of his plays flopped. Soon afterwards, in a London Park he frequented, he met a remarkable family - Sylvia Llewlyn Davis [Kate Winslett] and her four young boys, Jack, George, Michael and Peter. James had a childless, loveless marriage with Mary [Radha Mitchell]. Sylvia was a widow. Though the movie doesn't say so, I assume she had had a joyous, loving relationship with her dead husband.  <br /> <br />Barrie was well off. Sylvia was poor, although she came from a wealthy family, headed by her dominating mother [Julie Christie]. As Barrie bonded with Sylvia and her boys, his imagination began to create Peter Pan, Neverland, and its inhabitants. The movie shows the process of Barrie's imagination to great effect. <br /> <br />I have read that the movie is not historically accurate because it does not put some events in correct chronological order. This fact may bother historians, but it shouldn't deter most moviegoers who have little knowledge of Barrie's life to begin with.  <br /> <br />As always, Depp gives an amazing performance. Like the movie, Depp will be remembered fondly years from now. Like Hepburns Katherine and Audrey, Bette Davis, Spencer Tracy, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, among others, Depp has a gift for acting that transcends time.   <br />
1582432678|3.0|This novel rang false for me.  The narrator herself speaks like a Brit, in fact her distance and disdain for American culture kept reminding me that the writer must not be native born.  No one here has yet asked, why did she create the protagonist as Armenian?  So the past can be counterpoint to the present?  For me, the portrayal of the protagonist as an ethnic minority was absurdly shallow, represented occasionally by forkfuls of food. <br />Was her point that both parents refused to see the danger signals?  More like red alerts, and at some point the story loses all plausibility, but the reader must read to the end to see how it is resolved, or not. <br /> <br />For a brilliant, nonfiction look at sociopaths, read Gad Czudners \\"Small Criminals Among Us\\"  or \\"Without Conscience\\" by Robert Hare.
1400031567|4.0|This is my first Mankell novel, and I enjoyed it greatly!  It is a marvelous police procedural that skillfully presents the perspective of both the police and the perp, and includes a prelude that initially seems to be in another universe but is nearly tied back to the main story.<br /><br />The novel reminds me in structure and and direction of the John Sandford \\"Prey\\" novels.  Both feature a career policeman who faces horrendous crimes and addresses the matter through the eyes of the investigator and the investigated, with the policeman having a stable cast of trusted coworkers plus a somewhat uneven private life.<br /><br />Excellent book-looking forward to reading more of Mr. Mankell's books.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I remember seeing this on a huge screen when it first came out when I was ten years old.  It was an amazing and dazzling experience.  The mix of animation and live action was miraculous. While it is hard to understand today, the songs from the movie were actual hits that you could listen to on the radio.  Not only did we listen to them, we sang them!  Every kid had to learn how to spell supercalifragilisticexpealidocious!  We even had a game to see how many words we could spell from the letters in the word.  What a total movie experience!<br /><br />Seeing it again on this DVD, on a much smaller screen, was still quite amazing.  I am almost shocked how well it has held up after forty years.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are stunningly good.  I appreciate the parents, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns (George and Winifred Banks) much more now than I did as a child.  They give very fine performances.  Karen Dotrice and the sadly late Matthew Garber as the adorable Jane and Michael Banks are still treasures.  And who can forget Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, or Arthur Treacher as Constable Jones, or Hermione Baddeley as Ellen, or especially Jane Darwell as the old bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.<br /><br />The movie holds up solid as a rock.  The images, songs, dance numbers, and even the acting are all top notch and permanently enjoyable.<br /><br />The DVD also has some nice extras.  There is a nice piece with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and Richard Sherman reminiscing about the movie.  Another is an extended show on the making of the movie.  Richard Sherman also performs a deleted song, \\"Chimpanzoo\\".  I agree that it wouldn't have belonged in the movie, but it is a charming show tune.  There are several more extras, but you get the idea.  This collection is a fine value of a great and timeless gem of Disney Magic.
B0002S94OS|3.0|This album is solid in all but one area. VOCALS.  They are pointless.  It sounds like someone belching over the entire cd.  <br />After all the obvious work put into the music, the vocals just scar it.  The content also displays an extreme lack of knowledge.   I am just discovering this band, and I am very impressed with the creative writing,  but dissapointed that they have to hire \\"contractors\\" for the occaisonal solo. <br />If you are politically aware,  this cd may irritate you.  However, if you can look past the vocals (both content and sound) there is brilliant writing going on here.  I suppose their music would be better without singing. (or belching)   <br />One more thing.  I tought the palaces cd was mixed perfectly.  This new cd has the vocals up a notch, and the guitars down a notch.  This only makes the problems with this cd worse.   <br />
B00005JNSK|1.0|Though Tim Burton is a great director of magical movies and Johnny Depp is a terrific actor you cant beat an all time classic at all. the original will always be better because it was great, a remake would be pointless. But I haven't seen it so it could be good but not like the original.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|This film was incredibly touching, full of wonder and innocence, fun and imagination. I can't stop watching it, and loving it.  <br /> <br />Find out for yourself by watching, and believing.
B0002DB52M|4.0|I heard some reviewers call this film anti-American. I didn't find it that way my self. I'm not American though. I think this could really depict any small, isolated community in the world. Yes the bare set was a little disconcerting, but it didn't bother me, it seemed like watching a play in my opinion. There's not much of a script either, but the narration by Jonathan hurt helps this film along. The basic plot of this film is: A young woman named grace stumbles across a sleepy town known as Dogville. She's on the run from the mob and willingly offers her services to the town in exchange for sanctuary there. Grace tries hard to please and gradually the reluctant townsfolk warm to her and take her in. This works great at first, and everyone agrees that the town is better off with her. Gradually however the townsfolk load more and more onto grace and seeing as she never retaliates or shows any anger or discomfort, they slowly take advantage of her more and more. In the end she is practically a slave and also serves as the local whore to all the men in the village as well. She is also chained to an anvil to prevent her escape. She is abused, manipulated and mentally tortured until it appears that she has decided to sacrifice herself completely. I liked this film because I can totally understand where she's coming from. Let me explain. When I was 8 my mother moved us to Tenerife, which is a little Spanish island of the coast of morocco. I was immediately sent to school, where I was bullied and shunned by the entire class. Even by the teachers, whose punishment included kneeling on a cold floor for half an hour etc. You have to understand that it was a very backwards island educational wise. Despite everything, I tried my hardest to be nice and helpful. I never retaliated and put up with their physical and mental abuse for 4 years. I let them walk all over me. It was (like in this film) a very close-knit community that disliked outsiders. Even though I was much taller then them and could have easily pummelled them one by one I was determined to get them to like and except me. Well it never happened and I was forced to leave, but looking back at it now, having been through quite a lot, would I have liked to have all those people that took advantage of me and my feelings killed? Well...yes. In fact if the whole island sank back into the sea I would be ecstatic. So as you can imagine I really enjoyed the end when Grace realizes that some people just can't be saved and orders the whole town to be extinguished and the residents shot. She tried to fool herself into thinking that it wasn't their fault that they were the way they were, that they were just victims of circumstance, which is what I used to tell myself all the time. Kind of like a bad dog, blame the owner right? It doesn't stop the need for the dog to be put down though does it? No, and that's what happens here. I give it 4 stars because I don't think it could stand up to repeated viewing. Thanks for reading.

B0007DAZW8|2.0|Daft Punk were on a short list of groups that I would not hessitate to purchase without a preview listen. They are now off that list.  There is about enough original material here to construct one of their usual songs.  Next time I'm in Paris, I may swing by their studio to get my $13.99 back. <br /> <br />This album and the Chemical Brothers' plodding Push the Button were huge let downs from an increasingly stale electronic scene.
0385505833|5.0|Because of all the years I was made to \\"do Christmas\\" a certain way, I could relate to this marvelous story of trying to get away with skipping the whole thing. I never would have believed John Grisham came up with this, and in such a wonderfully humorous way.........and he kept it out of the courtroom! I had friends who read the book who didn't realize that Mr. Grisham was the author! The story and its subsequent chaos builds into a frenzied crescendo, and you keep wondering what will happen next right up to its conclusion.  Enjoy, and many kudos to John Grisham....encore! Encore!
0345440900|1.0|I heartily agree with the other reviewer who pointed out that this book is awful for babies with colic.  She fails to address the issue at all, claiming that babies with colic are in pain and that's it. <br /> <br />Furthermore, my take-away from this book is that although she states that a crying baby does not mean a bad parent, everywhere throughout the book she implies that if your baby cries, you are a bad parent.  I also found her categorization system for babies ridiculous.  She lists five \\"types\\" of babies, three of which sound unpleasant (touchy, spirited, and grumpy) and asks you to categorize your baby accordingly.  My experience in reading this book was to discover that my baby is unpleasant (according to the author) and that I am a bad parent. <br /> <br />As the parent of a young baby who was colicky and is now somewhat fussy, I found this book to be deeply depressing.  DO NOT READ THIS for help if you are in the middle of coping with your colicky baby.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I was sooo sissapointed the first time i've heard this album, but now I'm totally addicted. <br /> <br />Great job Josh!!!
B0006U4UAU|4.0|This CD really makes me move.  I love most the songs here, but my only problem is that I find myself changing songs in the middle because eight nine and eleven minutes for a repetetive dance punk song is way too long.  The second disc with the DFA singles suffers the most from repetitive progression, but there are still some choice tracks.  I fill they should release more of these with a radio edit, Daft Punk Playing at My House Radio edit is perfect example.   <br /> <br />Overall I really really like these guys.  I love James Murphy and his brainchild DFA, and The Rapture.  He knows how to make and produce music that is both fun, intense, and smart with a dance rock edge.  At times this CD can rock your socks off with great dance riffs, but once again, i very rarely can listen to evey song all the way through before switching it. <br /> <br />Best tracks: daft punk is playing at my house , Too Much Love, Movement, Disco Infiltrator, Give It Up, Tired, Yeah (Crass Version).  Beat connection would almost be a classic but it wears itelf thin by the 5 minute mark.  But for those who like their dance music throbbing and long, this will not bother them.  Overall a very good album.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Hi teenager,<br /><br />  You asked what song plays in the background when lucy liu and uma thurman fight in the snowy garden, the one that sounds like hands clapping? It's featured on the soundtrack: Santa Esmeralda (ft. Leroy Gomez) - Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. Great song. Enjoy!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Whoever was concerned what a post-Oliveri \\"QOTSA\\" would sound like need fear no more:  the future is here and it's solid.  There is a deceptive \\"easy\\" quality to the work, but trust me it is deceptive.  Repeated listenings of \\"Lullabies\\" reveal a growing \\"adult\\" quality to the Queens work, but the intensity that attracted so many fans is still at work here and Homme and Company give everything they have to the project with the ensuing result being:  one of the best rock albums to come out this year.  (Granted, the year is still young, but my comment about \\"Lullabies\\" will be just as valid come December.)      Even more, unlike other \\"QOTSA\\" that held (in my humble opinion) a few misses as well as hits, there isn't a single bad moment on \\"Lullabies.\\"      Although everyone is saying this isn't a concept album, \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" has a strong feeling all the way through it that make it nearly impossible not to want to listen to the entire thing.  Over and over.  A+ Effort!
B000002TP7|3.0|This one can't really seem to decide if it wants to be 70s pimp movie music (most of the instrumentals), hardcore (\\"Tough Guy\\",\\"Heart Attack Man\\"), old school party rap (\\"B-boys makin' with the Freak Freak\\") or some sort of groundbreaking conscious rap (\\"Bodhisattva Vow\\",\\"\\"The Update\\").<br /><br />Best tracks here are mostly the singles: \\"Sure Shot\\", \\"Root Down\\". and \\"Sabotage\\". Of the instrumentals, \\"Eugene's Lament\\", a highly dissonant trainwreck with atonal violin screeching, is the most interesting although not necessarily one I'd like to hear often. \\"Transitions\\" is the most listenable sounding like some lost score track to a blaxploitation flick.<br /><br />Worst here are usually the instrumentals..most simply aren't that interesting, as well as the preachy tree hugger/one world rant \\"The Update\\".
6305696071|5.0|A absolutely great movie. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have an amazing on screen chemistry that make this movie a winner. A must see.
B000001TVD|4.0|I dig this album and am a huge fan of Eddie Hazel's guitar playing (I just got his solo LP \\"Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs\\" and it's awesome), but I don't fully comprehend the gushing on this page about his \\"Maggot Brain\\" solo.  Yes, it's intense and has its share of breathtaking moments, but to say it's better than anything Jimi ever recorded is just silly.  For proof, I would point listeners to the Band of Gypsys LP, where Jimi's fiery \\"Machine Gun\\" performance pretty much decimates anything played before or since on electric guitar.  Eddie's playing here lacks the incredible tone and intricacy of Hendrix's latter-day work.  The sheer range of sound Jimi conjures from his instrument is unparalleled.  Just my two cents, but there you go... (I even prefer Michael Hampton's take on \\"Maggot Brain\\" from the \\"One NAtion under a Groove\\" LP to this... let the flaming begin.)
B00080Z53O|5.0|Having just seen this marvelous Spanish film (in Phoenixville, of all places, home of The Blob), I am entirely moved by the passionate sympathy brought to all sides of the euthanasia issue by this extraordinary writer and director. I'm completely unfamiliar with anything else he has filmed, but shall pursue his films more arduously based on how wonderful is this one. <br />In the heat of the Terry Schiavo fury surrounding that poor soul and her family and her husband, this film is certainly topical, but it would resonate even if the Bush Fascists weren't trying to ramrod their putsch down the throats of one and all. <br />This is the story of a man who has become quadripelegic as a result of a swimming accident, and now in his middle age would like to end his life. He has been a burden to his family, though they fulfill their care for him with great love and devotion. He is a source of hope for a lonely woman, and then falls in love with the lawyer who seeks his judicial approval. All of the emotions you could possibly summon are on display here through the dynamics of the various relationships. There is a sanctimonious priest who initially comes off as absurd, but then quite comically reaches a sympatico with the protagonist, not that he endorses the request for euthanasia, just the two men come to understand each other without any malice. What a concept, eh, all in its own right.... <br />The older brother can not agree with his younger brother's decision because in his heart and soul he is convinced that for all that he gave up, he'd continue to do it to care for his brother because it is the right thing to do. The protagonist wants someone to love him just enough to release him from his bonds.  <br />The music is enchanting and haunting, with the plaintive gaita of Suzanne Seivanne and Carlos Nunez on the score. The scenery of Galicia, the Celtic part of northwestern Spain, is beautiful. The acting is sublime. You will talk about this movie a lot. Its even handed treatment of the moralities involved is unblinking and compassionate and so this is a film to watch with your family, well, maybe not the kids, but anyone with whom you will be making decisions about yours or their care as Bush strips away the safety net for all Americans under a certain income level.
0887307280|4.0|This book is an excellent book for changing mind-set of business owners. The book starts by describing many problematic areas that small business owners may have especially those owners whose background are not in the business but more technical oriented. Then, the book stresses the importance of developing a solid system, where the business process are well designed, and thought-of. <br /> <br />As a business owner myself with a technical background, I found it to be a fun book to read. It requires technician-type owners to think more on the business side rather than technical side. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a mind-set change. <br /> <br />However, this book focuses more on business systems, processes and management, it does not provide systematic suggestions or solutions on marketing or sales, which I believe small biz owners need most. Also, this book uses too many stories to illustrate just one idea, which is too wordy.  <br /> <br />All in all, this book worth its value. With its price just a little over ten bucks, this book can change the mind-set of a technician-type biz owner, and possbily benefit or even re-shape the course of your business in the future.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Simon Pegg ( \\"Spaced\\", \\"Hippies\\" ) stars as Shaun in this black comedy/zombie gore-fest. After Shaun's girlfriend leaves him, he realises how miserable his life is and decides to change things around. Unfortunately, the dead have decided to roam to earth for a bit, devouring human flesh and what-not, which makes things tricky for him. <br />    \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a wonderfully written, well directed tribute to old zombie movies such as \\"The Evil Dead\\" and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". And a tribute it is too, as opposed to an all-out spoof. The zombies act like real zombies, and the humour comes from the actors. <br />    The DVD itself is brilliant. It's packed with special features such as outtakes, deleted scenes, comics, featurettes and four different commentary tracks, all on one disc. <br />    \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is probably one of the funniest movies of 2004, and certainly a lesson to film-makers in compiling DVDs.  <br />
B00001QEE7|5.0|It's funny.  A list of some of my favorite movies include Fight Club (awesome) Gladiator (Epic)  Dogma (Funny, controversial, and FILLED with many \\"truths\\" (which many would beg to differ;)about religion)  The Nightmare Before Christmas (a work of true genius). But the movie that outshines them all in my eyes, includes Ariel?<br /><br />My first experience with \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was a Japanese Anime Version from the 70's,  her name was Marina, she was topless, and she died at the end of the story, but I was drawn to it, it was sad, but beautiful, love and devotion, and her willing to give up everything for love? I was 5 and I could see it- it was beautiful.  But when I was 8 or 9, My Mom bought disney's Bambi on VHS, and before it started, there was a preview for a new Disney version of the story I loved, the regular generic blonde haired Mermaid replaced with a spunky red head with a Purple SeaShell bra, and a singing crab? Disney had never let me down before, and I couldn't wait until I could see it. It was May or 1990 when the Little Mermaid hit VHS, and I was utterly captivated.  Not only did the story create a much happier ending (some literary fans may have been upset, but I LOVED it!) but where before there was just a Mermaid, Ariel became the object of my nine year old affection, and she still is (my wife isn't always happy with this, but she seems to understand)<br /><br />When I watch the movie now, I do realize that compared to the films that followed, the animation is a little lacking at times (very similiar to Disney's 80's Television animation)- but it still has that certain something. My favorite scene is during the Part of your World Reprise (when Ariel is watching Eric leaving after she saves him) and the look  in her eyes is unbelievable, along with the sound of her voice (Jodi Benson has one of the most beautiful voices in the world), you can see and hear the longing, the love, the obsession, it gets me every time, I know every word to every song, the animation, being handdrawn through almost the entire movie, makes it a piece of art, the songs are incompareable, and the story is purely Disney (meaning Disney in the Beauty and the Beast good way - not the Cinderella II, Tarzan and Jane way)<br /><br />Although the \\"Limited Issue\\" edition is a little lacking in bonus features, and by \\"little Lacking\\" I mean, \\"What? Not even a trailer?\\" It is an amazing presentaion of the film- crisp clear picture, Dolby Digital sound, enough to bring the experience, and help me relive that same feeling I had when I was 9 (wow- a little over 15 years ago)<br /><br />I'm hoping the other reviewers are right on the release date- the original Platinum Edition release was 2010 (back when the series first started)- then I heard 2008, now I hear 2006 (Oh PLEASE let it be so- I could just die!<br /><br />I think everyone from little girls, to little boys, to grown Men and Women should see this film! It single handedly led Disney into a new golden age! It's a classic, and a masterpiece, and to me, the greatest movie ever!y song, the animation, being handdrawn through almost the entire movie, makes it a piece of art, the songs are incompareable, and the story is purely Disney (meaning Disney in the Beauty and the Beast good way - not the Cinderella II, Tarzan and Jane way) <br /> <br />Although the \\"Limited Issue\\" edition is a little lacking in bonus features, and by \\"little Lacking\\" I mean, \\"What? Not even a trailer?\\" It is an amazing presentaion of the film- crisp clear picture, Dolby Digital sound, enough to bring the experience, and help me relive that same feeling I had when I was 9 (wow- a little over 15 years ago) <br /> <br />I'm hoping the other reviewers are right on the release date- the original Platinum Edition release was 2010 (back when the series first started)- then I heard 2008, now I hear 2006 (Oh PLEASE let it be so- I could just die! <br /> <br />I think everyone from little girls, to little boys, to grown Men and Women should see this film! It single handedly led Disney into a new golden age! It's a classic, and a masterpiece, and to me, the greatest movie ever!
B000026C3T|5.0|Apart from a relatively cheap and obscure greatest hits package called 'Greatest Hits: 1969-1972', this was my first real taste of Led Zeppelin.  I first heard it as my uncle's house and was so excited that I asked for it for my next birthday.  That was some time ago now and Led Zeppelin has become my all-time favourite band.  If you are just being introduced to the band, I would say that this package is the perfect place to start.  It has everything the casual fans could ever want and more. <br /> <br />If you like this kind of music, these discs will probably have you rushing out to buy all of the band's albums like it did for me.  One of the many good things about 'Remasters' is that contains just enough material to placate the casual fan and not too much material to overwhelm them. <br /> <br />Start here and if you like what you hear, keep going until you have everything!
B000002HD5|5.0|drunk on whiskey, in the midst of an 8 year relationship falling apart - this is the best album of all time......
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Travis on Steroids is the best way I can describe Muse.  I am a fan of the Brit Rock/Pop from Coldplay, Travis, Oasis, Blur, Doves etc.  Muse has all the pieces of a successful British Band such as the above mentioned bands with the exception that they are much harder on the Rock side.  Its refreshing to hear wonderfully put together heavy guitar solos with the great ballads and songs on \\"Absolution\\" .  I admit that I had never heard of Muse until about two months ago.  I heard Hysteria on the radio.  Here in Dallas, TX we dont get alot new British rock on the radio, for the exception of some weekend radio shows.  I am now a fan of Muse and look forward to listening to their other album.

0596007124|5.0|This is a very suitable book for learning Design patterns. I have several patterns books and I think this is the most enjoyable book I have ever seen. You would not fall asleep reading this book.The code fragments are shown in such away to convey the idea across very nicely and with such clarity. I really enjoy the sidebar where the Pattern \\"Guru\\" converse with the \\"Grasshopper\\" student about pattern \\"truths\\". <br />Since I hold several graduate degrees, I have a lot of respect for authors who could assimilate complexities and then present them in a pedagogical way to help others, the \\"mere mortals\\" ,without resorting to using bombastic terms or words. This book certainly has achieved its objective really well. <br />I really look  forward to a sequel to this and maybe a \\"Heads First Web services\\" or \\"Heads First XML\\"?
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't think I can say much about this album that will fully articulate what an experience this is. When I first heard this from my cousin, I was absolutely blown away, not much has changed since then! <br /> <br />'Lateralus' is a stellar example of what progressive rock should sound like and Tool is one of those bands that always seems to be at the forefront of experimentation and boundary-pushing.  The music is hard, driving and unrelenting; but also reflective.  Like most of Tool's work, it left me completely drained.  It was worth it, though. <br /> <br />'Lateralus' is Tool's crowning achievement and it is a journey from one side of the universe to the other and back again.  What a way to start the new millennium!
0783225547|4.0|Dante's Peak is a good movie, not the best, but good. <br /> <br />The plot: Harry Dalton, volcano expert extroidinaire (Brosnan) comes to a town to investigate an \\"extinct\\" volcano, and tries to convince the town that the thing WILL BLOW at any moment before it's too late. I don't want to go too far into this, but that's pretty much it. There's also an underlying story of a relationship between Harry and Mayor Wando (Hamilton). <br /> <br />The good: The special effects are mind blowing. It's oh-so-realistic, and you've just gotta see it to believe it! The parts were believable and the acting was done very well (including the actors that played the mayor's kids, I don't know their names, but they had to have been young). The theme is even educational; I once aced a science test about volcanoes after watching this. Most of the scenes are incredibly innovative and unique, such as when they must cross the deadly, acid-filled lake before their boat dissolves (whew! suspense!). Even the score is good! <br /> <br />The bad: SOME parts of this movie are completely unrealistic. For instance, you cannot drive a car over a molten bed of lava, it's impossible for hot springs to heat up fast enough to instantly roast humans on the spot(the heating is over a few days; temps can't just skyrocket), and if a volcano expert tells you to stay in the boat to avoid contact with acid lake water, you stay in the *beep* boat!   <br /> <br />Suspend reality and don't ask too many questions, and you'll enjoy this natural-disaster wonder.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is a great album by Dire Straits, a real change in style after the earlier two albums. The style of guitaring changes dramatically on this one and the songs are longer and are catchy. <br /> <br />With the opener 'Tunnel of love' an amazing rocker, followed by one of the most beautifully written love songs ever 'Romeo & Juliet' the album more than pays for itself. 'Expresso love' and 'solid rock' are good rockers too. 'Skateaway' is another song with very interesting lyrics. This is my scond favorite Dire Straits Album after the first though it contains one of my favorites  in 'Tunnel of love'. <br /> <br />All in all, a great innovative album after 'Communique' which though a good album, did not show any innovation. <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater is one of the most talented and creative bands out there today and is one band that makes most mainstream metal look crappy.  Their 1999 concept album Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory represents all of the things that make Dream Theater as good as they are.  John Petrucci's guitar is nearly flawless with great solos and riffs all over the place.  John Myung's bass, well he can definitely hit those strings.  Mike Portnoy is one of the greatest drummers out there.  Jordan Rudess's keyboarding is amazing and to tie everything together, James Labrie can hit the highest of notes and his voice flows well with the music.  Here's a rundown of the tracks: <br />1. Regression (9/10) An acoustic piece and perfect intro that sets the general theme throughout the album. <br />2. Overture 1928 (9.5/10) A great instrumental that has one of Scene From A Memory's main musical melodies to it. <br />3. Strange Deja Vu (10/10) One of my favorites and one of the more happy songs on the album.  Similar to Overture 1928 except with lyrics to it. <br />4. Through My Words (8/10) This is a soft transition track to Fatal Tragedy. <br />5. Fatal Tragedy (10/10) A little darker.  This is also another of my favorites. <br />6. Beyond This Life (9.2/10) This is definitely a rocker and one of the longest tracks on the album. <br />7. Through Her Eyes (9/10) Another more soft tracks.  Has a female vocalist in the background kinda similar to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon Clare Torry. <br />8. Home (8.8/10) At times this song gets sort of weird.  It's the longest track on the album. <br />9. The Dance of Eternity (10/10) This 6 minute+ instrumental is very impressive.  Has everything from guitar solos to ragtime piano solos. <br />10. One Last Time (10/10) This one's a light rocker with a very melodic climax to it.  Another of my favorites. <br />11. The Spirit Carries On (9.3/10) This is another softer song with lyrics that you can sing along to. <br />12. Finally Free (9.2/10) Basically sums up the whole album for you. <br />There you have it, Scenes From A Memory.  One of the greatet prog bands with one of their greatest albums how much better can you get?
B000001E3V|4.0|What a fine document of Clapton's playing in a live setting this is.  Even though Eric seems quite nervous at times, his graceful and fiery playing more than makes up for it.  In places, Clapton seems to attack the solos as if his life depended on it.   <br /> <br />The rest of the band functions as an incredibly tight unit in places and it makes me wish that Derek and the Dominos had managed to stay together for longer.  It makes me wonder how much better the show could have been with a little bit more practice. I think the vocal support given by organist/vocalist Bobby Whitlock is particularly beautiful. <br /> <br />I would say that this is a very worthwhile purchase and just another example of why Eric Clapton is so great.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|this hardly needs saying. if there is an album better than HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, i haven't heard it. bob dylan IS the greatest song writer in all of music, and this is his best album [though one could make a case for BLOOD ON THE TRACKS].  <br /> <br />if i'm being honest, \\"like a rolling stone\\", \\"tombstone blues\\", \\"ballad of a thin man\\", and \\"desolation row\\" are all in my top ten favorite dylan songs.  <br /> <br />from \\"like a rolling stone\\":  <br /> <br />You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat <br />Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat <br />Ain't it hard when you discover that <br />He really wasn't where it's at <br /> <br />from \\"tombstone blues\\":  <br /> <br />Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain <br />That could hold you dear lady from going insane <br />That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain <br />Of your useless and pointless knowledge <br /> <br />from \\"ballad of a thin man\\": <br /> <br />Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you <br />And then he kneels <br />He crosses himself <br />And then he clicks his high heels <br />And without further notice <br />He asks you how it feels <br />And he says, \\"Here is your throat back <br />Thanks for the loan\\" <br /> <br />from \\"desolation row\\":  <br /> <br />And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot <br />Fighting in the captain's tower <br />While calypso singers laugh at them <br />And fishermen hold flowers <br />Between the windows of the sea <br />Where lovely mermaids flow <br />And nobody has to think too much <br />About Desolation Row <br /> <br />. . .  <br /> <br />only the beatles and lou reed/the velvet underground have come close to making songs of this caliber.  <br /> <br />these are definitely not the only great songs on the album either. \\"it takes a lot to laugh . . .\\" is subtle, has wonderful imagery, and is quite beautiful; \\"from a buick 6\\" is funny and extremely rocking; \\"queen jane appr.\\" is just beautiful; the title track is a brilliant! brilliant! rocker; and \\"just like tom thumb's blues\\" is disjointed and vivid and personal and just great.  <br /> <br />if i could only have 1 album, this would be the album.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Between the barbaric violence depicted and the scenes of Satan and his legions, this movie puts the darkest aspects of Christianity's mythologies on stage for everyone to see.  Anyone who takes a child to see this movie should be arrested for child abuse because they will surely be scarred by the scenes of senseless violence and cruelty.  In  terms of plot and character development, this film fails on many levels.  I'm not sure exactly what message Gibson was trying to tell in this movie, but whatever it was, it didn't work and it didn't inspire me except to make me want to avoid this movie with like a plague.
0060934913|5.0|If you are a food arts fan, you'll love this book.  Anthony Bourdain is witty, self effacing, clever, and most of entertaining.  He uses his own life experiences to captivate you and drag you into his world.
B000002UVX|5.0|By this point in his career, Jimi Hendrix had grown tired of being more well-known for his showmanship and theatrics than for his music.  This record was his reply and was made because it was the most expedient way for Hendrix to resolve a contractual obligation from early in his career. <br /> <br />On New Year's Eve, 1969 and New Year's Day, 1970 Hendrix got together with drummer Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox to form Band of Gypsys.  From the first note played, it was down to business: creating some of the bluesiest, funkiest music ever recorded.  Jimi and the guys absolutely let loose; giving us soulful, funky jams with more serious and introspective lyrics.  This is just the kind of environment in which Hendrix could fully explore a new musical direction -- a direction that both paid homage to Hendrix's musical roots and pointed things in a totally different direction. <br /> <br />An incredibly powerful listen -- this is what Jimi Hendrix was truly capable of!  You have to listen!
B0001CCXY8|3.0|I tried hard to like this album, because I have been a fan of CC for about 2 years now; But let's face it, CC are definitely NOT the most groundbreaking, innovative, daring, or varied musicians. They've stayed true to their formula of gore-obssessed, fast, technical, brutal death metal their whole career. I respect that, but I can only take so much of the mindless technical wankery and redundant lyrical content that has plagued every CC release since \\"Gallery of Suicide\\".  <br /> <br />This isn't totally a bad album though. There are some nice grooves found throughout, mainly on \\"Decency Defied\\" and \\"Festering in the Crypt\\", my favorite track; But there are scarcely any nice rhythms that grab you by the throat and force you to headbang... The majority of this CD is mid-paced technical work, and a lot of faster sections that, quite frankly, come off as forced and sloppy. Sure, the savage, lightspeed riffs may grab you on first listen; but add the drums into that, and you are left with an indecipherable mess. It's a shame to see CC like this, because off al the musicians here are extremely talented... They're just heading their talents into all the wrong directions. Simply put, this album suffers from the typical DM crisis of \\"this is our (insert number here) album, and we're beginning to run out of ideas... Let's throw in a bunch of filler tracks and technical wankathons!\\" If they would trim some of the absurdly technical parts from this album and cut out some of the boring songs, this would easily be a 4-star album, maybe even a 5-star! \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" just failed to grow on me... A few good songs here and there, but somehow the whole level of musicianship seems sloppy here. This has all the traits of previous CC releases, but by now we've gotten tired of the formula, in all seriousness.  <br /> <br />In essence, this is most likely CC's weakest album, and isn't anything they haven't done before, unless you're a hardcore fan of the band. Only reccommended to the long-time fans of CC.  <br /> <br />Standout songs: Decency Defied, Festering in the Crypt, They Deserve to Die
B00005MCX3|5.0|growing up in the seventies near Glastonbury meant lotsa hawkwind. My school had regular trips to glastonbury,reading etc. For anyone who can recall the lovely Stacia doing her thing this album must bring a smile. We added a whole chapter to The legend of BeanzonToste, i've got it somewhere. <br />this is the quintessential hawkwind album, plenty of that ethereal space rock sound. The grill has it all from the pounding heavy metal of the earlier Space Ritual through to the gorgeous synth washed sounds that would define later works like spirit of the age. For an Hawkwind beginner i would suggest this album as a taster, although you can hear the newer direction that the band were heading in. Does anyone remember the Hawklords ?
B0002S94BG|5.0|Grace is one of the few albums that I have ever heard that I can truly say I think is perfect. Everything from the songwriting, the arranging, the playing, the vocals, the production, to the mixing and mastering was absolutely pristine. And it was originally produced mixed and mastered by andy wallace....  so why does it need to be remastered? I guess for the same reason starwars needs to be redone again....  Ha, ha, ha....  :))
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Imagine a wonderful film with no violence, no obscenities, and no torrid love scene...FINDING NEVERLAND proves that, yes, it still can be done successfully in this day and age and stand strongly against other films.<br /><br />Johnny Depp play the title role as the author of Peter Pan, struggling from writer's block after his last play flops.  Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, the widowed mother of 4 boys and head of the family who inspire Barrie to write Peter Pan.  Julie Christie is great as the grandmother you love to hate--fearful for her daughter's reputation, but also \\"protecting what she has\\" as she puts it during a strong talk with Barrie.<br /><br />The 4 young men who play the Davies brothers are especially impressive.  They look and act like brothers and hardly seem to be acting at all because they are so natural.  Note that all 4 of the boys lended their names to the story:  John (Jack) and Michael are Wendy's younger brothers, George is the father (and the oldest son), and of course Peter is the boy who refuses to grow up.  Legend has it that Barrie created the name Wendy and it was first heard in Peter Pan.<br /><br />Of course the stand-out young man is Freddie Highmore, who plays the young Peter from whom Barrie borrows the name of his title character.  I think we'll see great things from him in the future.  He'll be playing Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  Johnny Depp will be Willy Wonka.  These are great roles for Johnny, who seems to be defying aging himself.  Who knows how FINDING NEVERLAND would've turned out if Johnny Depp hadn't been cast as J.M. Barrie?  Fortunately, we'll never know.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman does a superb turn as Charles Frohman, Barrie's producer.  Of course, we all know that Dustin Hoffman can do anything onscreen, but it is fun to see him linked to Peter Pan once more after his hilarious turn as Captain Hook in HOOK, with Robin Williams.<br /><br />If differently cast, with different editing, this could've been a very boring movie.  It certainly doesn't play like most of the modern-day films.  Luckily for the viewers, it IS extremely well cast and well edited and you'll find yourself wanting to find Neverland again and again.rently cast, with different editing, this could've been a very boring movie.

B000000WJZ|5.0|I have always loved this album and wanted to write a review on it but i didn't wanna end up writing a subpar review of it that would make others think that i dont appreciate this album as much as i do. blah, blah, blah, i think too much <br /> <br />Anyway, here we go Siamese Dream is the best album of the last 15 or so years for sure.  Everything about it is great.  It has many different styles of songs, it has amazing guitars(lead and rhythm), its intros and outros are amazing, and the lyrics are equally amazing.   <br /> <br />What makes me appreciate the album even more is the fact that you can tell that Corgan put an ungodly amount of effort into making each of these songs.  All the layering of guitars, the back-up vocals, the interesting outros, and the overall catchiness of this album.  This is a must buy for any fan of alt. rock, rock, good guitars, or just music in general.  And please give it some time if you're initially turned off by Corgan's voice as many are. <br /> <br />soma, geek usa, mayonaise, and spaceboy are probably the standouts here, but every track is good. just as every pumpkins album is good. What can i say i am a sp freak. <br /> <br />But seriously listeners of all genres of music should give siamese dream a listen if they havent already.
1401301363|5.0|yet again another wonderful book from nigella. beautifully written, excellent artwork and more importantly the food is exceptional. currently working my way through it!! - everything made so far has been a triumph. my stomach highly recommends this book.
B000002OX7|5.0|All the greatest albums of all time have had one thing (if not more than one) in common: they have all inspired an emotion or two.  Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" sparked sadness and depression while the Sex Pistols classic \\"Never Mind the Bullocks\\" channeled rage, anger and revolution (to some extent). <br /> <br />\\"Who's Next\\" is no exception in this area.  Just take the album cover for example: four grown men pissing on some monument.  If this doesn't spark a chuckle or two, you are devoid of a sense of humor. <br /> <br />There's an emotion lacking in many rock albums, humor.  Well, \\"Who's Next\\" doesn't fail here, either.  \\"My Wife,\\" written by the late Mr. Entwistle.  It's quite the entertaing take on a raging wife who's chasing after a cheating husband. <br /> <br />But \\"Who's Next\\" doesn't just have humor.  There's also sorrow, regret and bitterness- all in one song.  The classic \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" (which limpbizkit later ruined) is easily a top 3 in the entire Who catalogue, and it didn't even appear on the original album.  \\"This Song is Over\\" also fits the said feelings. <br /> <br />\\"Who's Next\\" doesn't stop there either.  It also features hope and anthemic-type songs with the astounding opener \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and the bombastic closer \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" drum solo and all.  Both are also among the groups best work. <br /> <br />If you decided to disregard the entire above text, read this: this group is a SUPERgroup.  Pete is one of the best axemen of all time, John is superb on bass, and Keith pounds his kit as well as N. Peart and J. Bonham. <br /> <br />And, yes, the music matches the level of emotion and lyrics, and even enhances both.    <br /> <br />A must have for any rock fan.
B00005JMX6|3.0|After watching this movie, I realised how different it was from all the other teen movies out there. Although it does stick to the typical boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-wins-girl-back formula, there's a lot of twists, and nudity inbetween.<br /><br />Although the cast were a bunch of unknowns to me (although Elisa Cuthbert was previously in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her scene in Love Actually), I found myself identifying (not with the porn bit obviously) and liking them. Emile Hirsch, looks extremely boyish, and has a real baby face, but I was shocked in a couple of scenes that he has a really hairy chest and legs! From a guy that doesn't actually look like he could shave, he could rival Robin Williams in the body hair stakes! Ugh!<br /><br />While I wasn't overly keen on the front cover of this movie, as I thought Elisa looked quite strange, she surpassed herself in this movie, and definitely looks prettier than she does on the cover. And the outfits she wears are absolutely gorgeous! I want her wardrobe!<br /><br />I haven't seen Risky Business, which this movie is really similar too, so I can't really comment on the similarities - although I do want to see it now!<br /><br />I loved the character of Timothy Olyphant, nice one minute, nasty the next. I'd previously only seen him play Mickey in Scream 2, and I liked him in that too. I did not like Eli's character, and the extra feature dedicated just to him was so bad I switched it off.<br /><br />From a female's point of view, this film doesn't really offend that much, but it does make you feel really insecure about your body. There's lots in it for the guys - although just to ruin your fantasies, some of the bikinis were digitally removed. Not so much a film for a girl to watch, if you get an attack of the green eyed monster, or you just don't like watching other prettier girls parading about in not very much. However, the one sex scenes there is, is very subtle, and appears near the end. Unless you count the porn movie scenes on the TV. For guys who have a thing for Elisa, although being the focus of the movie, she spends an alarming amount of time not actually on screen. It's more a Boy Next Door movie!<br /><br />The extras are unsurprisingly dull - can't they think of some more interesting extras? There is a commentary by Luke Greenfield; trivia track (does anyone watch these?); Revealing the Girl next Door; photo gallery; 16 uncensored deleted/extended scenes, including the original ending; hilarious unrated gag reel; 2 provocative featurettes \\"A Look Next Door\\" and \\"The Eli XXXperience\\" and there's apparently an Easter Egg (ooooh, chocolate!) somewhere, but I have no hope of finding it.<br /><br />This is a film worth taking a look at, particularly if you like the teen movies, or if you're an adolescent boy. I'm the former, and this definitely surpasses other teen movies that are around at the moment.ount the porn movie scenes on the TV.

B0000YEEGM|4.0|Dustin Hoffman is so good in this, it has to be seen to be believed. He virtually disappears into the character of Raymond, and wows the audience. It must have taken a lot of work to play such a character, and other actors might have failed, but Dustin wins hands down. The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, is all spot on.<br /><br />This is not my favourite Tom Cruise performance, as he acts like a complete SOB in this, but it's great the way his character changes throughout the movie, and by the end, I like him a lot more. He's a real pain to his girlfriend, I would stayed well away from him if it was real, & I was her!<br /><br />I'm not so keen on the special edition of this movie, but at least I didn't spend money on it, I got it for Christmas. For the amount of time between the original release, and the special edition, they could have come up with a lot more. I hope the Titanic special edition isn't as disappointing as this. The extras only include: commentary by director Barry Levinson (who has a cameo as the psychiatrist determining if Raymond should stay with Charlie or not); commentary by screenwriter Ronald Bass; commentary by screenwriter Barry Morrow; featurette and deleted scenes. Not even a gag reel? I'm sure there were many slip ups made. The cover is also not the most inventive of covers I've ever seen. It's plain dull this cover.<br /><br />I definitely, definitely, definitely, love this movie, and I do tend to get a bit teary by the end of it, because I think Ray should have been allowed to stay with Charlie. But Dustin fought for the ending where Raymond goes back to Wallbrook, even though the screenwriters both wanted him to end up with Charlie. He thought it wouldn't be true to Raymond's character if they had him stay. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you give it a try at some point. You'll love it.
B0000524EM|5.0|I splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday (Devil's Night.) I wanted to have all three films available should I feel the need to watch them again. The concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to me- it seems to be the only kind that really exists....<br /><br />I wasn't dissappointed in this set. It contains all three of the \\"collectors series\\" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features. The profile of James O' Barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good. Plus, there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films.<br /><br />I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted. Sure, the original film is by far the best, almost supernaturally superior, but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Who ever said these guys are punk or this album then they should really do a head check. This is so mainstream its not even funny. Funnier is how these guys managed to sell themselves out and even being nominated. 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', who said this is the best song of 2004? If you did this is prolly the only record you bought thro out the year and the only tracked you played. Have em check what punk music is, go do your research and see if you can come with something else up.  <br /> <br />Wanna hear something more pathetic? Im gonna go see them live since my 14 year old cousin needs somebody to go with her. Hope somebody else volunteers. Damn!!!
0553212478|5.0|yes, yes, yes! This is what litterature is all about! Love, hate, life, death, good, evil. Not that the book in any way is trying to tell you what is what, quite the contrary, but it forces you to relate to the different characters one way or the other. And the language...shivers down my spine in excitement and joy! This book is the original story  about the creation destroying the creator, and with that in mind the clice&eacute;s are non-existant.<br /><br />I urge, oh I urge, anybody with an interest in big litterature to read this masterpiece. It's only about 200 pages, so it's a fairly quick read.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple's debut album is full of soul, jazz and spunk, good melody and a haunting voice.   <br />I'm pretty sure the first song I ever heard was \\"Never is a Promise\\" and it struck a quite a \\"chord\\" pun intended. <br />That is probably still my favorite song off of the album, however, \\"Sullen Girl\\" is up there too.  Then would come \\"Sleep to Dream\\".   <br />I love Fiona's \\"attitude\\", or perhaps world-view would be more appropriate.  She's my kind of girl.
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en can be legitimately labelled one of the most original classic serial killer films ever produced. It truly is a masterpiece in terms of depicting monstrous evil in the guise of religious righteousness against a backdrop of modern nihilism and human degradation.<br /><br />The film focuses on the seven deadly sins created in the 13th century by Catholic theologians as a method to teach virtue and the dangers of the individual relenting to their base desires. These sins are in fact extremes of natural human desires - hunger/gluttony, laziness/sloth, self-esteem/pride, sexual appetite/lust and so on.<br /><br />The film uses this notion of sin as a metaphor for modern society in general. Every scene is dark, degraded in appearance, raining - there is nothing in the story that provides the viewer with any contrast, that is hope, light or compassion. Se7en is intended to reveal the flipside to human nature in its extremes and how far we have dwindled as a civilization.<br /><br />Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is at the end of a long career as a police detective. He has seen human degradation in its many forms, and is finally only seven days away from his retirement. As a character, Somerset is cynical, wise about human nature, however is still effected by man's inhumanity to man. He wants to get out. Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young ambitious officer, newly transferred to the city and is anxious to make his mark. By contrast, Mills is excitable, emotional and takes the job personally. Together they find themselves in the wake of vicious and methodical murders, designed around the seven deadly sins. The killer is a man with tremendous will and patience, sometimes torturing his victims for days, and in one case, a full twelve months. These murders are exceptionally horrific because the killer wants to make a grand point, because he is preaching to the world about how far he believes we have fallen as a society, morally and ethically. In the killers mind, he believes we have dwindled so far and have become so apathetic, that we need to be literally shocked to our moral senses.<br /><br />In this special edition, included are deleted scenes and extended takes with Fincher commenting in the background. One of the more interesting additions is the commentary and creation of John Doe's notebooks. They were actually handwritten and drawn with painstaking precision. These extras accurately reveal the amount of detailed work that goes into creating a film of this high standard.<br /><br />Se7en is an exceptionally well-made film, and one of those pictures that can be viewed several times over the years to still find new aspects about it never seen before.rs mind, he believes we have dwindled so far and have become so apathetic, that we need to be literally shocked to our moral senses.  <br /> <br />In this special edition, included are deleted scenes and extended takes with Fincher commenting in the background.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I know there are a lot of people out there that haven't been pleased with the last few Green Day albums.   <br />If you are one of those people (I'm not personally, but I have a few friends who are), do not miss out on this album.  this is definitely the best record I have bought this year.  i was very skeptical at first, a little nervous, but I have listened to it a few times through now and I can say it was worth every penny. <br />\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is amazing, I would buy the album just for that.  i also love the song \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".
B00006V9A0|3.0|Why isn't Verse Choruse Verse on here as well as the Studio version of All Apologies. I also think Polly should have been included along with Breed and On a Plain. If Kurt Cobain were alive this release would have never happened. This undermines Nirvana's legacy. Keep in mind the disc is also only 50 minutes long which means these other songs could have been included. I just don't understand some of the decisions that are made in the record industry. Thanks Courtney Love. Also, the remastering is too bassy and heavy. On a higher note bonus points for including the 1994 remix of Penny Royal Tea and the unplugged version of Man Who Sold the World.
B0006399FS|4.0|There's no question about it, U2 is making better music than ever before.  I have listened to the album for three months now, and I have settled on four stars for the great music, great inspiration, and only an average acceptance of the lyrics which aren't too different from most other U2 albums.  (I mean how many times is Bono going to say the words \\"tonight\\", \\"kneel\\", and \\"steal\\"!)   <br />     Aside from the redundant lyrics Bono presents, the album is another inspirational journey with awesome musical images and ideas, and better individual songs than any other album.  U2 may not be taking musical leaps like Pop, but what's wrong with perfecting an old sound?     <br />     For example, the melancholy joy on \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" paints just as good a picture of a nightime, weekend group of friends surrounded by a city like New York as the uplifting \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" paints a picture of a daytime, third world society surrounded by large landscapes.  Both are great songs.   <br />     \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is arguably a more solid song of a peoples' oppression than \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\".  Bono speaks directly to the opressor in a great flowing song.  I can't wait to see Edge break out the guitar on a live performance.  <br />\\"Bullets\\" has always been an awkward song title to sing, and the recorded song on The Joshua Tree album is forced. <br />     Speaking of forcing, crafting, and contriving songs...why is this such an issue for critics?...just listen to the album Boy.  Since the dawn of U2, they have been distorting the guitar sounds, echoing Bono's voice, and tweaking every sound possible.  Oh, and one other thing, back then they didn't play their instruments very well...just listen to \\"A Day Without Me\\".   <br />     U2 have come a long way musically.  Their awesome skills at crafting songs are no more evident than on the leap from album to album.  You can start at Achtung Baby and continue on to the sublime compilations of The Million Dollar Hotel Soundtrack and the Passengers Original Soundtrack, and then onto great songs on Pop like \\"Playboy Mansion,\\" \\"If God Will Send His Angels (single version),\\" and \\"Please\\".  Great songs, great lyrics, crafted to perfection.  <br />     One of the best lyrical songs on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is \\"One Step Closer\\".  It's a very mellow song in a similiar vain to \\"The First Time\\" off of Zooropa, but without the hidden messages.  The sound and lyrics flow smoothy, and death is a clear topic of the song.  Very mellow, and very good. <br />     U2 continues to get every fan to anticipate their next album.  Bono's lyrics may be a bit redundant, but there's no doubt the band's ideas and sounds keep getting better with time.
1591396190|5.0|Hi there <br /> <br />I've just read the book, and it certainely have put some thoughts regarding my own business in play. I can see a lot of similaries in the way BOS defines blue oceans, and the way we have behaved in the last 1 year, unaware what we vere doing. The BOS gives a great framework for analysing on going strategies, and gives ideas to refokus the strategy. the book is absolutely a must for business executives. I come in mind of another book in the same league, \\"Eating the big fish\\", which operates with some of the same thoughts. <br /> <br />Best regards <br />Ren C. Larsen <br />Denmark
B00005JN2Z|1.0|The fact that a hitman is driving around in a cab killing people is bad enough but dragging the cab driver around with him was stupid. This plot has so many flaws in it I can't list them all. Its described as a taunt drama between the two men, but its so stupid you cant get into it. Really bad theater bad. By the way Tommy crusie is way over rated as an actor he gets his roles based on his looks not talent.
B0006MT314|5.0|Even though this show is not my absolute favorite i bought the cd and love it. \\"when the stars go blue\\" is amazing! i was suprised at how great this cd is!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|A little over a year ago, I was introduced to a band called Muse from someone I know.  I had no clue who they were and had never heard of them before in my life.  It was like love at first sight.  Slowly, day by day I got more and more into them.  So I decided to get their first two albums.  Their first to albums are such a treat to listen to.  It's like candy to your ears and you just can't stop moving to the songs.   <br /> <br />I finally get Absolution, which is what made them \\"Popular\\" in the US, and by \\"Popular\\" I mean introduce them more like it.  What made this CD popular in the US was the song Time Is Running Out, the third track on the CD.  Don't judge the CD from this song because the cd is awesome as a whole.  It starts off with Apocalypse Please with the dramatic piano (Piano has been used for all the songs at the beginning of each album if you've noticed the trend).  Apocalypse Please is my personal favorite on the cd.  Well, I'm going to stop blabbering on about the CD so you can go out and buy it here or some other place.   <br /> <br />I really hope this review is helpful to many because you really should buy this album.  It will change your life!  Because it sure as heck did to me!  Thanks for reading.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I thought the movie was great! I really did not want to see Bourne Identity or Supremacy. It was hubby's turn to pick the movie and that is what we watched. I loved Bourne Identity and went and rented Bourne Supremacy the next day. <br />I like the fact that the movie was great without a lot of swearing or sex scenes. I thought they were both suspenseful and wonderfully made films.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Oh My. I have always been a Bill Murray fan. He's made many funny movies, many classics. Here I was expecting some comedy, maybe a little drama even. Two Words, Forget it. It is almost as if this movie were an actual attempt to deliberately avoid being entertaining. Its much like I would imagine sitting in a padded room for two hours. One thing this movie is chock full of, Melancholia. Perhaps that would have been a better title. I realize now the title \\"Lost in Translation\\" isn't referring to Bill Murray being in Japan at all, but rather the great divide between pretentious Hollywood elites and the average moviegoer...Do not even watch this movie to see why other people hate it, its so bad.. p.s. it doesn't really deserve a star but I must give it one to post this review.
B00006879E|5.0|I once thought this album sucked, until they started playing it on TV. Then it became great. It rocks, but is also very emotional! Therefore it is even greater!! I was talking about this great band at the mall and how emotional they are, until some poser with long hair came up to me and told me that they just force emotion in order to sell their music to girls. Needless to say he didn't have a clue what he was on about because he obviously doesn't watch MTV. And that's where all the good music is played (anything not on there sucks). You should buy this, but try to avoid all those lame hair bands (Van Halen were not cool), so-called \\"rock bands\\" (Led Zeppelin, Queen etc), classical garbage (Mozart, Paganini, Tchaikovsky etc) and anything that sounds like Dream Theater.
B00000FC5H|5.0|And if it doesn't, well, you might need to get an attitude check. Earth, Wind, and Fire take the rock/jazz combination popularized by \\"Chicago\\" and adds two new elements: danceable beats and a lot of soul. The big band (which always had around 8-10 members) produced many hit songs in the 70's and early 80's. This greatest hits album adds most of the greatest work by this awesome band. <br /> <br />The album is kicked off by \\"Shining Star\\", probably the song that they are most known for. The song has the perfect amount of everything: rock, jazz, soul, and dance. The album includes hit after hit after that. \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is a cover of the popular Beatles song, and is very well done. Earth Wind and Fire like the pop sensibilities that the Beatles had in their music early on, and have a lot of that sunshine, happy feel and melody to their music. \\"September\\" is the popular dance hit from the 70's, while \\"Sing a Song\\" will turn your gray skies sunny with it's happy beat and easy to sing refrain. The band can downplay the beat a little bit with the slower and more mellow \\"Can't Hide Love\\". The two biggest dance hits, \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" and \\"Let's Groove\\" of course are included as well. <br /> <br />The talent, soul, musicanship, and blending of many different styles make this an album of wonderful music. It's also proof that the insufferable 70's did produce some music outside of the Bee Gees and the Village People. Pick this album up today and feel the smile on your face widen.
B000002J03|1.0|The fact that people call this rubbish rock is a joke. The drummer is one of the worst ever, Page is a hippy who can't play and I'm sure the other 3 also suck. If you want REAL rock music then check out Jet, Kings of Leon or the Strokes. If you want something that rocks just as much but is heavier then go for Linkin Park. This is plain crap.
B00023BLXK|5.0|Personally I don't see why the critics said this movie was so bad because I absolutly ADORED IT! The story is cute and I must admit that Diego Luna is major eye candy! It's also fun seeing a cast of new actors instead of the same old same old actors. The dancing is so good that I started taking latin ballroom lecons because of it! A must see!
B000002H33|5.0|The best metal album metallica has ever done .My favorite songs on the album are MASTER OF PUPPETS and DAMAGE INC. Metallica definetly didn't sell out on this one.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|AMAZING!OUSTANDING!RENT IT!GOSH!<br />This was one of the best(yet pointless) movies I have EVER seen in my life! It's funny in many random ways but it still ROCKS! I bought it and kept on watching the seen when Napoleon says:Tina you fat lard come get some ham! Normal comedies would usually have plots,but not this one! It's about everything and nothing all at once! So what are you waiting for? Grab some tots,get comtfy and watch Napoleon Dynamite!!!
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining and touching and sometimes frustrating book.  What first attracted me to it was the basic premise...a mystery (the \\"murder\\" of a neighbor's dog) investigated by an autistic boy...told through the eyes of the boy himself.  Christopher, our narrator, is as unlikely a hero as you're going to encounter in a piece of fiction that isn't science fiction or fantasy based.   <br /> <br />Apparently Mark Haddon worked with autistic people for awhile, and his knowledge of their traits clearly informs the book.  It is a novel with a hero that is incapable of showing empathy or even sympathy for others.  He is totally self-involved and pretty well insulated.  Yet his unique humanity shines through.  What's also terrific in Haddon's approach is that while Christopher cannot really tell us what other people are thinking or feeling...we empathize with them anyway.  Whole pages of dialogue are given without any inkling from the narrator as to what tone of voice people are using, what their faces are showing (he doesn't like to even look at people's faces), etc...yet the crispness of the dialogue leaves no doubt.  We see through Christopher's blindness to the \\"normal\\" people beyond.  Yet we also buy into Christopher's world-view pretty easily, and we actually have a basic sense of how he needs to cope. <br /> <br />For example, when people try to touch Christopher, he may begin screaming or banging his head on the ground.  Imagine how embarrassing and frustrating this must be for his parents, how annoying or startling for those around him!  We can feel, as a \\"normal\\" person, that Christopher is frustrating kid.  Yet from Christopher we also know that he doesn't like to be touched, it's too much stimulus and by screaming or groaning or banging, he finds some escape.  And sometimes that escape can't stop because he doesn't dare risk stopping to see if he's no longer being touched, only to discover that he IS still being touched.  Hence, the screaminggoes on.  In Christopher's matter-of-fact manner, we see how he isn't really doing anything \\"wrong.\\" <br /> <br />The book really doesn't turn into much of a mystery about the death of a dog.  It's full of amusing or inciteful digressions...as Christopher shows us  how he can't understand things like facial expressions, but  is brilliant at turning everyday problems into mathematical problems.  I suspect he may be a \\"higher functioning\\" autistic person than most or many, but he has to be in order to write the book in the first place.   <br /> <br />Towards the later part of the book, Christopher takes an enormously brave journey, venturing into a world he knows virtually nothing about.  You can feel the fear in him, the isolation and the bravery.  And yes, even some pride.  It's a wrenching and dramatic final act, and at this point the book is pretty much impossible to put down. <br /> <br />The true story behind the story is the relationship of Christopher to his father, and to a few other key people in his life.  And when the end of the book comes, we find that we can actually be moved to tears by the events that have taken place.  It's a riveting and unique book.  There are a few casual bad words or phrases in the book (mostly Christopher seeing graffiti and reporting it to us) and thus I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under, say 15 or so...but I think it's brief enough, fast-paced enough, and just well-written and entertaining enough to be for almost anyone who enjoys reading.  <br />
B00003CXDG|2.0|since some wise guy has reviewed this as 4 stars 4 times in a row, and i think its worth 3, im gonna give this film two to balance it out. <br />    The plot is pretty weak, basically a scientist developed a virus called chimera, which he found kills red blood cells at an increasingly rapid rate, when tested on a patient,who died after 24 hours <br />    The fact that the virus comes into the hands of 'terroists'and they have to be stopped before it is unleashed on the world, already makes this film rather formulaic and unoriginal. <br />     All the gimmicky face changing doesnt add to the suspense, it just annoys the viewer, because its a easy way to create twists in a film with a weak plot. <br />     Theres a variation on the big rope drop into a computer room which was the main part of the first movie. From this point on theres a lot of action and killing of the bad guys, and it becomes obvious that John Woo knows what hes doing in this respect. <br />     Finally Tom cruise should be praised for the stunts he performs in the movie, the mountain climbing sequence and the motorcycle showdown are both top class stunts. <br />     So overall, youre looking at a film with patches of shooting and fighting action mixed in with a dull script and uninspiring acting performances. Go see the first one if you want a proper storyline.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I am not a big fan of this type of music. As a matter of fact there is really no classification for these guys. Emo, prog, punk,....what are they??? i would have to say that have formed a new genre of music that I call \\"creative sci-fi\\". lol. The Mars Volta is a great band. This album is not as good as \\"deloused\\" which is their best album yet, but it is defintely worth listening to if you're tired of hearing the same type of music on the radio everyday. It's like the art of Tool, the voice and emotion of Queen, the creativity of Pink Floyd, great musicians, and the \\"start of an era\\" history of Led Lepplin have all combined into one band. I am not a big fan of track 3 though because I am not really into spanish music. But that song does have a funky ass cool bass line! That bass line is low and groovy. If you are not a big fan of mars volta then I suggest you buy \\"Deloused...\\" before this album. It's a better introduction to their creativity.
B0000AK7AA|3.0|Without his fellow Monty Python gang members Eric Idle is just horrible in every way to watch. Here in this film watch his no chemistry-whatsoever performance with Cathy Moriarty. Their characters are supposed to know each other. You'll swear the two actors only met real life like 5 seconds before the camera began rolling and they just might have. Idle acts like he's in a different film entirely than Moriarty. He's unfunny to boot to watch and he's just weird here. I think the people who made Python knew how to film him at his best. He needs a certain director and writer or just forget it and him. Entirely!
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't know why everyone thinks these guys make music, when in truth it is really art that they make. Art musically. This album is the maximum height or shall I say climax of Tool. With every album since they started, their creativity was evolving constantly. If you are impatient then this is not the album for you. Long intros and silent, artistic spaces in these songs may irritate you. But that is the art and uniqueness of Tool. I love listening to them because you can ALWAYS expect a surprise in each song. Their music is unpredicatble. I love the way they play their music in patterns and layers instead of the regular 4/4 beat that other bands play at. Tool plays what they feel and whatever they feel comes out at anytime in the song, yet blends in perfectly. No other band is even close to them when it comes to lyrics and creativity. Maynard is great. His mind is great. His lyrics are emotionally strong. I even like the way he curses! Not to mention these musicians are awesome. Never before have I heard unique guitar riffs and solos, crazy bass lines, and a drummer who plays like he has 6 arms. These guys stretch music beyond it's limits. They play their instruments for what they are worth by making never heard before sounds come from them. \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is no doubt the best I have heard a drummer play in years. He hit every tom on that drumset and made it sound phenomenal. I can't wait until their next album comes out. Hopefully they will outdue themsleves with this one too. They can only get better. There are people out there that do not like Tool. But those people are most likely close minded, insipid, Blink 182 fans who do not appreciate uniqueness. And yes that goes for you if you don't like this album. As a die hard Tool fan, every time I listen  to this album I am deeply moved and emotionally intrigued. It's as if I can feel what Maynard is saying. As if I am in his world of conflict and fighting with him. There is a mysteriousness and darkness that this band posseses that is unlike any other. I absolutely love Tool. Just name a band of today that is better than them. I dare you to.
0596009208|5.0|I have the Head First Design Patterns book and love it.  This is every bit the equal on the Java side (I have the 2nd Edition which covers Java 5.0).  The fact that so many people have reviewed the book says it all.  I like the casual, playful format, dialog and visuals.<br /><br />Beyond the addition of the new Java 5.0 features (and dropping of some outdated features of earlier versions) it is still the same innovative \\"Head First\\" format.  If you are learning Java or want to become more familiar with Java 5.0, I can guarantee you will not find a more enjoyable book to learn from.
B00000099Y|5.0|A lot of people appreciate Tool. But there are people out there who say their music is nothing but a lot of noise. Those are most likely the lame Blink 182 fans who don't appreciate the uniqueness and art of this band. Almost 10 years after it's release, this album is still exciting and different. No one has yet to match the uniqueness of these guys. When this album first came out, Tool was saying \\"We have perfected our sound. This is who we are. There is no one like us\\". That is still true to this day. With off the wall bass lines, creative sounds, and emotional singing....who wouldv'e thought metal could be so artistic? Before Tool, the idea of artistic metal could have been tought of as lame. But Tool has done and perfected it. Their music is so powerful and emotional. It touches my imagination deeply and Maynard has a great voice in expressing his lyrics. Lateralus is Tool in their Prime. I can't wait to see what they can do once Maynard comes back from touring with a perfect circle. I, like all tool fans am anxiously anticipating another Tool album. Theses guys are great!
B0007P3582|2.0|We're all lemmings I guess. Another case in point about how powerful the media is and how you can be so average and sell so hugely. I'm out............
0780622553|4.0|I have the original release DVD which contains both fullscreen and \\"widescreen\\" formats. Be advised that the criminals who produced this DVD perpetrated a fraud on the public. The \\"widescreen\\" format is simply the fullscreen format with the top and bottom of the picture cut off so as to create an apparency of widescreen. I don't know about the platinum edition... so be careful about buying this DVD. <br /> <br />I've seen a fair number of other DVDs where the \\"widecreen \\" presentation is produced this cheap way. The people who market this crud are criminals who belong in prison.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Well.... How shall I put it? What I [i]wanted[/i] was a sort of retrospective, early-stuff based, mixed with Painkiller sound. As for what I excpected, I wasn't sure myself. I was quite wary that they might do another deathmetallica crap like the previous two albums, or a Halford solo. What I actually got is about 60% what I wanted, and that was a hugely good surprise, 20% unclassified stuff and 20% Halford solo. Some moments are too reminiscent of his first 'Fight' album and others remind of his 'Halford' project. All in all a good album, but it only gets 5 stars in comparison with the general market. Compared to other JP albums it only gets a 7.5-8 out of 10. Good, heavy, mostly fast, with a slight hint of more traditional Rock'N'Roll - I like the idea. A bit too radio friendly at moments, but that's mostly what they were trying to do since the \\"Hell bent\\" LP, but even their commercialized crap was quite good. This album lacks a bit of originality, trying to borrow a bit much of previous successes, and like someone once put it - \\"the difference between success and suck ass is a very fine line\\". I still love the emulsion of beautiful melodies with superfast, super-heavy metal - not alternating, as has become a metal tradition ever since \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" has been released- but doing it simultanously. Listen to \\"Hellrider\\" especially, and a few moments on \\"Judas Rising\\" and \\"Deal With the Devil\\". <br />My taste may not be like most JP fans, but I'm here for the music, nothing else, and I've got every Priest LP the day it was released starting with \\"Stained class\\" - so here's how I rate them: <br />Rocka Rolla, Painkiller - 10/10 <br />Sin After Sin, Stained Class, Point Of Entry, Defenders - 9/10 <br />Sad Wings, Hell Bent, Brit Steel, Screaming, Ram It, AOR - 8/10 <br />Turbo 6/10 <br />Demolator & Jugulition - 2/10 <br />All in all a good album, I am very happy to hear them with their tradional sound, rather than copying their musical grandchildren. They were really stupid doing that, especially as Halford was putting out the same crap. Some very nice solos, a few audible bass lines, too boring and monotoneus yet good drumming, good vocals. <br />Now for the technical details... If you buy the DualDisc, make sure to get it from some megastore that will take it back, because it won't play in your car, and in a lot of home Cd players either. SO the way to go is load it on a PC, burn it, and bring it back to the store. You don't have to pay the RIAA (**** 'em)  [b]AND[/b] the CD manufacturer, as well as wasting your time ripping and burning. And if you have Kazaa, it's even better. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|U2's released another CD running the gamut of liberally laced brittle guitar to psuedo-late '60's funk. Initially,after reading a scathing review on this site, I'd nearly passed on this extremely enjoyable disc; thankfully had not.  <br />There are listeners who prefer their bands \\"stuck in a moment that {they can't} get out of...\\" I, however, am pleased to go where U2's Muses journey. Every song is not going to be conscious-raising, nor a rich, mythical landscape musically painted on cuts from \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"End of the World\\". They are, however, no less enjoyable. Do I crave every riff,song ever recorded by this enduring cadre? No, and there are certainly tracks I don't like. But, those are few. Pick this CD up, C-R-A-N-K \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\",etc, then sink into the more velvety cuts.Thanks for another fine listen, guys! <br />
0060934913|4.0|This book is a riot.  Bourdain's autobiographical \\"expose\\" of the behind-the-scene activities in the kitchens of New York kept me turning pages.  While it would probably be a mistake to assume that all, or even most kitchens resemble those he describes and that everything he reports is truly factual about the kitchens in which he has worked, it is very interesting.  Considering his position as executive chef at Les Halles, his program on Food Network, and his non-trivial writing career, Bourdain does not appear to be the whacked out cook drifting from job to job that we see in this book.   <br /> <br />A very entertaining read.  Like eating some French food:  just relax and give it a try. <br /> <br /> <br />Positives:  He gives interesting info about working in kitchens and the restaurant business in general.  He weaves in some good cooking advice.  Some of his tips are well illustrated, such as \\"how to make Emeril your bitch\\".  He plays down the mystique of cooking and encourages the home chef to attempt more. <br /> <br />Negatives:  As a rule, I don't like stories that glorify drug use.  <br /> <br />Overall: A very entertaining book, especially for cooking enthusiasts. <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|5.0|This is the real deal about 50 cent's recent album The Massacre. It's on its 3rd week in a row at the #1 spot on the billboard chart, on the hot 100 singles chart the #1 song is Candyshop and the #3 song is disco inferno. I'm tired of people saying Game is better then 50 when the only 2 Game songs that are on the hot 100 singles chart are the songs that feature 50 cent. Game wouldn't have 1 hit record if it wasn't for 50 so i don't understand how Game's better then 50 when 50 made Game. Ok lets talk about the album, there's tracks on the album for ladies...(Candyshop, Baltimore Love Thang, Disco Inferno, Just a Lil bit, So Amazing and Build You Up), there's tracks on there for the fellas...(In my hood, this is 50, i'm suppose to die tonight, ski mask way, my toy soldiers, guns come out, etc...), and there's tracks on there for anyone that's in a good mood...(god gave me style, get in my car, etc...) oh yea and Piggy Bank is on there too so what's all the hating about? Cop this album, listen to it for over a week, and after it grows on you then write a review about it.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica/Metallica album, also called \\"The Black Album\\", was released in 1991 and was the most sold Metallica CD. The oldest fans of the band (who listened to the first 4 albums) didn't like too much this one, because it has changed a lot Metallica's style.  <br /> <br />The Black Album doesn't have the old 8-minute songs, that were replaced by 3-minute songs, ready to play on the radio. This atracted millions of new fans who had never listened to a Metallica's song. <br /> <br />The album starts with \\"Enter Sandman\\", one of the most great and famous Metallica's song, introducing a new style in the band's career. It's one of my favorite songs. <br /> <br />\\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" also gave Metallica a new sound never heard before, these are very emotional songs. <br /> <br />But there are some songs that remind that Metallica was still a hevy metal band. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" are heavy songs that remember the older band's songs. <br /> <br />The Black album is ceartenly one of the best Metallica's album (I also like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning), and it's one of the best albums I ever heard.
0394818237|5.0|This book is incredible, hence the 5 stars, but I ABHOR the abridged version and long for the pieces that were cut. Why is this the only version being foisted 'pon us??
B00008WT5M|4.0|im not a huge craig johnson fan;but this cd i like.i would recomend high voltage or highway to hell before this;but if your not a fan of bon scott;then pick up this one;and mabee any of there live stuff.the only bad thigh about this cd is the last half of the songs sound the same;but still;worth the $10.the best songs are thunderstruck{of course};fire your guns;money talks; the razors edge.afew good ones are rock your heart out and shot of love.the other ones arent bad;but they sound the same.
B000002AH9|5.0|Even though her voice had lost much of its quality, her sense of phrasing, and rhythm imbued this recording with an artistry that is unmatchable. Even if you don't know the Lady's story, listening to this album parallels on some level, with John Wayne's performance in the movie The Shootist. On some subconcious level you realize this maybe the last important performance from this artist and what a performance it was! The level of emotion embued in each song speaks for itself, the lady poured the essence of a broken heart into each song! <br /> <br />Simply outstanding.
B000089RV6|3.0|this cd is way over rated.everyone thinks this is the best ac dc cd;but i dont think.the only ones i like are hells bells;shoot to thrill and shook me all night long.i think the guitar in back in black is good; but the song just gets anoying.this is coming from a huge bon scott fan though;so iwould recomened high voltage and highway to hell before thisone.if your not a bon scott fan;then get the razors edge or something;but if your like everyone else;then youll love this album.
B000002AGN|5.0|This album is beyond superb. The choice of irregular meters in no way diminishes the amount of swing exhibited. The exploration of other music traditions with a jazz sensibilty is remarkable! The classic Take Five needs no comment, one of the most recognizable musical pieces regardless of genre and rightfully so. The other gems that are really suprising and equally brillant are Blue Rondao a la Turk, you can almost imagine a communal gathering with a dancer being spurred on to the clapping of the beat, breathtaking, Meadow lark is equally enjoyable as is K(C)athy's waltz and Pick up sticks.    Get this album you won't regret it!!
B0007GFFVQ|5.0|I've bought a few of the other Eno Remasters and while they're better than the original CDs they might not be worth the price unless you're a completist or an audiophile. This CD is an exception. I've always disliked the original CD version with its distortion and sound as if heard through cotton batts. This remaster is lightyears away from the original CD. It is crisp and clear and spacious. I hear things I've never heard before. It is amazing. If you like the original--run, don't walk to get this.
B00005QDW5|3.0|This cd leaves me looking for more. It it contains a great deal of great Floyd songs, but some could be left off, and some could be added. <br />This contains most of the essential songs from their carreer, but it's missing some things. For instance, they left off such awsome songs as \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Welcome to The Machine\\", \\"Have a Cigar\\", \\"Young Lust\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", \\"Not Now John\\", and \\"On the Turning Away\\". What makes this worse is that they put instead \\"Marrooned\\", \\"Keep Talking\\", and \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\". <br />If you are looking for a true \\"best of Pink Floyd\\", you will have to buy the $200+ Shine On box set, because you can't capture the genius of this band on two CDs. If you are looking for an introduction to a highly influential and expirimental band, you've found it here.
0596000480|3.0|Having bought O'Reilly books before, I should have known better than to pick up this one. It follows the same pattern of giving far too much theoretical information without following up with good examples of the concepts in use. <br /> <br />The Core Javascript language section is great, and I can definitely see that the Core and Client-Side Javascript Reference sections will eventually be of great use to me. However, the Client-Side Javascript section is next to useless for learning how to pull all of the concepts together, and implement javascript on your web pages. <br /> <br />If you're already very familiar with javascript and need a reference book, by all means, buy this book. If you want to learn javascript programming, look for something else.
B000002UB6|5.0|Okay, well this album really tends to be considered one of if not the worst Beatles album. It lacks the beautiful cohesion of \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\". You don't find the perfectly eclectic collection of songs you do on the White Album. And a lot of people will tell you that you don't find the Beatles performing at their best here. I'll admit that, at 16 and not a musician, I am not necessarily a trustworthy judge of musical performance, but for all the infighting that was going on, I don't notice the Beatles sounding any worse than their normally brilliant selves.  <br /> <br />The other big issue people seem to have with this album is the prouction job by Phil Spector, especially on McCartney's \\"Long and Winding Road,\\" using his wall of sound technique. Before I heard people talk about it, I never even noticed it, but I'll admit that the Let it be...naked solo version is better. The other majorly altered track is \\"Across the Universe.\\" I have Past Masters Vol. 2, which has all of the a and b sides from the latter part of their career that aren't on the albums. The original \\"Across the Universe\\" that's on there is significantly faster and has \\"nature\\" sounds in the background. Now, Spector's \\"Universe\\" might very well be my favorite song ever, rivaled only by the White Album's \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dogs.\\" But the original version isn't even close. Spector defintitely got it right here. <br /> <br />The other things that McCartney changed on the \\"...Naked\\" release (other than changing the track order) were to remove \\"Dig it\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" and add the brilliant \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and remove the banter in between tracks. While the addition of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was obviously the right move, the quirky \\"Dig it,\\" \\"Maggie Mae\\" and talking were some of my favorite parts of the album. Trying to figure what John is saying in the opening of \\"Two of Us\\" has happily troubled me for a long time. <br /> <br />Anyway, the actual songs are fantastic, and except for \\"One after 909,\\" which John and Paul wrote before they were even the Beatles, everything is pretty much at the level you'd expect from the greatest band that ever existed. My personal favorites are \\"Across the Universe\\" (obviously) \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (an amalgam of two separate songs written by John and Paul that works perfectly), \\"Let it Be,\\" \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"Dig a Pony\\" (which of course John dismisses as \\"rubbish\\"). Buy it. You won't regret it.
B000002KZT|4.0|This album is by far one of the heaviest of all time, and Slayer's best. By the way, Angel of Death is about Auschwitz, not Satan. I mean the first word of the song (besides the scream) is Auschwitz. In any case, the only reason I give it a four instead of five is because I sometimes feel like skipping the middle tracks to get to Raining Blood. The tracks in between are good, especially Jesus Saves and Criminally Insane. I almost gave it a five, but it just has to be perfect for me to give it that. Anyone interested in metal should pick this one up, it's necessary to further your metalheadness.
B00008LOS1|1.0|...and pist off. How many times are we expected to buy this album? Couldn't they offer the New Vic show as its own disc...in its entirety...the first time out? And can they release the Swansea show as well? They certainly are on top of everything, especially their fans....like a dog in heat.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The film Nausica&auml; and the Valley of the Wind is the timeless tale of a pure, goodhearted person trying to do what's right during a time of uncertainty. With a post-apocalypse as the backdrop, quite popular during 1980s anime (see Akira) due to the Cold War, we are introduced to a world where human technology and power has destroyed our land. Sparse kingdoms are seperated by an ever-growing forest of deadly spore-emitting plants while the beasts which protect them swarm. Nausica&auml; lives in a peaceful valley by the sea until an airship crashes with two things of importance: a captured princess and the hibernating form of a destructive monster which ravaged the land 1000 years ago during a time called The Seven Days of Fire. Soon, an empire sends their troops to recover the monster, and Nausica&auml; is pressed into hesitant action to prevent the destruction of both her people and the actually gentle creatures of the forest.<br /><br />While watching Nausica&auml;, I noticed many hints at characters Miyazaki creates later in his career. Our title heroine reminded my own mother of Kiki in Kiki's Delivery Service. I saw San (see Princess Mononoke) in her spirited defense of her people and the forest. Azabel, the young prince of a kingdom trying to prevent the monster from falling into the wrong hands, reminded me of Pazu from Castle in the Sky.<br /><br />Although the movie itself is quite good, I found the music odd. Too electronica, influenced by the 80s. I would love for Joe Hisashi to orchestrate a new score to this terrific movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is almost a giant sketch for forecoming works Miyazaki would create. While a fantastic film (especially with the strong pro-nature and anti-war theme), I feel many of Miyazaki's works later on are greater in their execution. That should not prevent one from watching this film, on the contrary, do so now. Just don't expect the movie to be the director's best. Definately one to watch, even though Miyazaki has gotten better.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|these two men in this particular movie are so self-righteous, vicious, selfish, egoistic. they can do whatever they want, what they do immorally wrong, they still can find excuses to justify themselves, but won't allow or tolerate the women to do anything similar to their wrong doings. why making love, climax or whatsoever sex issues are so important to these two egoists are just beyond my malewise comprehension. these two men only express their love by mouth, giving lip service all the time, pretend to be candid to their woman again and again, claiming themselves with a conscience and moral standard. force woman to become his own property, only he can abuse her constantly. while maintaining their superfluous love to one woman, they are also looking for newly found free chow around them. julia roberts is not a good choice for the role she played. she gave a remote possibility of being that kind of woman in this movie. not in the least convincingly true as a woman who's even remotely interested in sex. the young actress who grew up from her kiddy role in 'the professional', now turned out to be a great actress, bless her.<br /><br />both male actors are also good, but both got duck-like walking problem. good directing too. only the editing a bit too jumpy. that's all folks! agree or not agree is never my concern. none whatsoever.
0385510454|1.0|Boring.  I hate books where the author is trying to share their great love of a place without giving the reader any reason to care.  Grisham's foray into Italy, which he clearly loves, is just that.  Perhaps he and Thomas Harris both vacationed their on advances for their next novels, which then read more like travelogues than actual stories.  I know Thomas Harris slapped \\"Hannibal\\" together at the last minute, and I am relatively sure that Grisham did the same.  Why do we receive a detailed explanation of all the hit teams coming for Backman, especially the Chinese guy, only to ((spoiler))  have them totally ignored later?  Arrrggghh.

B0000000LI|5.0|This grand live performance by Yanni and a complete orchestra,performed at the Acropolis in Athens,Greece,in 1993,showcases Yanni's best works.Some pieces are energetic,like \\"Keys To Imagination\\" and \\"Acroyali/Standing In Motion (medley)\\",while others are on the more soft and romantic side,such as \\"Until The Last Moment\\" and \\"One Man's Dream\\",but all of the 10 performances on this disc are superb and of the highest quality.Every track is worth listening to.This is one of those few albums in which every single track is great.Of course,Yanni shouldn't get all the credit,because the orchestra really added to the magnificence of the songs' structures and melody.However,when you put a first rate orchestra together with a master composer,the results are simply amazing,and this album is a perfect example of that.I only wish I could have been there at the concert in person.When it comes to albums like this one,it is very difficult to pick out the best tracks,but I have done my best to pick the best of the best,and they are:\\"Santorini\\",\\"Keys To Imagination\\",\\"Until The Last Moment\\",\\"Acroyali/Standing In Motion (medley)\\",\\"Within Attraction\\",\\"Swept Away\\",and \\"Reflections Of Passion\\".This truly is a gem of a live performance,and in my opinion,was Yanni's shining hour.A very accessible album for those new to Yanni,veteran fans,and even people new to the genre.This is one of my most favorite albums out of my entire collection.I very highly recommend this!
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Lullbaies to Paralyze is an amazing album that just doesnt get any googd reviews from these pop culture magazines.  Every magazine gives them 3 stars.  First off every album they have done is amazing.  For this album they went back to a more desert sessions sound or like they sounded on their first album.I think that some of the standout songs are \\"Everybody knows that you are insane,\\" \\"Burn the witch,\\" \\"Someone's in the wolf,\\" and \\"Little sister.\\"  Besides that every song on the album is really good.  The guitar has a lower and sort of \\"muffled\\" sound.  The vocals also have that same muffled sound.  I understand that they don't have nick oliveri but i think they have made a good recovery.  This album is just as good as songs for the deaf and rated R.  It may take a few listens to them album to really appreciate it but once you do it is the most addicting album.  Just go out there and buy the album.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this band it great!!!! Australian music rocks.If you like the White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Darkness, Vines, and The Killers this cd is definatly for you. With 4 hits: \\"Are You Going to be my Girl\\", \\"Roll Over Dj\\", \\"Look What You've Done\\", and \\"Get Me Outta Here\\" there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this cd. I first heard jet while listening to triple j on the radio. i was immediatley hooked. The Best song on this album in my opinion would have to be \\"Roll Over DJ\\". Its a Great Rock song. If you have jet and are enjoying it you should check out some more Aussie bands like Grinspoon, Powderfinger, Eskiomo Joe, The Living End, John Butler trio, The Whitlams, Missy Higgins, Pete Murry, 1200 Techniques, Ben Lee, Regurgitator, Cat Empire, Spiderbait, and Thirsty Merc. These are all great artists. Give them a try.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Friday Night Lights kinda follows the forumla of past of football flicks like Remember The Titans and Varsity Blues. The movie takes place somewhere in west Texas in a small town who eat, drinks, and sleeps football with the lifestyle of a rock star. Odessa Permian High School is a school who prides themselves in winning state championships. The expectations are still there in the upcoming 1988 season with the all-star player Bobbie Miles who can do it all. He can be a quarterback, linebacker, runningback, etc. He is the jack of all trades and has all kinds of divison I schools looking at him. Other key stars on the team are Mike Wendell, a quarterback with no personality, Wide receiver Don Billingsley who's in the shadow of his father (Tim McGraw) who was a key star for one of their championship teams, has problems holding on to the football, Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and a silent preacher who blocks for Bobbie Miles. Coach Gaines (Thornton) has the stress in his second season to go undefeated and win state and has the team to pull it off. The first game goes their way as they were cruising with a 42-6 lead. After an awesome showing by Booby, Gaines tries to put in Booby's backup in but couldn't find his helmet, so Booby goes in for the last play which ends up backfiring as Booby was tackled hard and ended up tearing up his knee and career is in jeporady. The team must now try to move on and hope that Booby will return soon. The team struggled but the team ended up in position for 1st place in the last game of the regular season. Booby despite his doctor telling him he can't play, decided to go ahead and put his knee at risk by playing. Booby after 2 plays in a close game, could not play up to his usual standards and ends up re-injuring his knee. The team loses their second game of the season and is in a 3 way tie for first place in their district. Since only 2 teams can go to state in that district, all three teams respective coaches had a coin toss to determine who advanced. Luckily, Gaines survived the toss and went on to the playoffs. Despite all odds, Odessa Permian High School would make it to the championship game against the hottest team in the State. Carter cowboys who has 9 players who signed letters of intent to play Division I football. Even though the team came up short they put up an all star effort being down a few touchdowns and come a yard short of winning the game. The team went on to pursuit big careers after football and Gaines reportly won a championship ayear later. Truly inspiring movie that teaches people that to be perfect doesn't mean having an undefeated season, winning a title, or having flawless performance on the field but be honest and give it all you have. Worth checking out.
B0000019HU|5.0|I thought to myself as Slint had reported they were reuniting for a one-off tour.  As I waited in line for Slint tickets, I wondered to myself over and over...\\"How in the world could they ever hope to live up to my expectations.  \\"Spiderland\\" is indeed one of my favorite records of all time, and they come off as one, if not the most talented bands of all time.  So, as the day finally arrived to see Slint live, I had my doubts.  I had read they practiced every day for a month and a half above the Metro in Chicago for the ten or so dates they were playing, and I believed it.  How else could they hope to come close to duplicating \\"Spiderland\\" live.  Still, doubts lingered until they took the stage.  Anyone who was lucky enough to have seen Slint live on their reunion tour can now safetly say that they did not dissapoint.  They were so good in fact, that the crowd was in complete silence as they played.  People were soaking in every note and every word that these guys played.  David Pajo showed us why he is one of the most creative guitarists, while Britt Walford was out of his freakin' mind on drums.  I have seen many a show, and I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER, seen a drummer as precise and amazing as Britt.  This guy kept a pace that was so incredible, it was almost impossible to keep my eyes off of him.  I believe there are still a few dates left on the tour, so don't miss out.  You most likely won't be able to see a show as amazing as this again, as I believe Slint is done once again after this tour.  Thank you Brian, Britt, and David.  Along with the Pixies reuniting, you have made my wildest dreams come true.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.   This time it was different.   It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later. <br /> <br />Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.   Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.   Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously. <br /> <br />I suggest that anyone, who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world, should see this film with an open heart and mind.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri-La is Stevie Nicks' best album yet! This is probably one of Stevie's must long awaited albums because it is her newest album since 1994's Street Angel. All of the songs on this album are brand new, and some of them are ones that were written in the late 70's, but never released. If you are a Stevie Nicks fan, this is definately an album worth buying, hands down!

B00003CXPD|5.0|...Billy Elliot captures and propels the importance of creativity and in this film the discovery of Billy's talent seems to somehow heal and transcend a families collective pain.<br /><br /> Set agaisnt the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike in England, the Elliot family reside in a small North Eastern coal town.<br /><br /> Bily's Father and Brother are striking miner's and his sweet Grandmother is slowly loosing her grip on reality; the family is also fractured by the recent loss of Billy's Mum. All of them seem to quietly grieving and seathingly blaming each other.<br /><br /> Money is tight and the existance is gritty with little hope of change.<br /><br /> Billy stumbles across dance lessons in the local recreation hall when his \\"boxing\\" lessons prove pointless.<br /><br /> His dance teacher spots his potential and the story develops around his budding talent which clashes awkwardly with the macho culture he finds himself in.<br /><br /> There are some sublime moments of tender comedy, particularly with Billy's friends Michael and the dance teacher's daughter, Debbie. These moments perfectly capture the free and developing spirit of children as they struggle to assimilate this and their social expectations.<br /><br /> Billy's dancing is energetic and emotive and appears to be a cross between gritty modern moves and bouncy balletic/tap.<br /><br /> The number's are full of energy and raw emotion, Billy's tantrum dance to the Jam's \\"Town called Malice\\" is particularly memorable.<br /><br /> Culture clash and intimidation intrude again when Billy and his Father have to attend an audition at the tightly upper crust Royal Ballet School in London.<br /><br /> A wonderful film with some excellent performances, Bell is absolutley cracking. Walters is good as the disaffected dance teacher but for me Billy's Father and his freind Michael are strikingly memorable and powerful.

What a wonderful family Laura had!<br /><br />Another thing that is good about thebook,is how Laura gets<br /><br />tickled by the small things in life----something kids don't appreciate today.  When Laura got her first piece of candy she could hardley even speak because she was so excited!  The same holds true when she gets her first doll!  It is all very touching!
078681859X|5.0|I was at the library when I first spotted this book, scanning quickly through the rows of books, not really looking for anything. It happens that the cover of the book stuck out at me and I just picked it up. After reading through several sample pages I decided it was coming home with me. I was at first abit put off at the classic 'wizard's world'. Magic in books is fine, I like fantasty, but not cliche type books that basically follow each other around in circles, the only thing setting one apart from the other being different character names. However, after sifting through my initial instict I found the the uniqueness in the story. Bartimaeus. That clever, witty character is what make it worth the reading.  <br /> <br />Nathaniel also was interesting (and I'm sure fun to write) but did hold abit to much of the classic sob story background to be thoroughly likeable. Bartimaeus however is an entirely fresh new character. No other author (that I'm aware of) has brought such a personality to life in a book. The footnotes are a special attatchment that really tops everything off. After finishing the book I felt entirely satisifed, that is when you know you've read a good book, when at the end you feel contented. Jonathan Stroud does a brilliant job of writing and although some would bit down on him for using a magician's world, which, if I may point out is differed greatly from the classic wizard's world, he uses fresh elements that are new and therefore exciting to experience. The dark contexts in the story make the book for 11 year-olds and up. Some religious convictions also be activated by the books reference to demons and the calling of them, however, Stroud effeciently puts everything into a story-like perspective making the book harmless. I would strongly recommend The Amulet of Samarkand.

B00006CXXU|5.0|First, I didn't like Christina Aguilera at all, for me, she was doing bad pop music, with stupid lyrics. <br /> <br />But, after hearing her two first singles \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Beautiful\\", I decided to buy her album. <br />And I didn't regret my purchase! <br /> <br />She has an incredible voice, we can like or not, but me can't deny this. <br /> <br />\\"Stripped\\" is a very diversified album, we can listen to the whole album without getting bored. <br /> <br />There are songs to dance, like \\"Dirrty\\", \\"Infatuation\\" or \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\"; and there are more emotive songs, like \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and above all \\"I'm Ok\\", where she sings about the violence of her father. <br />Christina shares with us a part of her life. <br /> <br />Don't forget that she has co-written most of the songs of this album, and that she worked with Linda Perry, Alicia Keys and Glen Ballard, the man who wrote and composed \\"The One\\", a song of Shakira. <br /> <br />Christina always sings in live, she's a true singer. <br /> <br />To finish, I would say that Christina is a very talented singer, so forget about the clothes that she wears, the look that she has or the bad music she has done in the past few years, and just listen to \\"Stripped\\", you'll see that she is not a poor slut who needs to show her skin to sell.
B000000I3O|5.0|I like the misfits a lot, and this definately has the best stuff they did with danzig. Collection 2 isn't that good, but this one is awesome. Buy this one along with ''Famous monsters,'' and ''American Psycho.''
B0006284JQ|1.0|I can't understand why so many people like Britney. <br /> <br />We can't love her for her songs, she doesn't write them, we can't love her for the way she sings, she never sings. <br />Maybe she can dance, but what does it have to do with music? <br /> <br />I would have more respect for Britney and her albums if she was involved in her music. <br /> <br />But she just sings songs that other people have written for her and she never sings in live, everybody could do that.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|With apologies to Homer's Illiad, \\"Troy\\" is an action packed epic tale complete with kings, their warrior sons and of course, Achilles, played as a brooding and mostly unwilling soldier by Brad Pitt. For the most part the film excels at locations and scenery, rumbles with some of the best battle scenes ever made but struggles with dialogue and historical accuracy. This is not the best film, but it is enjoyable.
1400043662|2.0|I have read over two thousand books and Murakami wrote probably my favorite all time novel (Wind Up Bird Chronicle). I went onto EBAY and found his works that are not available in the states. I say all of this so that you can see I am a Murakami fanatic and would love nothing more than a new great novel by one of my favorite authors. But this here is not a good book and I wish that I had not read it.<br /><br />This work does not hold together, it is a hundred little components that have been carelessly pasted together. Murakami's genius still comes forward time and time again, but frustratingly so. I think that Murakami just got plain lazy and did not undergo the rigerous re-writing period needed in order to bring his ideas out. And the shame of it is that Murakami's \\"effortless style\\" that is so appealing to the reader needs an iron hand to formulate.<br /><br />I think that the best way to read this book is to open it up at random, read a few passages, ponder it and then put it down. By this I mean to say that if you treat his prose here like poetry I think that you would get more out of 'Kafka'.<br /><br />Perhaps the main concrete complaint that I have here is that a certain sense of mystery is missing in this book. Murakami has lost a little of this in his last couple of books I think. 'Kafka' is filled with the possibility of mystery here, but it is all feeling so forced and expected. You might very well get quite a bit more enjoyment out of reading actual Kafka short stories. I would recommend his complete short story anthology, as most of his better ones are not in Metamorphosis. Other authors you might want to check out would be Helprin and his book 'A Winters Tale,' or a collection of Borges fiction (Borges is a little dryer than Murakami or Kafka, but very much on the same level). Lastly, if you have not yet read all of Murakami, you might want to find his own collection of short stories, he really shines in his endeavors regarding this medium.
0451209338|1.0|[...]<br />There is a Palestinian freedom fighter called Tariq who assassinated the Israeli ambassador in France and who is now on a mission to assassinate Yasir Arafat.<br />There is Ari Shamron, chief of the Israeli secret service (never mentioned in the book as Mossad but called simply as the Office). The Office is going through some bad times and needs some good press. Ari Shamron is after Tariq and he seeks out the aid of a former agent, Gabriel Allon, who is spending his life as an art restorer. Tariq and Gabriel are enemies of old. Gabriel Allon in turn seeks the aid of a former colleague, Sarah Hilevy, who is spending her life as a model in France.<br />The story jumps from France to UK to Canada to USA. Sarah sells her body in order to be able to insinuate herself among the Palestians. From there on, she is contacted by Tariq and taken to Canada. Tariq and Sarah go to USA, where Tariq reveals that he already knows her secret and knows that she is working for Israel. He keeps her imprisoned in hotel room while he goes about planning the assassination of Yaser Arafat. He manages to get Arafat alone but Arafat charms him with his talk and Tariq decides not to kill him. He leaves Arafats room. Outside, he is met by Gabriel. There is a shoot out and Tariq wounds Gabriel. Meanwhile, Sarah escapes and goes after Tariq and shoots him dead. <br />In the end, it turns out that Tariq was going to die soon any way. He had an incurable brain tumor. Ari Shamron had put the lives of all his agents in danger in order to kill an already dying man for the express purpose of getting good press for the Office.<br />The novel is chockfull of clichéd characters, clichéd situations and distinct undertones of bigotry and racism. There is not a single likeable character in the whole kit and kaboodle. The book is unnecessarily detailed at places and skips whole chunks of necessary background at other instances. My advice: let it go
B00079FUI6|5.0|Like most other young men that would have seen the adverts and tuned in to the first episode of Desperate Housewives, I was expecting an hour of eye-candy possibly so bad in content it warranted the ongoing companionship of a crossed-out green speaker symbol in the top right corner of the screen. <br /> <br /> How wrong could I have been? <br /> <br /> Desperate Housewives is, in my mind, one of the only original TV series of today that is worth watching and not only that is actually very good. The characters are engaging, the script is interesting and not at all the braindead overly materialistic Sex and the City style claptrap I expected. <br /> <br /> The central story revolves around the genuinely intriguing mystery of the suicide of a resident of the neighbourhood, called Wysteria Lane (good name). This deceased \\"desperate housewife\\" takes up the mantle of the narrator of the series from beyond the grave. <br /> <br /> This series, still ongoing here in the UK, is one of only three TV series that I try to watch every week, the other two being the new 24 and the English satire comedy, Bremner Bird & Fortune. All three are on in succession on a sunday evening for three hours. I know not what I will do when they all finish, but I doubt I'll be watching any TV. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll go look up Bree and see if she's free for a drink?
B000002MUN|5.0|Almost 200 people have ranked this a 4.5 star album.  Most consider this among Petty's finest, if not his masterpiece.  Perhaps it is time to take down Geoffrey Himes's asinine review, which remains not only a bizarre outlier, but is head-scratchingly severe and frankly an atrocity.  This album is an artistic triumph for Tom Petty - a zenith of his musical livelihood, and a tireless album that defies contemporary rock par by actually delivering a product worthy of one's record-listening time from beginning to end.  &#34;Wildflowers&#34; features a mellowed Petty, relaxing a bit after the garage-fueled energy that sprung from almost two decades worth of efforts such as the spirited &#34;Damn the Torpedoes&#34; (1979) or the pleasant, anthemic &#34;Full Moon Fever&#34; (1989).  Here we see a Petty of vastly greater introspective reflection, considering a variety of topics that range from his usual underdog-fighting-for-his-piece attitude to melancholic ruminations upon his troubled marriage.  The title track is a simple, alluring number - the type of song Petty has nailed with consistency in the second half of his career (i.e. &#34;Angel Dream,&#34; &#34;Learning to Fly,&#34; etc.).  &#34;You Don't Know How it Feels&#34; is the type of song only he can sing, driven by his light, inimitable voice and blithe persona, it becomes an instant radio classic and spirit-of-youth mainstay, like so many of his past singles.  Songs like &#34;Time to Move On,&#34; &#34;Only a Broken Heart,&#34; and &#34;To Find a Friend&#34; are tranquil and mature recordings that feature an artist who has moved beyond the pomp and exhilaration of youthful rock-stardom and taken a careful, near-poetic/near-philosophic interest in his work.  At the same time, however, &#34;Honey Bee&#34; and &#34;Cabin Down Below&#34; deliver the kind of stripped-down, grassroots rock-`n'-roll that has made Petty an endless provider of young-at-heart &#34;hipness&#34; and energy.  This is to say nothing of &#34;YouWreck Me,&#34; a brisk and dynamic track of quintessential Petty laughing-exuberance, and the complex orchestrations and almost detached guitar cool (vis-à-vis &#34;Mary Jane's Last Dance&#34;) of &#34;It's Good to be King.&#34;  Simply put, what &#34;Wildflowers&#34; does, perhaps better than any album since, is offer fifteen tracks that stand alone as endurable play-list singles, but attain a higher overall substratum of glittering assembly when taken as a whole.  What Petty does here, as everywhere, is best described as visual music - the storytelling of an underdog in whose mind dreams come to life, and an album of that rare timeless capacity both mechanically and conceptually.
B00005176F|3.0|Blur, like many quintessential British bands, had such a UK sensibility that it can make their inventive music fly right over the heads of us Yanks. Translation: for the most part, you'll either think the band's keenest observations quaint or ignorable. But also like many of those brits (think The Jam, The Kinks, XTC, and the like), when they hit the universal chord, they were brilliant. After all, this band started off as one of those shoe gazer neo-psychedelic early 90's poseur types, along with Jesus Jones, EMF, Stone Roses, etc. Listen to the Kinksian first breakout, \\"There's No Other Way\\" and then compare it to the unavoidable sports arena yelp of \\"Whoo-HOO!\\" of \\"Song 2.\\" Damon Alburn and company weren't afraid to absorb all sorts of styles and transform them into some pretty wild rides.<br /><br />There are some fabulous highlights here. You get the classic gender bender new-wave of \\"girls who love boys who like boys who do girls who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys.\\" You get the high accent hijinks on \\"Park Life.\\" And the so-good-Ray Davies-shoulda-wrote-it \\"Charmless Man.\\" Its all good music, the main thing to remember is that it's not really essential music.
0316172324|4.0|Blink describes the underlying understanding of many things we see on TV, from our salesforce and with our day-to-day interactions with other people.  Many of the presented concepts can help to drive improved marketing, speech-making and other outbound communications.  I highly recommend this book and Tipping Point.
0316168815|3.0|There is one thing for certain: Alice Sebold is an amazingly talented writer. Her gift for writing beautiful prose and dialogue impressed me from the very first few pages of this heartbreaking book. I was also surprised at how well she was able to keep the novel from becoming one note and depressing, considering the horrific subject matter.  <br /> <br />However, this book had many shortcomings, and it's a shame because they could have easily been remedied. For one, the character Susie Salmon was not consistently that of a 14 year old girl; sometimes she was like a typical, albeit perceptive teen, and other times her narration read as if from the viewpoint of a grown woman. This flaw would not be so distracting if the author had not repeatedly made the point that while Susie is watching her family and friends on Earth grow older, she never will.  <br /> <br />Also, the story of Mr. Harvey, Lindsay, and Mr. Salmon was never resolved. Yes, I realize that he did somewhat get his comeuppance at the end---but not really. One of the most engrossing parts of the book was the fury from Mr. Salmon that was directed at Mr. Harvey, and it was disappointing to find that he never got the resolution he so wanted (not to mention Susie's body was NEVER found, but I can understand that not every missing girl's body *is* found.)  <br /> <br />Another thing that bothered me was the lack of development of Mrs. Salmon's character. Yes, a lot of the book was dedicated to the happenings of her character before and after she left her husband, but I never felt the sympathy for her character I felt for literally every other one. This is ironic, considering it was her daughter that was murdered. I didn't have a need for her to be this Madonna like character, but I did I feel that with a bit more fleshing out, this woman could've been slightly more human.  <br /> <br />And lastly, the ending, as many people have mentioned, was simply atrocious. It was as if the author had poured her heart in soul into the first 3/4 of the story, and just kind of petered out towards the end. The plot twist involving Susie, Ray, and Ruth + sex was RIDICULOUS and offensive, not because it was graphic or anything, but because it had no place in a story that was supposed to be about Susie dealing with her fate apart from the people she loved the most. Not to mention it made her seem very selfish that she would spend her last few precious moments on Earth not giving her tortured family (especially her dad) some peace, but sexing up her high school crush. I will never get over that travesty, it almost ruined my appreciation for the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />If you are in the mood for something different and slightly odd, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a unique, beautifully written book. However, the story itself suffers and don't be surprised if you find yourself shaking your head at some of Sebold's many plot and character blunders.
0385512058|5.0|You do not need to be an aspiring CEO to get value out of this book.  It's a value for anyone from the College Freshman to a married house wife that decides to start a company.  Never Eat Alone is a great book for anyone that wants to understand what makes truly successful people.  I've ready countless \\"self improvement\\" books and this one isn't in the ball park. It's a homerun to the parking lot.  The secrets laid out by Ferrazzi are more like objectives that many people don't put to work.  He lays out a clear plan of attack in the subject areas where many people fail.  I've been doing about 60% of what the book details since college, and it has been my secret to my success.  However, this book showed me how to be more effective.  Remember, there is always room for improvement.  Why is the book so great?  It's simple.  If a boy from a small town in Pennsylvania can grow up to be one of the most recognized people by fortune 500, than anyone can.  Follow Keith's advice and each of us, one person at a time, will make this world a better one.   <br /> <br />Since finishing this book a few months ago, I've started doing the other 40% Ferrazzi suggests.  I have been offered a promotion (one I was not seeking), enhanced my friendships by 'truely' listening to how I can help them, and shown me ways to help others that I never thought possible.
B0000640SA|3.0|There was nothing boring about this film. I heard this film's indisputable. Yet again, I was left disappointed because it failed to thrill me. No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up. I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does. By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost. Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it \\"exciting\\" and \\"re-watchable\\". I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around. Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by. However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.<br /><br />Am I over critical? Maybe. I just choose to be so with Memento. I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself.  There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie. Atleast not mine.
B00005QATY|5.0|i saw this movie in school for an assigment we had to do and i thought to my self i love this movie then it came on tv and i just had to record now i watch it every day and the love the songs aswell this movie is great!!!!!!!!! i think people should see it then they will want to buy i know i am. {soundtrack too.}
B000050FEN|4.0|Considering this movie was made in ten years ago, I thought the quality of film making would be a bit ordinary. In any case,thirty minutes into the film I'm left to feel like a part of the movie. Morgan Freeman is very good and fits his role. Brad Pitt on the other end with his slight humor fits his quite easily too. Now there were atleast two scenes in the film that made me jump up from my seat and scream.<br /><br />What I Liked about this film is the conclusions and the mystery based atmosphere the director creates. Of Course Pitt's done better films. This has to be my favourite Morgan Freeman flick though.The movie was made further more interesting by Kevin Spacey. There's a scene with heated dialogues being extended to him by Pitt. I thought that scene towards the climax made the film very interesting indeed.<br /><br />I was left a bit spellbound by the \\"help me\\" inscription on the wall. Gwyneth Paltrow has looked more beautiful in her other films.She doesnt have much of a role.The film also gives an insight on how detectives work. No it doesnt force it down your throat but just gives you a polite view.<br /><br />Overall I would say a film worth watching every few months.Kevin Spacey added more thrill to the film. A lot of very interesting and amusing scenes make sure its nothing less than a four starrer.
B000777J2S|5.0|I just got this last week after hearing a glowing review of it on National Public Radio, of all places. I was not disappointed. The music on the CD is amazing, breathtaking, and emotionally penetrating. I was drawn in and carried off by it.  Sorry I never heard of Antony and the Johnsons before. Now, I'm buying their earlier work, too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000000OQF|5.0|When I was 11 all I could think about was video games..no music...no sports...just games!! My brother was 18 at that time, and his life was based on music [and Snickers bar]!!  <br />And i remember 1 day...him coming home with a WIDE smile on his face, and holding a CD with a cross and 5 skeletons on it representing each band member. I said \\"What is this garbage?\\". It was hideous [at that time]. He turned on my dad's CD player...turned on the 4 speakers....rolled the knob to near full volume...and WHAM...the begining riff of Welcome to The Jungle blasted in my mind...and it couldn't get out! The guitars were amazing...especially the lead guitarist Slash [know today as the 6th best EVER metal guitarist in the world]. The vocals were unique...AMAZING! <br />But I was really hooked when I heard the opening classical riff...which is common to every ear..of SWEET CHILD O' MINE. That song is a pure classic. <br />Today I have my own band [im the lead guitarist], and im also a HUGE fan of Slash...and if u like the guitars on this awsome record, check out every other Guns N' Roses album [with the original members..not the new members of the new millenium], and also the debut album of  Velvet Revolver. Slash, Duff & Matt [former GNR bassist and drummer] with Scott Weiland as vocals and Dave Kushner as the rythm guitarist. <br />Believe me when i say, YOU WONT REGRET THIS ALBUM...buy it...and let everyone listen to one of Rock N' Roll's best ever band...along with Metallica and Velvet Revolver.
B00064WSN2|2.0|Left without Ian McDonald (principle songwriter of Crimson's debut) and drummer Michael Giles, Fripp did what many would do-- he called up his friends and got them to help him put together a followup to \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".  The result is a bit too similar to the debut and doesn't stand nearly as well on its own.    Of course, when you're Robert Fripp, your friends include that former drummer, and Michael Giles and their former pre-King Crimson bandmate, Peter Giles (bass) joined Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), Peter Sinfield (lyrics), Greg Lake (vocals), new band member and monster reed player Mel Collins and splatter piano player Keith Tippett to produce this record.  Lake was also in process of abdicating from the band, as a result Gordon Haskell sings one track.    Sonically-- the 30th anniverary remasters are incredible-- distinct, crisp, extraordinary production.  These records sound like they were recorded digitally yesterday.  But back to the music.    Fripp largely uses a lot of leftover material that the original band was working-- \\"Pictures of a City\\" was played on the road by the original band (first as part of \\"Trees\\" and then eventually as \\"A Man, A City\\" in very similar form), \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" was a hasty rewrite of a McDonald/Sinfield composition (to hear the original, check out McDonald & Giles' \\"Flight of the Ibis\\" on their debut), \\"Cat Food\\" was actually composed by Fripp with the departed Ian McDonald, and \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is a hasty rewrite of the original band's set closer-- Holst's \\"Mars\\" (evidentally Fripp couldn't get the rights to \\"Mars\\").    The problem is that the new material largely doesn't live up to the expectations-- and the album's first half maps nearly 1:1 with the debut.  There's the metal song with blazing leads, venomous vocals, and syncopated rhythm section to open the record (\\"Pictures of a City\\"), the second track is a pretty ballad with a lovely flute solo (\\"Cadence and Cascade\\"), there's an overblown minor-key mellotron workout with dramatic vocal delivery (\\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\").  Now mind you, some of these are pretty good-- \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" in particular is great with its circular keyboard figure and gentle vocal delivery courtesy of Haskell, and \\"Pictures of a City\\" just rocks, but I've heard it before.    The second half of the album does somewhat better-- \\"Peace - A Theme\\", a little acoustic interlude, is just beautiful, \\"Cat Food\\" is brilliant, with its frantic beat, explosive guitar playing, and splattered piano (although I confess I prefer the single edit).  \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" (the \\"Mars\\" rewrite) is a bit overdone with the mellotron and features odd samples from the debut album, and really falls apart unfortunately.  The album is also bookended by vocal snippets (\\"Peace - A Beginning\\" and \\"Peace - An End\\") that are largely throwaway.    Bonus tracks on this release, the single mix of \\"Cat Food\\", which I adore-- in under three minutes, it boils, twists, turns, and explodes, concise, with no room for indulgence, and the great \\"Groon\\"-- brilliant syncopated playing from Giles, Giles & Fripp as a trio, and eventually a great live feature for the band during the '71/'72 tour.    This album really isn't essential-- Crimson is a band that evolves, and the different material largely succeeds the best.  If you enjoyed the first album and don't mind rewrites, you may love this one, but for me, bigger and better things were on the way.
B000683VI4|1.0|The worst movie ever was Popeye with Robin Williams but that's a whole other thing. I'd have given The Notebook a lower rating but unfortunately, wasn't given the option for a 0 (or lower).  The acting was terrible (Ryan Gosling in particular). The story was sappy. I think that for a 1940s period piece, the characters were portrayed in too modern a fashion - in the language in particular.  The \\"loving\\" relationship between the two main characters during their youth wasn't really a nice one (if that's love, may God strike me loveless) and was completely the opposite of the couple in their older years. How Gena Rowlands, James Garner, Joan Allen, and Sam Shepherd ended up in something this bad is mind boggling. It's scary how many saps out there actually liked, excuse me \\"LOVED\\" this film and raved about it.  Ick.  I mean dying together at the exact same time?  Give me a break. What kind of a world are we living in?  The best review is the one where the guy said \\"Not unless you're Shakespeare.\\"  I'm with him.
B000003S0I|5.0|Once again, King Crimson shifted lineups, only this time it was far more dramatic-- after having toured without lyricist Peter Sinfield, the entire band left, leaving Fripp on his own.  A blessing in disguise, the band that assembled for this recording was full of such musical muscle and subtlety that they were able to turn out what may be the best of the King Crimson material (its a tough call, there's a number of stunning albums by them).  This is also the first Crimson formation not to feature a saxaphone.  Joining Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron) are David Cross (violin, viola, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocals), Bill Bruford (drum kit), and Jamie Muir (percussion).  Lyrics this time were handled by Richard Palmer-James-- getting away from the imagery of Peter Sinfield allowed the band's songs to flourish in different fashions.<br /><br />But also allowing the band to flourish is the delicate balance they created-- Muir as a percussionist would play everything from mouth harps, thumb pianos, and chains slamming against gongs created his own dynamics without the influence of everyone else, likewise Bill Bruford at the kit could manage both power and subtlety, whereas Cross' violin and Wetton's bass were in opposition, both in register and in expressiveness-- Wetton is a brutally aggressive bass player.  Fripp somehow counterbalanced all of this.<br /><br />In many ways, this is also the band shedding their progressive rock leanings in terms of the traditional \\"prog\\" sound-- there's not the emphasis on harmonied instruments, mellotrons, etc.  The approach is a lot cleaner and in many ways far less limiting.<br /><br />A couple of the tracks here have their origins in the past-- the album opener, \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\" (themes of which showed up in Crimson improvs from Fripp's guitar in '71/'72), is a signal of the future, from its delicate intro percussion, aggressive violin lines, and explosive guitar riffing, this clearly illustrates something else is happening here.  Dynamically challenging, musically complex, and capable of both directness and subtlety, the piece is a sign of brilliance to unfold, both on this and throughout the album.  Structurally, its looser than any of the previous instrumental Crimson material, when you want a musician to explode, he does.  Also developed from older material is \\"Exiles\\"-- the opening theme was originally performed by the '69 band live as \\"Mantra\\".  Both this and \\"Book of Saturday\\" are the ballads on the record-- \\"Book of Saturday\\" illustrates the softer side of the band, pretty violin figures and delicate guitar are the highlights of this piece.  \\"Exiles\\", having its old origins, has a slightly older feel to it, almost similar in content to \\"Epitaph\\" or \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\", the piece has a more timeless quality to it brought about by the use of the mellotron as a highlight rather than a driving force.  Wetton's voice is full of passion that was too often missing in the earlier band.<br /><br />The second half of the album, as though to underplay the dynamic complexity and delicacy of the first half, is aggressive-- the band assumes a muscular stance right away with the obnoxious and stunning riff on \\"Easy Money\\"-- Wetton sings largely unaccompanied but the band falls upon themselves with a furious nature.  A laughing box fades and \\"The Talking Drum\\" begins-- quiet a first, then building a repeated bass figure under which percussion work thrives, a soaring, aggressive, almost insistent violin lead bleeds into sustained guitar phrases from Fripp until almost like the train hitting the breaks-- the squeal arrives, and the piece transforms into the mighty \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\\".  Probably the highlight of the album, Larks 2 is a driving and insistent guitar riff in 9, phrases that turn each other around, and an explosive bridge, the piece boils over and is pure magic.<br /><br />For fans of unique and powerful music, look no further, this albumis genius.  Probably difficult to get into if you're not ready for it, but without a doubt some of the most stunning rock music ever recorded.his album is genius.  Probably difficult to get into if you're not ready for it, but without a doubt some of the most stunning rock music ever recorded.

B00065MDRW|5.0|In the life of any music fans, there are albums that change the way you perceive music-- \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" was, for me, one of them. <br /> <br />The original King Crimson band-- Robert Fripp (guitar), Ian McDonald (keys, reeds, vocals), Michael Giles (drum kit, backing vocals), Greg Lake (bass, vocals), and Peter Sinfield (lyrics) was a group positioned to do something great-- when Ian McDonald joined Giles, Giles & Fripp (an off kilter pop band and the prototype for King Crimson), and eventually the arrival of vocalist Greg Lake, the band's former pop sensibilities were largely replaced by a neoclassical form and a love for improv.  The only resulting document of this group in the studio is this album. <br /> <br />I'm going to briefly jump into the sound before talking about the music-- if you're not interested, skip to the next paragraph.  Fripp has remastered the album for what seems like the millionth time-- this time from the original session tapes.  The result is stunning-- there's a clarity here not present on previous editions, the production seems to have slightly changed, Lake often sounds like he's singing right in your ear, the vocal harmonies, always for me one of the things that separated this album from similar acheivements (the stunning playing of Fripp and Giles being the other) are clear and distinct.  And for an album of dynamic, it has long gone without any clear hearing-- \\"Moonchild\\", which often sounded like unfocused tinkling, finally sounds coherent on record.  From a sonic standpoint, this is finally the treatment the record deserves. <br /> <br />The music is this album is breathtaking-- the sound is in some ways very 1969-- mellotrons abound, lead playing splits between reeds and guitars, and a unique, high tuned drum sound, but there's a certain timeless quality to some of the tracks that make it stand out, even when seeped in the technology of the time.  The album's opener, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", is the closest thing to a hit the band had-- a group composition, the song opens with a whisper, mellotron effects, before exploding into power chord guitar and wailing sax-- Lake's voice, neveer a favorite of mine, takes a powerful and harsh edge and runs through two verses before the song breaks into a syncopated rhythm over which McDonald (on sax) and Fripp both take brilliant solos before coming back around to the verse again.  By the time this ended for the first time, I was hooked.  The level of playing on here, in particular hearing the four musicians playing complex lines in unison, will grab hold of anyone.  Combine that with a great metal hook, and you've got something in many ways overwhelming. <br /> <br />The following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind\\", is quite the opposite-- delicate, with quiet guitars, reeds, a brilliant flute solo, and soft harmonies, makes you realize this band is not a one trick pony.  This may be the finest lead vocal Lake has ever sung-- he sounds relaxed, confident, and without that air of pretension that so often dominates his singing.  Again, simply breathtaking, but in its own way.  Skipping ahead a bit to \\"Moonchild\\", the first two minutes are similar-- quiet musical performance and a great lead vocal from Lake before meandering into an extended guitar, vibes and drums improv.  While the trio improv is a bit overlong, it does (at least on this edition, not nearly as well on previous ones), work without having a feeling of draggin. <br /> <br />The other two tracks on the album are really the only ones that lack a timeless quality, largely in part because they're dominated by the lush mellotron strings that clearly point to their era.  \\"Epitaph\\" is probably my least favorite track on the album, dark, building, boiling, with some great guitar work from Fripp, I find it (and to a lesser extent the album closer) marred by Lake's overblown vocal delivery.  The album closer, again dominated by the string sounds and Lake's vocal, is also washed in vocal harmonies, features a really incredible reed bridge, and some great distorted guitar interplaying with the mellotron-- while it feels dated, its one of those period pieces whose performance is so brilliant and whose composition is so strong, it gets past its sound. <br /> <br />The album was one of a kind-- while Crimson would continue and produce many stunning albums, McDonald and Giles abdicated leaving Fripp to continue.  This is an effort that would never be repeated-- it also, unfortunately, established King Crimson as a progressive rock band, a sound that, by the mid-70s, they largely abandoned, and by the 80s, they totally turned their back on.  Nonetheless, its a great record, and definitely should be heard.
B00005JNEI|4.0|When Farenheit 9-11 first came out, I was not emotionally ready to see this film.  I was afraid it would bring back the trauma I felt in 2001.  I had visited the World Trade Center as a child and a teen.  New York City was one of my favorite places to visit.  I went there about twelve times before I turned 18.  I finally decided that I would never really be ready, so I decided to watch it.<br /><br />Moore devotes very little screen time to the day of 9-11, having only a minute of audio and another few minutes of stunned N.Y.C. passersby and a shot of the missing persons' wall.  In a way I was both disappointed and relieved.  I did want to see that day from Moore's perpective, but then again, why relive the images we all saw that day and for days after?  I was not traumatized, but I was deeply disturbed - for political reasons.<br /><br />Michael Moore's Farenheit 9-11 is unquestionably anti-Bush and biased.  But Moore's evidence of conspiracy-like connections between the Texas Bush family and the Al Saud royal family of Saudi Arabia is brilliant.  The volume and scope of Moore's research is staggering.<br /><br />Saudi Arabia is one of the most controlled and restrictive countries in the world.  The government follows a fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam that no other country adheres to.  The U.S. State Department says in their Human Rights report that Saudi Arabia is guilty of torture, violence towards women and children, and throwing people into prison for circulating petitions.<br /><br />So disturbing is the fact Bush allowed all of the Bin Ladens in the U.S. to flee the country two days after the disaster, without letting law enforcement question the family members.<br /><br />The Saudi-Bush connection is not the only target of Moore.  He targets the military for actively recruiting young, poor minorities in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Moore also interviews some troops who have deep reservations about the war and about their commander-in-chief.<br /><br />In the beginning of the documentary, the botched Florida election results and the plea of African-Americans to the U.S. Senate brings shame on George W. Bush and the Senate.  Moore portrays Bush as a yokel, but a sly one, with vast power and connections that seem to make him unstoppable.<br /><br />I am incredulous that even after Farenheit 9-11 was such a big smash at the box office, that Bush was re-elected.  After we viewed the film, my husband said, \\"Bush has no conscience.\\"  Isn't that a scary thing to say about your president?  But after seeing this film, it is the logical conclusion.<br /> <br />In the beginning of the documentary, the botched Florida election results and the plea of African-Americans to the U.S. Senate brings shame on George W.

B00005AFMT|5.0|Several years after the band broke up, Robert Fripp resurrected King Crimson, but in a way no one would have expected.  Returning was drummer Bill Bruford, and joining was bassist/stickist/backing vocalist Tony Levin and one of the few who could stand next to Robert Fripp holding his chosen instrument and not look inept, guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew.  Originally a band called Discipline, Fripp realized this was King Crimson and renamed the band.  Wrapped in a red sleeve with a Celtic knot on the cover, this album is in many ways as the cover implies-- intertwining and interlocking-- Fripp and Belew's guitars play complex lines that live with each other and don't stand without each other, supported by Levin's thunderous bass and melody vs. countermelody playing on the stick.  Below all of this, Bruford is easily holding it all together.  The album is one of the true greats of its era, and is certainly among the best Crimson has ever recorded. <br /> <br />From the opener, \\"Elephant Talk\\", you know you're in for something different-- Levin's melody/countermelody intro overlayed with two intertwined guitars, elephant squeals on guitar, a half-spoken vocal, and two bizarre guitar solos.  Five minutes later, you're overwhelmed, what's amazing is that its got a groove, its a great rhythm, its just plain amazing.   <br /> <br />The rest of the album pretty much follows suit in terms of being brilliant to the point of overwhelming while the environment and the mood changes-- interlocking guitars rule several of the songs (the breathtaking \\"Frame By Frame\\", with impassioned vocals and some of the fastest guitar licks you'll ever hear, the frantic \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\", and the title track-- an instrumental where you can really hear Fripp and Belew get into a groove).  These are offset by a couple great ballads (\\"Matte Kudasai\\", with its beautiful slide guitar seagulls and an almost lazy feel to the vocal, \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", featuring a horn-toned Fripp guitar melody).  In the middle of all of this is a piece that sounds like it would fit the last generation of Crimson better-- \\"Indiscipline\\".  Building tension until the release-- an explosion of guitar pyrotechnics and a blazing solo that almost seems out of place here, but works. <br /> <br />This reissue include as a bonus track another mix of \\"Matte Kudasai\\" with an additional guitar line-- its more a curiosity than something essential, but its interesting as well. <br /> <br />Something of note-- this is NOT a progressive rock album (in terms of the genre)-- in fact, its got more in common with new wave acts like the Talking Heads and the Police than it does with Yes and early Genesis.  One of the reasons why I love Crimson so much is unlike many of those other progressive rock bands, they didn't stand still, they grew and changed and became something else over time. <br /> <br />Bottom line though-- this is one of the greats, highly recommended.
1400032717|4.0|I just finished the below listed book.  The narrator is a boy with autism and give an incredible insight into his view of the world.  There are sections which do a great job of showing you just what it is like to live inside his head -- how he sees the world, and how the oversaturation of input affects him and it gives you a real sense of what that experience is like.  The brilliant math and science side and obeservations are incedible as well.  It opened my mind and heart and helped me to expand my own personal view of the world of people who are different in ways which society doens't understand.  I was really suprised by how moving the book was,  to experience emotion through someone who doesn't.  A quick read and one I recommend.
B000003S0P|5.0|\\"Red\\", in many ways, is the definitive King Crimson album and statement, the song itself as much as the album.  The closing statement by the '70s Crimson, \\"Red\\", came after much struggle and turmoil within the band, and the recording sessions would be the straw that broke the camel's back-- the band, by this point consisting only of Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocals), and Bill Bruford (percussion), further augmented by another melody player on most tracks, fell apart compeletely. <br /> <br />The album opens on a dark note-- the title track, an instrumental masterpiece composed by Fripp and generally regarded as one of the great statements of the band, lives up its reputation.  Powerful, dark, and with a haunting bridge, it grabs hold and pulls the listener with it.  Unlike previous Crimson albums, when the mood evolved, a state of darkness remains on this one-- \\"Fallen Angel\\", alternating between ballad form verses (featuring some totally stunning guitar work from Fripp) melts into a dark chorus (featuring a riff Fripp first tossed around in an improv when this band first came together) where several layers of guitars are added together with a positively haunting cornet solo by Mark Charig on top of all of it.  The piece shows how far this band has come-- the musicians are pretty much psychic in their playing, and Wetton's vocal resonates a condidence he's never displayed. <br /> <br />Speaking of confident delivery, on \\"One More Red Nightmare\\", Wetton sings the piece, which runs at a breakneck pace, flawlessly.  One of my complaints on the previous record was that his vocal sounded rushed, here again completely self-assured, there's no rushing.  The piece also features jaw-dropping drumming from Bill Bruford and a monster sax solo courtesy of former band member Ian McDonald.  The track that follows, \\"Providence\\", is actually a live improv from the city of the same name and as such, David Cross performs on violin.  Remarkably, its the closest thing to a light moment on the album, which is to say it isn't as dark as the rest of the album.  It still has an air of mystery about it and builds, but to my ears, never quite amounts to much. <br /> <br />The album's closer is probably the most stunning, \\"Starless\\", a piece in two movements.  The first is a mellotron-string driven ballad with brilliant liquid-tone guitar playing from Fripp, a lovely soprano sax solo from former Crim Mel Collins, and a passioned vocal from John Wetton.  This melts into a building section, highlighting Bruford's percussion again as Fripp plays repeated figures over and over again until the guitar and distorted bass echo each other and the piece explodes-- McDonald plays another brilliant alto solo, full of fire and passion before the two saxes restate the theme and the piece erupts like never before and comes to a conclusion.  Its one of those magic moments on record, definitely a moment of pure brilliance. <br /> <br />This was unfortunately the last work of the '70s band-- McDonald was supposed to rejoin, but in a surprising move (given band history), Fripp left, which effectively ended Crimson for a further six years. <br /> <br />This album is another candidate for \\"the\\" Crimson masterpiece-- I don't think its quite as good as \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\", but it is much more digestable.  Essential.
B000021XS0|1.0|I'm sorry, but that's the only word I can use to describe this stuff. Oh, wait...\\"mediocre\\" is another. And, for the reviwer below who put King Crimson in the same paragraph with this band should be ashamed of themselves. I'm headed to the record store now to see if I can get a buck or two by selling it!
B000003S0D|1.0|Of all the Crimson albums, \\"Lizard\\" is in my assessment, the worst.  I may not be the best judge for the record, I'm not a huge fan of the \\"progressive rock\\" sound, and all of all the Crimson albums, this one comes closest to that, at least in form.   I'm not entirely certain why this album is generally so well received, I've never been able to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), now abandoned by all the other band founders except lyricist Peter Sinfield, was building a band from the ground up.  Reedman Mel Collins had joined the band last album, and joining this album was bassist/vocalist Gordon Haskell and drummer Andy McCulloch.  This would be the shortest lived of Crimson bands-- the recording sessions were evidentally a nightmare and Haskell and McCulloch left shortly afterwards. <br /> <br />But for the recordings, augmented by monster pianist Keith Tippett and several members of his band (double reed player Robin Miller, cornetist Mark Cherig, trombonist Nick Evans) and Yes' Jon Anderson on vocals for one piece, this was the ensemble.  The album itself is really so well constructed that it fails miserably-- Fripp appears to have meticulously orchestrated everything, and thi time included a long-form suite on the second side that fails to sustain any interest. <br /> <br />The first side is actually decent enough, opening with a loud/soft jaunty piece called \\"Cirkus\\" with quite a bit of unusual transitions, some brilliant acoustic guitar playing from Fripp, a delicate soprano sax solo from Collins, Michael Giles-clone drumming from McCulloch, but unfortunately a lifeless and flat vocal delivery from Haskell.  \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy FamilY\\" (the latter about the Beatles) are both somewhat dull and uninspired, in both composition and performance, but they show progress in a fresh direction, a sort of off-kilter pop music, and \\"Indoor Games\\" begins to illustrate the sort of disjoint guitar playing Fripp would come to excel at.  \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\", the latest in a series of Crimson ballads is a pretty enough song, but the form is growing tired from my perspective for the band-- they've tread the sort of ground this song covers a number of times.  It doesn't help that the production on this one is totally bizarre-- the vocal sounds like its in a different room than the rest of the song. <br /> <br />The second side is one of those long, self-indulgent progressive rock suites you hear about.  The opening section, featuring Jon Anderson on vocals, alternates between a sort of neoclassical with pop vocals and overdone folk.  \\"Bolero\\", the second movement, is actually quite nice-- featuring great horn playing, its really a superb piece, if somewhat out of place in Crimson's catalog.  It actually has both the sound and feel of a Mingus composition in my ears, with some great swinging horns and that sort of chamber meets jazz feel Mingus excelled at.  The suite completely turns at this point-- Haskell's vocal delivery on the third movement is just awful, and eventually the song turns into a horn workout which is decent enough.  But overall, the piece is overlong and feels it-- it just doesn't work and Fripp wisely abandoned the suite form. <br /> <br />For Crimson fans, completionists, and maybe the occasional prog fan who likes this kind of stuff.
B00020HEL6|4.0|Get this prodigy back into the studio forthwith. I defy you to listen to her sing Summertime, and not conclude its the best version since -- well, since Ella Fitzgerald. Oh, and then you find out how old she is (I won't even tell you), and your jaw drops.  <br /> <br />Her voice -- in turns sultry or world weary -- is far, far beyond her years. She has a major set of pipes, and can just \\"own\\" a song like very few modern singers of classic torch songs today can. Norah Jones and Diana Krall better start looking over their shoulders. <br /> <br />Sure, you can quibble about the song selection (Midnight at the Oasis?) but this is a major talent with a killer voice. And the fact that the genuinely amusing \\"Still Standing\\" makes right wing moralists cringe is only an added bonus. <br /> <br />This would have been a 5 star review, but some of the song selections are a bit soft
B000003S0F|3.0|After a stunning debut and a pair of albums that were greater and greater letdowns, Robert Fripp finally managed to produce a Crimson record that was reasonably good.  Again having lost most of the band, Fripp (guitar, mellotron), lyricist Peter Sinfield, reedman Mel Collins are now joined by Boz (bass, vocals) and Ian Wallace (drums) as well as Keith Tippett (piano) and several members of his family supporting them.  Fripp's orchestral leanings, illustrated poorly last album, do much better this time. <br /> <br />Opener \\"Formentera Lady\\", featuring a voice over string bass and flute, and eventually great horn solos is a good enough opener-- certainly its nice to see the band drifting away from the same styled openers the previous three albums had featured.  While the piece itself isn't spectacular, it really is setup for the stunning \\"Sailor's Tale\\"-- a great instrumental featuring a driving rhythm, an explosive sax solo, and some of the most brilliant and angular playing Fripp had done to this point (the famous chord solo), its good to see the band beginning to arrive into their own.  Skipping around a bit, this group's signature tune, \\"Ladies of a Road\\", is a real oddity in the Crimson catalog-- sexual, both musically and lyrically, if features a great vocal delivery by Boz and a racey baritone sax solo from Collins and is really just a spectacular song. <br /> <br />\\"Ladies of the Road\\" is bookended by two recycled pieces-- \\"The Letters\\" has its origins in live material (\\"Drop In\\", performed by both Giles, Giles & Fripp and eventually the '69 Crimson band) and \\"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\\" has its origins in pre-Crimson composition.  The former is ok, starts off as a quiet ballad, punctuated by riffing saxaphones and blazing guitar, the latter is a piece of chamber music, and is nice enough, but like similar experiments previously, feels out of place. <br /> <br />The album's closer and title track, \\"Islands\\", is nice enoguh, a building, quiet, mellow piece, itspretty lifeless until Mark Charig's brilliant cornet solo kicks in. <br /> <br />Unlike the last couple albums, this band got on the road, but like the '69 band, fell apart there.  This album feels like a beginning, one wonders what would have happened had they continued.  In any event, Crimson moved on to incredible works, however this album is a unique piece in their catalog and stands well enough on its own.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Cross John Mayer with a Hawaiian surf champion, mix in a little Marcy Playground, and an occasional reggae rhythm, and you get Jack Johnson.  <br /> <br />He plays with a straight forward approach -- singer/songwriter/guitarist -- that  has a sparse, quiet, understated elegance. The disc has a soulful, funky groove not usually heard from in folk rock artists. <br /> <br />Johnson apparently has never heard of the sophmore slump: This charming, must hear album every bit as good as his debut effort, Brushfire Fairytales. Solid from start to finish. <br /> <br />Simply one of the best new artists to arrive in some time.
B0007LXJDM|1.0|I gave this DVD a 1 star rating because of the abomination of being forced to watch a commercial on a disc for which I paid a lot of money. The only way this practice can be stopped is if people refuse to buy DVD's containing this type of commercial. I give the movie 5 stars, but recommend that viewers wait until it is shown on television when it can be taped sans commercials. That's all I have to say about that!
B000089CJI|4.0|I first found Postal Service late in 2003. The euro synth beats sounded like every techno album I ever hated, and I quickly deleted the MP3s. But Ben Gibbard's vocals were nothing short of haunting (He's the guitarist/vocalist for Death Cab for Cutie), and the melodies stayed with me. I ended up borrowing the CD, falling in love with it, and had to get one of my own. The peculiar mix of synth pop and melody is not particularly accessible on first listen, but give it a few chances. You will be rewarded with quite a few gems.  <br /> <br />By now, the story of the band's name has become well known: the duo (eventually, trio) swapped tapes via snail mail as they recorded tracks long distance; They get kudos for not backing down when the US Postal Service gave them trademark grief over it (ultimately resolved favorably, leading to a front page NYT story). For a side project, the disc actually sold fairly well after slowly finding an audience.  <br /> <br />Bonus:  SubPop, Postal Service's record label (\\"Celebrating several years of record making\\") was smart enought to post a 40 minute video of the band performing live in the KCRW studio  <br /> <br />[...]
0765309408|4.0|It's quite simple, this book is very similar in theme to \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\". Anyone who enjoys those books will enjoy this one.
B00008O31H|4.0|When you've had enough of pop: This power duo plays straightforward, blues based rock and roll. Crunchy guitar riffs, soulful vocals over no nonsense drumming sounds like a lot more than two guys from Ohio. The recording is raw and rough edged, but contains surprising nuances and textures. On so many levels, it just works.  <br /> <br />Every Stevie Ray Vaughn fan I've ever played this for was simply delighted. <br /> <br />This is what the Strokes or White Stripes hope to be when they grow up. <br /> <br />Bonus: I iffnd this to be great driving music (but watch the speedometer or you'll be in ticket city fast!).
B000002I6V|5.0|I'd like to dedicate \\"Chicago\\" to all the people locked down in Guantanamo.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's Achtung Baby is an absolute stunner, unique to the point of rebellion, and packed with incredible passion and rock 'n roll spirit. <br /> <br />How 'Ultraviolet (Light My Way)' was not released as a single baffles me, but then it is a reflection of the number of great songs in the album.  Highlights include the inspiring yet heart-tugging \\"One\\", perhaps the coolest song ever created, \\"The Fly\\", and the timeless classic \\"Mysterious Ways\\". <br /> <br />This is another revolutionary album from U2 with their unique sound reiterating only through Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar.  Personally, 'The Joshua Tree' was their best album, with 'Achtung Baby' following closely.
0446677450|3.0|The book is very repetitive and not very well written.  It starts slow and empty... and ends without any major content.  It is a book about nothing.  Everything in the book is unrealistic: the examples, the \\"real life\\" tales, the dialogs, even some \\"lessons.\\"  I don't know if it is a problem with the poor style or the lack of substance.  The basic message: spend less than you earn and by \\"earn\\" the author means income generated from your assets, not your salary.  Easier said than done.  The simple logic of the argument is undeniable.  The only problem is that this is not as easy as the author wants us to believe.  The author seems to live a fantasy. <br />The world belongs to the mediocre.  This book is mediocre, therefore it deserves to be best seller and the rave reviews in this forum.  Another mediocre book that would supplement this one is The Millionaire Next Door. <br />This is not a major work, but it is interesting.  What else, really, can you ask of a book?  Do not give too much credence to this book though.  Use it only as a loose guideline. <br />In his excitement to send his message the author makes some pretty dumb comments.  For him, school, grades, traditional study, work for a corporation, high salary are not important.  However, he admits that he made his alleged fortune after a Ph.D. and after working for several years in three major corporations.  This is irresponsible because may send a wrong message.  But he does it on purpose.  He admits that he wants to be \\"controversial\\" and \\"get free advertise\\" (p. 133).  This is intellectual dishonesty. <br />One thing he got right \\"I am a terrible writer\\" (p. 132).  However, he did not follow his own advice that \\"intelligent people are those who work with or hire a person who is more intelligent than they are\\" (actually this portion is repeated several times, but see p. 127.)  He should pay someone to ghost-write his book or at least review the simplistic style, and delete needless, endless, boring repetition.  This book would be excellent if it had 20 pages. <br />Bottom line, my suggestion is to read the book.  But read also the criticism at [...]  Not all criticisms are correct or fair, though.
B0006399FS|5.0|Admittedly, this album does not deserve a 5/5 rating, but given the horrific 1/5 ratings of the past, I thought a bit of balance was in order. <br /> <br />While 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' is not quite level with 'The Joshua Tree' or 'Achtung Baby', it is a great listen all the same.  U2 fans should at least appreciate another unique, not quite revolutionary, album from this timeless Irish band under Bono's genius. <br /> <br />There isn't a single U2 song I dislike, with the exception of one or two of their B-sides, but there are several songs much weaker than others.  This latest album contains a few of those, but it is well backed up by what I feel are the highlights: 'Miracle Drug', 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own', 'City Of Blinding Lights', 'Original Of The Speicies', and 'Yahweh'. <br /> <br />Another diverse album and a triumphant one by U2.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Most albums on Amazon.com are either overrated or underrated.  Rarely is an album given the rating that it actually deserves.  OK Computer is one of those albums with a deserving rating on Amazon (4.5 stars).  The album isn't a perfect 5 (I gave it one because I can't give a 4.5), but it's certainly one of the strongest albums of the 90's and it beats almost anything that's been released from 2000 on.  This album marks Radioheads' collective decent into weirdness, but the journey toward the artsy is an enjoyable one.  The weird, experimental (or progressive, if you like to call it that) sound that annoys listeners on Kid A and Amnesiac is thankfully missing from OK Computer, but it still has a touch of that sound, just to keep things interesting.  There are actually only two or three songs on OK Computer that are single-worthy, but the album as a whole is cohesive and feels complete.  The art of making an actual album has been lost since the 80's, and Radiohead restores the concept.  The album will take some practice to appreciate, but you'll end of liking the majority of the songs on the album.  Of course, some of the songs are better than others, but there's really not a song on here that you'll want to avoid.  They're all worth a listen or two.  Some of the highlights: <br /> <br />Paranoid Android:  Several songs wrapped into one.  The second half of the song is beautiful.  Probably the best track on the album.   <br /> <br />Exit Music:  A slower song than most on the album, but it doesn't bring you down.  It ends very powerfully.   <br /> <br />Let Down:  There's a rich musical mixture in this song.  Incredible use of rhythm guitar, and the drums keep things moving along.  There's always something going on.   <br /> <br />Karma Police:  I play the piano, so this one is a sentimental favorite of mine.  What a great song!  A close second to Paranoid Android.  Probably the most radio-friendly track on the album. <br /> <br />No Surprises:  A pretty mellow song, but stirring.  Thom's vocals really stand out on this one.   <br /> <br />Trust me folks.  If you have a shred of good taste in music, you'll like this album.  And even if you don't like it, you'll at least appreciate it. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|1.0|So, listen---a guy dies on the Metrorail, right? And he does loop-de-loops around L.A. for six hours, and nobody notices, you know?<br /><br />So the real question is this: if a hitman gets gunned down on the LA metro-rail, and nobody hears him die, does the movie really stink up the joint?<br /><br />The answer is: definitely yes. The fact that Michael Mann produced this dog, which has made-for-TeeVee written all over it, is astounding, perplexing, and more than a little sad.<br /><br />If you haven't been hiding in a cave above Kabul for the last three years, then you probably know the preposterous premise behind Collateral's wafer-thin plot: hitman (Tom Cruise, with ugly grey flannel suit and ugly silver hair) blows into town with list of victims, hires cabbie (Jamie Foxx, who tries manfully to fake a working man) to take him to Points A, B, C, D and E.<br /><br />Never mind the stupidity of the premise: what professional hitman, ferried in by Colombian druglords to slaughter the witnesses in a major federal sting, is gonna trust his precious, deadly mission to the hands of some random schmo he picks up at LAX? Let's go by the numbers, alright?<br /><br />1) Every professional hitman works hard to blend in to the scenery by frosting his hair silver, wearing Agent Smith-style refracting wrap-arounds, and donning a dress-to-impress grey suit---especially in LA, where business-formal is defined by the length of your Bermuda shorts;<br /><br />2)Every professional hitman in LA with a high priority job to do hires a cab to ferry him to his destination. Because, you know, cabs are the---ummmm---most efficient way to go if you're carrying off a major hit and want no witnesses. Right.<br /><br />3) In a major federal drug trial, none of the witnesses, let alone the prosecutor, are provided with even the most rudimentary police protection, even when it's evident someone is bumping them off one by one.<br /><br />4) LA Federal buildings have just one crummy security guard, even on the eve of a major trial involving a Colombian drug cartel.<br /><br />5) If you're a high-profile international assassin, it's a great idea to leave all your critical assassin files locked up in a big obvious black briefcase that you dangle around in front of your hijacked cabbie and anyone else he thinks of tossing the thing to.<br /><br />6)If you're director Michael Mann, you're obviously too successful to worry about choreagraphing a coherent, visually compelling action sequence in the dance-club \\"Fever\\". Far better to just let things go, in random chaotic fashion, for about 10 minutes, and then call it a rap. Oh yeah, and did I mention? If you're a federal witness on the eve of a major Drug trial and you hear gunshots and the screams of the dying in a club you're chowing down in, it's better just to ignore it and keep eating sushi. Maybe it will go away.<br /><br />7) If Jada Pinkett Smith gets hired to do what would amount to a three-second throwaway role at the start of a flick, it must mean she's coming back for seconds. Or that she's tied into the plot in a big way. Right? Right?<br /><br />8)An expert shot will always miss the hero in a totally unpopulated LA subway terminal, but the hero will always be able to bring down the baddie with one lucky shot.<br /><br />9) When you run out of interesting dialogue/expositions, following a cab using an aerial shot of LA always helps. It lends, like, you know, credibility, man. Big City stuff. Word.<br /><br />10) When chartering a cab for your hit, it's always a good idea to shoot your first victim so he flies out the window and does some major hood and windshield damage to the cab. That way the cops know who to look for.<br /><br />Aside from one scene---a nasty little set-piece with a jazz trumpet player, which ends with a brutal little coda---I've seen all of \\"Collateral\\", any of \\"Collateral\\", on about 1000 TV-cop shows over the last decade. Everything here has been done, done better, a million timesbefore.<br /><br />Move along folks---there's nothing to see here.<br /><br />JSGn done, done better, a million times before.   <br /> <br />Move along folks---there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br />JSG
0385510438|5.0|The Last Juror is a book about a man by the name of Willie Traynor coming to live in a small town by the name of Clanton. Right after Willie bought the local newspaper, he got the story of his life. A local window and mother of two children was brutally murdered in her home. Willie decided to go out on a limb and report all of the gory details. That decision changed his life forever. IN this fast action book, Willie learns how to  eat in the south, learns a whole new way of talking and how to deal with a diverse group of people. Willie not only dodges several murder attempts, but he does it with ease. This is my first book written by John Grisham, but it will defenitely not be my last. This is a good book to just sit on the couch with a blanket and read on a raininy day. I would defenitely give this book two thumbs up.
B00004R99F|5.0|The trick in most Goofy titles, is that the schtick needs to be paced. The cartoons allowed for a frenetic pace which was often offset by another characters style. Well, this movie  succeeds in sustaining the style of Goofy, with a story that has a cast of many other funny  characters. <br />For a Franco-American co-production, it does ( for me ) come as a surprise that this has been achieved. However, the answer lies in the traditional animation style, and a strong script. <br />Bill Farmer's voice work is totally  awesome in this film, as in the Casper series, and he captures the reinvented Goofy that came to screens with the series developed around or after the success  of DUCK TALES. <br />Stylistically, the Characters were re-done for the \\"modern\\" audience, and unfortunately were part of the Disney downgrade of the style of drawing that has led to the cessation of traditional animation methods. The problem I have with this is not the shift to a totally  computer generated  form, but that the style as evinced by people like the Masterful Carl Barks, but that for all the high tech  gadgets that Disney has its command, it cannot do the simple thing of copy the classic style. <br />Fortunately, A GOOFY MOVIE maintains the high visual standards, but is one of a limited number of films that led up to dross like TWICE UPON A CHRISTMAS. <br />The gags in this film are brilliant; case in point, Big Foots Dance sequence as the backdrop to a moving scene with Max and Goofy... its clearly a reference for Adults, since the music and the Dance sequence is so 70's. And the entire movie combines classic Goofy  material together with contemporary  references, in such  a manner that the style of the Saturday Cartoon  series that featured Goofy, Max , Pete, and etc, is emulated  very well. <br />Totally worth it for the fan of Goofy and the cartoon series of the 90s.
B0000E2FLC|3.0|Only the willfully blind will refuse to admit that AC/DC is a great live band.  This is a band that has a guitarist, the underrated Malcolm Young, who is frequently called \\"the greatest rhythm player in rock\\", a band without a single ballad in its catalogue, and whose lead guitarist Angus Young is nearly as much of a rock icon as Jimmy Page or Elvis Presley. <br /> <br />But as great as the band is, the DVD isn't quite at that level.  There was certainly no lack of budget at the show -- we have cameras on cranes, superb lighting, and the visuals suggest they shot on either film or high-grade video (and this was before the age of high-def).  Unfortunately, great equipment and budget don't necessarily translate to great filmmaking, and on this concert you see one of the most common sins committed by concert/music-video editors of this age:  Too many audience shots.  I mean, why in the name of Rosie would you use mostly a wide shot on Angus Young's butt when he's doing his famous one-handed tapping riff on \\"Thunderstruck\\"?  Why do we keep seeing a wide crane shot over the entire arena which stops being impressive after about the fifth time...in the same song?  And why are Malcolm Young and Cliff Williams so underrepresented?  Even the obvious stars of the band, Brian Johnson and Angus Young, have their shots chopped up badly so that you can't catch their performances too well.  And these two guys give it their all; why the director and editor don't feel like staying on them is a mystery. <br /> <br />Of course, AC/DC fans will want to check this out anyway, and the music sounds good -- Brian Johnson may have a hard time hitting those notes, but he still pulls no punches, and the energy is there.  I wish Malcolm Young's guitar might have been more powerful in the mix, though. <br /> <br />For examples of good concert shooting and editing, check out the new Gram Parsons tribute-concert DVD, as well as Kate Rusby's Live from Leeds.  As for this AC/DC concert DVD, it doesn't do a great job capturing the band, but it's worth a look for fans.  They deserved better, though.
B00070QXL8|2.0|Richard Curtis really has completely run out of ideas. This was apparent in Love Actually which just rehashed all the most popular scenes from his earlier movies and this Bridget Jones sequel is just a reheated version of the first movie. The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser. Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget). Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark. Even the actors come across uninspired by the script. Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie). Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in. Like all film genres, romantic comedies evolve. Curtis's conservative, trite, cliched offerings should make way for more creative, original productions.
6304493681|1.0|I would have never thought to watch this, but my husband rented it. Was it my imagination, or did the main character's breasts get bigger in every shot? This movie never passes up the chance to show nipples, and in ever more gory ways. Yuck.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|I frankly don't understand why there are so many disapponted reviews. I think the movie is completely hilarious, and is just a good an adaptation of the second BJ book as the first one was. If you are looking for extra depth in the analysis of the reasons for why there are so many singltons around, look elsewhere. This movie is a lighthearted comedy, and excellent one!
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Yes, I said it. This movie is worse than \\"Battlefield Earth\\", if you can imagine that. The CGI looks stunning, so maybe if you watch this movie on mute it could be bearable. Otherwise, it's too horrible for words.

I could not believe my ears and eyes, these guys are unique. Bee Gees still rule after all these years!!! WOW
B00067TVHU|4.0|If zombies are your bag, and you're looking for a good laugh at the same time, then this flick is for you.<br />The movie follows the standard zombie plot.  Hero gets up one day, does his usual thing, and suddenly everyone is a zombie and it is up to him to save the planet.  Only here, the catch is that Shaun is just your average everyday slacker in a dead-end job.  He doesn't have a chiseled figure and is filled with self doubts.  His best friend is disliked by many and is a slacker himself.  In other words, these aren't the guys you would expect to be leading a group of people to safety.<br />But this movie works.  Unlike other movies which focus on blood and gore, this movie focuses on humour.  The gore and violence is kept to minimum, with more of a focus spent on the interactions between Shaun, his girlfriend, and his slacker buddy.<br />This is most definitely a zombie movie for the Gen-X'ers amongst us.
B00005JLK1|3.0|For as long as man has slapped together sturdy, seaworthy craft and pitched out across the Earth's black seas, there have been legends of ghost ships, tales of brigantines and merchant-men that have disappeared, only to turn up months or years later: abandoned, no sign of struggle, decks left neat, hatches battened, crew gone.<br /><br />The tale of old Captain Van der Gelder and his Flying Dutchman haunted the minds of sea captains and inspired an opera by Richard Wagner, and maritime legendry is rich with tales of the Marie Celeste (which plays a brief role in this film), the Andrea Doria, and even the Titanic, which has become a ghost ship of sorts, its supple staterooms hosting fat white sea-slugs and sharks instead of tycoons.<br /><br />With this in mind, I was looking forward to \\"Ghost Ship\\", which has all the ingredients of a good haunted house story: a mysterious (and shocking, right from the lurid opening sequences) tragedy aboard the Italian luxury ocean-liner Antonia Graz; the sighting of the monstrous, rusting hulk in the Bering Strait 40 years after its disappearance; and a slap-dash rush by a band of salvagers to get to the hulk and tow it back to port in Anchorage.<br /><br />Oh, not to mention the fact that the movie is helmed by Steve Beck, who may not be the most profound director, but as 13 Ghosts proved, is not a fellow who is shy about gore.<br /><br />So you've got a haunted ghost ship in the north Pacific, you've got great shiploads of goop in the cargo hold, you've got a nasty little decades-old sub-plot of murder and greed and treachery, and you've got some excellent actors (among them Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies). What's not to like about \\"Ghost Ship\\"?<br /><br />Actually, there's a lot to like about this little film, which is sleek, well-shot, occasionally very creepy, has solid acting and a decent story, and possibly the most masterful gore-effects I've seen in the last 5 years. And best of all, most of the gore and special effects is hand-made, and (blessedly!) not the cheap CGI that ruined other enjoyable creature features like \\"Deep Rising\\".<br /><br />When the salvage team boards the rusting Antonia Graz, all the lifeboats are gone, as well as the anchors---and that's not all. The story itself seems to have been jettisoned: while there is a nasty little plot (the tale of betrayal and murder is well told and awfully grisly), once the salvage guys turn up the movie turns into a little supernatural murder-by-numbers flick, so predictable that you can guess who is going to get it---and when, and how.<br /><br />And the climax, which should have been terrifying, seems grafted on; besides which the villain, who should have been literally diabolic (perhaps Gabriel Byrne?), is far too bland to be frightening.<br /><br />But let's get back to why \\"Ghost Ship\\" merits a look: the special effects in the movie are visionary, some of the best I've seen in a horror film. There is a little nugget in the DVD extras called \\"A closer look at the Gore\\" which is worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />And really, the opening sequence is worth the price of admission: it is incredibly well done and brilliantly edited, an entire sequence in which director Beck probably stepped away from the camera and gave the film over to the special effects guys. The scene is so lurid, so gory, and so disturbing, that I found myself still thinking about it days after I saw the movie. If you've seen \\"13 Ghosts\\" and remember what Beck did with the lawyer, this is about 100 times as good (or bad, depending on your gore-threshold).<br /><br />All in all, \\"Ghost Ship\\" is a great little nugget of gloriously gory horror that is slightly undermined by a story that feels cobbled together. The movie isn't frightening, but it is stylish.

1559409002|5.0|I remember seeing this on TV in the 1970s and the final scene shot at Saltair in Salt Lake City is a classic of camp horror that seeps into your subsonscious.  With a motivation of nostalgia I attended the revived film festival screening in 1989.<br /><br />  \\"Carnival of Souls\\" has become a cult classic and this 2 disc DVD contains everything you could possibly want to know about the film and then some.  How director Herk Harvey got the original idea based on the Saltair locale, and how John Clifford wrote the script.  As a low budget film it succeeds on many levels, the story being a version of the '40s Mercury Theater episode \\"The Hitchhiker\\" and the '50s Twilight Zone treatment.  Candace Hilligoss was a Lee Strasberg method actor when she got the offer to star in this film set in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah.  She was paid $2000, the only member of cast or crew to see any real money from the original film.<br /><br />  The amateurishness of certain aspects of the film also are part of its charm.  The beginning uses voiceovers that are completely out of synch and you can see the car is empty as it goes over the bridge, but when the lead character Mary comes up on shore after the car/bridge accident the otherworldly feel of the film starts to take over.  The gothic pipe organ building<br />sets the atmosphere, and as she makes her way to Salt Lake City the ghoul (Herk Harvey) starts to appear.  Also of interest is the in town scenes where we get a good glimpse of 1961 street scenes.  One scene doesn't quite gel with the rest of the film, namely the scene where Mr. Berger (John Linden) brings Mary coffee in the morning.  She is so bubbly with dialogue such as, \\"You're just what I needed this morning\\", that she seems a completely different character than that in the rest of the film.  But as the ghoul keeps appearing and she keeps getting drawn to the carnival the scenes of mysteriousness that make this a great film get underway.  The Saltair building scenes are classic, an abandoned dance hall and amusement park full of ghoulish ghosts.  The fast-motion dancing ghouls and the end where they run past and jump up in front of the camera predate the same feel of Night of the Living Dead by 7 years.  As Mary wanders through the abandoned park, the true atmospheric essence comes to the fore.<br /><br />  Much can be read into the theme of someone caught in a dimension between life and death, from the quantum theory of Schoedinger's Cat to the Many Worlds theory to ideas of purgatory, etc.  However as the writer admits the deeper aspects were not considered by him.  In the many world's theory we die in one dimension, but not in another.  If the dimensions overlap the death dimension can influence and change the life one.<br /><br />  A few things to watch for:  When Hilligoss is running from the ghouls at the end she is happily smiling the whole time.  At the end you can see how the girls in the car, supposedly dead, are twitching (look for the middle one twitching her eyes)...then again they were in cold water.  Its weird because in an outtake scene they are not moving.  The priest fires Mary because her playing is \\"profane\\".  Well the playing doesn't really sound profane to me, and either way it's not a convincing reason to fire someone.  In the DVD outtakes we get some good extra scenes of the ghouls in the bathhouse, and some extra footage of Mary wandering through Saltair.

B00008EY65|5.0|Looking at the HELLBOY  comics, it is hard to see anyone else than Ron Perlman in this role, and thats exactly what the commentary says. As I read it, and hear it, Ron was first and last Choice. The guy is such a master actor, yet oddly enough he is probably type-cast ( in terms of profile, not simply because his is one hell of an actor).<br />The touch that really works here is detail. The Director is, seemingly, a master of making the most of what he has, and doing it in amazing ways. The use of mirrors in one subteranean sequence is a master work.<br />Together with the creator of HELLBOY, and a team of skilled actors, and staff, the director evinces a world from the comics in a superb. Finally, it does boil down to the actors, and all else augments  what they do, as it should, and the end  result is a great potboiler.<br />Enjoy !!!
6305320802|2.0|I am a BIG fan of musicals. My favorite kind of movie is a musical from \\"Easter Parade\\" to \\"My Fair Lady\\" but I could not stand \\"Oklahoma!\\". I found it very boring with really nothing to uphold the plot. It's only worth viewing if you count some of the songs and dances. What got me the most was the plot. It was so annoying how they went back in forth. I was like just go out with him to the stupid dance!!! The other actress was equally annoying...(the one who wanted to marry the salesman) But, that's just my opinion.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie is simply crap. It is overacted (how many scenes can you have of staring off in thought), underwritten (has anyone ever known people to act like the characters), puts people in completely inconceivable situations (Clive Owen's sex-obsessed character somehow seduces Julia Robert's character with smut talk???). This movie was very stupid, and I am just as stupid for having paid to see it once. Don't let the names on the marquee fool you, this is crap.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles were often compared to the Go-Go's in the 80's, which I can remember them not particularly being happy about in interviews at the time.  They felt they should have been compared to the Beatles instead of the Go-Go's.  But, whether they liked it or not, the similarities existed then and still do today.  They were both girl groups that not only sang, but also played their own instruments and wrote their own songs.  Both groups also broke up after jealousy and rivalry among band members.  Just as Jane Wiedlin got tired of hearing Belinda Carlisle sing her songs on the Go-Go's albums, the Peterson sisters got tired of Susanna Hoffs getting all of the attention on the Bangles' albums.  And, just like the Go-Go's, the girls attempted a comeback in recent years with mixed results. <br /> <br />In comparing the 2 bands, the Go-Go's are usually seen as the more succesful of the 2.  This is largely because the Go-Go's were the first out of the gate and the Bangles were seen as a record companies attempt to cash in on the Go-Go's success.  However, when comparing their chart fortunes, the Bangles are the clear winner.  The Bangles scored 8 Top 40 hits, with 2 of those songs (Walk Like an Egyptian and Eternal Flame) going all the way to #1.  The Go-Go's on the other hand only had 5 Top 40 hits and none of their songs went to #1. <br /> <br />I love the Go-Go's and the Bangles equally.  I just think it is time to stop looking at the Bangles as a Go-Go's rip off.  As for this CD, Columbia did a great job.  Not only did they include the big hits, but they also included their lesser hits such as \\"Hero Takes a Fall\\", \\"Going Down to Liverpool\\" and \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\".  Another thing I like about this CD is that they present the songs in the chronological order of how they were released on the charts.  This is the CD to get to have all of the Bangles hits on one disc.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Judas Priest has had many albums better then this one, but fans will be thrilled to hear them back together again. <br /> <br />On first listen the thrashing awesome guitar licks and kicking drums grabbed me from the building intro of the first track. That impressive playing continues throughout the album. <br /> <br />After a couple of times playing this through and simply enjoying hearing Priest back together again, I started to dissect each song and listen more closely to the lyrics which some times get lost under the amazing metal talent. <br /> <br />Really the only track that I don't care for at all is the last one, Loch Ness. First off the lyrics are very cheesy and little clich. Second, you can cover up cheese or clich with heavy hitting music, but they don't. The song comes off as a poorly written power ballad and it just doesn't work. Try to ignore the lyrics and it's ok. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd recommend this album to any old fans of Priest or to any fans of metal in general that want a taste of what Priest can be. Keep in mind they have better albums out there, but this one is still very good.
0440180295|4.0|All in all I thought this book was good not great but definitely a book I would suggest to others. I was sorta lost in the beginning from all the different sections brought up at such a random pace, there was quite alot of scene hopping. Billy was shot with the drug Morphine causing him to pass out, then he woke up after the bombing and the war had ended, which started to complicate on my thoughts what really just happened. I was conceded with the fact that a man with such significance to lifes great aspects of becoming an optometrist and being so well academically inclined became a regiment in Luxembourg to fight against German troops in Belgium. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the setting because they're places I am familiar with unlike most books that takes place in odd places. The book threw me off alot because at one point Billy was in war and the next Russian allie soldiers are taking over the city and Billy ends up goin back to school for optometry. After re-reading some parts I didn't understand them, I then started to slowly catch on after remembering his psychotic post-vietnam like syndrome.  <br /> <br />Just when I thought the book was making an impression, He gets abducted by aliens called Tralfamadorians (two foot tall toilet plungers.) After a little more reading in that section it started to seem like a psychotic fantasy. He was forced to mate with a movie actress who also was captured from earth though Billy is married to Valencia a heavy-set obese women seemingly  that he wanted to be with a beautiful famous woman. Another good point in the novel is that it interlocks into different thoughts of each plotted scene. I really did enjoy my time reading this wonderful book by Kurt Vonnegut for where there were misunderstanding scenes it was made up of a well written novel. ****

'Dream Evil' appears to be more melodic than his previous three albums. The playing, arrangements and song writing are pretty well done as I've always enjoyed listening to this disc. Tracks that did it for me were the title cut \\"Dream Evil\\", \\"Sunset Superman\\", the metal ballad \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\" and \\"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\\" (love the video for this song). Line-up: Ronnie James Dio - vocals, Jimmy Bain - bass, Claude Schnell - keyboards, Craig Goldie - guitar and Vinnie Appice - drums. LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL!!
B000001DVD|5.0|The first time I heard this, I thought, \\"It's apparent they were touring with AC/DC.\\"  As I listened more and more, I became addicted to this album.  The beat is driving and the guitars rock.  Joe isn't quite in his element yet (he's still emulating his heavy metal idols) but the raw quality to his voice is fun.  The guitar work is excellent and the drums drive it all the way through.  Mutt Lange knew he'd found a money maker with these guys.  25 years later, I still love 'em and can't wait to see them in concert the summer of '05!
0452282152|3.0|The story is well written, easy to read. Something that I disliked was Vermeer asking Griet to \\"drill\\"her ears, use the earrings, then playing dumb when his wife confronted him. Griet as a maid, suffers in her mistress hands AND her master's hands. He orders, then do not assume the responsability to explain to his wife that she, giving birth incessantly, forces him to make a living even painting the maid because his boss or patron wants that. What is the big fuss about the earrings anyway? Why this little detail \\"ruin\\" Griet's reputation ? And why Maria Thins just keep her mouth shut? Can't somebody tell the \\"highness\\" Catharina that she birthing a mouth an year is going to require money to keep the family going? Does she work anyway? In this story, her husband is not even interested in the maid as a woman but as a painting model. He just keep his mouth shut and does not explain, talk or lecture his wife. <br />What a coward. Griet discovered that on time and made the right choice in getting married to a guy really into her.
B00005QHV5|5.0|During a season of Beethoven I decided to finally hear ALL the symphonies, and so I started to search for a complete cycle.  This Beethoven symphonic cycle is the current recommendation of Gramophone, out of all those available -- strong praise indeed!  Is Gramophone misguided, deluded or otherwise discombobulated, thus explaining their idiosyncratic choice?  I think not.  Nobody pays me to listen to Beethoven cycles all day long, so I can't say whether Wand's with the NDR of Hamburg (remastered from the original 1985-1988 recordings) is the absolute best, but I can testify that it is great -- no weak links, and several contenders for the best available performance.<br /><br /> The amazing Gunter Wand, who emerged as one of the world's great conductors late in life before his death in 2002, leads the NDR in strong, convincing versions of the 1st and 2nd, generally regarded as solid but less than revolutionary works. The 6th is absolutely transcendental, making a believer of me.  I had never considered it to be one of Beethoven's best, a bit on the \\"light\\" side, but Wand brings it alive and I have seen the light!<br /><br /> The remaining symphonies are all superb, but face the strongest possible competition from the legions of great conductors and orchestras that have tackled these great works over the years.  I am partial to Szell's 3rd and 8th with Cleveland, and I can now hear more clearly how distinctive his taut, streamlined interpretation is compared to Wand's, which is fuller-bodied.  Furtwangler's immortal live performances of the 3rd are incomparable in their intensity, which can only be fully appreciated by comparison to a powerful, yet mortal account such as Wand's.  Of course Kleiber, leading the VPO, reigns with the 5th and 7th.  The magnitude of his accomplishment looms ever larger upon the realization that these Wand performances are top-notch, and yet Kleiber goes still further into the Beethovenian essence.  That leaves the 9th, and while Wand and the NDR present a magnificent performance, it is impossible to say that it is better than the best of Furtwangler (ie, [[ASIN:B00000GCA7 Bayreuth 1951]] for the best combination of performance and sound).<br /><br /> A word on the packaging -- the \\"box\\" is just a thin cardboard liner enclosing 5 standard jewel boxes.  All have the same navy blue-with-silver-lettering design, quite appropriately noble looking.  The combinations are 1/6, 2/7, 3/8, 4/5 and 9.<br /><br /> This Wand cycle has added immensely to my appreciation of Beethoven, and I strongly recommend it.he NDR present a magnificent performance, it is impossible to say that it is better than the best of Furtwangler (ie, [[ASIN:B00000GCA7 Bayreuth 1951]] for the best combination of performance and sound).<br /><br /> A word on the packaging -- the \\"box\\" is just a thin cardboard liner enclosing 5 standard jewel boxes.

B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Not much I can say about the movie has not already been said. However, a remark in L. Benardo's review stated that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the Columbia tragedy. Although a focus of debate, I know that certain things could have been done during that flight. If they worked or not is another story, but the important point is something could have been done. When going over the tons of information on that flight I was reminded of Gene Kranz and what he did during the Apollo program. Again,this could be argued all night, but I just do not feel he would have done nothing. It was not him and this shows in the film. As an aside, a remark was made shortly after discovering the foam impact with Columbia that was along the lines of, \\"yeah, but that stuff is light\\". Newton figured that one out some time ago and a goose down pillow at 600 MPH can do quite a bit of damage. The Apollo program is just as much a part of America as anything else and should be celebrated and remembered. This film helps do both.
0679879269|3.0|Beware of spoilers! <br /> <br />Well, so many other people gave their opinion on this book, I figured hey, maybe I have an opinion too! Turns out I do. <br /> <br />The book really deserves 3 and a half stars. Unlike the angry Christians or the self-righteous atheist, I actually enjoyed Pullman's take on the hypocrasy and all-around pointlessness of the Christian religion. I found his views to be unique, refreshing, and well-written. It became a bit excessive toward the end of the book, but I'm sorry, the man has a conviction, he wrote it down, he wrote it well, and there's nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />My gripe, like others', lies with the confusion the plotline suffers from in this last book. It took me awhile to get into Mary's friendship with the mulefa, but once I did it became the most interesting part of the book to me and I began looking forward to that plotline. However, I'd finished the book by the time I realized I had no idea what role Mary played as \\"tempter\\" to Lyra. It was much later, when I was reading a review of the book, that it was pointed out to me that Mary's story was the temptation. I loved the whole Lyra-as-the-new-Eve thing, but once again... I was reading a review of the book when I realized that she and Will had had sex. Now that came as a shock. Maybe I'm naive, I don't know. <br /> <br />After having set up such high expectations and such an intriguing plot, it might have been inevitable that Pullman would somehow fail to do himself justice. I'm a writer myself and I'm here to tell you, when you set up that many subplots and give them such a grand scope, it is difficult, sometimes impossible, to finish everything flawlessly without some aspects of it becoming cumbersome, and that was the problem, I think. It just became cumbersome. I think Pullman might have done a better job ending the book without all of the confusion, but it seems like he was in a hurry. That's my biggest gripe with this book. <br /> <br />It was well-done but it could have been better. Of course, it can always be better, no matter what, and that's the problem with writing.
B000002NFM|5.0|I mean I'm usually a more casual listener of techno and hardly ever seriously get into the music or.. even remember it. Though in this case I found myself humming/whistling the tunes to these songs. I was instantly hooked by these tunes and never have I been this addicted to a techno CD...ever. I mean \\"Breathe\\" is worth the price of this CD alone. So in closing, if you're a big techno fan you must own this CD and if you're a casual listener..you must own this CD as well. Trust me you won't regret a dime spent on this masterpiece.
0783240287|5.0|The cast was exceptional, especially Donny Osmond.  He was born to play this role and his voice only seems to impove with age.  The different musical styles only served to make the production more interesting...you never knew WHAT you might get!  I think Joan Collins was born to play Potiphar's Wife as surely as Donny was born to play Joseph! <br /> <br />As for what someone a few reviews down said: <br />\\"The narrator, Maria Friedman, had a very good voice, but it was odd that she was in nearly every scene.\\" <br /> <br />She was in nearly every scene BECAUSE she was the narrator.  It wasn't odd at all.  She was the one telling the story.  <br />

0385510454|3.0|When Washington power broker Joel Backman gets a presidential pardon after serving six years of his twenty-year sentence in federal prison for compromising national security, he is given a new identity and sent to Italy. He undergoes an intensive language and culture training program to integrate him into Italian life and hide him from danger... at least that's what he's told. What he doesn't know is that he has been set up by the CIA as a target for assassination in order to determine which foreign agency he tried to sell secrets to.<br /><br />Joel Backman might be a former lawyer, but this is no legal thriller. There are no courtroom scenes, crime investigations, or legal maneuvers. It borders more on an espionage thriller, although the cloak-and-dagger action is minimal. The book consists mostly of Backman's struggles to keep a low profile in a foreign country and outfox his nameless pursuers. There is some amusing humor at the start of the book as the completely inept president, in his last hours in office, is bullied by the CIA into pardoning Backman. But that rapidly falls by the wayside as Backman goes into hiding. I found that the best part of the book was its delightful travel narrative, with Backman playing tourist and absorbing the local color of Treviso, Bologna, and other Italian cities. I imagined myself sitting with Backman in the cafes, drinking espresso and dining on fantastic local cuisine, learning Italian, and wandering the arched portico-covered sidewalks while absorbing the scenic panoramas of Bologna.<br /><br />Although the first half of the book was fairly suspenseful, the ending was very disappointing. It seems that Grisham grew weary of Backman's predicament and decided to tie up the loose ends far too tidily. He brought the story abruptly to an unrealistic and naive conclusion. This is not one of Grisham's best efforts, but if you enjoy travelogues and want to practice your Italian 101, you might consider that the book's redeeming quality.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackality. <br /> <br />Eileen Rieback
0767836324|3.0|HOOK is a typical Steven Spielberg movie, full of the magic and wonder of Never Never Land, and the joys of childhood disappearing when we grow older.  It's grandiose and flagrant; pompous and pondering, but the heart of the story still maintains an impact:  don't forget what it's like to be young.  Robin Williams does a stoic job as the adult Peter Pan, but it was hard for me to see him as a swashbuckling hero; I think Spielberg also took a little too long for Peter's acknowledgement of who he is and that he can fly.  Dustin Hoffman, one of the most consummate performers we've had, seems to be enjoying himself immensely in the role of Captain Hook, and he does a sterling job as always.  Julia Roberts' Tinkerbell is a little too cloyish and schmaltzy, but she doesn't hurt the film.  Bob Hoskins is delightful as Smee and Maggie Smith glows as Wendy.  I hated John Williams score; it sounded like all his other ones and at times I wish they had kept the music out it became so redundant.  Peter Pan has not been one of my favorite stories from childhood and I always felt it was funny that Mary Martin did the stage role---why make Peter a girl?  But kids should enjoy HOOK and it is good film-making, just not that special to me!!!
B000001FN3|5.0|After thirty years and never quite garnering the accolades which it deserved Alan Parsons' Tales of Mystery & Imagination has evolved into a classic. They have subsequently released thirteen other albums since unveiling Tales of Mystery & Imagination in 1975, some very good and some not so good but he has never matched the mystique oozing out of \\"Tales\\".<br /><br />Who is Alan Parsons?<br /><br />Alan Parsons is not really a performer, though he has on occasion, sang and played keyboards, rather he is a multipurpose, behind the scenes guy who writes, directs and produces each project. Born in the U.K., Parsons, a well reputed producer and engineer who had worked for some of the biggies, including Paul McCartney, got the idea for \\"Tales\\" after working on Al Stewart's \\"Tim Passages\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", both concept albums.<br /><br />Parsons teamed up with songwriter Eric Woolfson and voila, The Alan Parsons Project was launched. They released \\"Tales\\" in 1975, followed up with \\"I Robot\\" two years later and have never looked back. Their biggest commercial success came in 1982 when the title cut from the album The Eye in the Sky became a number three hit. All their albums to date are concept albums, based on some story or theme. Tales of Mystery & Imagination was inspired by a collection of stories by Edgar Allen Poe. I Robot was based upon Issac Asimov's many writings on robots and so forth.<br /><br />Song/Track List<br /><br />1 Dream Within a Dream [instrumental] 3:43 *****<br /><br />2 The Raven 4:01 *****<br /><br />3 The Tell-Tale Heart 4:40 *****<br /><br />4 The Cask of Amontillado 4:29 *****<br /><br />5 (The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether 4:15 ***** 6 Fall of the House of Usher: Prelude [instrumental] 5:51 ****<br /><br />7 Fall of the House of Usher: Arrival [instrumental] 2:36 *****<br /><br />8 Fall of the House of Usher: Intermezzo [instrumental] 1:06 *****<br /><br />9 Fall of the House of Usher: Pavane [instrumental] 4:44 *****<br /><br />10 Fall of the House of Usher: Fall [instrumental] 1:07<br /><br />11 To One in Paradise 4:14 *****<br /><br />Tales of Mystery & Imagination<br /><br />Let's talk about the music shall we? \\"Tales\\" is not quite rock although some songs like \\"Tell-Tale Heart\\" and \\"Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" certainly have rock elements and are fairly accessible in the commercial sense but that's where any similarity to mainstream music ends. The instrumental \\"Dream Within a Dream\\" actually starts with a monologue by the incomparable Orson Wells, a portion of which goes like this; \\"For my own part, I have never had a thought, Which I could not set down in words, With even more distinctness, Than that which I conceived it, There is however, a class of fancies, Of Exquisite delicacy, Which are not thoughts, And to which is yet, I have found it, Absolutely impossible to adapt to language\\", As Wells recites his monologue, ethereal textures begin to emerge, building in intensity until after Wells is finished the song builds to a crescendo, then fading back to only a bass and drum beat, eventually segueing into \\"The Raven\\" which keeps the same beat and starts with an electronically altered vocal. After the beat picks up the piece evolves into a extremely catchy song with normal vocals. There is no break when a heavy drum beat ushers in the mid tempo equally catchy \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" featuring heavy percussion and guitar and a few screams surrounding a dreamy bridge. Another varied tempo number \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", starts out slowly with sad melancholy vocals which continue throughout interspersed with another up tempo, catchy rock melody. The fourth catchy number in a row is \\"Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" a variable paced number with a whining guitar refrain throughout.<br /><br />Since this was originally released as a vinyl recording the following number \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" served a the B side of the album. It is actually a grouping of five atmospheric orchestral instrumental sets of varying lengths. These songs, mostly ominous which tell this sinister story, all sound as if they could be used in any soundtrack, for a quality horror film (oxymoron). On \\"Prelude\\" Orson Wells once again gives us the lowdown: \\"Shadows of shadows passing.<br /><br />It is now 1831, and as always, I am absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite sensations, to which end, music is an essential.<br /><br />Since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music when combined with a pleasurable idea is poetry.<br /><br />Music without the idea is simply music. Without music or an intriguing idea, colour become pallor, man becomes carcass, home becomes catacomb,<br /><br />and the dead are but for a moment motionless.\\" Other than that \\"Prelude\\" is a mixed tempo number which I found to be not quite up to the other compositions. It is little weak and almost pleasant sounding but it is setting you up for the fury that follows in the next four sets. \\"Arrival\\" begins in a rainstorm with a Hammond leading the way into a crescendo of sound and escalating frenzy segueing into \\"Intermezzo\\" a very ominous atmospheric interlude again segueing into \\"Pavane\\", a quite pleasant keyboard based number played with an European feel. It is however a mirage, ultimately building up and setting the way for the \\"Fall\\", which is not very musical but it is effective! Out of the carnage comes a hopeful dreamy song, \\"To One in Paradise\\", the antithesis of the \\"Fall\\".<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />There isn't much more I can say folks. Tales of Mystery and Imagination is almost the PERFECT album. Even thirty years later it still sounds as fresh as the day I first heard it. If you have never heard it and you want to try something a little different, something with a \\"snap crackle and pop\\", give \\"Tales\\" a try.

B00079FUI6|5.0|I'm not someone who can watch the same movie or the same episode of a show over and over again. Or at least rarely. That's not the case with Dsp Hswvs. I don't have cable so I downloaded all the episodes that were available (which was all of them. that right there should show you something.) And because I did that now I can watch them over and over again, whenever i want! When I downloaded the firsy episode it was more out of lack of imagination. I'd been reading something about the show on a tabloid cover while standig in line getting groceries. But after watching the first episode I was instanly wrapped up in the plot. The undercurrent of black comedy was so refreshing. And its just a world so far from my own. Not something I would want for myself but the actors casted in this show pull of their roles perfectly. It's got every element of a fabulous show. Everything you could possibly want.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|There is only one word that can describe this bands sophmore effort.  AMAZING!! This is a must buy for any rock, modern rock, alternative fan.  Any fan of great sounding music with emotional lyrics and unbelievable background vocals and hooks.  They are a must see live band as well.  Favorite songs are: Quiver,  <br />Say Goodbye, Me and My Girl, No Surprise, Save the best for last, and hello lonely.  This cd is so good i cant really choose as you can see so go pick this cd up rite now, if you dont u will be doing yourself a diservice and be missing out on the next big thing in rock music.  I have said enough, Your move!
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I watched this movie not expecting much at all.  I though it would be like some over-produced and more bombastic \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" episode, but to my delight I was pleasantly surprised by a cinematic marvel of a film that uses a great cast, superb visuals and soundtrack with a decent story to provide something for everyone.  That being said I felt the movie was missing the proper exposition needed for a period piece: we find out only too late the record of Jack Aubrey, his relationship and his foibles.  This however, only provides a reason to watch the film again, or again and again.  The film focuses on Captain Aubrey's ship \\"HMS Surprise\\" voyage around Cape Horn in pursuit of the French ship \\"Acheron\\" (named for a river in hell, which I don't think is all that realistic but it sure is fun).  But beyond just this chase the film weaves a yarn about the intricate and close knit life on a British ship of the line during the Napoleonic Wars. <br /> <br />The film is overwhelmingly realistic as it shows the microcosm of an early 19th century ship at sea with gritty honesty.  Literally seeing the blood sweat and tears of the sailors and the pomp and circumstance of the officers it is easy to see why tension was always high and justice was brutal on the high seas.  Paul Bettany, plays his role well as the ships surgeon who has a penchant for natural science.  The part where he is shot by one of the sailors is somewhat farfetched but it makes the scenes one the Galapagos Islands all the better.  One touching scene is when the young cadet who has had his arm amputated after a battle is given A book about Lord Nelson (who also had an amputated arm). The fighting is magnificently done and the storm scenes are almost too realistic.  This is one of those films you could enjoy even with the sound off. <br /> <br />In the end \\"Master and Commander\\" is a really fun movie: it is not a life changing experience but is enjoyable and worthy of several watches.  Russel Crowe, as he often does, earns his money with his great performance.  The other actors too perform well and this movie has good attention to detail.  I recommend this movie as a great family film for older children as well as anyone with a thirst for adventure.  This is an exciting film that will certainly entertain and leave you looking for more. <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena <br />
B0006FFRW0|3.0|This disc was a disappointment. Really.  <br /> <br />On the CD side of things, the re-mastered TDS is so subtle in difference that I sometimes wonder if its more psychological than anything else, hence the title of this review. (If you don't know the story then go find out!) <br />One of the few differences I can pick up is on the quiet bits, where they are more discernable than before, but thats about it. <br /> <br />As far as the DVD side is concerned, the 5.1 mix was a let-down. I was expecting the same assault attack that ravaged my sound system on AATCHB DVD, but it fell far short. I didn't even bother listening to the Dolby Stereo mix, so I cannot offer any comment. <br />The videos are the only saving grace here, so if you have them already...well you do the math. <br />Perhaps the Hi-Res audio is a bit better, but I don't have's a DVD-A player, so once again reserve comment. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong..I am a fan, a big fan, and TDS is a classic, but as a fan I can't stand artists churning out rehashed stuff for no apparent reason other than financial. There is just not enough difference in this version to the original to make it worthwhile. <br /> <br />Sorry, but this is just not good enough. 3 stars...one for each video.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|When I heard that Nick Oliveri, Bassist/Song Writter/Other Singer for QOTSA was kicked out of the band, my fears for this album began. I was hesetant to even pick it up. I feel that Josh is the better singer, and maybe even song writter, but an album of 100% Hommee material would be BORING! If you ask me, Nick is was and always will be the personality, and the drive of the band. They are extreamly boring with out him. I liked they way the two blended their styles. I liked how their styles influenced each other. I liked how Mark Lanegan would add a new texture to anyone of their songs. But he is now one a whole, 1:22 of this album. But that is now absent.<br /><br />Lullabies to Paralyze is a terrible but apropriate title. Its not a bad album. It starts off well.. but starts to run together, and drag on. By the end its hit bordem central. This is less of a Queens Of The Stone Age album and much like a more serious Egales Of Death Metal album. Or a Josh Homme solo album. There are almost no turely catchy song. I have listened to the album 3 times, in a row and nothing has stuck in my head other then that catchy as hell but otherwise HORRIBLE single, Little Sister.<br /><br />In the end, this is a good album. It beats the pants off alot of new releases. If this was put out by a new band it would be a masterpeice. But since its a Queens album, its lacking in important areas. Mark, and Nick kept this band interesting and with out them we're left with a watered down, Queens Lite. I know Nick was a little out of control, but I think in order for QOTSA to capture their formar thunder, the main song writting duo needs to get back in tackt! But that is just my 2 cents.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is the story of a genious who descended into madness and then resurrected himself back to the normal working world.  It is the story of Dr. John Nash, a Princeton Math Whiz-kid, who made a huge mathematics break-through with his work in Game Theory and it's applications to sociology and economics. Actor<br /><br />Russie Crowe plays Dr. Nash brilliantly --- and his wife is played by the beautiful Jennifer Connley.<br /><br />  The movie starts at Princeton, where Nash meets his prodigal room mate, Charles - portrayed nicely by Chris Plummer. Nash developed a strong bond with his roomie, but they were never competitve in an academic sense.  Why? Because the prodigal room mate, Charles - was only a figment of Nash's schizophrenia and never exhisted!<br /><br />  Nash's life unfolds during this movie, and we are vexed by his visual and auditory hallucinations ---  that are nearly perfect.  One has to look closely to see where the visual hallucinations conflict with nature....<br /><br />We come to understand Nash's intense paranoia, his delusions of grandiose as well as his delusions of persecution.  He begins to act very oddly in the presence of others and a kindly but stern psychologist is summoned to commit Dr. Nash to an Insane Asylum.  They take him away, kicking and screaming.<br /><br />  Nash is in denial and it is his wife, Jennifer Connley plays his wife, who has to deal the truth to him in the insane asylum. Nash undergoes insulin shock therapy, which was a dark stain upon our national mental health programs back in the day.  It was a barbaric therapy, but some people did get better after undergoing it.  Nash has some improvement in his schizoprenic symptoms and is discharged home with lots of pysychotropic medications.<br /><br />These pills contribute to his loss of mental concentration,<br /><br />and his abiltiy to respond to his beautiful wife's libido.<br /><br />Then he stops taking the pills and trouble ensues once again.<br /><br />Ed Harris plays another visual/auditory hallucination and the veiwer is second-guessing him....he plays a man in black from the FBI or the CIA....Mr. Parcher.  This leads to more paranoid schizophrenic behavior and self-mutilation.  In Nash's mind, he must rationalize all of this crazy behavior...he is brilliant enough to fool himself all over again, but he doesn't fool his wife or anyone else.<br /><br />  The story behind Dr. John Nash's mental illness helps to explain the social stigma associated with such a mental disorder and it also helps to build tolerance towards those persons who suffer from it.  It is a brilliant film that I showed to my first semester psych students, to help them learn about this important diagnosis in  mental illness, and to help them understand how a person with schizophrenia views the world.<br /><br />  This film also brilliantly conveys to the world that persons with  mental illnesses have the ability to conquer them - sometimes with unconventional methods - and to achieve great goals in life.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  The movie creators are just Wes Anderson wannabe's, and not very good one's at that.  Possibly the worst writing ever as well, the characters go nowhere.  You see them throw footballs, sell tupperware and dance in the auditorium.  This film offers nothing.  If you want to watch an obscure funny movie then watch 'The Royal Tenenbaums' or 'Rushmore' to just name a couple. Don't waste your time with this one.
0060278250|5.0|To begin with, \\"Abhorsen\\" is one amazing thriller that not only puts you on `the edge of your seat,' but \\"Abhorsen\\" also is a mystery within the mystery. I personally love the whole story line that Nix has plotted, but in order to read this and be able to follow the plot, you should at lease read \\"Lirael\\" first. Unlike \\"Lirael,\\" \\"Abhorsen\\" picks up right where \\"Lirael\\" left off. Also answering many of the questions that rose up in \\"Lirael,\\" \\"Abhorsen\\" is a final wrap-up that left vivid images into my mind and stuck there for days. Garth Nix has done an excellent job wrapping up his trilogy, but I think it would have been better if he didn't end the book so quickly, since it seemed like it just swirled in my head and that's probably just because I still have unanswered questions.  <br /> <br />\\"Abhorsen\\" begins where \\"Lirael\\" left off and its prologue creates a bit of a bang as well. With the main characters being Lirael, Sam, the Disputable Dog, and Mogget, the story follows their journey to the Red Lake where they are going to try and stop the Destroyer from killing the world. On their journey, they learn new things about the history of the Charter and about their foe. Placing his characters and scenes in remote and unusual places, Nix created a book to hook readers of any age group. Instead of a child's fairytale fantasy, this story goes deeper into the niceness and holds you to the edge of death itself. \\"Abhorsen\\" is a book that should be put on a school's reading list because it's that good. Over all, I recommend that you read this book, but also read the prequels, \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" before you do, so you not only get a better understanding of the story, but you enjoy the thrill \\"Abhorsen\\" holds in store as well.

0805076476|5.0|I never saw Fight Club. I'd heard of the movie, but I'd never seen it. I heard that it was based on a novel from some friends, and when I saw it in a book store, I picked it up. I sat down with it, and before I'd made it halfway through the prologue, I was drawn in, and I bought it.     The thing about Fight Club is that it isn't about Fight Club, or violence, or explosions. People who complain that it's too violent are missing the point.    The reality of it is that, to me, at least, Fight Club was kind of beautiful. The story, the narrative style, but above all, the characters were fantastic. The way that Palahniuk writes, by the time I hit the end of a chapter, I was usually left reeling.     I'm glad that I read the novel before seeing the movie, because it was new to me, and I had no idea where it was going to go.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|If u like Daft Punk only because of Discovery & consider Homework bad...im sorry to say that u will dislike or even hate this album more than Homework, why you ask? Because the happy go lucky party music style is gone & you'll just be wasting your time.If u like Daft Punk vice versa (that is, consider Discovery bad & like Homework), u will like this album simply because,although the album as a whole is new in style, it is most definetely reminding us of the days of Homework.If you are a fan of Daft Punk (like me) it depends on what you will think the first time you listen to it,you might hate it or love it right away.Personally, I was disappointed at first, but after 5-6 listens it just grew on me & now i consider it genius. I admit it is the worst the duo have released (NOT considering Daft Club) compared to the previous albums but believe me,as long as you don't compare it to Discovery or Homework, it is an amazing piece of work all in all, just don't judge the album from the first listen, hear it 4-6 times & you'll probably grow to love it just like i did, give it time & let it grow on you. I agree with the idea that people who dunno Daft Punk should not start with this, start with Discovery & then Homework & if u liked those, pick up Human After All at the end. <br />------- <br /> <br />Favourite Tracks: Human After All, Steam Machine, Television Rules The Nation, Technologic <br /> <br />Least Favourite Tracks: Emotion  <br />
0385720920|5.0|Initially, I was surprised to see that so many people hated this novel, so much. But then, the majority of Palahniuk's fans are begging for a sequel to Fight Club and hated Invisible Monsters, so, in light of all that, it's believable.    What I don't understand is what's so horrible about Victor Mancini. He is a sex addict, yes, and he's not shy about it, but if you're offended by this sort of openness when dealing with sexuality, then you probably shouldn't be reading Palahniuk's novels to begin with.     Then again, maybe it has to do with his attitude toward his mother; I don't know. Either way, he is an absolutely sympathetic character. The problem with Denny, I'm not clear on at all.     And as for the descriptions of sex, they're not meant to be shocking. As far as I can tell, they're meant to be tedious. Victor is a sex-addict.     The novel is excellent. It may not be as good as Fight Club or Survivor, but that should hardly affect the way you view this novel, which is fantastic in its own right.
0783219695|4.0|I am rating this four rather than five stars just because I think Universal is overhyping an inferior reissue that they easily could have gotten right.  They have upgraded the picture quality (which *could* make the upgrade worth it if you've got a really big screen), but it's shameful that they did not include the DTS soundtrack as an option with the normal version (it was previously available as a stand-alone DVD).  The only new extras are two documentaries about the space program and Apollo 13 itself (there are enough of those documentaries already out there for any Apollo fan) and the IMAX version of the film--with a DTS soundtrack option!  The IMAX version is stupendous when seen in an IMAX theater, but to present this edited version (made before IMAX upgraded their film platters to accomodate longer theatrical release conversions) on a DVD makes little sense other than as a throwaway extra.<br /><br />I saw \\"Apollo 13\\" at least seven times during its original theatrical release and three times in IMAX.  The original Dolby Digital DVD was the first DVD I bought.  Back then they issued a separate DTS DVD which I never found in a store, and some people said it lacked some or all of the bonus features so I had not been willing to buy it online just for the superior sound--hey, this was back when Universal SE DVDs were priced at about twice what they are now.  As many separate DD/DTS DVDs were reissued with both soundtracks, I was sure \\"Apollo 13\\" would so I never bothered to pick up the DTS version.  Looks like I'll have to wait for the HD release for them to fix this glaring oversight--or now go find the out-of-print DTS version....
B00003CXAA|5.0|these movies are cinamatic history, and if you havent seen them then you should. the movies are all classic as is everything about them. The corleone family has become part of American history not only from these movies but also from the classic novel. mario puzo and francis ford coppola do a fantastic job with the script and coppolas direction is perfect. the acting is fantastic i dont think that i can say a bad word about these movie. the sereis is fantastic and if you like thes movies then you should get the box set.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has that perfect mixture of smooth lyrics and provocative music that makes the listener get lost in the experience. Whether I am in my car, in my office, or at home, he hits the nail on the head every time and puts me in the mood to do whatever suits me at the time. He will be around for a long time, without a doubt, and I am anxiously awaiting his next CD.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I love muse's music, but the review on the front page saying muse are not actually a british band is not true. There IS a band called muse from florida but they are not to be confused with the british band. This muse grew up Teignmouth, Devon in England. Sorry just wanted to sort that out. <br /> <br />But actually onto the review: <br /> <br />Muse have a great range of songs, slower ones (Butterflies and hurricanes, Sing for Absolution) and faster ones (Hysteria and Stockholm Syndrome) Matt Bellamy uses piano parts in his songs which i feel gives them a nice touch, like coldplay. Muse are also often compared to radiohead, i admit their music is similar but not as alike as some people say. <br /> <br />5 stars, brilliant album.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Yes, Close to the Edge is musically tighter and awesome in its intricate interconnections of musical lines, probably because of Bruford's drumming, but....Topographic Oceans is just Yes's most heartfelt creation.  I grew up listening to Yes and haven't listened to them in a long time.  Now after all these years, I find that it's Topographic that still resonates most in my heart.  Believe it or not, its lyrics are the most understandable of all Yes lyrics, and it's because you get the sense that Howe and Anderson really cared about what they were writing about.  It's a grand and heartfelt vision to try and get at the spiritual origins of our universe. <br /> <br />The first and last tracks are the best tracks, but it's wonderful to listen to as a whole.  Howe and Anderson's song at the end of track 3 is probably Yes's most beautiful moment ever, a vision of the beautiful fragility of life and humanity singing together that almost always draws me close to tears.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|This is a very special DVD because it captures a part of Tina's career. Here you can find most of her biggest hits and greatest performances live. <br />The track list is good but some songs such as TYPICAL MALE or WHATEVER YOU WANT are missing. Most of the videos are from the LIVE IN AMSTERDAM and ONE LAST TIME DVD's. Personally I would have added different locations or scenes, like for example on SHOW SOME RESPECT, they could have added the not-released on video the version from LIVE IN BARCELONA 1990 or added old videos from NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS, PROUD MARY or even ACID QUEEN. Just to have something new to see.  <br />For STEAMY WINDOWS you can find a mix of shots from 1990 to 2000 and you can really notice how a great performer and ageless Tina is that for 10 years she dances and performs with the same energy and strengh. One of the highlight videos is LET'S STAY TOGETHER, what a wonderful act from Tina, amazing. I'm also very glad the you can find here WHATEVER YOU NEED (ofor me this is one of Tina's best songs ever). With songs such as I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN or ADDICTED TO LOVE Tina rocks wildly. The BETTER BE GOOD TO ME election is good but the most powerful release for this track was the one from her 1985 PRIVATE DANCER LIVE video. <br />Among the bonus features you can find THE BEST, BE TENDER WITH ME BABY, PARADISE IS HERE (never before seen live video), OPEN ARMS live on Parkinson, the video of COSE DELLA VITA next to Eros Ramazzotti and a 25 minute interview with Tina where she talks about her ALL THE BEST greatest hits album plus the three new songs for it. <br />I really enjoy this video and even though you go from videos from 1985 to 2000 you feel them with the same power, it's like it was a full length video.  <br />My final comment is that I wish there's an up coming ALL THE BEST-THE VIDEO COLLECTION. <br />
B0002JJBZE|5.0|After an absolutely brilliant, groundbreaking first season, Star Trek returned for its second year with a bit more self-confidence and a willingness to expand its universe.  The resulting year ranks almost equally well with the first, featuring some of the series' best ever episodes and finest character moments, although three or four unfortunate clunkers harm its reputation and show that the series was already beginning to succumb to formula cliche, which would become a much worse problem when season three rolled around. <br /> <br />Whereas season one had been moody, super-serious and pensive in tone, with only scattered moments of humor here and there, season two managed to lighten the atmosphere while not sacrificing any of the drama.  The resultant mix of high-spirited action, drama and comedy made for outstanding episodes like \\"Amok Time\\", \\"Friday's Child\\", \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" and the almost unbelievably good \\"Journey To Babel\\" (with Mark Lenard in regal form as Sarek).  A new crewmember, Chekov was introduced and the machinations of Starfleet were more fully explored, while the show took three direct forays into flat-out humor on \\"I, Mudd\\", \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" and \\"A Piece Of The Action\\" (the latter two becoming particularly popular with fans).  The Kirk-Spock-McCoy relationship was in high gear by this point, with choice moments between the three occuring in nearly every episode, and usually making even the worst moments bearable.  Those clunkers, which begin the \\"Kirk romancing the priestess of the alien computer world\\" formula included \\"The Apple\\", \\"The Gamesters Of Triskelion\\", \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\" and \\"The Omega Glory\\", although that was about it and the vast majority of scripts are superb.  Episodes which remain underrated or overlooked among fans to this day include \\"Metamorphosis\\" (my favorite of the entire series), \\"Return To Tomorrow\\" and \\"Patterns Of Force\\".  \\"Assignment Earth\\" could have been developed into a greatseries had it been picked up by Paramount. <br /> <br />This box set is about the same quality as the first, and has the same strengths and weaknesses; the most obvious weakness is the ridiculous price tag, which is nearly twice what it should be selling for.  Otherwise, the sound and picture quality are fine (I really see no reason for complaint in these masters, they're as good as they're bound to get) and the bonus features are mostly great, especially the sections focusing on DC Fontana and Matt Jeffries' recollections on working for the show and the pressures they had to undergo.  Matt Jeffries' boundless creativity--especially given the nonexistent budget he had to work with--was truly flabbergasting.  The segment on Uhura was nice although most fans will know this information already.  The \\"Life Beyond Trek\\" segment with Nimoy was more interesting than Shatner's, but still among the weakest of the features.  What still puzzles me is that more could have been included, such as additional text or audio commentaries on the episodes; given that this is supposed to be the definitive version of the legendary show now available, as much effort should have been put into this as possible.  Overall, however, the set is a must-purchase if you're a TOS fan and probably a good bet for any fan of good TV--just make sure you get it at a discount.
0812550706|5.0|In all honesty, I read this book about 3 times. The last time I read it, which was about 12 years ago (I am now 26), left the same impression on me as the first (when it first hit paperback). This is a fantastic book.<br /><br />I won't go too deeply into describing it, as there are plenty of reviews here that do that. What I will say is this: If this book wasn't very good, why is it that people are STILL reading it and posting a TON reviews here. This book is 20 years old, and it's still being read by tons! I truly believe anybody can enjoy this book, and it will be one of those timeless classics of recent history.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B00070QXL8|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this sequel to Bridget Jones' Diary.  For one, I wasn't initially a huge fan of the first, which I agree is the better of the pair, but it's since grown in intrigue for me as it presents a sympathetic although neurotic character who's trying her best to be lovable but keeps messing up.   <br /> <br />I appreciate the commitment the filmmakers had to this character, who is almost maddeningly paranoid in this second movie, but still has charm, and is believable enough to make you root for her.  Some of the earlier sequences between Darcy and Bridget are too cheesy for my taste, but I liked how they were balanced with squabbles between them as well--they seemed stupid, but so typical of many real couples. <br /> <br />Most of all, I thrilled to the part where I found out, along with Bridget, that Darcy had indeed done his utmost to advocate for her release from the Thai prison.  I was pleased when he fought Daniel the sleazebucket, even if it was a really pathetic and silly sort of wrestling in the fountain.  But knowing the love and righteous anger on behalf of Bridget that motivated him, I thought it was touching. <br /> <br />I liked the proposal scene, and how Bridget insisted to do-over the proposal moment that had gotten ruined.  That was cute.  I'm glad it didn't end with Bridget and Darcy's wedding--hopefully they'll save that for a future sequel!
B000001GY9|5.0|I have listened to these recordings for several years now.  Each time I hear them I recall why I fell in love with Robert Schumann's music and why these performances are incredible.  When one has a recording that combines superb conducting with superb performance by a symphony with superb engineering, something special happens.  And it happens here.  I use audiophile grade headphones for most of my listening along with audiophile grade amplifier and CD player.  I never tire of listening to any of these symphonies.  The second symphony is especially nice, especially the last movement.  The price of these recordings is an absolute bargain.  Most highly recommended if you enjoy romantic music played as it is meant to be heard and to be enjoyed.
B000005RQT|4.0|In rock is not a hard rock album but a tough approach rock album.  I consider it to sound like Roling Stones with harsher vocals and that is not a small compliment since I consider Roling Stones to be one of the finest rock acts ever. The vocals have a bit of metal sound to them, but they sound more like harsher sounding rock vocals. The book-let is a very nice piece of work with the members carved on mount rushmore. The artist did quite a good job and makes the guys look much better then they do in real life, but that shows that they picked the right guy for the job. I love the story about the album and the band. I was quite skeptical if I would actually like this kind of music at all and to my surprise and outmost joy, I like it allot and find them to be good vocalists, musicians and artists.
0552149519|5.0|This book was a wonderful read!  Being from a back ground of OES and Masonry, I was in awe of some of his references.  Dan Brown did excellent research.  This book may be fictional, but it is filled with facts that the reader should take the time to explore more into if they are in doubt.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This 1978 is their best album hands down. This is before they start making music for yuppies and sell out. Songs like Sultan of Swing, Down to the waterline and many others show a raw edge that disappears later on in their careers. Makr Knopler writers good lyrics and the other guys are quite accomplished muisicians in their own right. The book-let is nice and the lyrics are easy to read. The photos show some bad late 70's fashion and they sure could use a haircut all of them. I have no idea what the front cover is supposed to convey. It is this blurred photo of a women in a room. It looks cheap and like it has been shot by an amateur. The music is awesome though and the lyrics are very well crafted.
0805076476|5.0|The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club, and the 2nd is Don't talk about Fight Club. There are a couple of other rules, but they left one out. That being that you should buy and read this book immediately! <br />I have never read anything like this. I first saw the movie, but saw in the opening credits that it was adapted from a book. I bought it, and was never the same. I could not put it down. The best thing about it is the format. It goes back and forth between topics very much, such as Tyler's job as a projectionist and the narrorator's crappy job.  <br />The ending was really trippy. I suggest you all read this book. Now.
B000007ODM|4.0|I personally think they could have dumped the electric guitar since it just adds a layer of noise. The vocals are great and the rest of the instruments sound very nice. The book-let is odd and what does that \\"peom\\" mean. Ameno is a great track and there are more like it. If they had toned down the use of that annoying electric guitar and used more keyboards and the like it could have been astounding. Electric guitar just sounds bad when played with this kind of music and the guy playing it tries way to hard and it sounds really bad at times. I would say that this is a form of new age music that can be enjoyed by all kinds of people. The cover is quite boring abnd the font looks like a cheap metal album. Apart from this it is a good album that deserves it 4 out of 5 stars.
0780020685|5.0|A wild bunch frighten a small town of peaceful people. You know: they steal, rape and decide practically what is right and what is wrong. By mutual agreement they search for a solution and decide to request the support of seven brave men, seven samurais to put order in that tension state and awful mess.<br />This decision will be wise and you will admire the most beautiful sequences under the rain of reluctant poetic ardor ever mede: fight, violence and death are common places nowadays but in Kurosawa' s masterful direction acquire a major status.<br />You will be able to watch it over and over and always will find something new, so typical of the masterworks. Cinematography, art direction, close up, travellings and customer design.<br />Countless similar versions have been made after this monumental film ; Ritt would make a very good remake with The Seven Magnificent, but this is real artistic triumph all the way.<br />One of the sublime masterpieces in any age.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Hitchcock as Bunuel or Fellini was always a demolisher of the Status Quo. Among the three, Hitchcock was possibly the coldest but his poignacy was always conceived by the Hitchcock`s fans as a boutade.<br /><br />Hitchcock involves us in this deligthful satyre with all the discrete elegance and extreme good manners. Don' t ever consider  our starring is a vulgar Peeping Tom. How can you dare?  He is simply a man who is wound and unable to displace, and by this cause his only hobby consists just in taking a little bit around here and there. The illusion through the window is basically the same experience between the viewer and the screen. Window and screen mean the possibility of watching other different realities from the other side of the street.<br /><br />Someway Hitchcock suggestively reminds us but always keeping a discrete distance .<br /><br />But that hazardous Peeping Tom activity has its risks and demands its prize. This occurs when he is the involuntary eyewitness of a murder. And suddenly our beloved friend becomes hunted due its hobby.<br /><br />The rest runs for you my dear reader. A love affair is the secondary argumental line and the huge stage of several open windows seem to work out as a multiple stage. So the camera is a nervous eye until the moment our hero is watched by the assasin. The camera wil be introspective from this moment, and in this case it will be an impotent and mude witness of an unfair and furious human chase.<br /><br />Only Hitchcock knew to handle with these codes as a real magician showing his new tricks.<br /><br />Stewart is simply perfect in this role. Magnificent restoration, superb photograph and as always Bernard Hermann's score is another invisible actor in this cat and mouse game.<br /><br />Voil&aacute;!
B00005MP58|5.0|Yes, I am a period buff.  This movie is one of my favorites.  It is very funny and beautiful all at the same time.  Good sets and good acting make this movie a must have.  The characters will draw you in. I watch it about once a year and have not tired of it yet.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot is a band that doesnt get as much recognition as they deserve.(i used to not give them any either untill my friend got me listening to them) I think the words in their songs have more meaning then most would ever be able to imagine. This album is by far their best and It is with my favoirtes now. Vermilion and Duality are really the kind of songs that anyone should be able to love. Every other song is the same way but alot of people dotn take the time to listen to them. Rock on Slipknot (maggot 4 evEr)
0385338082|5.0|If you like the Shopaholic series of books, you will definitely like this book. The new character Emma, is not as quite as shallow as Becky is. This book is very entertaining and funny, although you have to wonder about this CEO who gets right into this woman's personal life. He was asking some pretty personal questions and making some uncalled for observations. However, that's what makes this book so much fun. Try it!
0446608955|5.0|The book called \\"A Walk to Remember\\", by Nicholas Sparks. A guy name Landon Carter had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town thought he'd fall in love with Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. She was a quiet girl who always carried a bible with her schoolbooks; Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her lonely father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. None of the guys has asked her out.  Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the deeps of the human hearts and lead him to a decision so fair it would send him completely on the road to determination.   <br /> <br /> <br />                                      Sincerly, <br />                               Emily,South Pasadena, California <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TB38C|3.0|[ASIN:B000GIWRIY Roots to Branches]]    Tull fans listen to all new releases intent on finding and appreciating the best in them. But even longtime group member Dave Pegg left the band after having trouble with this one. (When Pegg was unavailable for the sessions, he was replaced on many tracks by crackerjack bassist Steve Bailey, and couldn't come up with the will to play these songs live.)    Tull's sound is sleeker, thanks to sensitive keyboard dynamo Andy Giddings joining the group. Ian Anderson's beleaguered voice could be worse, and some of the songwriting is up to par, particularly on the poetic, environmental warning \\"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\\" and the Hatfields-and-McCoys yarn \\"Valley.\\"    The greatest flaw seems to be a frustrating propensity to tag on meaningless, occasionally even irritating preludes, codas, and interludes, with changing time signatures and tempos and volume. Tull used to use those to meaningful effect; here, they're extraneous and don't help the music. Perhaps, had this 60-minute CD been pared down to a brisk 40-45 minutes, it may have fared better.    Maybe not a ringing endorsement, but from a Tull fan who's heard it all, one can do worse than this.
B000268QB2|5.0|They are, indeed, excellent.  When you see them on video their personality, looks (including Tom Chaplin's endearingly chubby cheeks), and moves (I'm thinking, mostly, of Tim Rice-Oxley's piano-playing style) are -- what should I call them? -- entertaining?   <br /> <br />I saw them once, on Saturday Night Live, in late March 2005, and having no idea who or what they were, searched the NBC website for their name.  Ah, Keane!  OK.  And they are British?  Even better!  (I thought the vocalist's accent was strange -- not weird, just . . . foreign.  But the music is brilliant, altogether brilliant! <br /> <br />So I went on Amazon, bought the CD, and fell in love with them all over again.  The CD's production values are superior.  The sound -- heavenly.  The music -- imaginative, without being overly ambitious.  And the general atmosphere, of sadness and joy intertwined completely -- so emotional, it makes you want to cry . . .  with happiness. <br /> <br />Now for the full disclosure.  I am a fiftyish lady, so I have no clue what young people are talking about when they mention names such as Coldplay, Radiohead or Travis, to which groups they compare Keane.  To me, Tom Chaplin sounds like Paul McCartney (especially in \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\"), and the whole group sounds (and behaves) like the early Beatles.   <br /> <br />Is there anybody among the young reviewers (or, for that matter, people of my generation, who actually listened to the Beatles) who agrees?  Disagrees?
B0002O7XW2|3.0|As a Stephen King adaptation, I would rate &#34;Christine&#34; as maybe 1-2 stars, but as a stand alone horror movie which shares some of King's ideas, it's not bad, but nowhere as entertaining as the novel.<br /><br />Arnie Cunningham is your typical high school nerd, getting picked on the by the shop kids, having his lunch stolen and destroyed by bullies, and getting dominated by his overbearing parents. Arnie's only friend is Dennis, one of the popular kids in school and star of the football team. While driving home from school one afternoon, Arnie sees a beat up jalopy sitting in the weeds of a run-down backyard. Arnie falls in love immediately with the rusted out hulk, and buys the car on the spot. It seems the previous owner had recently died, and now his brother is looking to get rid of the car. Arnie purchase drives a wedge between he and his family when his parents insist the car be kept at a local garage instead of the driveway. As Arnie begins fixing up &#34;Christine&#34;, he begins to change, almost like he's been possessed.<br /><br />There are some great visuals in this film, the burning car scene in particular stands out, as does the &#34;healing&#34; scene where we see fully what Christine is capable of. I like the performances of Keith Gordon and John Stockwell as &#34;Arnie&#34; and &#34;Dennis&#34;, but it's a shame that neither character is fleshed out very well. Robert Prosky as &#34;Darnell&#34; steals every scene he is in, and I wish they had incorporated more of his story into the screenplay.<br /><br />The bullies in the film are laughable stereotypes, and look like they are about 30 years old? Not sure why or how they are still in high school when they are as old as the teacher? And watching &#34;Buddy&#34; try to deliver a line of dialogue is painful. I think the biggest problem I have is that this simply doesn't feel like a &#34;John Carpenter&#34; film, it's too polished, and doesn't deliver the suspense he's known for. This feels like just about any journeyman director could've been behind the camera.<br /><br />Not a bad film, just not a very good one.just about any journeyman director could've been behind the camera.<br /><br />Not a bad film, just not a very good one.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium is a good science fiction movie that went fantastically unnoticed.  It is not however, in my opinion, \\"the best Sci-Fi movie ever\\", or even \\"better than the Matrix\\".  Common praise, perhaps intended to raise it from its pathetically unfair obscurity.  That's not to say it shouldn't be seen.  Quite the contrary.  Equilibrium is a movie that, from the beginning, surprises with its excellent cinematography, big-budgetesque effects, and admirable performances.<br /><br />Set in post WW3, Equilibrium portrays a world fed up with violence, so fed up that they turn to imposing a drug that inhibits emotion.  This, by theory, would neuter man of his violent tendencies.<br /><br />Ok, I thought the setup was cool, so to were the excellent performances by Christian Bale and Taye Diggs.  There were however some annoying inadequacies.  Most notable was the obvious emotion shown by those characters who were supposedly emotion-suppressed.  In fact, the enforcers of societies condemnation of emotion are called \\"grammaton clerics\\" (of which Christian Bale and Taye Diggs both serve), they're supposed to bring \\"sense-offenders\\" to justice (usually by bullet or baking).  However, in key scenes, these clerics would carry on like a bunch of pre-menstrual high-school girls on prom night.  That really hurt the immersion factor.<br /><br />Another minor issue surrounded the ability of these clerics to seemingly bend time and dodge bullets.  About midway through the movie they give that ability some basis, but it would have been cooler if they beefed the science of that up a bit, and did it earlier, as most viewers will probably be going \\"um, ok, cool outfits and all, but how come the clerics are dodging bullets, and everyone else is getting mowed\\"?<br /><br />Minor gripes.  Fact is, I went into this movie with very low expectations, and was completely blown away.  I would have watched The Sound of Music in its entirety just for access to the 5 minute fight-climax at the end of the Equilibrium.  Truly fantastic!<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy as much as I did.<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiaght-climax at the end of the Equilibrium.

B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Watched this for the first time two weeks ago. And I have to agree with the bad reviews here. It was actually an insult to our intelligences I think. <br /> <br />After Gladiator and LOTR, this really is an epic on autopilot. The entire film moves along with no real characterisations, 1 dimensional performances....at great speed so we can get onto the next action set piece.  <br /> <br />Characters saying time and time again through the film how they were going to go down in history...yeah we got it first time, no need to keep repeating it. <br /> <br />I could go on....like this film, but I wont. It was boring, embarassing (we laughed many times, but it wasnt meant to be a comedy, was it?). Just a shallow, waste of money. It could have been something, but it wasnt.
B000002KNI|5.0|This is probably the best live album I've ever heard. Live albums can really be hit or miss, but this one is a hit all the way!<br /><br />Paul and Artie's vocals are virtually flawless. In fact, I prefer a lot of these live versions even over the great original versions. For example, the version of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" on this is FANTASTIC. The vocals are incredible!<br /><br />If you're a fan, or just newly getting into Simon and Garfunkel's music, then you totally can't go wrong with getting this great cd!
B000089CJI|2.0|Listen to M83, Depeche Mode, and New Order. <br />Hell, even Air. <br />This is the most pretentious and dull electro-indie I've ever heard.
B000001ESN|4.0|This is, in my opinion the quintessential Rush release. It bridges the progressive, rock and roll, and even poppy sides of the Canadian trio in a perfect blend, that is sure to leave the listener pulling this disc off the shelf for many years to come. <br />  The fact that radio has run the opening two tracks into the ground does not lessen or take away the enjoyment of \\"Spirit of Radio\\" even after hearing it a trillon times. Alex`s intro is timeless and along with Lee and Pearts masterful interlocking fills makes it easily one of the most recognized rock intro`s in  history. And the next track \\"Freewill\\", which has also been radioized to the point of making many ill, is still one of the greatest Rush songs ever recorded. Thought provoking lyrics by Peart and the instrumental/guitar solo section in the center is one the bands more challenging musical achievements. <br />  Up next is the \\"dark and brooding\\" Jacob`s Ladder. Very tight and logical arrangement, woven into some very odd time signatures and a virtuoso instrumental section. There are many reasons why Neal Peart is considered the professor of the drum kit. This song is one of them. <br />  After the all out prog assualt of Jacob`s Ladder, the disc takes a more poppy turn with Entre Nous and Different Strings. Entre Nous is a very upbeat, and catchy, but easily my least favorite song on the recording. Different Strings is a slower moody song with some nice harmonic work by Alex. While these two songs are by no means bad, they are most likely the reason this disc get`s a 4 and not a five star rating. <br />  The nine minute epic Natural Science closes the disc with another of the bands more challenging and adventurous pieces. A nice acoustic, vocal opens the songs until a beautiful guitar arrangement warps into a roller coaster ride of odd times, and progressive chops. Lifeson solo`s bridge the different sections of the song nicely and the end is a monster of a build up with Peart again demonstrating his total command of the drum kit. <br />  The fact that this cd clocks in at just over 35 minutes amazes me,it really seems alot longer, and it is the only other reason I can think of not to give it a perfect rating. Any new Rush fan or prog rock rock fan in general will like this one for years.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Please ignore the title. <br /> <br /> <br />Green Day had two good albums: <br />\\"1039 / Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\" <br />and \\"Kerplunk.\\" <br /> <br />The others were decent, but not something I would really ever listen to. This is complete trash. Billy Joe spouts off about how much he hates corporate America, and then I turn on MTV and there he is, either being interviewed or playing on a video. The album, supposedly, is an attack on the state of America, yet, from what I see, the ones listening are the rich teeny boppers who used mommy and daddy's money to buy this trash. <br /> <br />The lyrics on \\"American Idiot\\" are vague and uninteresting, especially on the hit single \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams.\\" The music itself is the same Green Day music we've been hearing for ten years. Come on, boys, do something new. <br /> <br />If this is political punk than Celine Dion is early DC hardcore. Listen to Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, or Fugazi. <br />
0804106304|5.0|This book was very emotional. It played on mostly somber emotions though, which I found to be quite depressing. A lot of the book was centered around the pain and suffering these women (the mothers) had to endure, and the trials and hardships the younger women (the daughters) had to put up with. Despite the fact that it had a feeling of sadness, the book was exceptionally written. I found myself flipping through the pages not wanting to stop. Just to see what these women went through, fiction or not, showed me how strong someone can be in any situation. This book told me how to be strong and independent and think quickly, but still using common sense. I would recommend it to anyone that is in need for a good read.

B000099T2L|3.0|ok we all knew beyonce was gonna have a solo album.plus its exactly what i exspected it to sound like.the album does have good choices for singles.the album is ok but i think its estremly overrated,and doesn't warrent 5 grammys at all.but thats life i guess lol.if only black people can when ocars about as much as we when grammys but i digress.i also noticed that beyonce is a somewhat pure mainstream alternative to alicia keys,as keys is a high brow alternative to her. so its really comes down to taste and what side of the fence your on.i have had this album a few months now and i rarely listen to it,it just didn'tb keep me interested.but of course girls like it cause well its girly,but i just thought it was silly and corny.
B00078XGRO|5.0|I received this today and immediately threw it into the DVD player. The film has never looked better and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is superb. You can hear every little noise made by the Borg, as well as every sound effect.  Picture is crystal clear and very sharp. If you're a Star Trek fan, this DVD is a must for your collection.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Los Angeles is not known for being a spooky town, with the palm trees, sunshine and Hollywood. But David Lynch makes it so in \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" a brilliantly elliptical film where nothing is as it seems. With outstanding acting, eerie direction and a thoroughly strange plotline, this is a brain-bender of the best kind.<br /><br />The movie opens with heavy breathing, visions of a lovely young girl being awarded, many teen couples dancing, and a slow descent toward a pillow. Then we cut to a three-way car crash, followed by a pretty young woman (Laura Harring) wandering down the hill to an upscale apartment. But she soon encounters the owner's niece, pretty plucky Betty (Naomi Watts). When Betty learns that the mysterious young lady -- who is calling herself Rita -- has amnesia, she decides to help her find out what is going on.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a promising young film director's life is falling to pieces, because of a pair of malevolent brothers who want a particular young lady to star in his film. And when Betty begins to explore the strange car accident that Rita walked away from, they find that there is a bizarre conspiracy brewing in L.A. Or is there? The path gets more and more twisted, as the boundaries of reality and dreams blur.... and it all centers on a mysterious name: Diane Selwyn.<br /><br />This is a movie that doesn't make sense on the first viewing -- at first it just seems to be a straightforward suspense movie. But David Lynch completely turns that on its ear. Not everything makes sense in this film -- such as the monstrous man behind the restaurant -- but the pieces start to slowly click together as we find out who Diane Selwyn is.<br /><br />When you realize what the first two hours actually are, the film makes much more sense -- a muddied look at Diane Selwyn's life, but fragmented and twisted by her desires. Multiple alter-egos, wishful thinking, obsessive lesbian love, jealousy, rage, and random people and places come into her dream, but reflected as she wants to see them, and tainted by her own guilt.<br /><br />And even the sunny opening scenes, with the starry-eyed Betty arriving in sunny L.A. for an audition, take on a dark tinge when you discover who Diane was, and that she had the same experience. Naomi Watts plays both Betty and Diane, one sweet and innocent, the other bitter and unbalanced. And she's marvelous as both, whether playing a sweet young girl, or a hardened, obsessive starlet. Harding does almost as good a job as Rita, especially as the film starts, but the focus slowly and inexorable shifts to Watts.<br /><br />David Lynch ignores the shiny warmth of L.A., focusing on back-alley monsters, creepy dreams and hit men. He's known for being incredibly weird, and here he doesn't disappoint -- ordinary words and occurances are sinister, and the camerawork is insanely good. The camera slowly descends, wanders down hallways, and creeps to reveal something horrible. A few scenes -- the lesbian love scene, the monstrous restaurant creature that is implied to be in the middle of it -- seem a bit out of place, but then again, their presence could be interpreted in multiple ways.<br /><br />Surrealistic noir is the best way to describe \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" an exceptionally strange mind-bender of a movie. Creepy, beautiful and very very unreal, and not something forgotten easily.o her dream, but reflected as she wants to see them, and tainted by her own guilt.  <br />  <br />And even the sunny opening scenes, with the starry-eyed Betty arriving in sunny L.A. for an audition, take on a dark tinge when you discover who Diane was, and that she had the same experience.

B000068FUM|5.0|This was the CD I started on with the Jayhawks, and I was hooked. Great stories that take you through feelings of a quiet small town in the midwest, crashing at a friends house, and going to a Mom and Pop resturant for breakfast to talk over old times. I didn't really know this type of music was out there when I stumbled upon The Jayhawks.<br /><br />Acoustic guitars mixed with screaming electric leads, and vocal harmony that reminds me of the old Simon and Garfunkle songs. To me these guys are the Bob Dylans of my generation, discussing the real world instead of some hyped up rock and roll world that I can't relate to.  :)<br /><br />I will forever be a Jayhawk Junkie, if they put out a CD it will be in my collection.
6305633177|5.0|Yea, I'm a bitter, long-haired, middle-aged man who dislikes the more recent exploits of Metallica.  However, this DVD is an example of how a great band can be popular yet still keep their underground credibility (now gone).  Putting together bootlegged fan footage with some professional footage makes this DVD visually interesting without resorting to overproduced flashiness.  The footage from their early days (Dave Mustaine!) and the seeming spy camera work on Cliff's drug deals/dens is essential to add to the graininess of the tale.  Even on the \\"present day\\" (1987) footage, the rough camera work with the other 3 drinking beer, listening to the radio (is that Tesla?) and just hanging out is the essence of what Metallica was in the eyes of their long-time fans.  This DVD is a touching tribute to an integral member of the band and an important document in the history of Metallica for those who know nothing of them before \\"King Nothing\\" or even \\"Enter Sandman.\\"
B00079018K|4.0|I spent four hours today travelling, and practically that entire time I listened to this album, all ten tracks, grooving to the beat. There's nothing at all original with this highly polished debut album (Madchester, anyone?). Other UK bands have hit the same notes with the same groove before, but there's something about this album that makes it much more enjoyable than your typical copy cat album, and I can't put my finger on it entirely, except maybe this is what I (at least) need to hear right now. Well-produced groove pop with a great backbeat that gently slides over your ear drums.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Having been a huge fan of Rated R, and enjoyed Songs, I looked forward to getting my hands on this. It seems to me to be a cd of two halfs, the first half for me ( first 8 tracks ), being the more accessable and contains better songs. To me ,it seems to run out of steam a bit after that, trying to grasp attention with gimmicks (Someone In The Wolf & The Blood Is Love ) and guest appearences ( You Got A Killer Scene..), and relying on the impetus of the first half before ending on a return to song writing with the long slow goodbye. May take non QOTSA fans a few listens to get into.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. There's a perfect mix of comedic lightness (most of the scenes on Earth) and hightened tension (most of the scenes on the Enterprise) that really make this one of the best, if not the best, Star Trek movies ever. Plus, it has the Borg. The Borg!
B000001YOW|5.0|But hey, there's where I made a mistake. So in all reality, this album receives 4 stars, and In absentia(which I review about a year ago) gets 5. Anyway, on to this album, now unfortunately when I first get many cds that I buy I review them a year later or so. I've had this album for quite a while, and decided to review it this afternoon. The cd is quite a good one, and like most Porcupine Tree, is a masterpiece of great prog rock.  <br /> <br />The album starts with \\"Bornlivedie\\", which is generally a normal opening  song, with a radio jockey talking, and then some strange ambient sounds. As this song ends, \\"Signify\\" rolls on, and it starts with quite an interesting little riff. Progressing throughout the song, the drums and eventually a guitar solo wrap this one up. It's a damn good instrumental I must say. Next we have the slow, alternative \\"Sleep of no Dreaming\\". This song is relatively depressing I should say, nonetheless has a great chorus, and is pretty damn good as well. Steven lends his hopeless yet familiar vocals to this one. The cd continues on, with another little instrumental called \\"Pagan\\", one that is pretty good as well. Next is my favorite song on the album,\\"Waiting Phase one\\", and why it is my favorite, I don't know. Somewhere between the beautiful verse sung by Steven Wilson, this one tops the rest for me. Next is \\"Waiting Phase two\\", a kind of add on to the first one. Up next is the ending half of the album, with the long and dark \\"Dark Matter\\", which is a perfect end to this kind of dark and eerie album. \\"Dark Matter\\" is filled with neat little ambient sounds, and great guitar solos. Overall, ending a fairly superb album, however, one complaint I can give is that this cd is just a bit stranger than all of PT's other stuff, such as \\"Stupid Dream\\" or \\"In Absentia\\". I haven't heard however the \\"acid trip\\" inspired \\"Voyage 34\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fine album, for Porcupine Tree, and the world. I'm surprised that Porcupine Tree isn't anymore popular in the United States, they'd be perfect to destroy this seamless crap that ends up on our radios everyday. Anyway, buy \\"Signify\\" if you want to try somethin new, or your just another prog fan or PT fan. You most likely will not be disappointed, I sure wasn't.
6305161879|5.0|This film is a piece of art. Every time I see it I find something new to laugh at. <br />This is not a Monty Python film, even if both John Cleese and Micahel Palin act in it. <br />The first time I saw it I was disappointed: was this it? Then I saw it a second time, and could not stop laughing. Other people, including my wife, have reported the same experience. It improves with time, and you cannot say that about many films! <br />The acting is superb. Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis even steal the film from Cleese and Palin, which is a feat in itself. Kline has reportedly claimed that it was his favourite performance. <br />I think that the viewer has to be prepared that the humour might be inspired by the classical Ealing comedies, which moved in a border between the bizarre and the realistic. It is not quite Monty Python, but it is not quite mainstream either. Just take the absolutely absurd characters played by Kline and Palin: they just could, barely, exist in real life.  <br />The story and the characters are more complex than one would expect from an ordinary comedy, and it might also be a reason why it takes a few watchings before the laughter erupts. Then, on the other hand, it becomes one of the truly funniest film ever made.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I was in grade school when I purchased these recordings on cassette tape back in the very early 80's.  I played it so loud it felt like my fillings in my mouth were coming loose.  I have not heard these songs in about 7 years , but when I heard them again recently , I forgot how incredible Ed's solos were and how tight the rythym section sounded.  One of the best VH recordings out there.  If you never listned to VH growing up , get this record.  And I quote the great Diamond David Lee Roth.  \\"And somebody said Fair Warning , Loooooooord strike that poor boy down.\\"  What an awesome record man.
1559409010|5.0|Their belief in organised religion and political organisations might be shaken though...  Most people have already seen this film probably, but this DVD contains the four scenes deleted the day before the premiere. They are viciously funny, but had to be cut since they broke the rythm of the story.  The main reason to watch this film is that it is very funny. This is Python at their peak. It is not a collection of skits like The Holy Grail, it is a real film with a clever and tight story. Beautifully directed by Jones and Gilliam, and again reaffirming the acting genius of Graham Chapman, who is probably sharing a joke or two with Jesus in heaven as of now.  The Pythons have admitted that they set out to write a parody of Jesus, but when they studied the bible they saw to their surprise that his teachings made sense! Let me state this: THE PYTHONS ADMIT TO ACTUALLY RESPECT AND ADMIRE JESUS. They then wondered what to do; they then understood that the problem with christianity is not Jesus - it's organised religion! Leaders who interpret Jesus's teachings to fit their own beliefs and needs, and then demand that we, the rest, make them our needs and beliefs.   It is mainly in the US the film has caused a controversy: other countries where the competition between churches is less and the need to control the \\"flock\\" is less urgent the film is not seen as as dangerous.  Not content with attacking organised religion they actually deliver an even more scathing attack on political extremists - something which tends to be forgotten in the hue-and-cry over the alleged heresy of the film.  The essence of the film is that we should just get on with our lives, don't let anyone manipulate us, or get swept up in hysterical mass-movements. Brian learns it the hard way when he in the end becomes a \\"symbol\\" - not a human anymore - and he is more valuable dead than alive to the movement he, unwillingly, created.  In a funny twist to the film the Roman occupiers come out as quite sympathetic charatcers - after all, they represent an authority governed by reason and law, not by whim and charisma.
B000286S8S|3.0|Well , What can I say , other than that when the hunger is gone it shows through anything you do or try to accomplish in life.  Including my long time musical heros Eddie Van Halen & Alex Van Halen.  Hey Ed & Al , its all right man.  You guys can't always make hits all the time.  Nobody ever bats a 1000 in life.  To me , Van Halen is the ultimate band.  And to all those reviews out there that knock Sammy (AND I AM HUGE DAVE FAN ALSO , I LOVE HIS LYRICS AND HIS FLAMBOYANT STYLE) Sammy did not do that bad of a job as a fill in.  Everybody is different.  As far as which era I like best , its a toss up.  I love the old and I love the new.  Eds hunger is gone and it shows through those three new songs that are on this CD.  There NOT bad , just not up to speed with all the other hit songs you wrote Ed.  Nobody can remain the KING and reign forever.  Dave , Sammy , Mike , Alex and Ed have nothing to be ashamed of with all their accomplishments.  As far as purchasing this CD , thats fine , but if you have the Volume 1 CD , do not bother.  Ed , if your reading this (and I am sure you are) hang in there man.  You and Alex are the greatest in my book.  I always liked the way you two carried yourselves.  Get that hunger back Ed and Al.  Suprise us all with something really heavy next time around.
B00023BLXA|5.0|I just loved this film.  It has SO much in it and was done so well.  It may be my all-time favorite movie to watch again and again. <br /> <br />I can understand why and how the critics panned it. They are looking at it from a tired, old, \\"Old World\\" perspective. I'll get back to you with a review shortly.
B000085RTX|5.0|Right.  I bought this album to give to my boyfriend - it's his type of music - but it ended up that not only was it definately his type of music, but mine as well.  Normally we don't agree.  He likes thrash and power metal, but I like doom and gothic metal.  Or at least that's how it normally goes.  I love this disk.  I absolutely  love this disk.  Nothing like what I normally listen to, but in this there is finally something that he and I can agree on.<br /><br />Kamelot rocks.<br /><br />For a random pick, I think I picked a winner.
038551123X|1.0|Having read several of the first glowing reviews on Amazon, I was very anxious to read this book.  I ordered it with several others, and made sure to read it first.  I guess I didn't read enough of the reviews.  The story line is an interesting and unique one, but that is where the positives end.  The book is short.  The characters are flat.  The plot in unbelievable and filled with cliches.  The writing is remedial.  Worst of all, however, the book is very boring.  The author spends most of his time hammering home the point that Dexter doesn't have normal human emotions or empathy.  I found myself saying \\"Allright, I understand Dexter is devoid of humanity lets move on\\"  about every fifth page.  The ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel with most of the same flat characters.  Needless to say, I won't be reading it.
0312335164|1.0|This was my third Dan Brown's book. I liked the Da Vinci Code, and did like Angels and Demons, but Digital Fortress is just a waste of time. <br />The least you expect from a writer is research, and Dan Brown has not even researched on where Seville is or what are Spaniards habits. Reading the book I found a lot of inaccuracies and cliches that are unacceptable, for instance: <br />- Sevilla is in Andalucia, not in Extremadura, as mentioned at the beginning at the arrival at the airport <br />- People do not dress in black to go to church <br />- Communion is not at the beginning of the mass... <br /> <br />The lack of accuracy in these and some other issues make me believe that the other books are also full of mistakes. <br />And just another thing, the book is not yet translated to Spanish but I do not believe that Spaniards will appreciate his whole approach to Spain and Spaniards, which by the way is very outdated <br />
0609610570|3.0|This is a very lengthy book that don't offer a lot of new ideas.  There are other books that do a much better job in providing useful, valuable ideas, such as \\"Built to Last\\" and \\"First, Break all the Rules\\".  Also, I wonder how credible are the authors' philosophy.  The book identifies several companies as examples to follow.  However, now several years later, the CEO in one of their examples has stepped down for not being able to execute.  I think given a few more years, it will become apparent that their philosophy cannot withstand the test of time.
B00078XKDE|5.0|the kills are unlike any minimalistic band around. There is a lot variation in the build up and construction of the songs. The riffs seem to flow with the vocals, which is very unique. If there is any major band inventing a new style at the moment then I would say it's the kills. I can't yet say if it's any beter than their first cd. It is more experimental, which is good. I think it's more interesting, although their debut does have good melodies too. Not only have they crafted excellent riffs, the guitar sounds are beautiful, and most of it seems to be played in just one take.
1400032717|1.0|This book STUNK.  I will have to admit, that the writer did an amazing job depicting life from the point of view of an autistic child.  that is the only reason that I kept reading after the first 3 pages.  It was sadly predictable from the opening lines, where you could guess everything that was going to happen.  Essentially, don't waste your time unless you are interested in living with autism.  Wait a minute, strike that. Go read Faulker.
1400031362|3.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third book in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith.  While this series is quite delightful, I found this book less entertaining and darker than the first two.<br /><br />The engagement plans of Precious Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni hit a snag when the groom-to-be comes down with a mysterious malady.  Mma Ramotswe not only has to run her detective agency, but also must oversee Mr. J.L B. Matekoni's garage, Tlokweng Rd. Speedy Motors.  This actually becomes more the story of Mma Makutsi, secretary and now assistant detective for the detective agency.  In addition to her detective agency duties, Makutsi is also made acting manager of the garage.  How she motivates the two, lazy, girl-crazy apprentices is a stitch.<br /><br />The agency deals with two cases in Morality for Beautiful Girls.  A government official suspects his brother is being poisoned by the brother's wife.  Mma Ramotswe must infiltrate the household as a guest to investigate the accusations.  Mma Makutsi digs into the backgrounds of four young ladies competing for the title of Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana.  Neither of these cases is as riveting as in the first two books.  Still, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books are better than most \\"fluffy\\" mystery series out these days, and I will definitely pick up book number four, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.
B00004SZWD|4.0|This was a Grammy winner for Stevie Wonder, and the music is great. And, there is a lot of it! On vinyl LP, it was 2 LPs plus a 45!    The mastering on this particular edition of the CD was done with way too much high end, so much so that it may damage the ears. So, if you listen to this CD even close to loud, turn down the Treble setting from around 2K-4K+ down. (Read the following only if you want more EQ setting details: Depending on your speakers and the volume: 4K, down about 4dB; 8K down about 9dB; 16K down about 9dB. MAYBE a small boost around 1K of 3dB. Again, depending on your speakers. :)    Another, older CD of \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" may differ from this one -- ASIN # B0000060NA.    From, \\"Sir Duke\\" to \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", there is some great music to be had on this CD!
B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of light pop music and don't consider myself a Modonna fan in any way.  HOWEVER, with Ray of Light and American Life, she has created something special.<br /><br />Ray of Light is very different in feeling from American Life.  There's an ethereal quality to the tracks that I can relate to.<br /><br />American Life, on the other hand, has a harder edge.<br /><br />The title track \\"American Life\\", \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"I'm So Stupid\\" appeal to me a lot.  I don't really care if she's a legitimate rapper.  I was born too long ago to claim rap as my genre, so I know from nothing there.  The back beat and electronics on these three cuts are excellent; very catchy and danceable.<br /><br />I think the album's greatest weakness is \\"Mother and Father\\".  I've listened to it several times and it still comes across as a painfully immature piece of psycho babble wallowing around.<br /><br />The other tracks are not bad, but don't stand out to me.<br /><br />In the final analysis, I'll buy another album from her if she can come up with something along the same lines.  And folks, let's face it: love her, hate her, whatever, this babe's a force of nature in the music world.  And some of what she puts out there is well worth hearing.
B00001ZULV|5.0|Genesis is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. There are many reasons to this. One, the band lasted from the late 60's to 1999, an amazing frame of time only equaled and surpassed by the Kinks and the Rolling Stones. Two, the band spun off two solo artist superstars: Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Three, the band released many hit songs and albums like \\"That's All\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Land of Confusion\\", and \\"I Can't Dance\\". \\"Turn It On Again: The Hits\\" is packed with the hits from Genesis.     Some fans are going to pick up this album and be throughly disappointed. Why? Because this is a hits album, meaning most of the progressive era Genesis is gone. Genesis went through four (or five, depending on if you count the Anthony Phillips/Chris Stewart era) stages. Stage one was the original quintet, maybe one the most talented group of musicians this side of the Beatles. Peter Gabriel was lead vocals and flute, Phil Collins was backing vocals and drums, Tony Banks was keyboards, Mike Rutherford was guitar/bass, and Steve Hackett was guitar. With Gabriel as the head of the band, the songs were of epic proportions, emphasizing stage theatrics, heavy make-up, and complex musical arrangments. The music is not easy to access and understand right away, making for art rock at it's most progressive. Though critics and hard core fans will claim this is Genesis at it's strongest, it is definitely an acquired taste and takes time and patience to grow on you. I definitely recommend picking up the albums \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\", as they are beautifully produced albums. This album, however, locks onto stages 2-3. These are the stages of when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett left and Phil Collins took over as the lead singer of the band and the sound changed.    The newly formed trio stayed into their progressive roots at first, and created some pop songs during this time with a progressive ting. These include \\"Turn It On Again\\", \\"Abacab\\", and \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\". One hit from this stage, \\"Misunderstanding\\", sounds much more like a stage 3 song than a stage 2. This stage, which is stage 2 from 1975 to about 1981, showed Genesis staying true to progressive form, but starting to do more pop songs. However, with Phil seeing solo success and the progressive rock landscape changing with the new wave 80's, Genesis changed their sound completely with their 1983 release. Making the album self-titled to ensure fans that Genesis was transforming and was a new band from the 70's incarnation, the album was heavy on studio production, synthesizers, and new-wave style instrumentation. It produced many hits, and two of them, the haunting \\"Mama\\" and the top ten mega hit \\"That's All\\", are on this disc and show Genesis growing into prolific hit makers. 1986's \\"Invisible Touch\\" was one of the strongest pop/rock albums of the 80's. Many tracks   are included from this album: The keyboard/synthesizer heavy number one title track, the number three hard rocker \\"Land of Confusion\\" (famous for it's very creative music video), \\"Throwing It All Away\\", the mysterious/deep \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\", and the popular ballad \\"In Too Deep\\". Around this time some people started crticizing the band for sounding too much like Phil Collins solo material (more so in the ballads than rock numbers), but that didn't stop the fans, albums, and songs from becoming popular. It took five years after this album for the band to get back together to release \\"We Can't Dance\\" (a tongue in cheek title by the band, making fun of how unusually popular they were despite their older, less hip image compared to the other young pop stars of the time) in 1991. The album, which hit number one on the charts, said goodbye to the 80's by not being so dependent on synths and keyboards (though they still are in massive supply), thus making for a more mellow and mature sound. Many songs from this album are included as well, such as the peppy \\"I Can't Dance\\", the romantic \\"Hold On My Heart\\", the humorous satire on religious fanatics with \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\", and the melancholy \\"No Son of Mine.\\" After this album, Collins would completely focus on his solo career and leave the band. This would put the hit making stage (stage 3, 1983-1991) to a close. Stage four would keep Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, but add Ray Wilson as the vocalist and studio musicians for drums/second guitar. One album would be released from this period, \\"Calling All Stations\\" (highly underrated), and one song from this stage (stage 4, post-Phil Collins), \\"Congo\\", is on the album. For Gabriel fans, \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" is included and the original quintet reunites to make a new version of the beautiful \\"Carpet Crawlers\\". (Adding two songs from stage one, 1970-1975, featuring the original five and making for a great balance of all the time frames.)    Yes, some songs are missing (\\"No Reply At All\\", \\"Never A Time\\", etc.) and there are some edits (\\"Mama\\", \\"Abacab\\", \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\"), but for a compilation of the hit songs from one of the strongest bands in rock history, this is the album to pick up. Get it today.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|When Tim Robbins and Sean Penn won Academy awards for their roles in \\"Mystic River,\\" I just knew I'd see the film sooner or later.  Plus, I love Tim Robbins' progressive politics anyway.  This movie was such a letdown.  It ran too long.  I didn't sympathize with Robbins' character in the slightest.  I loved Robbins' dorky look and I loved Penn's muscular torso, gray temples, and big hair.  However, any admiration stops there.  This film was a bunch of nothing.  I don't know why Laurence Fishburne put on so much weight for his role.  This film wouldn't help people understand the sexually abused better and it  wouldn't help the sexually abused come to terms with their tragic victimization.  I love the way that sports balls falling into sewers was a metaphor here.  In fact, they should have played it up more.  Still, very disappointing.  This must be one reason why moviegoers don't take the Oscars seriously.
B0008GNJZY|2.0|Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol.2, XXX 2: State Of The Union) plays Coach Ken Carter who becomes the new coach for a High School in which he went to when he was in school. Richmond is the name of the school and The Richmond Oilers is the name of the team he coaches. Jackson has them sign contracts in order to be a part of the team. In that contract is stuff like...he has to be on time for class, sit in front of the class, wear a tie and suit on game day and maintain a C average grad point to graduate. Not the most inspiring movie in my mind but it had its moments...I mean, you guys might find this uplifting and WOW!! but I found it to be longish and boring really and it sorta played off like a cheesy TV movie like on the Lifetime. Only Jackson gives off his usual blazing brilliance. Also starring Rob Brown and singer Ashanti who isnt impressive..mostly annoying.  <br />
B0000X61UU|5.0|I wish Cindy (or someone) would make another all-over full-body workout like this one.  I've bought tons of exercise videos over the years but always come back to this workout because I know I don't have to do anything else that day, well any other exercise anyway ;-) <br />The leg work is tough and beginners may have to do half of the workout at first, but don't give up! <br />This is one of my top 5 fav exercise videos.
0553275976|5.0|I felt like I couldn't put this book down.  Before I read it, I had had some idea that it had to do with the \\"upperclass\\" New York social scene in the 40s.  <br /> <br />Not exactly. <br /> <br />I was surprised to find that it all takes place in the 80s, and is a tongue-in-cheek look at the racial divide.  Although it does have to do with the \\"upperclasses\\" versus the \\"lowerclasses\\". <br /> <br />If you think that's boring, I promise it's not!  Tom Wolfe has a great writing style that uses lots of exclamations!  I loved it, it's the first book like that that I read, and it really adds humor to the situation, so that it's not a serious, boring novel about the black/white divide, but rather a funny look at a serious problem in the States today. <br /> <br />So, if you're not intimidated by a book with more than one thousand pages, definitely read this book.  For me, the more pages, the better, because I hate to see a good book end.
B00005MKA1|5.0|THis album is the best way to start your Bob Marley some say its better to buy one of the greatest hits albums like 'Legend' or 'One Love', but this album is by far the best of most Bob Marley's albums but all are good. In this album you hear the reble spirt of Bob Marley in songs such as 'Kaya'. Kaya which is the bud of the marawana plant. The sounds and rythems in this album are amazing. So you MUST BUY this ALBUM!!
0553108034|5.0|Don't get me wrong I'm totally immersed in this series. I think GRRM is a literary genius...but, uh...maybe there are just a little too many characters and mini stories going on at the same time.  I thought the format was great in the first book, but then in this book here comes more personalities.  Fine, fine-the story is evolving--I get that.  Yeah, I get the fact that we are set up to never feel safe within any character and therefore you're afraid to get attached to anyone.  I get it, I get it. I love this series, I hate this series. I wished it would end and I wish it would never end.  Go figure.
B000002U82|5.0|Indeed when Dark Side Of The Moon was released Pink Floyd was considered one of(if not) the best musicians. To make an album like this back in 73 its because you do have musical talent. Like it's known this album has been an inspiration to atleast 90% of artists nowadays and will keep doin so for many many years ahead. This is a must indeed for your collection. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, Mre BW doesn't even know where he, she is standing. Ignore the ignorant.
B000777J2S|4.0|I realize that the title of this review is a total copout, but for the first time I can remember, I can't decide whether this disc is audacious, skillfully orchestrated pretension, or if it is pure unadulterated genius.  First things first.  \\"Antony\\" has a stunning voice, and yeah, while that voice sounds somewhat similar to both early Brian Ferry and Nina Simone, it is something else entirely and an undeniably powerful instrument.  While there are elements of cabaret and a host of other musical influences, he is, first and foremost,a blues singer. <br /> <br />So where is the problem?  I'm not convinced that there is one...\\"Hope There's Someone\\" is as powerful an expression as I have heard in a looooong time from a pop singer.  But I do weary of the sexual identity crisis lyrical obsession and the overall melodrama of the thing.  Hence the copout.  Check back with me at the end of the year and I'll let you know if I get enough courage to take a stand.
1564021017|5.0|This is a good one! <br /> <br />A simple plot  (Where is Mommy?) <br /> <br />Sweet pictures <br /> <br />Gentle repetition in the text is very appealing to very young children <br /> <br />Portrays realistic relationship between siblings <br /> <br />Teaches about animals as they really are, not as pretend humans  (Yes, owls are awake at night and asleep in the day.  The mommy owls go out to hunt for food and bring it back to the babies.) <br /> <br />We've had this book for years and still love it!
0440180295|4.0|This book was very strange but interesting.  It was very hard to follow in how he jumped from what was actually happening to things that have happened in the past, and then jumping to the present then random years.  I found it very interesting because what he was talking about was very interesting.   <br />   <br />  In the beginning of the book, he kept talking about how he always wanted to write a book about war, but could never think of enough details to put in it.  He was also very humorous in telling random details about everything.  He mentioned his wife and how he studied Optometry. How his daughter ended up marrying a Optometrist so it stayed in the family.   <br /> <br />  This book was kind of crazy in the sence that he felt he was abducted by aliens.  No one believed him. He ended up publishing letters in the newspaper. He thought that everyone would believe him if he kept writing letters.  <br /> <br />  I thought it was pretty cool how Weary was from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (my hometown).  You never find how people in a book from your city in a city like this.   <br /> <br />  I didn't like, however, the random jumps of how he was in a different place he actually was there, and you didnt really understand how he got there and then he blinked and he was back into what he was doing before.   <br /> <br />  I think that i would have liked it a lot more if the things went in a chronilogical order instead of jumping from year to year so that i would be able to follow it better. I also think that if it was like that it would have ruined the whole effect of the book.   <br /> <br /> <br />  I like Vonnegut's style and i feel that i will read many more of his books.
184121602X|4.0|I have no affiliation with the author or publisher. Just picked it up in a bookshop.<br /><br />The prose lilts along as perfectly as Judith Kerr's \\"The Tiger Who Came to Tea\\". Its (nearly) as funny for adults. My boys (ages 3 and 5) have requested it daily since it arrived in our house last week.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if it has the desired effect: the boys now swear they will never eat a tomato. But there's been a lot of smiling at bedtime.

B000092Q4U|5.0|As The Palaces Burn would have to be one of the best compact disk out there. Amazing Riffs, Razorblade Solos, mind blowing drums, this is deffinently a classic
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Just a very, very good movie. Depp always seems to out-do himself. Winslet was enchanting. If we weren't so jaded as a society then the premise of this movie wouldn't seem so odd. I laughed and then fell into tears all within an hour, so something must of been done right.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I had first heard of the Beatles when I saw Ringo Starr on Shining Time Station when I was a kid. I heard about Octopus'Garden and Yellow Submarine. My uncle had this CD and played \\"Yellow Submarine\\" back in 1997 or 1998 and I checked it out from the library a few times in 1999 and I grew to be a huge Beatles fan. This album has most of their early songs digitally remastered and at top sound quality. The one problem with Beatles is there were so many hits that they have no good greatest hits album, you have to buy all kinds of albums to get all of their good songs. This album is one of those albums easily worth the money.
1400032717|3.0|Probably my favorite part of this book was the point of view it was told in. I've never quite seen anything like it and this was partially what kept me interested until the end. This is definitely a character driven novel and through Haddon's spectacular situations and simplistic yet advanced vocabulary he manages to portray to the reader a very unique boy by the name of Christopher Boone. However, I did find myself enjoying the beginning more than the end. As the book neared its finish line, it somehow seemed to lag and the plot seemed a bit petty. Overall, I did enjoy this read and would reccommend it to others for the most excellent writing strategies and devices used.
0783232039|5.0|This is one movie that I can watch so many times without getting bored! I think that the makers of the film made a great choice in turning the chucky series in this new direction. <br /> <br />Bride of Chucky adds a funny new killer doll into the series, none other than Chucky's bride, Tiffany. This brings a stylish and creative sense into the movie.  <br /> <br />Tiffany ressurects chucky and they go on a killing spree, trying to find an amulet that will get them out of their doll bodies, into humans. This movie has great lines and a great plot that will keep you laughing and interested in seeing what happens at the end.
B000000OQF|1.0|I got this album due to its repuation as being the greatest metal album of all-time, yada yada, but I was sorely disapointed. This CD stinks. It is plain to anyone with ears that Guns N' Roses is just a huge rip-off of Creed. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" is a third rate \\"What if.\\" \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine\\" is a poor man's \\"With Arms Wide Open.\\" And the list goes on and on. That hack Axl Rose is such a Scott Strapp wannabe it's not even funny. All of Slash's solos are straight out of Mark Tremonti's songbook. Anyone who says this CD is good doesn't know a thing about rock n' roll.
B00000F566|5.0|This movie has a formula summer romance and great sexy dancing. Dirty dancing means close sexy dancing with wonderful dancing music. Seven new songs were written specifically for the movie. Jimmy Lenner, the executive producer of the soundtrack, wanted to make sure that the new songs had their emotional roots in the early sixties. To him, this was imperative in making the music blend seamlessly into the film. The new songs needed to be as immediate and poignant in 1987 as they would have been in 1963. The new songs included \\"The Time Of My Life\\", \\"Hungry Eyes\\", \\"You Don't Own Me\\", \\"Where Are You Tonight\\", and \\"She's Like The Wind.\\"
6305696071|5.0|In my opinion, pretty woman is a movie that you can never get tired of watching, it is a cinderella story and it is a feel good movie. I just absolutely adore and love the movie.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic, one of the best horror movies ever made, and certainly the best slasher movie ever made. This is the start of the best horror movie series, and the start of Michael's terrifying journey to find his family. It's also the start of laurie's journey in escaping Michael.<br /><br />This first Halloween movie is very simple and easy to follow, you don't have to do alot of thinking to understand it. You can just lean back and be scared as you watch this kick a** slasher.<br /><br />From the very beginning, your eyes are glued to the screen. The movie includes teenagers, babysitting, and murders. Everything that makes up a great horror movie. If you havn't watched the movie yet, I highly suggest you do so right now.
B00067189O|1.0|I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection. What can I do with this disc - region 1, in Europe (region 2)? My message for Sony Corporation is: \\"This format will not exist for long with DVD region protection! Sorry.\\". <br />My first, and last DualDisc. Back to the SACD!
6300216209|3.0|The acting isn't that good. However, this movie is guaranteed to make you cry. It is a classic tearjerker. The musical score of the movie is terrific and won awards. This movie is mostly for people who saw it years ago and would like to see it again to bring back memories.
0767812166|5.0|This underrated sci-fi is a joy to watch. Karen Allen stars as Jenny Hayden, a young widow who wakes one night to find someone in her house who looks exactly like her dead husband Scott. Jeff Bridges plays an alien who is sent on an investigative mission after his people intercepted the Voyager probe, which was carrying details of earth and its inhabitants. In a naive attempt not to frighten Jenny, the alien takes on the form of Scott.<br />The alien has crash landed and has only 3 days to cross the USA to a rendezvous point where he will be rescued. A terrified Jenny is forced to drive the being and she initially is, naturally enough, very hostile. As their journey across the States progresses however, Jenny begins to learn more about this strange and gentle being and a burgeoning relationship develops. Meanwhile government agencies are in hot pursuit, their aim is to capture, interrogate and kill the alien.<br />This is a film that is gentle and moving but also manages to build up tension as the chase is on, and fine acting from all the leads adds to the quality. This film is great for anyone wanting something a little more thoughtful than the usual action packed, special effects filled type of movie in this genre.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Before you just skip over the review becuase i'm not ranting about how good it is, just take the time to read it. I read reviews in magaznes like Entertainment Weekly which said this movie wasn't really that good. They said it was dry and boring. So, i pretty much just ignored it. Then, a bunch of my firends saw it and were telling me how funny it was. At first i just argued with them, saying that it really wasn't that good, but i really had no basis to do so. I eventually gave in and when it came out on DVD, i rented it. It was only about 90 minutes, it would be that bad.... <br /> <br />Well i put it in my DVD player and sat there and i watched the whole thing. I laughed, i didn't fall on the floor laughing, but i did luagh, becuase it was funny. But about 45 minutes into it and it started to lose me. It just got boring. There was never really any plot established. There was that thing about the election, but nothing was ever developed. The ending came around, and Pedro wins the election, but i didn't seem to care. It was like the writer just tried to squeeze all this stuff into the last 45 minutes and it just became painful to watch, but i did finish it. <br /> <br />There is one reason people love this and one reason only, and i'm not saying i don't fall into this category. Napoleon is a nerd, and as you probably now, nerds are not the most popular people in shcool. htey get picked on by the \\"jocks\\" and when those \\"jocks\\" watch this movie, they laugh at the Napoleon because they feel superior to him, they think they're better. As a matter of fact, anybody who isn't a nerd (or who tries to deny the fact and never accept it) feels the same way. It's the same reason that these people pick on nerds and laugh at them. I'll admit that i am one of these people and do in fact pick on the nerds, so i'm not going to lie to you. Now, the nerds see Napoleon and can realte to him and laugh at him that way, becuase they feel like they share his experinces. <br /> <br />As i said, i did laugh, and i have repaeted SOME of the lines, becuase they were kind of funny. But, it just wasn't a good movie. If you could just look past the Napoleon and Kip and whoever else for just a second and look at the actual movie, you'll realize there is nothing there. The movie is just an excuse to put a bunch of nerds on screen make people laugh at them, not to make a movie. So, if you can accept that this really isn't a movie, you'll enjoy yourself, and i don't mean that as an insult. But, if you're like me, and you watch a movie in hopes that there is something there and that the movie is treated like the art form it really is, you won't make it through the whole movie, you might fall asleep. <br /> <br />If you're looking for some good comedies in 2004, check out \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" or, despite negative critic reviews, \\"I Heart Huckabees\\". Also, if you're looking for a mindless comedy that is still extremly funny, and does have some kind of story going on, check out, \\"Team America:World Police\\". It is a perfect example that is funny the whole way through, has some kind of plot, and has some kind of intelligence.  <br /> <br />\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is decent for what it is, but that's about all, it has nothing more.
0767812387|5.0|When DANCE WITH ME came out on VHS, we were urged to go right out and rent it because the reviewer felt it deserved more attention than it received in theaters. Upon renting it, we were amazed at the amount of music and dance pouring over us. The woman in the beginning dance scenes made our hearts stop and the blond female singer in the Cuban nightclub was mesmerizing. We have tried several times to determine who they are. But this was just the beginning. One is transported past any failings of the story by the driving rhythms and dancing. The music makes you want to move; the dancing makes you want to find a dance studio. The conflict between dancing for the joy of it and dancing in competition is well delineated without overpowering the more important and sometimes subtle points of the film. In addition to the outstanding performances of Vanessa Williams and Chayanne, this film is full of delightful surprises such as Jane Krakowski's stunning dance with Chayanne, Joan Plowrights fun-filled participation,the \\"community dances\\" at the Cuban nightclub, and spectactular dances from current and past participants in actual dance competitions. The hullabaloo at the dance competition is augmented with the talent, humor, passion, disappointments, and beauty that is dance. The morning after watching and thoroughly enjoying this film, on several levels, we decided to \\"just watch the dancing\\" before taking it back to the video store. Two hours later we rushed to get it back before the deadline! It is not possible to \\"just watch the dance sequences\\". We have repeatedly viewed, shared and recommended this film.  We wore out our VHS versions and purchased the DVD. Any serious dance enthusiast should have this film in the library along with STRICKLY BALLROOM, SHALL WE DANCE, and the many classic musicals now available on DVD.  This review is based on both VHS and DVD versions.
630522577X|5.0|This great movie from 1964 is the winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture Of The Year. Rex Harrison won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Audrey Hepburn, playing Eliza, was not even nominated for Best Actress once it was learned that her voice was dubbed over for some of the singing in the movie. This was not even mentioned in the credits and was a slap-in-the-face to movie-goers. In the 2-CD set some of Hepburn's dubbed over voice is restored for the viewer.
B000002JAX|5.0|Listening to this album it is hard to believe this isn't one of the great black female Jazz artists from the 30's or 40's. Madeleine Peyroux has a voice very reminiscent of Billie Holliday yet uniquely her own. She delivers her songs with a style and maturity way beyond her years; she was a mere 22 years old when she recorded this. As well as covering some well-known numbers Ms Peyroux performs some of her own songs proving she is as talented a songwriter as she is a singer. There isn't a track on this album that isn't flawlessly performed but particularly outstanding are 'La Vie En Rose' and 'A Prayer'.<br />This is an album that you want to listen to with the lights low and curled up in a comfy chair.... bliss.
0440180295|3.0|The book Slaughterhouse-Five was a good, yet hard to read, novel.  The righting style reminded me of Hemingway, with all the short sentences.  The way that the main character, Billy, continually drifts off topic and how the book jumps from place to place strongly reminded my of Catcher in the Rye.  If you enjoyed either of those books, then Slaughterhouse-Five would probably be a good read for you. <br />However, the story is rather hard to follow right from the beginning.  Vonnegut starts the novel as a biography of how he lived after World War II and how he was pestered to right this book.  But out of nowhere, the story suddenly changes to revolve around Billy Pilgrim and his life in the war.  Vonnegut's story about Billy continues to leap from place to place, and even skips around in time throughout the novel.  The skipping around really got to me and eventually led me to believe that Billy, or Vonnegut, was a schizophrenic.  It almost became annoying and sometimes made me want to stop reading, but there always seemed to be a part that would come along and catch my interest.  I must say that even though the writing style could become annoying, the main plot always seemed to pull me in.  Vonnegut uses crude language every now and then, which is normally fine with me because it's not like it's in bad taste.  Now Vonnegut did not write in bad taste, but the language would come up so unexpectedly that I would usually have to read the sentence twice to realize what I just read. <br />Overall I would have to say that this book, Slaughterhouse-Five, is a good read for a weekend or something nice to take on vacation, as that's what I did. <br />
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Clearly this is not Shakespeare or Austen. It's fun and frothy Brit romantic comedy that reminds many of the foibles of our lives. Bridget is back at the same time next year from Bridget the Movie I. Back at Mummy's annual New Years Turkey Curry. Only this time, both she and Mark Darcy are in funky sweaters (or, as the folks on the other side of \\"the pond\\" call them, \\"jumpers.\\") But what happens in \\"happily ever after?\\" There are rollicking rocks - and a Thai cocained international diplomatic aplomb - along the way to continuing romance.<br />Even if you saw Bridget the Movie II at theatre, the DVD is worth another go. Renee as Bridget interviewing Colin Firth as Colin Firth alone is well worth the price of the DVD. But wait! Buy now and also get the \\"Stop the action! Who's Your Man?\\" quiz - which, as one is happily viewing the movie, pops up periodically to ask the viewer \\"What would you do?\\" What a hoot! Try it and see which, if either, of Bridget's beaus is right for you.<br />/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Nothing in this movie had me laughing harder than the main character throwing up in the alley behind the bar after getting drunk.  I mean, we're talking 90 good seconds of up-close puppet puke.  My abs were sore from laughing at that scene.  Beautiful.
0553212478|2.0|The idea of a mad scientist creating a human monster was a great idea--especially in the year 1816.  However the book is boring...implausible...over-written...under-edited...and boring.  So why is is so famous?  Let's face it, today nobody would have heard of, much less read, this book if the 1931 movie hadn't made it famous; yet the book and the movie have very little in common.  So why does it get such great reviews?  Again, let's face it, the title is so famous that most people don't want to say that they don't get it.  But there's very little to get, other than what you read into it--the emperor has no clothes!  But credit to Shelley for a truly great idea.

B000002KXV|5.0|Any fan of Steely Dan would not be caught without Donald Fagan's first solo effort.  This album is critically acclaimed for the many colorful arrangements including the title track, I.G.Y. and my favorite, Greenflower Street; which simmers to the brim with jazz reminiscent of the 50s era.  Do yourself a favor and get this album FIRST!  You cannot go wrong.
B0007P3582|5.0|I gave grotd 5 stars because it was flawless. for this album all the songs are good or decent, none that are weak. So I think it gets five stars. It is near die tryin. Although I think it is better than Games CD that CD didnt agree with me. Maybe there was 7 songs on the game cd I  liked. #2,#3,#4,#6,#9,#10 and#18. All the songs on Massacre are good. Overall I am glad i got this the real copy and not bootleg like I got Thug Matrimony uuuggghhh. <br />     Top Ten songs <br />In My Hood <br />Im Supposed to Die Tonight <br />Get In My Car <br />Piggy Bank <br />Ski Mask Way (THE BEST) <br />Just A lil Bit <br />Gunz Come Out <br />My Toy Soldier <br />God Gave Me Style <br />Hate It or Love It <br />I think that the dispute between game and 50 was just to sell records I think its funny that the day after it came out the beef was over????? Yayos cd is going to be a classic. When is it going to come out. G-G-G Unit. They always make the best records there is not a weak G-Unit Record. But some of 50's underground cd's were weak. Whoevers listening check out Guess Whos Back 50's best Record so far.  <br />

B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  The cast was well chosen; the actors did a great job on their own and interacted with each other successfully to create a perfect blend of personalities.  The performances were very believable and the characters' relationships played out well, growing naturally over the time span represented.  I cared very much about the characters - always the goal in films and plays, but not always the result.  A longtime fan of both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, I was very pleased to see wonderful performances from each of them again in this film.  The children were real, fully developed characters - not just walk-ons or used as \\"window dressing\\".  Young Peter's turmoil nearly broke my heart.  The filming was beautiful throughout - even knowing the story of Peter Pan, seeing it presented to the theater audience and the private showing at the family's home, watching the first time viewers' surprise and delight pulled me into the story with a new sense of wonder.  As the title of my review states, I found this film thoroughly enchanting - absolutely worthy of its Best Picture Oscar nomination.  I bought the DVD a week ago and have watched it three times so far - still smiling, laughing and crying as the moment touches me.  This will be a favorite film of mine for a very long time.
B000002UAF|4.0|It's said that Beach Boy Brian Wilson's reaction to hearing RUBBER SOUL was \\"It's a whole album worth of great songs...\\" If this one (3 albums earlier) isn't ALL great, it's darn close. Every track here carries a Lennon/McCartney credit and all but 2 are at least good with several Beatles classics in there as well.<br /><br />The album couldn't possibly have started any stronger. The opening chord to \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" blasts out of your speakers like a bullet out of a gun barrel and from that point on the Beatles seem bent on proving they are the best band in the world. Along the way we're treated to rocker \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" and Paul's first really good ballad (\\"If I Fell\\").<br /><br />Clunker \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\\" gums up the proceedings a bit but lovely Spanish tinged ballad \\"And I Love Her\\" resumes the roll of great songs. The momentum doesn't slow again until \\"Tell Me Why\\".<br /><br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" is a great song in terms of its structure regardless of any complaints Lennon may have later made about it. The problem is the production sounds just a bit thin on the chorus harmonies. That and the section in the 3rd verse right after Paul sings \\"only listen to my pleas\\" is VERY shrill and painful. It should have been reworked. What could have been a great song becomes an also ran among their better works.<br /><br />\\"Can't Buy me Love\\" recovers from the stumble with the idea of opening the song with the hook, an idea that was very new (never before done?) at the time. It's a Beatles classic and an all-time great in the annals of rock.<br /><br />After this, things tone down a bit again but there are two more really great songs before the album ends: underrated ballad \\"Things We Said Today\\" (unusual in that it contrasted its optimistic love you forever lyric with very \\"dark\\" sounding acoustic guitar figures and somewhat jarring harmonies) and \\"You Can't Do That\\" which married John Lennon's jealous threat to a girl to an chipper pop melody.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" are among the best songs rock music has produced. The album has very few missteps. This is where the Beatles begin to take shape.d \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" are among the best songs rock music has produced. The album has very few missteps.

B00006NSGX|4.0|I've been a Clapton fan for over thirty years. This set is, undoubtedly, the best \\"live\\" collection I've ever purchased, regardless of the band / musician. The sound is crisp, and the band is polished. If it wasn't for the cheering of the fans, this 2 CD set could pass for a studio album. And, from my perspective, that's the mark of tight, well rehearsed group of musicians, and a fine supporting cast. This does not mean that the performance is identical to the studio tracks. Far from it. Clapton manages to give a remarkable twist to a bunch of old favorites, including some new surprises. The temperment is a bit more subdued than his earlier \\"Just One Night\\" live set, but Clapton can still rock. The set represents five tunes from his \\"Derrick and the Dominos\\" set, including a beautiful rendition of \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\". And, who else but Clapton, could close a show with a version of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" that brings the entire performence to a great culmination? <br /> <br />I don't normally promote live albums. But this is Clapton, and this is good stuff. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JL9B|5.0|To begin with, yes, I rented this video because I'd heard that it was a very controversial film- a bloody tale in which a class of high school kids are forced to play cat and mouse and kill each other until only one remains.<br /><br />And yes, I received that. But I was completely shocked that I also got a very serious, character-driven, emotional drama. If you're into this movie because of the violence, don't worry, you'll be happy. But for those quick to turn away because they think this will be another crazy, senseless, far-out Japanese trash film? I have to tell you- you're very wrong. I went into this film wanting to see just how flashy and violent it would be, and walked away from it with a much higher opinion. This movie didn't insult my intelligence with two hours of nonsense. Instead, it captivated me with emotional tales of life, loss, love, and friendship. These kids aren't just disposable fodder. The movie makes sure we understand that they all had lives and dreams.<br /><br />The film's premise is explained quickly but paced expertly: In a future Asia, things are horrible and some adults have rebelled against the youth that spites them. One man in particular, a high school teacher, goes with his unruly class on a field trip. They're shocked to find themselves being hustled into a room under supervision of armed militants and told that their lives are at an end. Each of the 40 kids are given a bag of rations and a random weapon, and shoved out onto an isolated island where they must kill each other, or be killed themselves.<br /><br />As strange as this may sound, I was surprised at how well these scenes played out. These kids are fine actors. Extreme disbelief, shock, rage, confusion, terror- it's all on their faces as they slowly take this message in. Some rebel and are quickly disposed of. Others fly into rage at what they see. Most others however shrink into the corners of the small room and try their best to accept the impossible fate before them. Soon though, the music goes low and the faces get stark as the kids are rushed, one by one, out into the wilderness. They look at their friends and hastily embrace for what they know will probably be the last time.<br /><br />As I said, there is of course a lot of violence in the film. It's comparable to the first Kill Bill, or perhaps the original Robocop. But the controversy following this film is due simply to its theme of high schoolers killing high schoolers, and also due to the film's dark tone. I reiterate: This isn't a rocking, stylistic gun glamorization. Some of these kids fall backwards in fear, not wanting to fire upon their friends. Others recoil in shock when they do what's required. Others simply attempt suicide to free themselves of the burden. The subject of this movie is not taken lightly. The mood is dark, the situation desperate.<br /><br />Driving things home are vignettes of the kids. Often, we're given glimpses of these people's lives. We see exuberance of youth- a shy boy trying to find a way to let a girl know he likes her. A girl who's happy to bring cookies to her friends for the field trip. Another boy who just lost his father and is trying to cope. The basketball game where these kids last shared their lives together. This film is about loss, primarily evidenced by the loss of innocence and youth that these kids experience when they know they have to kill their best friends. Heightening the film is a gorgeous, poetic soundtrack of classical music that is expertly juxtaposed against the agony and misery that these people have to go through.<br /><br />The film makes sense, has a well-paced, intelligent narrative, and interesting circumstances. Some kids can't handle what's happening, others glory in it. Some are experts, some are terrified. Something important is constantly going on, and by the end, it's a sad, moving piece of human drama regardless of who wins- if anyone. Well acted, well scored, with raw and realistic dialog, and fantastic direction.<br /><br />Yes, if you strip away all narrative, this is a movie about kids killing each other. But to my pleasant shock, it was also one of the most moving, emotional dramas about life and loss that I've ever seen. And not just life, but what it means to live., and fantastic direction.  <br /> <br />Yes, if you strip away all narrative, this is a movie about kids killing each other.

B000002KDI|5.0|It simply doesn't get much better than this. 'Live Rust' presents one of the three greatest male rock artists of all time (Dylan and Springsteen being the two others) and his estimable backup band, Crazy Horse, in all of their full raging and tender glory on what was probably their best tour ever.  The set sequencing is perfect and builds to a raging finish --how can you top ending your set with the triumverate of \\"Like a Hurricane\\", \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\", and \\"Tonight's the Night\\" ?  The acoustic set comprises all phases of Neil's career up to that point, including early standouts such as \\"Sugar Mountain\\" and \\"I am a Child\\".  The album, in fact, works just about as well as 'Decade' in being a comprehensive 1970's career summation and shows why many critics picked Neil at the end of that decade as its greatest rock 'n roller --- few artists can sound equally as comfortable going from acoustic folk to hard rock and a punk/grunge sound and back again.  He would temporarily lose his footing in the 1980's before 1989's excellent 'Freedom' album put him back on the right path, but 'Live Rust' captures Neil Young at what may remain his all-time career peak as a singer and songwriter. <br /> <br />Now, the question remains: why have so many of rock 'n roll's greatest live performers --- Springsteen, the Who, and U2, just to name three as a start --- yet to put out a definitive commercially-released live album that's as good as the bootlegs ?  If Neil can do it, these other guys can as well.
B000002UAC|3.0|Looking at the track lineup for this CD, a younger (American) fan might wonder WHY the mop-tops were such a big deal in 1963? (They owned all top 5 chart positions in the U.S. at one point that year.) The answer is that the American label, Capitol, had \\"chopped up\\" several British Parlophone Beatles releases and developed their own album called \\"Meet the Beatles\\" which included \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and all-time rock classic \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and left off 5 of the cover songs that appear here. It made for a much stronger album than the British version you get here. Also keep in mind that strong singles like \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" were released that year in the U.S. but never placed on album.<br /><br />In fact, I'd argue that even compared against \\"Please Please Me\\" (the U.K. premiere LP) this is a step BACKWARDS for the band. Like the first one, there are 8 originals, but the strongest Beatle penned tune here is \\"It Won't Be Long\\", which makes for a decent opening track but not anywhere as explosive as \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" was. \\"All My Loving\\" is a good midtempo Paul number but not really a \\"classic\\" from him. \\"All I've Got to Do\\" is probably one of the weakest Lennon/McCartney tunes until the \\"White Album\\" era. And once again, they've included Motown covers that compare unfavorably with the originals (The Beatles, at least at this point, did not have particularly \\"soulful\\" vocals. Their version of \\"Money\\" doesn't stack up to Barrett Strong's. The backing vocals on \\"You'Ve Really Got a Hold on Me\\" are terrible. The best cover, \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", is only average.)<br /><br />On the good side, the show tune done here (Paul's vocal on \\"Till There Was You\\") is done in a good arrangement that works for the band and in this regard it's better than last CD's \\"A Taste of Honey\\". \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" and \\"Little Child\\" are good, if not great, Lennon/McCartney originals.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is a band on the cusp of something great. They've given hints of it here and there. But it's not until the 3rd CD that the group magic kicks in.<br /><br />The Beatles may have hated how Capitol changed their track lineups (the famous \\"butcher cover\\" where the Boys are covered in bloody meat and chopped up doll parts was their protest at how the label spliced and diced their track lineups) but at least here the cigar chompers were right. You'll want it eventually, but I wouldn't make this the first one you buy from the \\"suit years\\".given hints of it here and there. But it's not until the 3rd CD that the group magic kicks in.

B0000844M8|5.0|You always here the story or the expression that you can't take wild animals and try to them into pets. This movie tells and shows you why. The movie is based on a true story from a book by Joy Adamson. The movie is set back in the 1950 era when George Adamson who is the game warden for the Kenya area in Africa.  While out on a routine run George has to kill a charging female lion in self defense. After George kills the lion he discovers that the lion was a mother as three lion cubs come out of no where. George takes the 3 cub's home because he knows that if he didn't the cubs will die. When the cubs get too much to handle they have to make the hardest decision of their life. Do they send the animals to the Rotterdam Zoo? Do they send all the cubs or do they keep one?   To me the acting was great as Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna play George and Joy Adamson. As a side note McKenna also narrates the story as Joy voice-over, using the book. The real star of the show, though, is Elsa herself, actually played by three different lionesses. You can really see the genuine affection between the large cat and her caretakers as they interact. It is magical to watch. This movie would be great for you and your family because there's none of the following in this picture. There's really no violence, and there's no sex or any swearing for that matter. The entire movie was shot in Africa. If you can get the DVD the picture quality is as good as a movie that you would buy today. This review is based on my home addition of Born Free on DVD. You can get this DVD right here on Amazon.com and it by far better then the current VHS that's out there now.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0761536434|5.0|I've been playing video games for 20 years now. I began with the Atari, saw the market crash, grew up with Nintendo, and got caught up in the 90's proliferation of newer and hotter systems. I know a great deal about the industry, yet this book puts my knowledge to shame.<br /><br />Exhaustively researched and crammed ridiculously full of information, anecdotes, and hundreds of direct quotes from every walk of video game life, this book is worth more than one read-through. My copy is well-worn because I find it so easy to take with me on plane trips and just start reading through at random points. It's written in a very friendly, conversational tone and engages you with its prose. The book is extremely interesting because the author is clearly interested in the subject himself. He manages to get the kind of details and answer the type of questions you'd want to know, yet stays very thorough and accurate throughout.<br /><br />Loads of different subjects are covered, sometimes at great length: The bar where Pong was first tested. Nintendo's lawsuit against Galoob's Game Genie. Tengen illegally producing Nintendo games and the big N's forceful prosecution. The battles over Donkey Kong and Tetris. The founding of Electronic Arts. Sega's mid 90's dominance and slip of the cd based systems. The furor over Mortal Kombat. School shootings. I can't list enough, and I can't go on enough about it. This book is extremely comprehensive and covers the entire video game industry and all its major players chronologically from the 70s until the turn of the century. It's well-written, accurate (given all those direct insider quotes) and completely objective. One of the best things about it is the fact that it gives details of so many things from my video game youth, such as the first Nintendo commercials, as well as the good old days of parents rampaging through stores for a copy of the \\"low supply\\" games. Aside from interesting industry information, this book helped me reminisce.<br /><br />I've read \\"Game Over\\" (the only book comparable to this one on the subject, though it centers on Nintendo), \\"Phoenix, the Fall and Rise of Videogames, \\"Masters of Doom\\", and several other video game books. Honestly, this one still entertains me after four years. Though it ends at about the dawn of the PS2 and Xbox, it covers so much history and gives so many informative, interesting, and humorous stories that it really does deserve the title \\"Ultimate\\". Forgive me for not being more objective, but I must shrug and stick to my story. At 500 pages, and with such a wealth of information about so many familiar faces, companies, and games, I just find this to be the best book on the subject without question. Absolutely worth checking out for any video game player.Over\\" (the only book comparable to this one on the subject, though it centers on Nintendo), \\"Phoenix, the Fall and Rise of Videogames, \\"Masters of Doom\\", and several other video game books.

0783219695|5.0|\\"Apollo 13\\" is a tremendous cinematic achievement, just as the rescue of the Apollo 13 spacecraft during the actual mission was a tremendous technical achievement. <br /> <br />There are obviously reviewers around here who believe that Ron Howard and his effects wizards stooped to low-brow techniques in making this film, such as \\"running the film backwards\\" to show the flames being sucked downward by the rocket exhaust at launch.  Obviously, such reviewers haven't seen the making of featurette on the DVD, and have probably just watched the VHS version.  The use of such an underhanded means would be unworthy of a film which went to great lengths to reproduce the launch footage without using a single frame of NASA stock footage. <br /> <br />Apollo 13 is a tear-jerker movie for me.  I remember watching my television set, awaiting the spalshdown, completely unaware that Marilyn Lovell was also watching hers, but praying with the rest of America that these three men, who had made it back so far, would be able to cross that last boundary between space and atmosphere and return safely to Earth.  That extra minute was grating then, and is now. <br /> <br />Much has been made of the \\"inaccuracies\\" in Apollo 13, and I won't delve into them here, except to say that they are pretty much all noted and explained in the \\"making of\\" featurette or on the commentary track.  It is fun to listen to Jim and Marilyn Lovell with their take on the events as they unfolded.  Ron Howard also adds a great deal of interest with his commentary. <br /> <br />Before closing this, I must also make mention of the idiots who have posted reviews claiming that NASA never went to the moon, but that it was all a stunt done on movie sets.  The so-called \\"facts\\" that they cite are really the ignoring of facts and a paranoid fantasy that everything the government does is somehow fabrication.  Please don't buy into their stupidity. <br /> <br />Apollo 13 is a timeless movie.  It probably resonates more withthose who actually experienced the event on some level, but it truly gives an amazing picture of how we went to the moon, and how much more amazing it was because of the technology we did it with.  In the days where a computer \\"would fit into a single room and hold millions of pieces of information\\", the technology almost sounds laughable by today's standards.  It makes the accomplishment of landing on the moon, and of rescuing a crippled moon mission, all the greater.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|No question about it -- if you love guitar slingin, you'll love this.  I sat down and couldn't move until I'd heard every number on both discs.  I doubt there is any other performance available showcasing so many of the very greatest players performing today.  And they're not just doing ragged, what-do-you-expect-from-a-benefit performances; many of them play their heart out.  Do you like Clapton?  His I Shot the Sheriff (among other numbers) is spectacular; he obviously wanted to give it everything he had.  Wondering if McLaughlin can still do it?  As you'll discover, indeed he can.  Not a big fan of Steve Vai?  Me neither, but at least he shows why some folks are.  One reviewer says Joe Walsh was drunk.  I don't know, but his solo behind James Taylor is very tasty.  Another dissed J.J. Cale's numbers; I pity his inability hear that master's genius.  Forgive me, but I'd never seen Vince Gill play.  Wow!  I could go on.  (I would have to agree with one reviewer who questioned having ZZ Top close the show, but if the worst thing you can say about a show is that ZZ Top was the least impressive among several dozen acts, well, you could do a whole lot worse; I mean, it would be hard for anyone to close that show, so you have to give them credit for trying).  Unqualifiedly recommended, strongly.
0553582461|5.0|This is the third and final book in the Tawny Man trilogy (after Fool's Errand and the Golden Fool).<br /><br />Now that Dutiful has accepted the Narcheska's challenge, everyone is getting ready to sail to ice covered island of Aslevjal to slay Icefyre, the last male dragon. But the Fool wants to bring dragons back to the world and so he's strongly against the killing of Icefyre. Fitz is now torn between his duty to his future King and the love of his best friend the Fool. To cap it all, the latter has told him he's foreseen his own death on the glacier. Fitz and Chade have to do everything possible to prevent the Fool from accompanying them to the Out Islands.<br /><br />The sea voyage to the city of Zylig, their first stopping place on the Out Islands, is not a pleasant one. Thick gets seasick and ill, and takes it all out on an already much guilt stricken Fitz, who's in charge of him. Day after day, the simpleton's Skill-music dampens the crew's spirits and threatens the whole expedition. Fitz will ask Nettle in her Skill-dreams to help Thick go through his ordeal.<br /><br />They finally arrive at destination, to discover that the Out Islands political system is strongly matriarchal, with customs much different from those of the Six Duchies. There Prince Dutiful meets the hetgurd, a council of warrior clan chiefs and learn that they too are against the slaying of the dragon. Why then does Elliania want the dragon killed? Dutiful faces a terrible dilemma. Must he risk a political blunder? Finally the Prince decides be true to his word to his fianc&eacute;e, and so they all set out to Aslevjal for a long trek to the heart of the glacier.<br /><br />Again, what a fantastic, wonderful, amazing story! Of the ones that makes me wonder at the magic of books, and Robin Hobb's in particular: my eyes where following the words and lines and paragraphs, but my mind's eye was always elsewhere, holding on to the railing of a ship, walking on  field of bright white snow, taking care not to fall into crevasses, in cold caverns of blue ice... I was seeing the events thought the characters' eyes, living the same emotions. I laughed, I cried of joy, I cried of pain and grief, I suffered with them.

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|If you're a QOTSA fan, this album will not disappoint!  Rolling Stone gave it 3 stars, but don't listen to those clowns.  They're so mainstream it's sad.  Among the best tracks on the album is \\"Burn the Witch\\" which Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top plays a guitar solo near the end.  Another good one is \\"You've got a killer scene there, man\\"; it's blues mixed with good ole QOTSA style rock.  The only song that sucks is \\"Little Sister\\", which sadly is what they decided to release as a single.  Though the bassist and drum expertise of Dave Grohl are missing, it doesn't make this album any less good.  On some levels, it's better than \\"Songs for the Deaf\\".  The best part is it isn't a clone of Songs for the Deaf.  It's extremely creative and different, yet it's easily recognizable as QOTSA.  Buy it!  It's worth it.
6305212112|5.0|What more could you ask for in a movie?  A well rounded cast that ranges from the obscure to the well recognized and a story that touchs on almost every human emotion.  You have a modern day friendship that transends age and a historical friendship that transends race, one that transends culture (could Ruth and Idgie come from more different back gorunds?) and yet all of these individuals come together to experience the magic of love.  And as an added \\"bonus\\", just when you think you have all of the answers and have the plot all figured out there is one last twist that will change your mind.  Being a native Alabamian I am very proud of the book, written by fellow Alabamian Fannie Flagg, that this movie is based on and I hope that somewhere in our state there was a Whistle Stop and a Ruth and Idgie.  One correction is that this movie WAS NOT filmed in Alabama as reported by another reviewer, it was filmed in neighboring Juliette, Georgia and if you go to the Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe website there is the wonderful story of this sleepy little town and how it was reborn through this movie.  If your ever in the area of Juliette stop by sometime and have a plate of fried green tomatoes, they really are wonderful!

B000056NX5|5.0|I have to say, I have seen the original movie and listened to the soundtracks so many times, I wasn't expecting this new version to be new. But it definately was. weaving the wars into it, with Pilate's German-inspired costume, and French graffiti on the walls, it did this subtly, not pushing it too much. The lighting was brilliant, each character had their own lighting. The subtle costume change in Jesus from modern clothes to a more \\"Jesusy\\" garment was perfect, and the musical score was amazing. They could not have picked better actors (and actress) for the parts.  <br />Now, I had noticed Rik Mayall was in this(as Herod, which he played brilliantly, as should be expected), and since my favorite movie is Drop Dead Fred (well one of my favorites) I was excited at seeing him in a new production. But what really got me was Jerome Pradon. He plays the role of Judas brilliantly, bringing out different sides of the character. He shows that Judas was a real person, loved Jesus, had deep problems and also showed him as the attention seeking child, trying to prove to everyone that he's not bad, and  really shows that maybe the reason he overreacted at Mary was because he was Jesus' \\"right-hand man all along\\", and Mary was taking his place. It showed he was not entirely evil, and was trying to do good for Jesus, but didn't think of consequences. I especially love his cocky grins and \\"yeah, yeah\\" hand movements, and his voice. I usually would not like a voice that cracks, but He did it on purpose, and it worked beautifully. I was in love with Pradon instantly.  <br />This entire movie is a masterpiece, with something for all ages. Every element of this film was brought out perfectly, and they didn't just do a remake of the original movie. They did their own version of it, with things a newer generation could I identify with, instead of being just another 70's based production. I will have watched this movie for the 7th time in three weeks now ( I watch it as often as possible) and I plan on buying the soundtrack from it soon. If you have not seen this movie yet, you are missing out on an epic film that did not get the attention it deserves in the USA.
B00005BL2A|2.0|I am ranked very high among Depeche Mode fanatacism...I simply love most of their stuff. At one time, before this album, I would have said \\"I simply love ALL of their stuff!\\". This release was simply a let down. Sure, there are some good songs - in fact, they are all \\"good\\"...but they're simply not DM...more like solo MLGore w/ Gahan singing. I am simply shocked, I am...     I hope their next one (2005-2006) will be more like Ultra, or whatever Exciter simply  SHOULD have been! (this is helpful hint #2. For helpful hint #1, see my review of Ultra).    Even as a hardcore DM fan (yes, hardcore), I'm gonna have to veto this one. Save your hard earned cash, and buy something like Ultra or Violator or SOFAD or...simply, you get the idea...
B00008OLYN|5.0|\\"Damnation\\" is absolutely, positively nothing like other Opeth soft material.  This is intense, creepy music.  Almost the polar oposite of soothing.  Just unhappy, unrestful, almost angry(?). <br /> <br />Oh, it is definitely good, good music.  \\"In My Time of Need\\" is very chilling.  \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\" could even be called heavy; it is that unnerving.  This album left me with a worse feeling than I think any other has, the last track especially.   <br />\\"Damnation\\" is a must-listen, but don't go four hours straight like I did or you'll be chewing your fingernails off and shaking with nervousness. <br /> <br />Oh, and \\"Closure\\" is one of the coolest songs ever recorded, what with that odd repeated minor chorded riff.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra is simply an amazing collection of well crafted and produced songs written by Martin Gore, and NOT produced/mixed/remixed by Alan Wilder. A fascinating first since the departure of Wilder. Someday, I'll update this review and give a track by track assessment. But for now, don't even question it...just buy it! You won't regret it!    1. Barrel of a Gun: This is the very first song I heard from Ultra, prior to the single's release in '97. This song really sounds like it was leftover from SOFAD...and I thought ALL of Ultra was going to sound similar. But it's the only song on the album (to me) that sounds a little out-of-place. But in retro-spect, Ultra wouldnt be the same without it. Has kind of a rock/bluesy groove, much like \\"I Feel You\\". A nice rockin' song.    2. Love Thieves: Some people think this is a melloncollie/sad tune...but to me, it's very uplifting in spirit. The combination of punchy/crisp percussion, mellow-toned guitars, and unusually soft vocals from Dave sets this apart from anything they've done previously. This was very refreshing to hear for the first time, and still is to this day.
0425179877|4.0|Gene Kranz's amazing story of NASA's beginnings from inside mission control is a view most Americans never get the chance to experience. Kranz's hard work while in the military as a pilot and his strong sense of competition led him to become a part of a young space program, competing with the Russians for records in space exploration. His compelling story shares everything from the risky Mercury missions to the dramatic Apollo missions, all of which pulled the heart strings of Americans but, in the end, united all over one accomplishment and circumstance. Kranz discussed the media and their perceptions of the men inside mission control. In writing this book, Kranz gave himself the chance to break stereotypes and myths and tell the public what was happening behind closed doors. <br /> <br />This book is truly riveting to everyone, not just \\"science\\" people. The ideas behind space exploration and the amazing risks the first adventurers took can keep you reading for hours on end. Kranz shows us the raw emotions and conflicts the men had to deal with while trying to propel the United States into space. This gives us the real truth behind the men in the control room of the movie Apollo 13 and puts a story behind Ed Harris' character. Kranz is also not afraid to share with us mistakes, miscalculations, and mishaps that occurred in mission control. The raw realism with which Kranz presents his story, along with the conversational tone, makes the book a quick and enthralling read.  <br />
B00020HEL6|4.0|Forgetting her age, Renee Olstead is Impressive in her Jazzy debut.  Her voice is genuine, sexy and unforced.  It has an amazing range without strecthing or breaking.  Now addressing the age issue, it is a tad bit detectable in \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\"  prefferably sung by a woman who has been through some rough spots.   What's a 14 year old girl know about \\"a Sunday kind of love, a love to last past Saturday night.\\"  Therefore the song comes out sounding standardized, but she does well on the rest of the selections.  A couple of her contemporaries lend a hand.  Chris Botti is just gorgeous in \\" A Sunday Kind of Love\\" and \\"Someone to watch over me,\\" nice touch  and Peter Cincotti compliments and acompanies Miss Olstead's vocals in \\"Breaking Up is Hard to do.\\"  They almost sound like a couple in love.   When you get to track #9 \\"A Slow Boat to China,\\" you can really imagine how far this young singer, endowed with a beautiful voice, can go.  She has plenty of room to grow but hopefully she stays in the jazz/blues arena since it suit her vocals well.   I give it four stars because  it lacks bite and some emotional commitment, but these are the things that comes with age and growth. <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|I really like this album... but the song \\"Mr Bightside\\" (which is why I bought the album)was recorded improperly.  Whoever recorded/engineered \\"Mr. Brightside\\" pushed the recording levels too loud, and therefore it distorts a few times.... I have tried listening on several systems, and it just sounds like crap when you crank it up...The rest of the album doesn't seem to have the same problem... <br /> <br />oh well
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This CD marks the first time I had really listened to Jimi Hendrix and it turned me on to one of the greatest guitarists ever.  'Experience Hendrix' is a great way for the casual fan to hear material from right throughout Hendrix's all too brief career.  It has all the big hits, as well as some more obscure songs such as 'Freedom' and 'Dolly Dagger' from later in his life.  This is as good as it gets!
0743455967|4.0|King gives many interesting details about his life is this book.  He also gives some tips on how to write, but the best parts are Kings revelations about his personal life, family, addictions, and experiences.

B00005ASHM|5.0|It's weird to note that the single which \\"almost\\" made it onto \\"Pet Sounds\\" is the best song the Beach Boys ever did- \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  \\"Good Vibrations\\" mixes everything that was good about the \\"old\\" Beach Boys and the \\"Pet Sounds\\"-era Beach Boys and combines them into one amazing piece of music. <br /> <br />Likewise, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"/\\"Penny Lane,\\" the single which \\"almost\\" made it onto \\"Sgt Pepper\\" are arguably the best songs the Beatles ever did.  The creativity and innovation on this single improve upon the work the Beatles did on \\"Revolver\\" and really kick things up a notch. <br /> <br />Too bad, \\"Smile\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" in totality didn't really equal the excellence of the singles that came from the sessions.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is amazing. The combine talents of Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell form such an incredible sound that every ear should enjoy it (unless the person listening doesn't know much about music). Just listen to Morello's amazing solo in the albums second single \\"Like A Stone\\". You will be so amazed when you hear it. I'm not exaggerating. Chris Cornell's amazing vocals sound awesome blended in with RATM's sharply-tuned guitars and base. RATM's drummer is also pretty good. The lyrics are well-written. Pick this CD up along with Chris Cornell's solo album Euphoria Morning.
B00005JMYI|1.0|This movie was all over the place from a '70's battle of the sexes to a West Side story back alley rumble to a \\"rainbow and unicorn dream sequence\\" sex scene but most of it was not very funny, only very odd.  The jokes are mostly groaners.  Some people obviously liked this movie.  But it is not family fare, not really a date movie, not very funny, does not really tell much of a story, not even hilarious in a gross-out way.  Pretty much just dumb.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I remember the first time I saw the title to this movie, and I thought \\"what the....\\" The name of the movie was so outrageous, I HAD to see it. And I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />Hedwig is a girl with a serious past and a wonderful, if sometimes misguided, outlook on the future. Her story is funny, heart rending, and completely entertaining. Though few of us have probably ever been in Hedwig's (fabulous) shoes, I'm sure that everyone single one of us can identify with how this more-than-woman feels!<br /><br />I love musicals, and this is my favorite of them all. If you liked \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\", or even tolerated sitting through all of \\"Velvet Goldmine,\\" then you will definately like this Rock Opera gone totally awry.
B00005UEAR|3.0|I liked this album a lot more before I bought A Change of Seasons. True, this album introduced me to a great progressive metal band who was still writing insanely long songs in a time when the music industry was (and still is) set in an assembly-line formula of verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus (repeat as necessary, but keep it under four minutes). But after listening to the more elegant hard rock of Change of Seasons, I listened to both discs of Six Degrees again from start to end and realized that in the 21st Century, the band seemed to be relying more on flashy gimmicks than on composition. Granted, there are still some good moments on Six Degrees. But there are moments that could have been better had the production not been so overblown.    The opening track of Disc One, The Glass Prison, starts out nice, but sadly, it seems to turn into hip-hop metal about three minutes in. Unfortunately, this song also sets two tones that will be repeated for the rest of the album. The first is that the band seem to care less about engaging the listener, and more about straight-rocking, seeing how many notes they can cram into a single meter. The second is that the lyrics, while more subtle on past offerings, here become overly pious. I understand that the members of the group are deeply religious, and I can respect that. But when you're religious AND a member of a progressive metal band, there are more clever ways to go about it. The line \\"I fell down on my knees and prayed, 'thy will be done'\\" practically ruins The Glass Prison for me. When Mike Portnoy was writing the lyrics to that one, he might as well have tacked on an ad for his church's bake sale. That being said, I have to admit that the next song, Blind Faith, partially appeals to me. About all of that appeal comes from the way John Petroucci's guitar translates nicely into some keyboard work from Jordan Rudess, plus the cynical sneer with which James LaBrie sings the first few verses (\\"I'm sick of all of this, the suffering, and we just carry on\\"). But for me, the standout track on disc one is The Great Debate. The sound bites inserted into the song remind me of the mid-70s work of Pink Floyd, and the eerie ambience created by Rudess on the synthesizer even hearkens back to Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright (who enjoyed creating spooky ambience, and was quite good at it, if one listens to Atom Heart Mother or Animals). Plus, in their treatment of the subject matter (which deals with the controversial issue of stem cell research), the band manages to put their personal feelings to the back seat, and LaBrie assumes the roles of both a supporter and a pro-lifer with equal passion.     As far as disc two is concerned, I have mixed feelings. I like the fact that although the title track is divided into eight smaller tracks, it's billed as a single 45-minute song. I also like the fact that the only common ground between the songs is that they deal with people who suffer from abnormal psychological disorders. Therefore, it's more like six seperate case studies, which only augments LaBrie's expertise in assuming different roles with equal fervor and enthusiasm. A website I once looked at listed the overture as being one of the best offerings, which is something I disagree with. That same website claimed that the band employed a full-piece orchestra, which I find hard to believe. The orchestra sounded synthesized, which only hints at the shortcomings in the piece's overall production (that, or someone botched the mixing process). I always found this a shame, because it flows well. Maybe the Overture would have been better without the orchestra (like Rush did on 2112).    A few things I like: the band uses a lot of big words in the lyrics (denoting their higher intelligence than most other \\"musicians\\" today), and actually manages to make it flow well with the music. The best examples of this are found in War Inside my Head and Solitary Shell (I'd like the latter song more if the intro didn'tremind me of a Jars of Clay song). Musically, I feel the most solid tracks are The Test That Stumped Them All and Goodnight Kiss. Petroucci's guitar work in Goodnight Kiss, combined with the ambience created by Rudess, are about as close as this album gets to the elegance of 90s Dream Theater. The intro to the reprisal of About to Crash also appealed to me, but after that, it just felt like the band tried to cram too much in, especially with the Finale. And while I'm talking about the Finale, lyrically it suffered from the same problem as The Glass Prison. I guess the band felt some resolution was necessary, but again, they could have handled it more subtly. However, I did like how Portnoy finished his drum roll with the gong rather than symbols. That was unexpected.    Overall, I would say that this album is fifty-fifty. There were some elements of classic Dream Theater, there were other elements that could have been better had the production been less fluffy, and there were things that just didn't work. All in all, I would say that there are moments on Six Degrees that open-minded Dream Theater fans can appreciate. But if I were to give two Dream Theater albums to someone, this would not be one of them. Scenes From a Memory, yes, but I would say that the other album should be A Change of Seasons. If that person really wants to, they can check this one out for themselves.
B00005ASOC|2.0|When you saw reviews for this movie, what did you think? Good movie?  Predictable movie? Horrible movie? Whatever you though, you are probably right.<br /><br />I have spoken with lots of people who really loved this film. I thought it contrived, thinly written and not that great, to be honest. The story was nice and it left you with a warm feeling in your stomach, but it was a story we have seen a million times just put into a new setting. (Think Scent of a Woman meets Dead Poets Society.)<br /><br />But like I said, lots of people really liked it. I tend to think it would be more worth a cheap seat viewing or rental price, but if you thought the previews looked good, see this film. I guess.

B000067IZ3|5.0|*Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 starts playing in the background.*<br /><br />Ah yes. Today's journey takes us to the heart of America's Midwest to the manicured suburbs of Cincinnati. Urban sprawl. Rolling Hills. White, private school kids free basing in daddy's living room. This is the American Dream.<br /><br />Traffic confronts dealing, selling, using and the \\"war on drugs\\" through three intermingled plot lines in this documentary-style film that take viewers from D.C. to Cincinnati to California to Mexico.<br /><br />More well known actors grade the screen during this movie than is reallynecessary, but somehow director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull it off.People like Salma Hayek have bit roles and few lines. Other big names, likeBenjamin Bratt, don't make into the story line until the last fourthof the movie. But the main stars of the movie are Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones (looking *gasp* very pregnant for her role as a pregnant wife of a drug trafficker), TopherGrace (Eric Forman from That 70s Show with a good haircut finally) and ErikaChristensen (Leave it Beaver, the movie?).<br /><br />The greatest part of this movie is its focus on Cincinnati Country Day high school in Cincinnati. For those of you have seen the move, you might be thinking, \\"What focus? They only mentioned the name of the school once.\\" Well, let me fill you in.<br /><br />Douglas' character and his family live in Indian Hills in Cincinnati (although the house they use is actually from Hyde Park). Indian Hills is where some schmo who raised like a bajillion dollars for President Double-yuh lives, as well as Marge Schott. Anyway, Douglas' daughter goes to Cincinnati Country Day, which is a REAL school. SO, when little, rich, white kids are doing drugs in the film, it's not reflecting well on Cincinnati Country Day with its $14,000 a year tuition.<br /><br />This appeals greatly to my still-experiencing-horrors-as-a-result-of-all-girls-catholic-high-school-hell self.<br /><br />So this movie is great. It really is and everyone should see it. And after you do, e-mail me. I have a question I want to ask you what you thought of this one scene I found very troublesome.

B00003CXPD|5.0|I might as well come right out and say it. I love this Billy Elliot. I can't give it an objective review. I think it's cute and sweet and it made me feel happy when I left the theatre. And you should see it.<br /><br />Billy Elliot is about a boy who decides not to continue the boxing lessons his father wishes him to take, and opts instead for ballet lessons. Billy has to confront everyone's prejudices about males dancing ballet, especially his brother and father's, as well as maneuver ways to continue lessons.<br /><br />Billy Elliot is done very much in the style of old 1950s movies, but it includes more modern-day themes and confronts issues of sexuality that the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant never would have seen in their movies.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's kind of a corny story. But I like it. What can I say?

B00003CXRP|2.0|Hollywood is a phrase and an adjective. When I say a movie is very Hollywood, it can be a good or a bad thing. Cast Away is very Hollywood. And I have not decided yet whether that is good or bad.<br /><br />This tale about Tom Hanks being lost at sea, away from his very time-conscience world at Federal Express is good, although a little slow at times. Hanksdoes what I never would have expected him to pull off- he entertains youby himself for about an hour. And yet...<br /><br />It would seem to me, and you may have to see the film to know what I mean, that a movie's point should be clear. And if it isn't, it should be up for your personal interpretation. Cast Away's point is unclear, at least to me, throughout the whole movie. And then at the end, it is like they try to imply what the meaning of the film is. Right there at the end. I hate it when films do that. If you have to come out and say it, then maybe you didn't do your job right.<br /><br />Sorry about the little tirade there. Anyway, the film is good. You have and will continue to hear all the hype about it so I guess I would recommendit. But the hype- ignore it.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Someone else made a comment that the content wasn't enough, but I would have to disagree. First, you get a second disc with all the blue b-sides which I thought was a great idea. Second, the packaging with the extra pictures and song lyrics was cool to. So I don't understand what else one can ask for. The disc was also remastered. This is a must buy for any Weezer fan.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|1st off this DVD shows that Dickinson can't sing the the songs off the 1st 2 albums . They just don't sound right at all . Good news is there aren't that many with him singing on this DVD. It also shows how the band progressed when Dickinson came along on NOTB .    I really wished they would've made  2 more albums with the Killers lineup before moving on though .  <br />   I also would've liked to see some studio footage while they were working on the 1st 2 albums but I guess it simply doesn't exist .  <br />  Overall this is an excellent DVD and I highly recommend it and hope other bands will follow this concept  .    Also makes you question the current music scene even more .   The footage of this DVD shows how pure the music scene could be back in those days.  <br />  Just a group of guys playing the music they wanted to , dressing like they wanted to and making it happen the old fashioned way . <br />
0060012218|5.0|I'm about as far away from the target audience of this book as you can get, seeing as I'm a) not gay, b) not a guy, c) not a teenager and d) hopefully no longer completely taken over by teenage angst (well, mostly). That just goes to show how great a book it is, since I couldn't put it down once I started it. Actually, that's not entirely true - I started by reading an &lt;a href=\\" [...]\\">excerpt&lt;/a> of it and was forced to wait anxiously until my review copy arrived a few days later.<br /><br />Russel is a completely believable teenager concerned with not only the normal teenage stuff (you know, zits, body odor, looking right, etc.) but also with keeping his secret well hidden. He's gay.<br /><br />Even so, he takes a leap of faith when he meets a fellow gay student online and they arrange to meet. It's hard to tell who is more surprised at that meeting - Russell or Kevin, the most popular jock in school.<br /><br />Then Russel discovers that one of his best friends, Min, is bi-sexual. After they all meet up at a pizza joint (successfully) and at school lunch (unsuccessfully), they all decide they need a way to meet. But how to do it and still keep their secret? That's when the Geography Club is born. After all, who wants to talk about geography?<br /><br />The expected happens and Russel learns a lot about himself and his friends during the process. I don't want to give everything away, so you'll have to check it out for yourself.<br /><br />I recommend this book for teens ages 14 and up, whether they are gay or not. Hey, after all, isn't it always good to walk a mile in the other guy's shoes once in a while?
B000005ITX|5.0|I bought Forever Changes the week it first came out as an album, when I was attending college, and it is as excellent today as it was when I was falling in love with it then. This is Arthur Lee's greatest work, and is also, perhaps, the best album of its genre to ever be recorded. Every time I played the album on my stereo in my college dorm, people would knock on my door and ask me what that amazing album was that I was listening to. There are no second rate songs on Forever Changes, and two of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard are Andmoreagain and Old Man. Forever Changes is an album that will never go out of style, and I expect that people will still be enjoying it long after I have grown old and passed on. If you have never heard Forever Changes, treat yourself; you will be very thankful that you did.

0064471837|5.0|\\"Sabriel\\" is wonderful book for teens and adults alike. Garth Nix is a rare gem in the world of sci-fi/fantasy as well as in the world of novels in general. \\"Sabriel's\\" Old Kingdom may be fantastic and readers not used to the genre will notice all of the magical elements, but it resonates with modern political issues. And Nix must be commended for creating a strong female protagonist that holds up against her male counterparts in the fantasy genre. It is unfortunate that authors of the fantasy genre create over-sexualized females who are overshadowed by male counterparts. Sabriel is a well-developed heroine who rings true with girls and women alike--she is a far cry from the female character conceived by a misguided male perception of womanhood. This is an excellent introduction to the fantasy novel, especially for adolescent girls looking for fiction they can relate to. Fans of Tamora Pierce's \\"Alanna\\" series or of T.A. Barron's \\"Merlin\\" books will certainly find a new love in Garth Nix.

B000002KBU|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant work of art right here.  Joni Mitchell is just a great artist all around and she brings a level of depth to her work that is rarely seen.  Unfortunately, being a profound musical artist is generally something that is not valued or appreciated by most, so many just won't take to Joni Mitchell.  Joni possesses a truly rare gift as a lyricist, and she is able to paint extremely vivid, rich and effective pictures with her pen.  She is also one of the greatest composers ever.  She has created some of the most complex and beautiful arrangements and melodies that I've ever been lucky enough to hear.  Her arrangements are generally pretty intricate, so if your simply looking for some catchy poppy tunes to bob your head to, then you are really looking in the wrong place.  Joni Mitchell is one of the few artist that I've heard that I can honestly describe as a genius and she shows why throughout this entire album.  This album is a totally engulfing experience from beginning to end.  It can be a tough nut to crack at first if you don't already listen to this \\"type\\" of music ( I use that word very loosely because I really don't like to categorize music into \\"types\\"-the only types that I care about can be measured in degrees of quality :-), but man is it rewarding once you get it.  It was a challenge for me at first, but I've learned that the best albums are not the ones that are fully grasped on the first listen, but ultimately are the ones that are just as powerful and rewarding no matter how many times you listen to them, and those albums often take a few listens to grasp.  So, I continued to listen, and now I would put this in the top 5 albums that I have ever heard.  It is stellarly written, superbly composed and just so moving, powerful, and effective an experience, that it gets better with each listen.  The songs mostly alternate between acoustic guitar based tracks and piano based tracks, and they're all excellent!  The tone of this albumis pretty somber all througout, although it does have the occasional radiant burst of sunshine such as 'California' and the oh so rockin' 'Carey'.  'This Flight Tonight' is uniquely brooding and engulfing and it provides another well-placed energetic break from the somberness of most of the album.  Ultimately, the best albums are the ones that are the most rewarding, and I have heard very few albums in my lifetime that are anywhere near as rewarding as this one is.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory just happens to be my fav Linkin Park cd. Not only does it have the smashing hit of one step closer, it also has the great In The End!!! This five star cd should be at the top of everyones wish list.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|I saw Robots not to long ago, and didn't expect much from it (honestly), and it was actually better than I thought it would be, but not that great. Not nearly as good as Shrek or The Incredibles or those other CG Animated movies.
B000089RVX|4.0|My favorite songs are: Going Under, Bring me to life, Everybody's Fool. <br /> <br />All the songs are perfect until it gets to past \\"Imaginary\\". then things get very scary, depressing, and a little disturbing. take Tourniquet. It is about suicide! Amy has a great voice, though.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Wow! What a great live album! The band is awesome. They just sound so raw live, it's amazing! Robert is like, screaming his heart out and changing up all the voice expressions. Jimmy, as always, sounds absoulutly awesome. He just riff's so hard man! He also does a good job improvizing new parts to songs. John Paul Jones is kind of in a tough position because Jimmy can't play rythem guitar, and he NAILS the rythm parts to Jimmy's soloing. And Bonham is just wild on the drums, crashing at them like theres no tommorrow. All the songs sound great and raw and awesome, but my favorites are the live version of \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Rock N' Roll\\", and \\"What It Is And What Should Never Be\\", these songs are sound alot like the recording, but are just made so raw! Great collection. Everyone who likes Led Zep should own this!
0385504209|5.0|This thriller focuses on Robert Langdon, a Harvard University professor of symbology, who is in Paris on a speaking engagement. He is awakened in the middle of the night by the French police and implicated in the murder of the Louvre Museum curator.<br /><br />With some help from a French police cryptographer, Sophie Neveau, who feels that he is being wrongly accused, he manages to escape and together they embark on a quest to find the real killer.<br /><br />That quest leads to clues, puzzles and riddles that link back to an ancient society tasked with protecting the truth about Jesus Christ and unlock the greatest secret in Western civilization.<br /><br />While the book is a work of fiction, Dan Brown has done an exhaustive amount of research to ensure that his explanations and depictions of history and the ancient societies that are featured in the book are as accurate as possible. I felt like<br />Brown did a good job of researching computer encryption algorithms and network security for his book Digital Fortress, but that research pales in comparison with both the depth and scope of the research for The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />There is no shortage of critics of Brown's research or his depictions of events. When you introduce evidence and arguments which, if true, shake the foundation on which the entire religion of Christianity is based, there are bound to be skeptics.<br /><br />In Brown's defense, he is a writer first and foremost, not an art historian or theologian. In defense of Brown's research, he is not a heretic who thought up the concepts he describes. There are plenty of resources that agree with the version of history and events described in The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Frankly, even an art historian or a theologian in my opinion can not state for certain how things are. That is why it is called \\"faith\\". Brown's book gives you plenty to think about though in exploring the roots of that faith.<br /><br />(...)
B00003CXCT|5.0|I LOVE what they did to the digital effects for the Original Star Wars Trilogy. They're just way better now, I swear. Like the Death Star blowing up. In the first version you can see the strings, but in this one, it looks like a pure Nuclear explosion, and you can see the outer shell of the Death Star heat up and then go BOOM! Absoulutly incredible! That's only one huge improvement to the effects, theres many more. The special features are very informative and very educating about the movie, and the video games look great. A must have!
B00026YO36|5.0|And to tell you the truth, I can still only listen to bits and pieces of it at one time.  Its almost like its too good to hear all at once, because I can't really savor the individual songs if I do it that way.      Lanegan throws just enough rock into this album to remind you that he still knows what he's doing.  In fact, I think \\"hit the city\\" might've been the best rock song of 2004.  Really though, its the slow, groovy, languid stuff that draws you in and burrows into your subconscious.  \\"100 days\\", \\"come to me\\" and \\"wedding dress\\" are so atmospheric and almost tranquil that its easy to lose sight of how intricate they are.  If you read the album credits, with its list of famous collaborators, you might get the impression that this is some sort of weird rock circus, but really Bubblegum has a pretty stripped down and simple sound to it.      If this album were a demo, it'd be the one you went around showing to all your friends, trying to get them all excited about this undiscovered genius you've stumbled onto.  But Lanegan's been doing this for 15-20 years.  I don't think he'll ever get the chance to be as famous as he could've been with the Screaming Trees, but that just makes his stuff all the more endearing.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's debut album is very good and well done. Quite impressive. I like the way they blend 80's top 40 with modern Alternative Rock. All the songs are good, but my personal favorites include 'Cheating On You', 'Tell Her Tonight', 'Dark Of The Matinee', and of course 'Take Me Out'. Not for everyone, but for anyone who likes current day alternative rock with a retro edge should buy this album.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I really like Collateral and that is coming from someone who is not a great Tom Cruise fan. I think Mr. Foxx is excellent. he is a real star potential here.  <br /> <br />The DVD is clean and crisp and that is from someone who watches movies on a protector (you tend to see a lot of problems in films with projectors).  <br /> <br />It is certainly one to add to your collection: there are so many classic scenes. Max cleaning the car versus the broken windshield and scattered sandwich. Max reading the Mercedes catalog yet driving a taxi for 10 or 11 years. Vincent and the classic line about the fact that he didnt kill him, 'the bullet and the fall killed him'. As for Mr. Cruise. I dont know where he learned to shoot, but he actually handles that pistol like a real contract killer (and no i dont know any!). He looks like a guy who could get 2 rounds only a few centimeters apart. Again it has been said that the role was created for the way he acts and i think this could well be true. I certainly do not like the terminator stuff at the end, jumping on the back of trains is for Arnie not Cruise. I am a big M.Mann film buff and this certainly goes up there with Heat for intensity and realism (except the aforementioned terminator stuff).  The music is EXCELLENT. I would reccomend that as a big buy. It does still have that Miami Vice feel and glow and sound. Finally, what is it with M.Mann and the colour BLUE? ...
B000002TQV|5.0|This classic Radiohead album is a must have for anyone who loves music! <br /> <br />Starting out with the opening sounds of \\"Planet Telex,\\" Radiohead takes you on a musical adventure to a pure rock oasis.  This pre-OK Computer is an amazing jump, IMO, from their debut album Pablo Honey. <br /> <br />I started out actually listening to Radiohead (not counting hearing their name sporadically when I was a kid, pre-teen) with HTTT, and it took me a second to get used to this album, but I'm listening to it right now, and it just blows my mind away! <br /> <br />Please, if you love music in the least, try this album out!  You won't regret it.
B00005LK95|3.0|Even wihtout the Jheri curled stylings of the hit El Debarge song \\"Who's Johnny?\\", this movie is still worth a look on cable if you have nothing else to do but sip on schnapps. <br /> <br />Apparently Steven Gutenberg and Ally Sheedy agreed that it was not in the best interest of their careers to appear in this sequel, though its notable that Gutenberg rode the Police Academy Gravy train for 4 out of 6 stops.  We are left with an Ally Sheedy voice over in the beginning explaining why we won't be seeing them in this picture, and then we are given the new stars of the sequel:  Ben Javiri (an amazingly blatant Hindi/Indian cab driver stereotype played with surprising depth by Fisher Stevens) and the dude from Spinal Tap. <br /> <br />Ben has lost his choice gig creating weapons of mass destruction  for Uncle Sam due to the 'liberation' of Johnny 5 in the first flick.  Defeated, he has come to NYC to take a step down in salary, working as a toy designer who temps selling little Johnny 5 toys from a table on the street.  With the help of Johnny 5 and Spinal Taps charismatic frontman, he not only gets his business going, but he finds true love and what it means to be a man... <br /> <br />This one has some more production value going for it and a Radio Shack plug too!  It seems as if the films creators went for a slightly darker tone in this one than there was in the first.  Lots of characters in this movie trying to find themselves and love.  Possibly the most emotionally powerful film in the 'Short Circuit' franchise. <br /> <br />Disturbing spoiler:  Johnny takes a terrific thrashing in this one that is WAY over top and really shocks you out of the whole campy tone of the series.  I know it's a robot and all but...what a killer beating. <br /> <br />Sadly, the soundrack lacks the ultra sheen soundtrack of the last film, and instead has a weak version of the song \\"I need a hero\\"...still, nothing makes a boat chase better than pulsing, relentless 80's-90's synth soul/rock.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I started listening to Radiohead hardcore with this album, and I must say it is amazing. <br /> <br />The songs on here are melodramatic, yet perfect, crazy, yet crazy enjoyable. <br /> <br />Definitely need to check out this album about 30,000 X million times.
0201721481|5.0|The previous editions (including the 3rd) of the book are all obsolete! This edition presents the language from a modern C++ perspective (post C++/98 standard), with emphasis on applications of the standard library, primarily the standard containers and algorithms. The standard library is still very under-utilized till this day, with many programmers still keep reinventing the wheels and laboring on things already provided by the library. With the C++/03/0x standard on the horizon, one is definitely much better served by upgrading to this edition and switching to the better way of programming C++ in terms of the standard containers and algorithms. By taking adantage of them, one writes more concise, more elegant, more robust, and in most cases more efficient code.
078062565X|5.0|King Kong is proably the best of the giant monster flicks. I mean, let's face it, Godzilla isn't really a very good movie. It's fun to watch, but it has a pretty bad plot, not to mention the bad voice-overs. King Kong on the other hand, has an epic plot. There's a reason why the last scene is one of the most well known images in movies anywhere. And, amazingly enough, King Kong still looks a lot more believable to me than most of the computer-animated movies we have now. Some of the effects are ingenious. Like the scene in Kong's lair where he's holding the woman. It was done by recording the lady in a gigantic arm (which is used throughout the picture along with a gigantic King-Kong face) and then rear-projecting that on a Kong-size scree and recording it with a Kong model with only one arm. Ingenious!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I'm not old nor middle-aged, i'm 17, and i've never listened to music like this, i usually listen to Rap & R&B. But I saw Michael Buble on some late night show (Letterman I think) and heard 'Feeling Good' and thought it was pretty dope so I decided to check his CD out. At first all i liked was Feeling Good, but after awhile I actually started gettin into some of the other tracks. Now if he can get my attention with his music and not just the fact that he looks good, and my brother's attention, then dude must be doin somethin right. If you're tired of the same ol same ol, and lookin for somethin good that u wouldn't normally listen to, or wouldn't be caught dead listenin to (i still only play his CD on my headphones lol!) check this CD out.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best album of 2004 without a doubt. This is pure anti-mainstreme punk. I was telling all of my underground punk friends at the mall about how great this album is and they all agreed with me. Not only is this album punk, but it's also political!! Therefore if you listen to it you're smart AND rebellious. Only cultured people like myself will understand this record. Some poser came up to me and said that some album by some poser wannabee \\"band\\" called Painful Salvation or something lame realised the best album of the year. This guy obviously doesn't understand music as he didn't watch MTV. Get Green Day.
0385510454|2.0|John Grisham is in low-energy mode these days and while this newest poses as a thriller, it's more a what-I-did-on-my-summer-vacation essay. Grisham supplies lots of spy hardware and mean-as-snakes international assassins, but it's all told on automatic pilot. We've been there with him before (and in better books), so this is something of a post card from Italy  rather than a full-blown, explosive Grisham knock-out. I must admit this: I want to visit Bologna more than anything.
B000002UAO|5.0|Imagine if someone like, let's say, the Backstreet Boys suddenly and completely, at the height of their screaming-teen stardom, morphed into U2.  Multiply that impact by 100 for some idea of the signifigance of Rubber Soul in the Beatles catalogue.  The stunningly rapid growth in songwriting from \\"Love Me Do\\" to most of the songs on this album is unparalleled in rock history, and helped the band move from teenybop idols to conquering middle America, middle England, heck the whole middle world.<br /><br />The newfound maturity of the songwriting is manifested in details like John's lascivious heavy-breathing \\"Girl\\" to the secret affair (and sly drug reference) on \\"Norwegian Wood\\" as well as instrumentaly with George's interest in Indian music starting to come out and John and Paul writing songs that went beyond girls and rock-n-roll and more girls.  Perhaps most shocking of all were the almost Stones-ish misogynistic lyrics on \\"Run For Your Life.\\"  The Beatles had suddenly gone from wanting to hold your hand, to rather creepily warning you what's gonna happen if you don't. \\"I'd rather see you dead...little girl\\" John croons, the sarcastic \\"little girl's\\" at the end of each line a genius little touch.<br /><br />Best of the best:  \\"In My life\\" can be forgiven the over-use as a proven tearjerker in television dramas since it's quite probably John's best and most profound song ever, which is really saying something.  \\"Nowhere Man\\" is the perfect example of how if you try to listen to Beatles songs with fresh ears you are astounded by how simple yet brilliant and enduring Lennon/McCartney's songwriting was.  3-part harmony never sounded so good.  \\"Think For Yourself\\" found George coming into his own as a songwriter, helped by some bitter lyrics and Paul's fuzz bass.<br /><br />Not so stellar are two dogs in my opinion: \\"The Word\\" and \\"What Goes On.\\"  However, the rest of the record is far too strong to suffer from their presence.<br /><br />A pivotal and key entry in the Beatles discography and a must for any collection.try in the Beatles discography and a must for any collection.
0440224764|3.0|An entirely plot driven book - characters and action are subsumed by the story line. It's like a heist movie, with two getaways, once illegally, once legally. Grisham does very well mixing up both stories to keep the pages turning, revealing a bit here, a bit there - from four years before, and in the present. It's almost impossible to discuss this effort without spoilers, so consider yourself warned. It's purely a book for the ride, and the ride is clever and well paced. The `hero' plays the system and the people in it like a deck of cards, and Grisham entertainingly spins out the basic plot with admirable control. He also gives us the common heist movie satisfaction of knowing that the `victims' actually deserve what they get.<br /><br />Or, at least, he does until the final twist. That didn't really work for me. Until now each of the actions are carefully reasoned and justified. The final twist is pretty random - just a mandatory final page surprise. But good surprise endings integrate with a bunch of things earlier in the book, making us rethink them. This one doesn't, it's just a betrayal of trust that hasn't been hinted at previously - it's surprise for surprise sake only, and it doesn't give us the satisfaction of the previous two heists: it's too easy, and it's unjust. Moreover a bit of thought raises some dumb contradictions around the question: why does she disappear? If, as the last pages say:<br /><br />\\"She knew where to hide, and how to disappear, and how to change identities, and how to move money instantly, and how to spend it without drawing attention. She had learned from a master. Patrick had taught her all too well the art of vanishing. No one would find Eva, unless, of course, she wanted them to...Her face would not be seen, because he'd taught her how to hide it...\\"<br /><br />why did she wait until Patrick had given back the 90 million! Moreover, if Patrick was the master, why did he ever bother returning? The rest of the book explains that he chose to return so that he wouldn't have to look over his shoulder any more. He's got the interest on 90 million over four years, and no one is chasing him - that's the beauty of the heist, the satisfaction of safely signing in to a hotel in his own name. Yet Eva is left with the ordeal Patrick knowingly risked torture to escape. A still unsatisfying but less stupid finish would have seen Eva meet Patrick and calmly say, \\"Thanks for the cash, it's been fun,\\" and then return home publicly. Patrick could follow her there, but do nothing - and she wouldn't have to hide from anyone. That would make sense of her waiting until Patrick had neutralised the the threat from Stephano's employers and the FBI, returning the bulk of the money to call off the dogs. Does she suddenly not care about her father, that she will never go back to her beloved Rio or her family? (for some unknown reason - why is she running from Patrick? What can he do? Who else is chasing her?) This doesn't square with anything we knew about her until now. Nor does this talk of her as the master of invisibility work with her relatively easy capture in the US - what possible motivation would she have had for being caught? Either she's not so competent, or she actually does love Patrick and is prepared to risk herself for him. Eva the scheming betrayer has no reason to risk the torture she knows Patrick underwent - from the same people hunting her in the states - if she, as the book contradictorily contends - can disappear at will, and/or is just using Patrick. The only possible reason for her risking her life to get Sandy all the material to give Patrick his safety is so that she also can stop running.<br /><br />So, bummer about the very end. As I said, until then the plot is very well handled and a pleasure to follow. Still, it is a one-dimensional read - nothing much in the way of character or relationships: Patrick, and by extension, the reader, only thinks of people as tools. Don't read this for humour or insight or powerful narrative (as you can find in addition to a decently paced plot with some other writers - say Chandler or Perez-Reverte) - but it's still an OK read. Just tear out the last few pages before you pass it on.his for humour or insight or powerful narrative (as you can find in addition to a decently paced plot with some other writers - say Chandler or Perez-Reverte) - but it's still an OK read.

B00024BHTC|5.0|Once more, the amazing Finnish progressive rock / symponic metal band \\"Nightwish\\" comes through with yet another impressive album.  Quite a bit edgier and more agressive than some of \\"Nightwish's\\" other albums (\\"Wishmaster\\", e.g.), this album reminds me a bit of their earlier offering, \\"Oceanborn\\".  Now I'm not going to say that this is the best band ever or try to insult those who dislike this genre of music, but, speaking from personal opinion, this is definitely my favorite band.   <br /> <br />As a fan of just about any Finnish or European metal, I highly recommend this album.  Like \\"Century Child\\", \\"Once\\" takes a lot of flak for being more \\"mainstream\\".  I still can't quite seem to grasp just why people say this, but, as we all know, if enough people on the internet say something, it's just got to be true! (Detect the sarcasm.)  As a resident of a small town, I'm just about the only person I know who listens to this type of music in general and this band in particular.  However, this is definitely worth picking up.  <br /> <br />As a sidenote, the German label Nucleur Blast who released this imported version did a wonderful job.  The audio quality as well as the printing on the slipcase and booklet are topnotch.  Very highly recommended. <br /> <br />P.S.  For those who like this style of music, I also recommend the Italian metal band \\"Lacuna Coil\\" and the Finnish metal band \\"Sonata Arctica\\".  (Tony Kakko [\\"Sonata Arctica\\"] has worked with \\"Nightwish\\" in the past, most notably singing Tuomas's vocals in the remix of the classic NW song \\"Astral Romance\\" from the band's earliest offering, \\"Angels Fall First\\".)  Also, Finnish goth rock band \\"For My Pain...\\" is an excellent band featuring Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish on keyboards.  Last but not least, fans of Marco Hietala's vocals and basswork on both this album and CC should check out his flagship metal band, the infamous \\"Tarot\\".
B000006E4C|5.0|In the late 70's I enthusiastically took my recording of \\"18\\" home from college and played it for my father on my new stereo; his first-listen gut reaction was to cringe and grouse at his perceived needle-stuck-in-a-groove monotony of the piece.  Somehow, that indictment never has tarnished my perception of \\"18\\"; after a quarter century of listening, I still find myself mining riches from this utterly beautiful, labyrinthine work.  It's ambitious and challenging, harmonically as well as in terms of the instrumental settings/juxtapositions. <br /> <br />The first \\"movement\\", Pulses, is a tightly encapsulated microcosm of the entire piece, with each following section developing and expanding the themes stated therein.  The cumulative effect is much like watching a chrysalis metamorphose into a butterfly.  I've watched PBS science shows that used \\"18\\" as audio backdrop to footage of cells dividing, stars forming in nebulae, etc., and I just marvel at the elemental qualities of \\"18\\". <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|First & foremost, I liked this film. In fact, I liked both Kill Bill movies, although for different reasons. For this review, we'll focus on Volume 1.<br /><br />When you view the film for the first time there is so much thrown on the screen you end up missing a lot. The more times you watch, the more new things you see, driving you to continue re-watching. Plain & simple, this is a fun film. However, let's be honest. A fun film, absolutely. A good film, definitely. A great film may be pushing it. A masterpiece....Nah. The reason: Tarantino wasn't trying to produce a masterpiece. In an interview I watched he claims he made these films to see how great of a director he was, to see if \\"there was a ceiling\\" to his genius. I don't think that was the reason. I believe Tarantino made these films to see how much he could get away with and still be called genius. From the reactions of critics & moviegoers I would say he got away with a lot.<br /><br />Volume 1 is mostly an \\"action\\" flick. The basic plot is about revenge. The Bride, played extremely well by Uma Thurman, has been beaten to a bloody pulp, shot in the head, and left for dead by the deadly Viper Assassination squad, of which she was once a member. After getting pregnant and bailing out of the group she is tracked down by Bill & company. We are treated to a series of chapters that take us back & forth over the past 4 years. There are some parts that seemed to be mostly filler, like the cartoon chapter \\"The origin of O'ren\\". That just wasn't needed and, to me, actually made the middle of the film drag. But there were also some absolutely great scenes. One of the most powerful scenes is watching the anguish of The Bride when she wakes from her 4 year coma to find she's not pregnant anymore. And, of course, the massive fight scene where she takes on an army of samarai body guards so that she can reach O'ren is exciting, amazing, and even humorous at times. Well worth the wait to get there.<br /><br />Again, overall I liked this movie amd continue to watch it over & over. One caution: Don't expect volume 2 to be the same type of film. As I mentioned, Volume 1 is action-packed. While Volume 2 has some of that it tends to be a bit more cerebral.erall I liked this movie amd continue to watch it over & over.

B00003CXDD|4.0|When George Lucas was younger he wanted to become a race car driver. Instead, he has become one of the richest and most powerful men in the movie making industry. Besides dreaming up STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES, Lucas was the driving force behind several other filmmaking projects. One of the best of these is the movie WILLOW.<br /><br />WILLOW is the story about a Nelwyn (hobbit-like creatures) farmer and hopeful sorcerer named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) who finds a baby girl in some water weeds at the edge of the river. At first Willow is unsure what to do with the child, but after warhounds invade his peaceful village Willow approaches the village council to reveal his discovery and find out what to do. Willow is chosen as part of group that is to take the child and give it to the first human being they meet. The first human they meet is an encaged warrior by the name of Madmartigan (Val Kilmer). Madmartigan is imprisoned in a cage for offenses not revealed. After trying to give the baby to other humans, Willow and his companions realize that no one else will take the child. Madmartigan swears he will keep the child safe in exchange for his freedom.<br /><br />Unfortunately Madmartigan isn't much of a match for a race of tiny people called Brownies (they are related to fairies) who steal the child. Eventually it is revealed that the baby is a princess, Elora Danan who will grow up to become the Savior Princess. Willow is chosen as her guardian and sets for with Madmartigan and a couple of Brownies on a journey to take Elora Danan to safety and defeat the evil sorceress, Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) who has been killing newborns in an attempt to protect herself from a prophecy that predicts she will be overthrown by a baby female princess. Add in some trolls, a giant two-headed fire spewing monster, a couple of battles, a banished sorceress, and a magical wand and it makes for a very charming fantasy film.<br /><br />The acting in the film is on par with some of the better fantasy movies. Warwick Davis is lovable as the film's title character and is a fine actor despite his size. I wish there were more opportunities for him to do film's like this instead of having to play evil bad guys (he's the Leprechaun in the LEPRECHAUN movies).<br /><br />WILLOW hosts the first computer effects of the process known as &#34;morphing&#34; that were ever used in a movie. From a film history perspective, the movie is worth watching for that.<br /><br />However, provides a good story. Lucas has never claimed to be all that great of a writer and the tale that he weaved in WILLOW is soaked in all kinds of great stories from the past from LORD OF THE RINGS, to THE ODYSSEY, to Lucas' own STAR WARS saga. Nevertheless, everything seems to fit into a coherent whole that makes for a very charming and entertaining movie.the better fantasy movies.

B000002KB8|5.0|THis is a great album!! its underrated and is probably the best black sabbath album!! <br />I RATE ALL THE SONGS ON THIS CD 5 STARS
0060512806|1.0|I am 38 years old, and have read hundreds of science fiction books.  This is the first one I was unable to finish.  Although there are interesting parts, they are few and far between.  Some good, tight editing could have made this a much more fast paced and interesting read.  The back cover suggested a really cool story, but many of those elements are not introduced until 200 pages in.  By 400, only halfway through, I could not go on.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|1st off let me say that I am not a rabid Blind Guardian fan. While i do enjoy them, and own most of their cd catalogue, it took me about a year and a half to really get into what they were doing after my 1st BG purchase, \\"Nightfall In Middle Earth\\". I started to enjoy them, but still thought \\"N.I.M.E\\" and \\"A Night At The Opera\\" were a bit over-produced as far as all the different background guitar and vocal parts were concerned. <br /> <br /> As I am a musician myself (not anywhere near being professional), I enjoy watching other musicians perform, so i decided to take a chance and purchase this DVD \\"Imaginations Through The Looking Glass\\". Wow, Blind Guardian sounds better live, with a more raw, stripped down sound. <br /> <br /> This DVD is a quality product throughout, from the packaging to the Live show to the extra disc. The video and sound are excellent (sure, you can nitpick here and there where the camera was fuzzy or the sound wasnt quite \\"there\\" for a split second)and Blind Guardian was in top form, albiet the show IS taken from 2 different nights, but the editing was so good i didnt notice till half-way thru the disc. The bonus DVD is full of behind the scene footage, from setting up the festival stage, to band interviews and day-of-show goings on. The 2nd disc IS in German, but a decent DVD player should (some seem to have had problem) be able to subtitle it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great DVD that any power metal fan should have, and fans of metal in general should enjoy it if they like a good live performance regardless of genre.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|On Rust in Peace, Megadeth had another new line up. It showed new drummer Nick Menza, and new lead guitar \\"Virtuoso\\", Marty Friedman. The oringinal was a great album, the remaster is geat too. The new vocals from Mustaine dont bother me that much so i thinks  its still great. Plus you get to hear demos of songs with Chris Poland, which sound awesome.  <br /> <br />1.) Holy Wars...The Punishment Due-This track is why megadeth are speed metal gods. Great solos, and good drumming. The lyrics fit the song nicely too. 10/10 <br /> <br />2.) Hangar 18-Awesome song. Goes into the whole stuff with area 51. Plus it shows Friedman/Mustaine doing trade back solos. Also shows some wierd but cool sounding scales from Friedman. 10/10 <br /> <br />3.) Take No Prisoners-Another all out thrash song. So sick. The tempo is so fast on it, good closing solo by Friedman. 10/10  <br /> <br />4.) 5 Magics-Has a long intro. This is the only song i dont like how Mustaine sings it. Its still a good song but his voice sounds pretty bad. 8/10 <br /> <br />5.) Poison was the Cure-A shorter song but still good. I dont know what he says some of the times but the riff, and solos make up for it. 9/10 <br /> <br />6.) Lucretia-Another cool song. Great solos at the end of the song. Plus the opening riff sounds awesome. 9/10 <br /> <br />7.) Tornado of Souls-I think his voice sounds really wierd on this song. But its a cool wierd. This is like 1 of the few songs with a chorus, and i love this song. the lyrics, the solo, the rhythym sounds sick too. 10/10  <br /> <br />8.) Dawn Patrol-I never listen to it. Its just a singer, drums, and a bassist. If your a bassist you might like it. 4/10 <br /> <br />9.) Rust in Peace-Awesome drum intro. Then the guitars pick up, and it sounds really cool. The vocals sound good on it too. 9/10 <br /> <br />Well thats it. The bonus tracks are cool because Chris Polands on them. In my opinion Dave Mustaine sounds better in the demos, except on the Rust in Peace demo. He still sounds good but, you know. <br />
B00003CX5P|2.0|This edition to the star wars universe is crap.  The actors looked utterly out of place when meshed with the CGI (the fault of the director).  And haveing the movie pander to a 6 year old didn't help it any either.  This movie was riddeled with pointless reaction shots from Anakin and JarJar.  Instead of buying this peace of crap I got the Phatom Edit 1.1.  This is a fan edit of this movie that ends up only being little under an hour and it's a better film for it.
B0006213WG|4.0|This is something superbly surprising for someone who wrote the preppy semi-mosh song \\"Fat Lip\\". Good song, over played. Anyway back to this album. I bought it expected a shotty album after hearing the descent high power-ballad \\"All to Blame\\". Wow was I surprised. But I found it hard to take serious at first from a band that used to play pop-punk. Keywords USED TO. This is not metal. No way is it metal, but it is rock'n'roll. And my friends rock'n'roll ain't noise pollution. This is the album to kickstart a new wave of classic metal-classic rock/a hint of punk new wave of rock. The track \\"Bitter End\\" sounds like Metallica, wheras they have no problem bustin' out the acoustic for a ballad. I do hope they are serious about this sound they are going for, cause I like it. I like it alot.
B000001F5F|5.0|This is a five star album for a variety of reasons:<br /><br />A. The song selection. This is a release from a supremely confident band, trusting that their audience will enjoy the songs they enjoy playing and not just the obvious favorites. Party Girl? 11 O'clock Tick Tock? Rock on!<br /><br />B. If you are of a certain age, UABRS is inextricably linked to the Red Rocks concert video that was incessantly played on MTV for months and months (and months) back when MTV was not only concerned with music but on a mission to break high quality, envelope-pushing new music in America<br /><br />C. It is a snapshot of one of Rock's great bands peaking for the first time<br /><br />All that said, Under A Blood Red Sky cries out for the Deluxe Edition treatment. This short (under 40 minutes) album was sold as an EP upon it's 1983 release and if memory serves was priced accordingly. It seems like this sold for under $6.00 on vinyl. In my humble opinion, Island should blow the dust off the masters re-release it:<br /><br />A. Remastered in SACD format<br /><br />B. Fleshed out with all or most of the songs played on the dates originally recorded for the album (I saw this tour at the old Paramount Theater in Portland, OR in 1983 and I remember they were still playing some of the great tunes from Boy, An Cat Dubh particularly sticks in my memory)<br /><br />C. With a second-disc DVD containing the whole Red Rocks concert<br /><br />D. Why not add some MTV interview footage from the time?<br /><br />E. A liner note essay from Paul McGuinness telling the story of the first American transformation: From obscure Irish New Wave up and comers to America's Alterna-Rock heroes with the release of War and the Red Rocks video<br /><br />UABRS compares favorably to the Who's Live At Leeds. The Who release was an explosive live document also, marred only by it's brevity. The Deluxe Edition remedied that and proved a revelation. Come on Island, get on the stick!
B000002KON|5.0|UIf you just dig on the Kinks big US hits because they're poppy and fun then go pick up Lola vs. Powerman, a brilliant album in it's own right, but if you find Ray Davies' lyrics on \\"Lola\\" and \\"You've Really Got Me\\" brilliant, subtle, eloquent and poetic then you've just seen the tip of the iceberg.  Arthuris an underappreciated concept masterpiecce.  The decay and dissilusionment of a working class English family is it's focus and as it dwells deeper into the post-nuclear family psyche it manages to fit in a complex understanding of the characters alongside killer guitar riffs andsome just plain old brilliant rock 'n' roll music.  On par , interms of complexity and lyricism with \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" and reminiscent of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"II\\"
630587493X|1.0|This film was on TV the other day and the only reason I watched it was because I was bored. My god, afterwards I felt like Id truly wasted the day and just like the film it seemed 200 years had passed. The script was flat and boring,  full of misplaced jokes and inappropriate sexual innuendoes (only one joke brought a chuckle) the acting mediocre in no way moving,. As for the story itself, it was like being spoon fed a lesson in human morality and re-gurgitated SCI-Fi babble with no real depth or intellect at all.  <br /> <br />I dont know why I continued to watch the film, maybe just to see how worse it could possibly get but when it finally did (and what a predictably rubbish ending too) the only satisfaction I had was knowing I hadnt made the mistake of paying for the DVD. <br /> <br />.... even I-Robot is better than this heap

B0007GAEW6|5.0|With their latest release, the Mars Volta have solidified their position as one of the most musically audacious bands in the mainstream today.  Continuing in the epic progressive nature of their previous release, \\"Deloused in the Comatorium\\", \\"Frances the Mute\\" sees the band pushing the boundaries even further, making for a somewhat jarring but undoubtedly engaging listen.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\", a sprawling 13-minute epic.  The song sort of builds up in reverse, firing out of the gate with wild jazzy time changes, eventually melting into spacious guitar melodies, and finally concluding with an odd electronic bit.<br /><br />From there, the album mainly continues in the multi-part epic fashion, with the exception of the more radio-friendly ballad \\"The Widow\\".  Much like \\"Televators\\", from \\"Deloused...\\", this song serves as a brief respite from the musical madness.  However, it ends with a long, ambient outro that goes on for a bit too long, and drags the song out a bit more than it really needs to be.<br /><br />\\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is perhaps the highlight of the album, boasting a strong Latin influence.  The song is filled with scintillating salsa-esque rhythms, adding a catchiness to the wild, technical jazz structures, and features lyrics both in English and Spanish.  At 12 minutes in length, the song goes by surprisingly fast.<br /><br />The remaining two epics, \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" and \\"Cassandra Gemini\\", delve even deeper into unpredictable weirdness.  Each is spread over several tracks, totaling at around 27 and 20 minutes respectively.<br /><br />The jazz influence in these songs is taken to even greater extremes, featuring trumpet, flutes, and saxophone (Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea even contributes some nice trumpet work).  Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's jagged guitar rhythms and Jon Theodore's octopus-like drumming are showcased here like never before, and the high-pitched cathartic wails of frontman Cedric Bixler Zavala anchor it all very nicely.<br /><br />Combining jazz and rock stylings hasn't been commercially viable since the 70's, but these guys put an extremely fresh and exciting spin on it, and manage to sound very natural and cutting-edge in the process.  The music seems rather chaotic at first, but for the most part, everything flows together very well.<br /><br />I realize this previous description was a bit vague, but the reason is that there is so much going on in these two songs, it is extremely difficult to put it into words.  It's really something you just have to hear for yourself.<br /><br />Epic, unpredictable, and quite intense, the Mars Volta are most certainly not for the faint of heart.  However, those who appreciate progressive rock, or any daring and challenging style of musical art will find great worth in this, one of the best and most exciting releases of the year.s of frontman Cedric Bixler Zavala anchor it all very nicely.   <br /> <br />Combining jazz and rock stylings hasn't been commercially viable since the 70's, but these guys put an extremely fresh and exciting spin on it, and manage to sound very natural and cutting-edge in the process.

B000002H33|5.0|The best heavy metal band of all-time at their creative best. <br /> <br />I first got into Metallica during my teenage heavy metal phase in the late 80s and early 90s.  I picked up ...And Justice For All (on vinyl) along with Master of Puppets (audio cassette) summer of '88 and wore out both albums within a year.  For me, these are the band's best efforts, and perhaps the two best metal albums ever recorded, with Puppets receiving a slight subjective edge between the pair. <br /> <br />I continue to be amazed at how sophisticated the songwriting is on Puppets--keep in mind that this was a group of pasty-faced, beer-swilling kids still in their early twenties when the album was recorded in the fall of 1985.  The quality of the songwriting is top-notch, easily on par with Led Zeppelin's first few albums, and with the release of Puppets Metallica had firmly established their own genre (intelligent thrash) and an incomparable level of originality. <br /> <br />There are no weak links amongst the eight tracks on Puppets.  \\"Battery,\\" similar to the opening song \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" from their previous release Ride the Lightning, lulls the listener with a light acoustic opening only to hit him with a sledgehammer of sound moments later; the title track is a pure rock classic, transcending the entire metal field; \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is a Lovecraft-inspired nightmare demonstrating the mighty punch of a \\"dropped-D\\" tuning; \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" is a frightening first-person look into madness, sympathizing with the plight of the mentally ill; \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is a harsh, hyper speed precursor to perhaps the band's most famous song, the anti-war milestone \\"One\\"; \\"Leper Messiah\\" warns of false prophets and the inherent problems with organized religion; \\"Orion\\" is a classically-inspired instrumental featuring a steady allegro opening march, followed by a soft, largo interlude in 6/8 time, and ending in an allegro finish with terrific outro solo; \\"Damage, Inc.\\" is one of the fastest (190 b.p.m.!), harshest, butt-kickingest thrash pieces ever. <br /> <br />Though Metallica layered the tracks heavily on Puppets this album doesn't have the problem with excessively thick sound that Justice has.  Some of the guitar tracks on Justice were layered dozens of times resulting in a somewhat muddy and unintentionally distorted sound.  For having been recorded almost twenty years ago Puppets sounds as fantastic today as it did when I first gave a listen.  It's also one of the few metal albums I still listen to regularly.
B000002C25|4.0|Despite often being derided as a Beatles ripoff (which I suppose isn't entirely untrue), Oasis are a pretty good band.  They made a giant splash with their best-seller \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)\\", and, riding on that success, this album also did very well.  However, it didn't seem to be quite as commercially successful, despite selling very well.  But oh well, not important.  What is important is that this album is full of excellent, catchy tunes, with plenty of big guitar hooks, powerful drumming, and Liam's trademark vocals.<br /><br />This album is much more epic than its predecessor, clocking in at over 70 minutes, with many songs in the 6-9 minute range.  Some of these are very well-written and go by quite fast, while others tend to lag a bit, and make the album overall feel a little drawn-out.  \\"D'you Know What I Mean?\\" and \\"It's Getting Better (Man!)\\" are top-notch  melodic rock, \\"My Big Mouth\\" and \\"Magic Pie\\" have powerful, driving melodies, and are equally beautiful and energetic.  The title track is quirky and rocking, and \\"Don't Go Away\\" is excellent catchy pop rock.<br /><br />The album drags the most with \\"Fade In-out\\", which is much too repetitive and long, and really could have been left out.  \\"All Around the World\\" is kind of cheesy and over-the-top, and despite having its moments, just falls flat.  As Samhot stated in his review, they were trying too hard, and ended up achieving the opposite of what they were going for.  Also, the reprise is pretty pointless, and I think \\"It's Getting Better (Man!)\\" would have been a much stronger way to end the album.<br /><br />This is an album that may take some time to sink in.  It's not perfect, but there's plenty of stuff to enjoy here. It's not as readily catchy as \\"What's the Story...\\" (and I must admit, also not as good), but it's certainly worth the purchase.
B000002UAF|5.0|A Hard Day's Night, being the Beatles' third LP and the soundtrack to their first feature film, signals the height of Beatlemania craze and the top of their pop-star period. The film 'A Hard Day's Night' shows the Beatles' remarkable sense of humor and self consciousness in regards to the absurdity and silliness of their popularity at the time. The album, though, is a perfect pop album, one of the finest ever made by anyone. It shares its qualities with the other truly perfect pop albums - The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds', Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumors' and Carole King's 'Tapestry', to name a few - short, catchy, highly melodic songs, simple rhythms, a perfect structure, and musical and harmonical complexities that make the music sound completely fresh and unique and yet do not overwhelm the music to make it less listenable. <br /> <br />In fact, while the songs are not as expressive and experimental as the ones the Beatles recorded in the late 60s, in many ways Lennon and McCartney were at the top of their songwriting career at this very point - they prove themselves on 'A Hard Day's Night' to be completely mature and completely aware musicians who know precisely what they're doing, and in that aspect they were lightyears ahead of any other rock musicians working at that time, save maybe Brian Wilson. It's no accident that this was the first Beatles album to feature nothing but original songs; and interestingly enough, the only Beatles album EVER to feature nothing but Lennon/McCartney compositions. It truly shows them at their best, and it's easy to see, even today, that it wasn't just they're charm, their sense of humor and their good looks that made them the superstars they were. Very few songwriters manage to achieve that perfect blend of originality and complexity with lightness and catchiness that Lennon and McCartney did on this album. <br /> <br />That much can be heard from the very first chord of the title track, which opens song, album and film and is as powerfuland heavenly today as it was forty years ago. A stroke of genius so simple, so perfect - it's little touches like this chord, like the drum entry on 'If I Fell', like the harmony on 'I Should Have Known Better', or the ever so slight Latin touch on 'And I Love Her', that make the difference between pop music and timeless music like this. These are the details that demand the listener's attention and make them take notice. Each song on this album is beautifully crafted like that, mainly 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Can't Buy Me Love', by no accident the album's leading singles, but the others as well, including the second side - songs that were not on the film, and perhaps just a little bit weaker than the first half, but still include classics like 'Things We Said Today', 'I'll Be Back' and John's wonderfully and typically bitter 'You Can't Do That'. <br /> <br />Call it dated if you must, but I dare you to find one serious musician in the last forty years who was not influenced - if not directly - by 'A Hard Day's Night'. And though it may take a bit more attention to find the genius in it than in Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, it's impossible not to fall in love with it. Again, it's the multi-layerness of it that makes a perfect pop record that lingers through the ages. Even if the Beatles hadn't become the psychedelic and avant-garde gurus that they had in '67-'70, and A Hard Day's Night was their last and finest achievement, it would have been enough to earn them a place in the history books.
B00004NRWH|5.0|Simply stated (no pun intended).......this is the best album Nickelback has put out.  The songs rock and arent repetitive sounding.  I have tried to get into realeases after this, but they fail to rock out like this one does.  BUY IT IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN!
B000084T18|1.0|This man is so talentless. The only thing worth while is the background music to his trite lyrics; this background music would be better without 50 cent's influence and can be found on a mixture of rock and, surprisingly, classical albums.  Nothng original here and it butchers the real music in the background used to move this product.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|So it's still the beginning of the year.  However, this crooner is as talented and heartfelt a male singer as there ever has been.  The disc includes 1 song co-written by Mr. Bubl`e, and it's outstanding:  \\"Home.\\"  Chances are good you've heard it on the radio.   <br />     The remainder of the tracks are pop standards,  beautifully arranged by David Foster.  While Foster is hit-or-miss, (listen to the extreme power schmaltz of JOSH GROBAN) He nails this swing/big band sound for Bubl`e.  The covers range from \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" to the Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" and it's amazing how this guy makes them sound as though they have the same composer.  Other uptempo standouts are the opening track, \\"Feeling Good,\\" and the stunningly arranged \\" Save The Last Dance For Me.\\"  Just listen to that voice soar at the end of that one.  Nothing uptempo can compete with the ballads.  Along with the aforementioned, \\"Home,\\"  he makes \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" the Ray Charles hit, and Leon Russell's \\"Song for You,\\"  his own.  Again, credit Foster for not overdoing these ballads, as is often his penchant.  A truly brilliant CD.
B00000AF95|5.0|KISS's \\"Animalize\\" is not generally regarded to be among one of the band's better offerings, but I happen to be quite fond of it. In the early 80s, KISS went through a revolving door of guitar players. From Ace Frehley, to Vinnie Vincent, to Mark St. John, and finally Bruce Kulick--all in a matter of about three years. This is the lone KISS album to feature lead guitarist Mark St. John, who was sort of like the George Lazerby/John Corabi/Gary Cherone of KISS. Even though the trio of early 80s KISS albums all feature different guitar players (Lick it Up, Animalize, Asylum), a casual listener wouldn't be able to tell. The music did not suffer from a lack of a stable lineup. All three albums sound like a cohesive follow-up to one another.<br /><br />Even though Vincent was a huge presence and main songwriter on \\"Lick it Up,\\" \\"Animalize\\" still sounds like a natural follow-up. St. John didn't help co-write any of the songs on this CD, but his style and playing is more or less the same as Vincent-- a very flashy 80s shredder--in contrast to the more laid back style of Frehley or Kulick.<br /><br />Even though this lineup of KISS was short lived, the band sounds as tight as ever. St. John jelled with Stanley, Simmons, and Carr to create a kick-ass 80s metal album. This CD takes off where \\"Lick it Up\\" left off, but is slightly heavier. The album opens up strong with Stanley's \\"I've had Enough\\" (Into the Fire) and never looses momentum. \\"Heavens on Fire\\" (Stanley, Desmond Child) remains one of KISS's best, most memorable songs to date. As others have commented, the Stanley songs are more memorable and better written, but I actually like the Simmons' penned songs as well. \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\" does have rather juvenile lyrics, but it's catchy as hell. The whole CD is very enjoyable and a lot of fun. Stanley and Simmons wrote a great collection of pop-metal songs. \\"Animalize\\" may not be as original or memorable as \\"Love Gun\\" or \\"Destroyer,\\" but it's still a solid 80s sounding heavy metal album. St. John was a good stand in and his playing and solos are all quite good. Eric Carr's awesome cannon like drums sound great as always and help give the songs an extra kick.<br /><br />\\"Animalize\\" is one of my most favorite hard rock albums from the 1980s. If you're a fan of KISS or 80s metal, I recommend giving \\"Animalize\\" a spin.St. John was a good stand in and his playing and solos are all quite good.

0515127485|3.0|After reading so many glowing reviews here I expected a real masterpiece, but having just finished \\"Archangel\\" I can't quite see what all the fuss is about.  \\"Archangel\\" is a pretty solid thriller that is at its best when it brings to life details of Stalin's cruel regime, but beyond that it is only average.  The characters are pretty one-dimensional (evil and cunning Soviet general, frumpy alcoholic professor with writer's block, scrappy American journalist who'll do anything for a story, etc.).  None of the characters are particularly likeable, or (far worse) even sympathetic -- as another reviewer said, I wouldn't have cared too much if Kelso, the main character, had been shot.  If you don't really care about your characters, it's really hard to keep the suspense up.<br /><br />The plot is interesting enough, but by the time it is fully revealed to us Harris abruptly wraps things up.  He could have developed his own idea a bit more.  As it is, the ending is *technically* a bit open to interpretation, which might leave room for a sequel -- perhaps that was Harris's idea all along?<br /><br />The book isn't bad, and it's fine within it's genre -- a quick and interesting thriller.  But don't expect too much.<br /><br />Those who really liked the plot of \\"Archangel\\" should check out \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" by Steve Berry.  It's not as good as \\"Archangel,\\" but it's almost a companion piece as far as plots go.
B0000C8AVE|4.0|I haven't listened to many folk songs, and even less Bob Dylan (only \\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" and the \\"Everybody must get stoned\\" song), but I like this album.  I read the beginning of a book called Studio 1: The Bob Dylan Reader, and I heard mention of this album, so I went to a record store and bought The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.  His girlfriend (I forgot her name) is on the front and back.<br /><br />There are political songs, like \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" \\"Masters of War\\" (which is very relevant to today), and \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.\\"<br /><br />Many humorous songs, too - \\"Bob Dylan's Blues,\\" Talkin' World War III Blues,\\" and I Shall Be Free\\" (\\"Make love to Elizabeth Taylor, catch hell from Richard Burton\\").<br /><br />Plus love songs - \\"Girl from the North Country,\\" `Corrina, Corrina\\" (the only track with drums, I think), and \\"Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance.\\"<br /><br />I like \\"Oxford Town\\" and \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" best.<br /><br />I shouldn't categorize the songs and try to pigeonhole them; listening to the album as a whole, I don't categorize - I just listen.<br /><br />As my first Bob Dylan CD, I am not disappointed.  In the future, the Dylan albums I purchase will, hopefully, be as good as this one.
0790749858|5.0|This movie was well made despite its' obvious crudeness. Yes, I would agree that the charactors are pale immitations of the old Looney Tunes charactors and of course the acting by the Ball players (yes, even Bill was just as bad or worse, despite his so-called \\"name\\"). The voices was probably like listening to AL Yankovic-type impersonations compared to the old \\"Tunes\\" voices. Most of the \\"critically acclaimed\\" movies are only hype anyway so, why attack this movie?? Rediculous. <br /> <br />This movie was very entertaining. You have these jealous idiots that hate the fact that Michael Jordan is cast in the film. So what?? Get over it. One idiot was talking about his popularity outside of the US as if it has anything to do with it. The guy is known outside of the US from this movie and the produts he endorses as well as those who follow American basketball. And, Yes, he's known \\"moreso\\" today. You MJ bashers are just plain jealous and stupid.  <br /> <br />Yes, this film was still VERY entertaining and inspirational.  I've seen less entertaining and inspiring films get Oscar / Acadamy Award wins and nominations. I wouldn't normally write a review such as this but, these people talk about this film as something personal that has been done to them. If you don't like it, or thing it's so bad, it's not like you can create something remotely similar or better. So, just get over it, \\"Space Jam\\" detractors.
B00065GX64|5.0|Okay, so I'm loosely using the phrase \\"masterpiece of German cinema\\", as I have not covered a massive demographhic of German cinema, but for what I have seen, M is definitly a sheer masterpiece. I started by buying a cheap DVD at my mall once containing Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" (which is now my favorite film of all time), in any case, the film blew me away, so, I looked it up online, then saw the director's filmography. This was on IMDb.com, and I saw his film \\"M\\" was on the Top 250. Ranked pretty high, and with an intricate plot, I chose to look for it. With no luck at the mall, I tried Best Buy, my first choice for DVDs, and wouldn't you know it, \\"M\\" is in. So I pick it up, watch it as soon as I get home.<br /><br />Wow. This film is impeccible. As I write this, I'm going through a phase of  watching alot of foriegn cinema, mostly German and French movies. This is by far and away the best.<br /><br />Criterion's transfer and restoration is great. Clear, crisp picture quality, a job well down. While it has a different, European \\"letterbox\\" transfer, the look is subtle, as I myself don't pay much mind to it. Also, it's stocked full of features, short film, interviews, enough to cover for Criterion's price tag.<br /><br />And as a film, it's just amazing. The acting by Peter Lorre was great, and different considering I had just watched him in \\"Casablanca\\" in my film class. The plot is very unique. A harrowing tale of a child murderer in Berlin, with the growing unrest in the city. A chase ensues for him, and the end culminates in an interesting show-down of sorts.<br /><br />This movie gets my highest recommendation, 5 out of 5. A brilliant film, highlighting on of my favorite decades in film, the 30s, and is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
B00079018K|1.0|Do not buy this CD.  We need to take a stand as consumers that we will not put up with this.  You buy a CD and cannot copy the songs to your MP3 player?  No thanks.
B00020QXU4|4.0|Okay the only dif between the UK and the US versions is 1 song got swapped (and the one on the UK version is waaay better), but that's the version I've got so that's the version I'm reviewing. <br /> <br />That being said, this is a great album.  The Killers are no doubt going to be labelled as another \\"retro\\" band.  Let me just say that I'm really tired of this whole \\"retro\\" label.  Just because a new band actually has a melody instead of a dull repetition of over-over-overdiven minor chords (ahem...Godsmack), sings instead of growling like a dorky 3rd grade kid trying to scare his little sister on Halloween (ahem...Slipknot), and sings about things us normal human types can relate too instead of moaning and wailing about how much they hate being rich and successful (shem...Korn), doesn't mean they're ripping off \\"older\\" music. <br /> <br />True, The Killers use the same sort of synth-driven hooks that Duran Duran used, but did Duran Duran ever bust out the guitars like \\"Mr. Brightside\\"?  True, The Killers throw in a good dose of melancholy-English-croonery that might remind you of Morrisey (if you allow yourself to be reminded of that sort of thing), but would Morrisey have made you want to just get up and bounce around in the middle of your bedroom like \\"Somebody Told Me\\" does? <br /> <br />The Killers--just like a lot of other so-called-retro, may have their roots in something a little more recent than whoever's-on-the-cover-of-Blender-magazine-this-week, but face it, they're a new band and overall a new sound.   <br /> <br />And by Jove it's a good sound indeed.  I had more fun listening to this album the *first* time than I did listening to one song by most \\"New and Innovative bands\\" (ahem...Linkin Park...you guys really suck...quit now...stop selling reptition to the kids, they get enough of it from pop/rap/whatever as it is, they don't need it from ignored-computer-nerds posing as a rock n roll band). <br /> <br />So, the lesson today, kids, is that if somebody is getting labelled as \\"retro\\", it probably means they are playing REAL music (with notes, not just an expensive effects rig plugged out of a guitar that they really don't know how to play), and it would do your poor MTV-abused brain some good to give 'em a listen.
B000002GFC|5.0|Cream (Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker) were possibly better as a live act than on record, but their records (at least some of them) were nevertheless impressive and this CD captures the best of their recorded music. The group were generally more popular in America (where they spent a lot of time touring) than their British homeland.<br /><br />They were never really a singles act although they had some chart hits. They never made the UK top ten but they came close with I feel free. They also made the UK top twenty with Strange brew and Badge. Wrapping paper, Anyone for tennis, Sunshine of my love and White room all became minor UK hits. Every one of those tracks can be found on this collection, together with other brilliant tracks including Spoonful, Politician and Crossroads.<br /><br />This compilation provides a great introduction to Cream's music, though maybe the best way to hear them is via their original albums (Fresh Cream, Disraeli gears, Wheels of fire, Goodbye). Still, this is the best place to start if you are new to their music.
B000002JOH|4.0|I like this album alot. Dime's solos kill. I'm not so crazy about pantera, but these solos are awesome!!!!
0765310015|5.0|Now where do I start? Gardens of the moon is the first book in a series of 10 (5 out so far) based on at least 5 continents and I estimated over 10 different character POV per book. There is also about 300, 000 years of relevant history, numerous different species and a completely different system of `magic' to the regular fantasy fare.  With countless mysteries and good number of extremely powerful beings it is quite hard to get your head around it at first. So I will try my best in this review to give you a good idea of what to expect from the series as a whole. <br /> <br />Firstly if you are looking for any of the following, beware! <br /> <br />A young nobody (or lost prince)  finds famous sword, hacks up baddy, saves the world <br />Main characters that never seem to die <br />A light read i.e. Few brain cells or imagination required (Harry Potter?)  <br />Author spoon feeding i.e. everything is explained immediately <br />Elves, Orcs, Hobbits, goblins etc <br /> <br />After about 100 pages of gardens of the moon you will be very confused, after about 200 it will be even worse, it was for me when I first read it. The story does pick up, but there are still a number of things that will have your head spinning. Erikson is not the type to give info dumps so the brain cells will have to stay sharp while reading this book since the info is spread through all the books. The first book is the weakest of the 5 currently published simply because it is impossible to fully understand everything that happens since you don't have enough information about the Malazan world. But perseverance pays of tenfold as soon as the second book and there is hardly any filler (WOT?)  so it is worthwhile not to skim through. <br /> <br />To give a head start I would say that there are 2 definite constants in the Malazan world. The first is convergence which means that power draws other power. And the second one is a balance of that power. It is also useful to condition your thinking andremember that this is a completely different world and is not based on LOTR or D&D, for example a god is not one in the conventional sense, but is just a powerful being who commands a warren (a realm can be used to release magic into the Malazan world).  <br /> <br />Even though gardens is a good book, there will always be debate about its quality since it is quite complex and a lot of people can't take that. However, that debate dies off after Book 2  (Deadhouse Gates) , which even with a good dose of extra mystery is easier to follow and the Erikson proves himself as top class with  incredible story that leaves most people very numb and wanting more.  If you are not hooked after that there is still some hope as book 3 (memories of ice) is in my opinion even better. <br /> <br />There will invariably be comparisons made to George Martin's (another favourite of mine) song of ice and fire. Which is fair since they are both gritty and main characters can and do die. However, I would say that Martin is more character driven, while Erikson is more event or plot driven. But both do it so well that they are arguable writing the best ongoing fantasy series at present, other really don't come close. <br />  <br />So you should get into the Malazan series if you're looking for: <br /> <br />A powerful story that will blow you away   <br />An intriguing web of plots with no clichs  <br />A chance to test the limits of your imagination <br />A different world you can really get into <br /> <br />Enjoy. <br />
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a timeless, deeply powerful, brilliant novel that explores safety, risk, individuality, the common good, love and loss and sheds light on all of it while providing enormous fodder for the reader to develop his or her own thoughts on these issues. It's a favorite in schools with good reason - it is well written, tightly plotted, fast paced, and just ambiguous enough to leave kids lots of room to consider their own views on the characters and their decisions. I strongly recommend that all parents read this book and discuss it with your kids. It will be an enlightening experience for both of you.
B000058983|5.0|Like the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, Love never hit the mainstream, but had a massive cultural effect on all music that came after them. Up to this day, this album remains a true cult classic. Psychadelic without being too arty, and folky without being boring. Most bands from both of the previously mentioned genres should take a lesson or two from these guys. The highlights of the album are definatly \\"Alone Again Or\\" (with its beautiful flamico influenced guitar), \\"A House Is Not a Motel\\" (with it's rock 'n' roll influenced guitarwork), and \\"The Red Telephone\\" (love the lyrics on this one). And who discovered Jimi Hendrix and got him in the studio? Arthur Lee!
B00005U8EM|4.0|It's kind of a hidden gem.  This is probably Bill Murray at the peak of his schtick in the 80s.  This role fits him.  It's really a simple - even silly - premise.  Arrogant, self-centered semi-celebrity weatherman gets called to cover the Groundhog Day hoopla in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, something beneath him that he begrudgingly does. <br /> <br />In a strange twist of fate, he continue to wake up every day to the very same day - February 2, Groundhog Day.  For day after day, he wakes up at 6:00 a.m. to the same song, the same DJs and the same forecast.  The only one who knows it is him.  Everyone else is living a different day.  Only he is experiencing it over and over again.   <br /> <br />We suddenly see his personality begin to change and his worldview with it.  He begins to appreciate small-town life and finds his personality transforming.  Never sappy and never sinking into cynicism, it remains fresh and simple and a pleasant viewing experiencing with just a touch of whimsy.  It's a nice change from the heavy films out today and a break from the cheese that is at the opposite end of that spectrum.  Guaranteed to lift your spirit just a touch.
B00005ASHM|5.0|By far the best Beach Boys album (and the best Brian Wilson album, along with the recently unearthed treasure \\"Smile\\"). The harmonies and lyrics in the songs are perfect, and remain timeless no matter how many times you listen to it or how many years have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelves. It wasn't a big hit in the States, mostly due to the fact nobody was ready for it. It's such a well-organized and cohesive work, much unlike what people were used to the Beach Boys putting out at the time. They decided to be something more than just a surf band, or a catchy and trendy pop band, something which nobody gave them credit for. Compare \\"God Only Knows\\" to \\"409\\" or \\"Surfin' Safari\\", and you shall understand what I mean. The melodies are perfect, and blend greatly with the vocals. This is a rare album without a single track to be skipped. If you haven't caught on yet, freaking buy this!
B0000DJZB9|5.0|As a big G N R fan I wanted much more but when I purchaced this DVD I knew what I was getting. There is a lack of content on this DVD but I like the music videos I just woulda prefered some special features. All my other music DVDs have much more on them and I wouldn't say it was a waste of money but some more things should've been put into this package. I rated it 5 stars because it was everything that it said it was nothing less than a good time watching classic guns n roses videos that aren't on TV anymore besides the last hour of Headbanger's Ball.
B000002AP1|4.0|Without Ron Asheton's guitar and Dave Alexander's bass, this can not truly be called a Stooges album. However, if you view it as a good and raw rock 'n' roll album, it is, well, good and raw! Great dancing music. One of the first punk bands by far, and truly raw power. How can one not just rock out or turn the speakers up as loud as they can go when listening to \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell\\" or \\"Death Trip\\"? Don't even ask me to choose which Stooges album is my favorite, I love them all like I'd love my own children.
0156027321|4.0|I found this book an entertaining read. The main character, Piscine Molitar Patel is an engaging, fascinating and very likable character. I was driven to continue reading as a sort of cheering section for this nice man I wanted to overcome his obstacles. The other reviewer's comment that it tempted you in the beginning with greater spiritual meaning is well taken: \\"this is a story that will make you believe in god' - mamaji (another character) and Pi's interaction with Hindu, Muslim and Christian faiths simultaneously seem to lead in that direction, but it didn't deliver well on that count. But from reading the 'about the author' section, I don't think such a person as Mr Martell has the capacity to be anything other than a spectator in spiritual matters. It's an amazing story, a great character, and at times a very funny story. (interfaith dialog and the interview with the insurance men had me laughing out loud)
B000001DYA|5.0|In 1968, nobody was this raw or crude (save for the Velvet Underground). The guitars are fuzzed out and distorted beyond beleif. Sure, in 1969 both the Stooges and the MC5 would top this album, but nothing was quite like this at the time. In addition to having the group's one hit \\"Summertime Blues\\" (it's weird to think how the flower power children could usher this baby into the charts), the album also contains the even better \\"Out of Focus\\" and \\"Parchment Farm\\". On the cover of this album, they may look like hippies, but they almost sound nothing like them. There's definatly more Stooges / Black Sabbath / Captain Beefheart in their sound (hey they even predated the first two bands mentioned) than Jefferson Airplane or \\"Incense and Peppermints\\". Great album to play your guitar along to, glad I discovered this killer album. Also, unlike the long concept albums of the time, this one is only a bit over thirty minutes with six songs.
0385510454|3.0|I picked up The Broker based on John Grisham's reputation alone.  I have read most of his books and have enjoyed nearly all that I have read.  I do not count any of Grisham's books in my list of top 10 books of all time and I usually like to read his books in a more relaxed state.  This book gave me nearly all I expected.<br /><br />It starts out fairly slow and has the classic Grisham build up but it never quite seems to reach the pinnacle of where he's trying to go.  I was never sure whether I should like the character they call \\"The Broker\\" or whether I should despise him.  At the end of the book I couldn't tell whether he was a better person at the end of the book than at the beginning.  And I felt like Grisham possibly didn't know either.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an enjoyable read as long as you are not expecting one of the better books that Grisham has written.  I would recommend this book if you have the time and don't have any \\"must-have\\" books waiting to be read.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer tells the story of four people who each get what they want in a relationship, but haven't a clue as to how to hang onto it.  Each of the characters relationships are doomed from the beginning.  None of them can see it coming, of course, but they each have a tendency to lay the groundwork to ensure its occurrence.   <br />     The movie depicts what happens when a man, Dan (Jude Law), falls for Alice (Natalie Portman).  Dan sees Alice first as a vision of beauty on the streets. She gets hit by a car and he gets to save her and take her to the hospital.  She's younger than him, wears skimpy outfits and works as a stripper. She completely falls for him and he's got her right where he wants her. <br />     A year goes by and the two now live in New York. Dan sets his eye on a woman closer to his age named Anna (Julia Roberts). She works as a photographer and has been assigned to photograph Dan for the back cover of his latest book, which oddly enough, tells the story of he and Alice. Anna can see right through Dan. She can see that he doesn't love Alice, so much as he wants to hang onto her like a prize won. Frustrated, Dan tries to shake Anna's life up by sending her someone completely undesirable in a very comical scene in the film. <br />     Anna and the character sent to her by Dan end up hitting it off which goes against Dan's plan to be an obnoxious prankster.  Many more months pass by and the four lives become locked together through a series of infidelities, declarations of lust and destructive confessions. Lovers leave, hearts get broken and honeymoons crash and burn. Be careful what you ask for. You just might get it. <br />     Now, first, let me tell you this movie is not for the general public.  The explicit language and sex may be too much for some to handle.  Also, if you are looking to go see a movie that, when over, will make you feel all warm and tingly inside and optimistic about life, this is not the film for you.  It is not meant to have a moral or teach you a lesson.  It is a film depicting life and certain aspects of the human condition they way that they are in today's society.  Closer studies the human tendency toward self-preservation in the face of gross deception. It is at once a condemnation of human nature and an acceptance of it.  <br />     Closer is a welcomed relief from the normal drivel being released by American cinema lately.  I highly recommend this film to all those who are fascinated by the enormous gray areas of love, seduction, trust, infidelity and deception.   <br />
0609610570|2.0|I had a very hard time getting through this book.  I love to read books about business (or any other books for that matter) and enjoy learning different points of view on very abstract subjects; however, this book didn't have a lot to offer as a way to keep me interested.  The authors speak as if they are all-knowing and imply that if you disagree with their point of view then you are destined to fail.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem is that I am reading the book nearly 3 years after it has been published.  However, if that is the case then it is hard to imagine that this is going to be one of the great business books.  If it is out-of-date just 3 years after it is published, how will it fare in 25 years?<br /><br />I am not sure if I would recommend this book to others.  It seems that a business person would be better of actually using their time on actual execution instead of reading about how others aren't doing it.
B000001EXB|3.0|I had reviewed this album at one point but I feel the need to go back and re-review it in a much more objective way..<br /><br />\\"Picture\\" is an album that came out at a time when Elton's career was booming and resurging, but at the same time falling into a sort of adult contemporary and slightly over produced feel. \\"Picture\\" is exactly that, an adult contemporary, over produced album.<br /><br />The tracks themselves are quite well written with excellent melodies and lyrics that get stuck in your head. Not to mention Elton's vocals are clean, clear, and dead-on. But the best way to sum up the album??  it's this... where is Elton's piano?  Each track is full of excellent pop ear candy with all the 90's sheen in full front... But in it's own way this album comes off more like an project called \\"Session musicians featuring Elton John on Vocals\\". Chris Thomas is an excellent producer but I do feel on this album the over production hurts the intimate melodies and lyrics that Elton and Bernie had written.<br /><br />For me, \\"Picture\\" marks the end of Elton's pop album-making machine before he started going back to his early roots. It's his last attempt at a radio friendly target audience in all it's 90's glory. ...now, having said that, I'm a HUGE elton fan, and do appreciate this album greatly even though I do think you have to be in a certain mood to really 'listen' to it. Aside from the over produced sheen, the melodies and lyrics are great and Elton's voice is in fine form. ;o)<br /><br />All The Best,  The AndyMan
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful. Everyone of the songs are beautiful. Very talented artists, I have enjoyed it thoroughly.
B000001DQI|5.0|There are so many reviews of this album, most of them talking about the songs that people think you will like or their favorite songs... So what do I say that hasn't already been said?!? Well, I'm going to tell you why I love this album so much, and hopefully you will come away with a better respect for this masterpiece like I did...<br /><br />First off, growing up I was always an Elton John fan. As far back as I can remember! Litterally!  I am now a 24 year old proffesional musician. I am a session musician for signed and unsigned acts out of nashville, TN and I credit most of my influences to Mr EJ, and most of it to this album.  I had never heard an actual Elton 'album' until I purchased this at the age of 16. It was always the 'hits'...<br /><br />My sister had it, but never let me listen to it..! So just to show her I went out and bought it as soon as I got my license. I really didn't know what to expect to be honest because I wasn't too versed in Elton's back-catalogue at ALL (yet..!).  So I bought it at a used CD store, drove home (had a tape player in the car!) and popped it in..<br /><br />I was freaked out by the first minute of the CD..  the song was so haunting..  I couldn't stop listening to it..  The cd kept going... one song after another.. I was just amazed! I LOVED IT! I just remember thinking that I just heard a masterpiece..<br /><br />The years passed, and I would go in and out of my phases.. but there were always a few albums that I would revert back to and this was one of them. Every time I listened to it I would stop everything and just listen to it..<br /><br />And as time passed, I would always have a different favorite song from it. I started loving the hits, of course, but now to this present day the songs I love are the non-hits.  Thats what I love about this album. Each and every song has it's own identity, it's own style, it's own sound. The lyrics were character driven and painted pictures in your mind.. But the music accompanied the stories to make you feel like you were right there in the song.  Elton and the band performed them with so much energy that made the album sound fun, fresh, and in your face..  His voice was very humorous as well meaning that he just had fun singing them.<br /><br />In the present day, I still get the urge to listen to this album quite a lot.. and everytime I hear it I always head to the piano or the guitar and play along with it note-for-note. This album has taught me quite a lot as a musician and songwriter, and I always am inspired each time I pick it up.. This is a very special album in my heart.<br /><br />Pick it up and listen to it. Hopefully this album will strike the same emotional chord in you as it did with me. Try it out and see for yourself.<br /><br />Thank you Elton for everything...<br /><br />All The Best,  The AndyManaccompanied the stories to make you feel like you were right there in the song.

B000005RYQ|5.0|For a band that were at the height of their fame, It seemed a shock to hear that 'The Police' were to disband. (Due to tensions between 'Sting', and the rest of the band, \\"Andy Summers (Guitar)\\" & \\"Stewart Copeland (Drums)\\". But what they did leave behind, was a collection of incredibly well-crafted, slick, literate & lively songs that touched upon Jazz (a particular favourite of Sting's, and one he would explore on his solo albums), Album rock, Pop/Rock (\\"Message in a Bottle\\", was the perfect encapsulation of intelligent Pop music, for a more discerning listener). New Wave (The spookily infectious anthem, \\"Don't Stand so Close to me\\" was one of the most successful new Wave-oriented tracks to climb the singles chart). Alternative Pop (The angst-ridden swagger of \\"Roxanne\\", was as reflectively beautiful enough for it to become one of their most requested/Covered songs, of their career).  Songs with a slight reggae-ting to them (\\"Cant stand Losing you\\", toyed with elements of reggae instrumentation to marvellous effect). Alternative Rock/Post-Punk (The spaced out freeform guitar on \\"Walking on the Moon\\", perfectly summoned weird images of life on another planet), Cerebral Pop (The unforgettable catchiness of the mildly melancholic \\"Message in Bottle\\" will arguably remain one of their best known songs). Singer/Songwriter tracks (the Haunting \\"Every Breath you Take\\", is all the more disturbing, when you realise the song is about a 'Stalker' watching his victim, read the lyrics for the song again, and it'll start to make sense).      And, so it's fairly safe to say that the most popular /classic tracks are included in this comprehensive complition of the work of The Police.  And although there are likely to be several personal favourites that didn't make the tracklisting on this compilation, this compilation still truly shines and is undoubtedly more than worthy of 5 stars.  There may be those to bemoan the lack of a couple of inclusions, but then, that's always to be expected, when you have a band, that was as big as 'The Police', and whom made so many worthwhile singles, it would be virtually impossible to completely please everyone.  And even though my personal favourite...the Exotic/World music influenced \\"Masoko Tango\\", is absent.  It would be pointless to bemoan the fact, especially and the compilers have tried to offer as broad (and appealling) overview of the bands work, as is possible.       Of all the police compilations available...(and there are a few), this is easily the best of them.  It might not be the cheapest, but it not only offers the most tracks (16 tracks, as opposed to the next best compilation offering only 14 tracks).  And unlike some of the other compilations, it doesn't try and pad out the compilation with various 'Remixes' of songs, instead preffering to place emphasis on the original tracks. To be honest no compilation of 'The Police's' work is completely without merit, but if you (the buyer) want the absolute best summary of their work, (along with the most songs included), this is by far the best of all the compilations currently available.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This movie is more direful than any other \\"horror\\" movie ever made. The day after shows the chaotic situation that the inhabitants of Kansas city would face, in a case of a hypothetical nuclear war between the two cold war period super-powers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />I guess people who lived in the 60's, 70's and 80's, had experienced a constant tension situation, because the imminent treat of a davastating nuclear war! In my opinion, the most chocking fact is not the harmful effects proceeding from the radiation...The most chocking is the social chaos.  <br />Without laws nor order, people will start to live \\"each one for itself\\", literally...I remember a scene when a family keep to its shelters and provisions with a gun, from another possible survivors. So, It seems that solidarity disappears in a case of a nuclear catastrophe... <br /> <br />Really frightful!!! <br />
B0007CNXUK|1.0|I am suprised to see all of the 5 star reviews. one of two things happned here. a bunch of \\"soccer moms\\" saw the movie in there mini van and loved it. or a bunch of briandead people escaped for a day and wrote reviews. skip this movie at all costs. i had to shut it off it was so bad. boring drivel. see big fish instead. because, frankly if your over the age of 5 you will noy enjoy this.
B00005JNTV|4.0|The Ultimate \\"Non-Chick Flick\\"    Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you \\"must see\\" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: \\"Spiderman 2\\", or \\"Sin City\\". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as \\"literal truth\\" as \\"Spiderman 2\\", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as \\"Sin City\\", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling \\"American Splendor\\", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after \\"Frank Miller's Sin City\\". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original \\"Star Wars\\" was in its day.       Visually, cinematographically, the movie is genius. If you've seen the trailers, you knew that something new and excitingly \\"awe-ful\\" (no, I don't mean \\"awesome\\") was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head.      The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as \\"Marv\\", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as \\"Dwight\\", this is a man's movie. I haven't even mentioned Elijah Wood in a role that will forever keep him from being typecast as a lovable hobbit, Benecio Del Toro, who quite literaly metamorphoses into a \\"dirty cop\\" on screen, Michael Madsen and Nick Stahl. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.      It does bother me that we haven't yet grown out of this teenaged vision of violence, but nowhere else is it so satirically, so poetically translated onto screen. As virtually \\"bloody\\" as this movie is, and as much as I say I abhor violence, I was laughing with the young male audience at the violent hyperbole which permeates the story. I am also bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings.  \\"All women\\",  except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--,  who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for \\"political correctness\\" outside the theater.      But if you have a mind to suspend disbelief, and live for 126 minutes in Frank Miller's graphic world, choose Mickey Rourke for the ride. His features are modified to look even more \\"comic book\\" than the more recognizable Willis or Owen, but he is so completely Marv that he blows us away when he's blowing away the bad guys (OK, the worse guys). Mickey Rourke is the hard act to follow in this film. He is too much. He is over the top. But he carries us over the top with him, like King Kong with Faye Wray.      \\"Hardboiled\\" is a wishy-washy, weak-kneed way to describe the spectacularly and terrifyingly gender-driven bloodlust that fuels the film. All of the \\"heroes\\" are more than flawed, but they are all violent, and both welcome and expect it toward themselves in the same way they dish it out.      Someday, I dream, Tarantino and Rodriguez will put their genius at film as medium in the service of a philosophical idea that they recognize as bigger than themselves. They have perfected stylistized violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up tosome masculine heroic ideal. I cannot even imagine how wonderful, how superb, how phenomenal that film might be, if they were to grow up, explore the universe a little bit more, and take us with them. A-
B000056H24|4.0|The documentary that comes with the 2 disc DVD reminds us that George Stevens had Max Von Sydow in mind for many years, since shortly after finishing up THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK.  He took in a screening of Ingmar Bergman's JUNGFRUKALLAN (1960) which featured Von Sydow in a sizeable part.  This is the same movie which Wes Craven re-made as THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and Von Sydow played the father of the abused girl who takes a terrible revenge on her rapists.  Thus, although Tore (the part essayed by Von Sydow) is a 14th Century Christian, he gets to show off a lot of fearsome acting chops and winds up not entirely sympathetic.  And very un-Christlike, so it is funny that Stevens stuck with his casting inspiration through thick, thin, and studio resistance.<br /><br />For his part, Von Sydow had to interrupt his series of intense collaborations with Bergman to take the time out for the arduous Arizona shoot of GREATEST STORY.  Bergman was not pleased with losing his leading man for such a long period.  The result was that no Bergman film between WINTER LIGHT (1963) and HOUR OF THE WOLF (1968) employed the services of Von Sydow, who had been slated for a big role in Bergman's THE SILENCE, as well as his flop comedy ALL THESE WOMEN.  The SILENCE was largely re-written to increase the size of the women's parts, and it was during +this time that he wrote the all-female PERSONA, the first of Liv Ullmann's nine films with Bergman.<br /><br />But in return, we received a wonderful gift, Von Sydow's controversial portrait of Jesus in a performance that looks better every year.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I enjoyed the other movies by these talented filmmakers. Noting Hill--Great. Four Weddings and a Funeral--brilliant! I am very sorry, however, that I was so high on those films that I went ahead and bought the DVD without first screening the movie on cable. There are TOO MANY characters and storylines. This means no character is given ANY depth. It's awful, cliche, and sickeningly sweet. The \\"bad\\" girl secretary is actually wearing devil horns as part of a costume in one scene--sheesh, how juvenile and obvious can you get? Are these the same minds that created the other brilliant, touching, biting movies that I loved? If so, then all I can say is that they were so busy trying to push \\"agendas\\" that they forgot how to tell a story well. Characters are left at loose ends or given ridiculously forced cheerful endings to their stories. Just awful. Waste of time and there's some really nasty attitudes toward America too. I want my money back.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Man this album rox!  I thought they couldn't top their explosive debut, but wow they sure did.  Rcommended for any fan of rock, post grunge, or just good songwriting and good music!! Favorite tracks= 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
0792839730|4.0|Do not take Mr. Spencer's review in any serious light.  If you read the book (I'm a WW2 history buff) you will see that Monty wanted the British Airborne to take the farthest bridge so as to get all the glory.  Most generals thought that they really were taking a bridge too far but Monty insisted that it could be done. <br /> <br />Yes the US 82 and 101 did have trouble taking the bridges, BUT the British Armor support had one hell of time getting all the way through to Arnhem.  Also British intellegence didn't believe the reports that a Panzer Division was on rest outside of Arnhem..... <br /> <br />but regardless of the little history lesson the film is very well done.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Based on a real story of three half-white, half-Aborigine girls who were legally kidnapped and torn from their mothers in a small Australian village, Rabbit Proof Fence is a compelling, never sentimental, fast-paced account of an odious racial \\"purification\\" program exercised in Australia from early 1900 to 1970, giving these poor children the tag \\"The Lost Generations.\\" Mostly these poor children were kept in camps where they were to be, ostensibly, taught in the ways of Australian white middle-class society so that, after three generations, their \\"blackness\\" would disappear. But in truth these children were really trained to be domestics or slaves for white land owners. In the film, we get to know the three girls and find that the oldest, Molly, is very street smart and perceives that the camp she and her cousins are in is a deadend. There's only one thing to do: reunite with their mothers, so they make their escape. Much of the film shows us the harrowing journey that these three girls make and the spiritual strength, inspired by the bond between them and their mothers, that they draw from to make their dangerous trek in the desert. What's remarkable about this film is how dead-on the acting is from the three girls, ages between seven and thirteen. The director, who discussed in great detail the casting in the documentary section of the DVD, says that finding the right girls would make or break the film. He shows how he gained the girls' trust, taught them to act (they were not professional actors), and most of all, explains how they lost their innocence and connected themselves to a part of their history that until then they were not clear about. This is the only DVD where the documentary footage on the making of the film is as compelling as the film itself. To see these girls blossom as actors and raise their social consciousness in the process, maturing as human beings, both on and off the camera, is a remarkable thing to witness.
B000003S0P|5.0|One of the great albums of the 70s from a band always determined to break the boundaries. Bill Bruford was as impressive in concert as on this album (and a an inspiring player for me as a younger drummer/musician). This is as good, if not better, than anything you'll hear today
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As I sit reading everyone else's reviews, it reminds me of why <br />I loved the show so much when it was on TV. <br /> <br />I would make sure that I didn't have anything else that needed to be done on Fridays nights!  I do love SciFi and thought this show had an excellent twist with it's more \\"primitive\\" aspects! <br /> <br />It is extremely unfortunate that this show was cancelled during the first season.  I had no idea that so many people feel the same way about it that I did. <br /> <br />But, as my title suggests, it is worth every penny and TRUE scifi fans will love it!
B0000067L2|3.0|Yes, I know - people keep telling me - this is an all time, bone-fide classic. And with this in mind, I bought it, listened to it and tried to disregard the hype that surrounds it and form my own opinion but its reputation got in the way and damn well ruined the whole thing.  <br /> <br />There is no doubt that in its day, this album was THE  greatest blues-rock album created but I wasn't alive then and have been soaked in the 30 years of great \\"Blues-rock\\" albums that followed in its wake, which has served to make this one sound a little like all the rest. Love the cover though !
0345440900|3.0|Coming into parenting for the first time, I had now idea about the different school of thoughts for parenting a baby and how so many people felt strongly one way or the other! It seems you either follow Attachment Parenting (not advocated in this book) or Babywise (which this book puts a new spin on but is basically the same thing).<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the language used in this book \\"luv\\" this and \\"luv\\" that felt almost condescending, and Tracy Hogg basically rewrites the wheel which was already started in Babywise with her E.A.S.Y method. I also find all of the charting a bit too much (which babywise also advocates). I already have enough to do with a newborn, so I don't really have time to write down how many dirty diapers I've changed. But it does give you a good reference to see that the baby is getting enough to eat and is developing properly which as a new parent gives confidence that you are doing just fine.<br /><br />So if you want to read about the same parenting approach in a more precisely written (and less annoying) way--get the Babywise book and forego this one because they both are saying the same thing.<br /><br />If you are still deciding on parenting methods, I think the best advice is to read about both AP and this approach and see where you and your family feels most comfortable (which for us is somewhere in between). People are sooo judgemental! If you don't do it their way you are a bad parent--which is so wrong! Both methods seem to work for differnt people-so find what fits for your family and ignore others judgements!. Personally, I'm leaning more towards the Baby Whispering/Babywise side because contrary to what people have said, they both promote flexibility and a family-centric and not child-centric approach I also like the babywise method of breastfeeding which concentrates on getting full feedings every time vs \\"snacks\\", Oh, and this method does want you to feed the baby when its hungry, the idea is if you get full feedings every time--you only need to feed him/her every 2 1/2 - 3 hours. (Vs giving the baby a breast or bottle every time they cry whether they are hungry or not) On the other hand I also plan on using a sling, and am not against falling asleep with him if we both are tired!ou only need to feed him/her every 2 1/2 - 3 hours. (Vs giving the baby a breast or bottle every time they cry whether they are hungry or not) On the other hand I also plan on using a sling, and am not against falling asleep with him if we both are tired!

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This last Ray Charles CD has many tunes that are easy to listen to especially while in your car on the way to work.  They'll calm you and you can sing along.  Don't expect it to be the typical Ray Charles music, but I think he was aiming at something new like Frank Sinatra's \\"Duets\\".  Here he sings with various other popular and diverse artists such as Elton John, Natalie Cole, James Taylor, Diana Krall, Bonnie Raittt and Norah Jones.  The only song I'm not crazy about is the one with Willie Nelson called \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\".

B0001CCXZW|5.0|If you haven't already seen Gilmore Girls, I'd suggest you run out and buy this box set. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. This show has everything you could hope for in a show and so much more. The intelligence of the writing on this show makes you crave for more.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|A lot of people thought that this movie was a disappointment and had no meaning to it. Clearly this movie has a meaning to it. It's about a guy who gets picked on in high school every day of his life and still decides to live his life no matter how hard things get. When things are as worse as they can get for ND, it seems as if he knows that things can only go up.  <br /> <br />Some people say that this movie sucked because this movie was a low budget film, it took only 22 days to shoot, it seems as if it jumps from timeline to timeline or that it has dead humor. Some of the best movies of all time were low budget and took little time to make. And there are some movies that cost over 100 million dollars to make that weren't even good.  <br /> <br />The movie does sort of seem like it jumps back and forth from the eighties to the nineties. The movie does use songs from the eighties and fashion that you would've probably recognized from a John Hughes film. But, not everything in the movie represents something from the eighties though. Napoleon does have wierd clothes but I would be pretty sure that they would be clothes that the nerdy guy in school would wear. His best friend Pedro comes from the south, where Latino culture is well known and represented. His clothes are pretty much up to date for being where he is from. How many people down south don't wear jeans and cowboy boots? Then there is ND's friend, Deb. She's her own fashion designer which would pretty much explain how she dresses during most of the movie. Last but not least, ND's Uncle Rico. Rico is a guy, in about his forties, who is pretty much stuck in 1982 and wishes that he had the chance to back in time to change his future. Come on, how many people have wanted to do that? He does dress in eighties attire, only because he thinks he still there.  <br /> <br />Let's face it folks, comedy is the genre where Hollywood needs help. We have horror and action films galore. Sometimes I ask myself, how can we have a comedy with so little comedic talent. We do have some funny people on the big screen, but we're seeing less and less of the people that can still make us laugh harder than anyone on the big screen now. Jamie Fox and Jim Carey are playing more serious roles, Chapelle is making a really big impact on his tv show but it would be great to have him back on the big screen. ND does have dead humor and sarcasm, but that was the backbone for comedy for quite sometime. From the Naked Guns to the Ace Ventura's. It would be great to have comedies like Pryor or Murphy used to make, but that's not going to happen. ND is probably the closest we will get to old school humor.  <br /> <br />On the contrary, I read something about someone saying that Lizzie McGuire was better than ND. I only have one question, what in the heck were you doing watching that movie? I would suppose that this person watches her show too. And just too let everyone know, if you read the facts about ND, you will read that they do tell you that a Liger is a real animal. to know that, you have to have read the quotes or you have to be a reall geek....... <br /> <br />This movie may seem dumb at frist, but give it another shot and you'll see that this movie is worth owning and why people, who hate or love it, keep on rambling on about Napoleon Dynamite. Pay attention to what people say and enjoy the laughter. This movie is very original in it's own way and has the potetial to win probably just an eMpTy Vision Movie Award. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />    <br />  <br />
0812548094|5.0|This is a great fantasy series that any intelligent reader who likes the genre must read. Wizard's first rule was and still is one of my favorite books of all time.  But, Goodkind excelled even further with his writing of the sequel.  As a series the story slows down a little after book four but it still is worth the read and I find myself anxiously awaiting each subsequent book.  I have recommended this series to all my friends and have not found one yet who didnt enjoy it or who wasn't addicted from the start.  Most of the negative reviews talk about how cliche some of the themes are (good vs. evil, etc.) but that is what makes us watch a movie or read anything right? Seeing good triumph over absolute evil is always an uplifting feeling that we as a race can never get enough of in any aspect.  Goodkind introduces new ways to replay similar themes (mord-sith, confessors, gars, mriswriths, dream walkers, prophets) with each gifted person he throws you a new and interesting twist in the typical stereotype of that kind of character.  Don't let all this negative reviews fool an intelligent reader.  Terry brooks, and Tolkien bored me at times where as Goodkind kept me up late reading until I couldnt keep my eyes open any longer, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next.  I have grown attached to the characters , feel for what happens to them and what they have to go through and have enen shedded a tear over many of the tragedies that occur.  The one thing I love about the series is how it mimics life so well.  The characters interact like real people even though many of them have extrordinary abilities.  And most of all , even though good usually triumphs , like life, there is no happily ever after, you just move on to the next problem and look for a solution.  There is always something to fix or correct, life is not picture perfect and once you solve one problem , not too long afterward something else comes along that you must attend to if you are going to survive.  Excellent series that I truly recommend to any reader.  If nothing else read the first four books (without a doubt the best in the series so far).  IF you give Goodkind a chance you will not regreat it and if you are an open-minded intelligent reader will be hooked as have many of his fans have been for many years. <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is a unique movie in that it's not a typical Hollywood movie filled with Hollywood actors.  Part of the thrill, I think, people will get from the film is seeing \\"Superstars\\" acting dirty.  And you can certainly watch this film and get that thrill.  But, that's just the surface of this intense movie.    I do think the DVD is giving people a false message with the review line from Times, \\"At last, a love story for adults.\\"  Unless an adult love story involves backstabbing and eventual destruction of relationships, this isn't true.  However, I don't think that an \\"adult\\" relationship necessarily involves the harsh, harsh situations that occur in this movie.  A mature look at relationships, yes.      In fact, what I liked most about this movie is the different perspective of love.  Most romantic movies revolve around a person trying to get with another person.  This movie transcends this idea by showing a period of time in the lives of four people.  Not only that, but it shows that love can sometimes be destructive as is evident in the way the movie unfurls.  It's sometimes hard to watch because you get frustrated with how the people act, but I give that as praise because the characters are doing what's in their character.    Another interesting thing is that people will flit in and out of the four person story but we really don't pay attention to them.  I can't truly remember any characters besides the four main ones.  And what this does to the story is show that, to these four people, no one else matters.  They are so wrapped up in their game of love/war that nothing else matters, life passes them by.  It's kind of a morality tale in that aspect because it not only shows the destructive ways in which they act but also that they are so caught up in their own lives that they don't notice anyone else.  Very effective.    The acting is terrific.  I'm not a fan of Julia Robert's choice in roles usually and was surprised to see her character in this because it's sucha change of pace with her usual Runaway Bride/Best Friend's Wedding/Pretty Woman characters.  The dialogue is very explicit and frank in dealing with sex and might offend those not expecting it.  It's not a movie to take little kids to, that's for sure.      There's not too much \\"physical\\" action in the movie.  Because it's based on a play, the action is represented in the dialogue.  What's interesting and sometimes darkly humorous is the verbal warfare that occurs between the characters.  Every scene is a war of wits as each character has an agenda and they use words to get to it.  These situations can become darkly humorous and witty as we see two characters sparring with words.  But this might be a turn off for some because, while there is a threat of violence that lingers between the lines, not too much physical action happens in the movie.      There is a song that flits over the opening and closing of the movie and it really is effective in conveying a sadness to the movie.  The song, which I spent a long time trying to find, is \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" by Damien Rice if anyone is interested.  It's on the cd \\"O\\" which you can find here.    As far as the DVD goes, there's basically nothing besides the movie.  However, the DVD is a superbit edition which has been mastered in high definition with excellent sound which is probably why there isn't many extras since the superbit takes up much more room on a DVD.  But if you have a TV and receiver to run it you will be in for a real treat.      I can't recommend this movie enough.  If you are interested in seeing an atypical Hollywood movie about the thing called love and aren't put off by a word heavy movie, then this is an excellent place to look.  It will frustrate you, entertain you, and make you think.
B000062XM7|5.0|Another beautiful movie centered around Native American culture. Although a fictional movie it touches on some truths about history of these great peoples. This movie is romance mixed with adventure mixed with tragedy. Incredible cinematography, acting, scenery and soundtrack. Great song by Clannad. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen as yet.
6304698682|5.0|Pale Rider foreshadows the genius of Unforgiven, following a more compact and focused story than Eastwood's multi-Oscar winner.  This one gets behind the myth of the Western hero by overlaying that archetype onto a preacher--the viewer has to rethink either his stereotypes about the clergy or his equation of violence with heroic action, if not both.  Pale Rider doesn't take on the scope of Western folklore the way Unforgiven does, instead concentrating on a good vs. evil allegory in which a robber-baron raping the earth for mineral riches is equated with a rich boy raping a poor girl.  Chris Penn is surprisingly effective as the \\"heir to the throne\\" for whom sex is just another expression of power.  Pale Rider features some impressive visual passages, especially an Eastwood staple, an interior dimly lighted and all but blacked-out in contrast to daylight outside.  Here, that effect supports a scene in which Eastwood's Preacher keeps the town baron \\"in the dark\\" about his intentions and loyalties.  The shootout at the end of the film is exciting even while it is winking at and parodying some of Sergio Leone's more operatic moments of violent excess.  This film doesn't have the broad ambition of Unforgiven, instead providing a closely focused, intensely sustained narrative world both realistic and fabulous in equal doses.  In this widescreen version with digital sound, Pale Rider proves a real treat to recover from its undeserved obscurity.
1577311523|5.0|I thought this book was direct and to the point. The message of this book is to be fully present in this moment. A great introduction to the evolution of awakening. There is a power when fully living in the NOW. Eternity is Now!!!
B0002858YS|4.0|I never really paid that much attention to the Killers until I saw them on Saturday Night Live. I picked up the album today, and let's just say that for only eleven songs, they sure know how to pack a punch.<br /><br />The Killers' sound seems to be not-too-hard, not-too-soft rock with a hint of new wave flavor (most likely due to the way singer Brandon Flowers uses the synthesizer). And the songs are more than good, but first let me talk about the singles. As catchy as \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense (well, the chorus, anyway). And \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is a hit for good reason, although you have to admit that Brandon is really talking rather than singing.<br /><br />The reason why I mentioned those two songs first is because as good as they are, the rest of the songs are even better. \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" are excellent mellow tracks, and \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" is downright catchy as soon as it starts. And \\"On Top\\" is when Brandon's synth REALLY gets to shine. Pick this album up if you don't have it yet, because Hot Fuss is one hot disc.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0007GAEW6|2.0|The widow, does not fit in this album. The rest of it is a bunch of noise with some lyrics thrown in there. I do not recommend buying this, get their other album. It's better. This one is disappointing.
B000007MVM|5.0|With The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Syd Barrett proved that he was not only the greatest musician within the rock genre ever, but one of the most formidable musical talents in all of human history. With the Madcap Laughs, Barrett, the Celt, turns rock/pop completely on it's head and again creates a work of utter genius that continues to surpass, in substance and origionality, anything else. The songs, though poorely structured, pack an emotional punch that will practically make your heart bleed. The lyrics, nonsensical and sloppily delivered though they are, are never the less the best you will ever hear on a \\"pop\\" record.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is one music DVD that you'd never regret buying. <br />It's \\"Mr. Clapton\\"s present to the fans of this type of music (i.e., fans of first class music). It's \\"his\\" selection of guitar top guitar players (Robert Cray, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, ZZ Top, Steve Vai, John McLaughlin, BB King, ...), supported by their genuine bands. The two DVDs will take you away for over 2 hours, and leave you back to earth with your ears filled with top-notch 6-string based live music. <br />As per the video and audio quality, it is really impressive to see such a recording under those \\"windy\\" conditions at the arena. The audio and the video is much more than satisfactory. <br />If this were a VHS tape, it would already be worn out as I watched it over & over again. I guess this will remain to be my favorite music DVD, among the other ~60 I have in my archive.
B0002858YS|5.0|What can I say? The first time I heard about the killers, it was with \\"Somebody told me\\", and I instantly fell in love. Im all for good 80's music, and while The killers have many 80's elements (ex. synthetyzer), they also have great rock and great lyrics.Also, a slight british accent-although I dont know where that came from, since they are from Vegas. After buying this album, I have listened to it more than ten times without stopping it or skipping a song. The progression of the songs is just perfect: It starts off with a great pace, making you want to stand up and dance. Then, it ends up with \\"Everything will be alright\\", which is almost like a lullaby that just sends you into a trance. Definetely the right choice if you are tired of all that hip-hop, wannabe metal, wannabe indie rock.(And considering Im 17, its saying a lot)
0061020710|5.0|After reading this book, Terry Pratchett became one of my favorite authors.  He has a way of writing similar to Douglas Adams, and humor that cannot be described.  This book is the first book (or rather, the best introduction) to the series of books about Discworld, the whimsical and unpredictable (yet often comical) dimension where most of Pratchett's books take place.  The Color of Magic gives a great overview to this world, and introduces us to the people of Discworld.  You will laugh every page at his clever writing or humorous footnotes, explaining the many mysteries of Discworld.  If you like fantasy, and you like laughing, this is the book for you.  Not only does it make fun of other famous literature, but it is also a worthy satire of real life.  Coupled with The Light Fantastic, this book is a beginning of the Discworld series.  If you liked this book (which you will), read other Discworld books-each one is just as funny and clever as the last.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|There is only one word I can use to describe Muse: Genius. <br />The thing that makes me crazy for them- wait, its not just one!They are the kind of band that really stirs you up. Its stirs up your feelings and it will never let go. Their guitars are just so powerful, and the voice of the lead singer is positively haunting. Something that should recieve special attention is the use of piano. The solos are so impressive, at times you will be almost close to tears because it is so overwhelming. Muse is unforgettable, and it is not like anything heard before- but at the same time it is full of the elements you love. A definite must in your alternative music collection.
B00076ZZ9I|1.0|I am not reviewing the musical content....we all know this is one of the great Rock albums of all time.  I am reviewing the NEW release and specifically the VIDEO DOCUMENTARY which they advertise at approx 30 minutes WRONG...its about 21 minutes and on the back of the disc they push IN-Studio performances  by Malcolm and Angus Young  of \\"Hells Bells, You Shook me All night Long\\" \\" Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and more!  sounds great right? WRONG...it is snipits of them playing a lick here or there..VERY misleading... <br />its a nice 20 minute documentary but hardly what EPIC claims it to be... <br />i would still buy this again....as it is stunning sound and the small documentary is fun but don't expect much..

B0002VKZL6|4.0|The people who say this cd is boring are obviously not good listeners. If you're looking for hot licks a la Sultans Of Swing then go there. This record rewards repeated listening and is a shining example of Knopfler's fine songwriting and masterful guitar playing. If you dig the focused, guitar oriented sound of the early Dire Straits albums, you'll like the sound of Shangri-la. The title track features Mark's best vocals on the album and some gorgeous guitar. There are many other fine songs on this 14 track collection including Boom Like That, Sucker Row, Back To Tulepo, and Everybody Pays.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The thematic element of graphic violence is very apparent after the young boy is killed, so the movie is not for the weak of stomach or mind.

I thought this would be an easy book to pick up and put down, but putting it down was almost impossible!

All I can say is that I want to read every book that Boyd has written, and then read this one again.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|It seems that people nowadays are rediscovering the classics of the past. The story of Peter Pan has been around for a hundred (!) years, and see how delightful and enchanting it can be. In Marc Forster's movie \\"Finding Neverland\\", it's a magical place that is both beautiful and healing.<br /><br />Excellent performances by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet add to the magic of the film that is so lushly imagined and realized. The ending is at least four hankies worth of tears, but cleansing and right for the movie. It was as if this was the Neverland that all of us have dreamed of, and now, for the first time, we get to see it on screen.<br /><br />Wonderful!

B0000026J1|4.0|I don't doubt that at this point in their careers, John Norum was probably a better guitarist than Kee Marcello. But, for some reason, the guitar riffs on Out of This World and Prisoners in Paradise sound, for lack of a better description, less lazy. The positives of this album are the good ballads and guitar riffs. <br /> <br />The bad thing about this album is that every other song seems to start out with Joey Tempest saying, \\"Hah yeah!\\" or some variation of that. It really gets annoying if you just listen straight through this CD. If you rip mp3s of these songs and throw them into a random mix with dozens of other Europe or pop metal mp3s, the Hah Yeahs are much more tolerable.
0141301066|5.0|I wish I would have read this as a kid!  Matilda has everything the perfect children's book should have:  characters who are close to perfect, who you can adore and support to no end, as well as horrid villians you can hate with all your heart.  The ending is even better than you might hope, and the child is left dreaming about how wonderful Matilda's life will be from now on. <br />Dahl has a knack for understanding what a child wants to read, and designs his characters to be so clever that you are left quite inspired!
B00025ETIW|5.0|The first song I heard by MCR was \\"Ghost of you\\" and that has been my fave song by them ever since. You won't be disappointed with this cd simply because each and ever song on this cd rules. Usually, I'm not into yelling BUT MCR has changed that :). The following are the songs that stick out for me the most:  <br /> <br />Jetset life is gonna kill you <br />To the end <br />Ghost of you <br />Helena <br />You know what they do to guys like us in prison <br />Give em hell kid <br />Cemetary Drive, so what the hell- the whole album is incredible!!!
0060989157|4.0|Back when I was in high school, Motley Crue was one of the biggest bands around.  Stories would always surface about how they were wild party animals, how there would be women all over them, and how there would be drugs and booze a-plenty.  Of course I always figured this just to be rumours, told by mothers to scare their children into being straight A students, and wishful thinking on the part of me and my friends.<br />But after reading this book, which is written in a very unique style by having a member from the band each write a chapter, I can tell you that everything you heard, or everything you thought you heard about the band, is true.  This book does a nice job of letting the reader into the 'inner sanctum' of the band.  Through reading what the band members have to say, it's easy to see why they ended up breaking up like they did.  Yet at the same time it was one hell of a ride.<br />Definitely pick this book up if you're a) interested in Motley Crue, b) interested in what it's like to be in a world famous rock band or c) interested in finding out how too much alcohol and too many drugs can ruin a good thing.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I am a huge cinema fan, and this film is up there with the very best films ever made, in my opinion.  Every second, every frame, every idea, the acting, everything in this movie is PERFECT.  And no film has done or will ever do a better job of understanding dreams with their complexity, intrusions, and tangents, though always connected together through words and symbols.  There is a scene involving a Roy Orbison song that is devastatingly beautiful - the music, the whole thing -- you will remember it, and many other amazing things in this movie, for the rest of your life.  Currently my favorite film, up there with Rear Window, Sprirted Away, and The Seven Samurai.  You cannot rent this; you will want to watch it many times and unravel its complex and beautiful meanings.  Go ahead and buy it!
B000000WA4|5.0|I know that's a bold statement.  But I was pretty young when it came out (sixth grade?) and back then it hit me like a bullettrain.  It was amazing.  Four years go by without me going back for another listen, occassionally hearing \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" or \\"Zero\\" on the radio.  Then I finally pick it up and proceed to fall asleep to it.  Dawn to Dusk wakes me up twice during the night because it's so good, and Twilight to Starlight tackles this feat three times.  Years later, the damn thing still gives me goosebumps. <br /> <br />Oh God, high points...um...well, there's a song for every mood on this two-disc set, but overall, \\"In the Arms of Sleep,\\" \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" and \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" are the best ones the band has ever released.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|So, perhaps you are a recent QOTSA fan like myself, one who picked up Songs for the Deaf and went \\"WHOAH!\\"<br /><br />Unless, like me, you then picked up the back catalogue, and wrapped your head around the drug-trip that was Rated R, and the Kyuss->Queens transition of experimental grinding jams that was the original (and now out of print, talk to me and we'll see what I can do) QOTSA album, you will enter the forest of Lullabyes to Paralyse, and be...<br /><br />Underwhelmed.<br /><br />Where are the constant pounding rock chords?  Why have we moved from the high desert, where God Is in the Radio, to a place where Someone's In the Wolf, where, instead of Nick Oliveri's scream, we hear the ay-ya-hai on Burn the Witch, to an enchanted forest of change...<br /><br />Well, as you all know, this is Josh Homme's ship now.  Josh and Troy VanLeeuwen and Alain Johannes and Joey Castillo (Grohl fans, fear not, Joey's stellar), the occasional Dave Catching riff, and a dash of Lannegan's bluesy tones, all combine with guest appearances by Billy Gibbons, Brody Dalle, Shirley Manson, and Chris Goss, and then...Well, Josh and Nick broke up, so to speak, musically, and this is an album of exploration, of seeing what sounds come when the duo is rent apart, and in the aftermath of the Tornado's exit, the Desert Fox remains...<br /><br />This is a trip.  This is a concept album.  This is a post-nu-metal rock opera.  This album reaches back to the first QOTSA record when the phone no longer says, \\"Josh, this is Nick, Oliveri,\\" but instead, is off the hook to start \\"Long, Slow Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />Nick's gone.  If he comes back, he comes back.  This is Josh's ship now, and he wanted to see what would happen.<br /><br />Don't dismiss this album.  Note the fact that many people give it four stars, or three--especially the major reviewers, claiming that it is a lazy follow-up, that the Queens are not the Queens without Nick, and that Josh has gone off the deep end, and then remember whatJosh said recently on a musical station that will remain nameless: \\"Right now, if you're saying this band's gone soft, you really don't know what the f*** you're talking about.\\"<br /><br />This is not Songs for the Deaf.  This is Songs for the Forest of Change.  This album touches the stoner epics of Rated R, it reaches back to the proto-queens of their self-titled debut, it jams down on occasion with the precision of Songs for the Deaf's dropped-C scalpel, and it goes off to find the Queens of the Josh Age, circa 2005.<br /><br />They f***ing rock, my friend.  Welcome to the forest.  Take a deep breath, and watch out, because you never know, as you enter this ethereal world, Nick, Troy, Alain, and Joey are hiding behind the trees with songs that will not paralyse or mesmerise--<br /><br />To quote Jack Black, prepare to have your socks rocked off--when you least expect it.<br /><br />The Queens are Dead.  Long Live the Queens, their new epic proclaiming the flaming intensity of the red-haired singer that is espoused not only in the licks that blast away at your very rock-n-roll soul, but also flame in the flaming Q that burns on their official site.<br /><br />May its fires never be extinguished.<br /><br />\\"This is the dose you've been dreaming of, revelation from above...\\"  Amen.  Rock on, Josh.  Rock on, y'all.
0375703764|5.0|Because of the distressing abscence of real talent in modern writing (i.e. the advent of books by Paris Hilton and Britney Spears), I tend to shy away from recent literature and stick to the classics, with the exception of authors like Neil Gaiman.  So I  was overwhelmingly surprised when I took my brother's advice and picked up House of Leaves.  It is absolutely THE BEST novel written in the last decade, and ranks in my top five best novels of all time. <br /> <br />Even without its intriguing format, the story at the heart of the novel could stand by itself as a well-developed and intelligent horror tale.  However, Danielewski goes several steps further.  The format of the book reflects the tone of the novel through and through - the more lost the characters become in the House and the study of the Navidson Record, the more lost the reader becomes in the tactile qualities of the book.  I have read House of Leaves several times, and am amused to find that, just as the House changes with each re-entry, I discover new aspects of the novel with each re-read.   <br /> <br />I won't go on about the uniqueness of the book, as it is evident just by flipping through the pages.  The novel is at once both challenging and absolutely enjoyable, and is a gripping read.   <br /> <br />p.s. Be sure to look for hidden codes throughout the book, especially in Danielewski's signature 'first letter of each footnote' cryptography.
0140186409|5.0|Most of the review accurately recap the plot of this masterpiece, so I will avoid doing that in my review.  I have read most of Steinbeck's work and I am most impressed by the vivid skills with which he colors reality.  Steinbeck's books specialize in early 20th California.  This is the centerpiece of that collection.<br /><br />It is true that this book can be both dry and depressing at times.  In reality, life also fits that description.  There is not always a happy ending.  This is one of the great qualities of Steinbeck, he does not feel the need for a happy ending in his work.  When the dustbowl era of the 1930's dried most of America's crops in the center of the country, many people were forced to move.  California was the promised land for some.  For the majority, life in California was a nightmare of discrimination and starving through poor working conditions.  People suffered and died.  Life was harsh, and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a perfectly painted picture of that reality.<br /><br />While the movie version of this book starring Henry Fonda is well done, certain things are omitted.  The controversial ending of the book is too much for the silver screen.  The story of Tom Joad and the rest of the Joad family is enjoyable read.  The fighting spirit and sense of justice in the tragic hero Tom Joad is still very real in the world today.  If only there were more Tom Joad's in the world.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I usually dont like American Tv but this is so wonderful and amazing!!! <br />My fav would have to be Lynatte she cracks me up lol <br />A must have item in my DVD collection
B00000ILDF|4.0|I think Alien 3 is actually a really good movie. Don't get me wrong Alien is still my favourite because it is so original. Aliens was ok but a bit cheesy in places. The problem is I don't think America were ready for this movie when it was released. While we in England looked upon it as easily on par with the second in the franchise. Yet it has taken time for people to adjust to it and the Director's Cut (while not officially David Fincher's director's cut as he wanted nothing to do with the movie), has improved the movie greatly.  <br /> <br />True, it is a very downbeat movie however it is a very powerful redepmtion story so that turns over a leaf in my book!! People are saying it had a rubbish storyline and are slagging off David Fincher, but it is not his fault. The script was written on set as they did not have a script to work with when the movie started. So I actually praise David Fincher for coming in to a movie and giving it hope. David actually saved this movie from being a major flop, true it could have been better but there were numerous diagreements between the Fox Executives and the members of the crew, so it was going to be a tough one anyway. <br /> <br />I think this movie is creative, the sets are amazing, the acting is the best its ever been. People say that the CGI Alien doesn't do the movie justice. That is actually a bold judgement to make when the Alien is not CGI - it is in fact composited with a controlled puppet. The only CGI shot is when it blows up at the end - but yes I agree that shot could have been better. Then again it was the first CGI shot ever made for any movie so give them some credit. <br /> <br />I think this movie deserves a lot better apppraisal than what some reviewers have been giving here. It may have some flaws but it is definately better than Alien Resurrection (by a long shot actually lol). I just hope Ridley Scott returns for Aliens 5 and we go back to the Alien planet which is what Renny Harlin was going to do with Alien 3 originally - it's about time somebody did it!! <br /> <br />Overall 8/10
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|This cd is great, but the Amazon.com reviewer, Aidin Vaziri, is obviously not informed about the band of which he writes. If he were he would have known this is the FOURTH QOTSA release not the third. The band's releases in order are Queens of the Stone Age, Rated R, Songs for the Deaf and finally,Lullabies.
B000002ADT|5.0|There was no greater musical genius than Miles. <br /> <br />This is a great set of songs.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I waited quite awhile before I wrote a review of this CD. I wanted to see if it held up after weeks of listening. Well, it does. Green Day has always had some pop in their punk - a huge part of their overall sound. But this CD is the first where there is more pop than punk. (Some would argue Green Day was NEVER a punk band.) Obviously, Billie Joe has greatly matured as a songwriter. But I winced when I heard this was to be a concept album. Some have done it well - The Who, Queensryche and Rush, for example. And of course, Pink Floyd. But KISS' \\"The Elder\\" forever scarred me upon hearing the phrase \\"concept album.\\" Luckily, Green Day's offering nods more towards The Who than KISS, a great \\"Punk Opera.\\" The \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\" offering with its fantastic lyrics and quick tempo changes run the range of bombastic punk to the Jellyfish-like \\"Dearly Beloved\\" section. You'll here familiar phrases thoughout the album like \\"St. Jimmy,\\" \\"Jesus of surburbia,\\" \\"my mind,\\" \\"my dreams,\\" and others that connect the tracks. And done brilliantly. In all, \\"American Idiot\\" offers a wide variety of music from the usual Green Day punk-style to soft acoustic strums and piano, and can go from one to the next in a heartbeat. The quick-paced title track later gives way to the pop mega-hit \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,\\" a song current popsters only wish they could write. \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" are pop gems, as well. What is always present, regardless of the tune, is fabulous melody, clever lyrics delivered in a fantastic vocal performance from Billie Joe Armstrong, dead on harmonies, and wonderful guitar tones. Which leads me to one of my major complaints - the drums on this CD are weak. Not the performance, but the sound, which is weak and often buried. Some of the tunes would be outright dangerous if the drums matched the level of the guitars and vocals in quality. Oh well. The quality of the songwriting and diverse nature of the music more than make up for any sonic shortcomings. Not every tune is a masterpiece, but there is not one that is bad enough to skip over. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" with its super-chant chorus comes close, but the jangly guitars in the verse and Billie's excellent, emotional vocal put this in the \\"keeper\\" column. I didn't care for \\"St. Jimmy\\" at first, but it grew on me, mainly after seeing a killer, dead-on live, energy-filled performance.  \\"She's A Rebel\\" is probably my least favorite song, but, again, only compared to the others. More classic, simple-type Green Day. But it could be a gem on many other albums.  \\"Homecoming\\" has elements of both \\"Tommy\\" (\\"East 12th Street\\" section) and \\"The Wall,\\" (\\"Nobody Likes You\\" and \\"We're Coming Home Again\\" sections). The kid voices, bells, and English, Waters-like accent and delivery are almost too much \\"borrowing.\\" But it's done so friggin' well you can't help but dig it. Tre' Cool makes a brief, lead vocal appearance on the Meatloaf-ish \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\\" section. By itself this would not be a good song, but it fits great in the perspective of the complete work. This CD easily gets 4 stars, maybe even 4 1/2 stars. Calling the current administration's agenda \\"redneck\\" gets one star all by itself.

It is interesting how Pi learns to survive and to keep the tiger from eatting him, but after awhile, floating on a boat does not leave for the most exciting read.  It is worth reading, but do not expect an \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" or \\"touch the heart\\" kind of book.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Firstly, whatever that Pete \\"Snake\\" guy is smoking on, he needs to stop smoking it. How can you honestly say Death Metal is more appealing than Rap music? Death Metal... just reading that tells me that that music is PLAIN TRASH! It tells me all you f*ckheads sing about is death, killing, raping etc. Do you actually know what the F*CK you're talking about??? Ever listened to Rap back in the days? Listen to Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions, 2Pac's Me Against the World, Eric B. and Rakim's Paid in Full etc. and tell me you were just stoned or drunk when you wrote that review. Yeah, Public Enemy dresses sexy, says \\"f*ck\\" in all their songs and curses b*tches. F*ck you're dumb Snake, Public Enemy rapped about the realities of life like drugs, social awareness, politics, prison life etc. And they hardly ever said \\"f*ck\\" in their rhymes so before you run your f*ckin mouth off, think before you speak, a55wipe. Just because you hear f4gots like 50 Cent talk trash, it don't mean Rap has always been like that. I still can't believe you'd choose Death Metal over Rap, who cares if they play instruments and write songs about killing (which is f*ckin pointless coz they prove their freaks and unnatural). <br /> <br />I guess you didn't know that Rap is not ACTUALLY MUSIC! Rap is a cultural movement, broken down into 4 elements, sometimes 5 (but the 5th can only be obtained by rappers who actually understand rap music). Those 5 elements are: MCing, DJing, Breakdancing, Graffiti and Knowledge (the 5th element) (this goes out to this generation who obviously don't know nothing about Rap music at all). You check out music by Run DMC, Boogie Down Productions, Nas, Ultramagnetic MCs etc. and you'll find what you said was really pointless. See, your brain is so brainwashed, you think that life is about killing and committing suicide. I can tell by what kind of stupid music you listen to. Rappers rapped about actual things that happened in LIFE. Listen to Grandmaster Flash- TheMessage and you'll see what I'm talking about. <br />I've listened to your trash music like Slipknot and Soulfly and all they blabbered on about is killing. Seriously, what kind of idiots do that? And the music is just noise, like James Brown said- \\"you're talking out loud but ain't saying nothing\\". Snake, lemme give you some advice- <br />1. Take your trash out of here <br />2. Never come back again <br />3. And don't bring any of your \\"Death Metal 4 life\\" talk around here again, you f*ckin freakshow. You're only making yourself look stupid. <br /> <br />And this CD sucks, it has no meaning, whatsoever. 50 thinks he can take down Nas? He can think again, Nas ripped Jay-Z to bits with Ether, Nas wouldn't even need to use 1% effort to take 50 down. Candy Shop is a complete rip off on Magic Stick and he even made a jingle, WTF?!? Shot 50, keep bringing down your career. You're nowhere near the top of the list to me and never will be.
B00005KFUM|5.0|It dosen't matter what type of music you like this cd will affect you. This band is one of the most amazing bands I have heard in the past 10 years. I'm really into heavy stuff too. These three men are so incredebly talented, if you brush them aside you are a fool. In every song there is so much emotion. The lyrics are great, the singer is more amazing than any vocalist of our time. I would most compare him to that of Freddy Mercury from Queen(THE BEST vocalist of all time) If you are a fan of rock music, and appriciate good music. are tired of this cliche music (ex. the used, taking back sunday) , lots of talent and the most original sound today then pic of this cd and the others up right now!
1400032717|5.0|This book tells the story of Christopher, a boy with autism. It is written from Christopher's point of view, and is an interesting look into the mind of a person with autism. I loved this book, and felt the author did an excellent job of describing what it's like to be autistic. Especially revealing for me was the way Christopher processed information without having any emotions. Even when he finds out something profoundly shocking about his dead mother, he doesn't react in the way most people would. A very poignant, very insightful book.
B00007E8V4|1.0|i don't understand how people like this band. they have a few good riffs but this goofball armenian wedding music with distortion is just such a joke. \\"shhhhuugaH!\\" what the heck is that?! horrible, horrible, stupid band. its not even worth the criminal activity its title promotes. more like \\"Flush this album\\". i cant believe they are as popular as they are. please break up. you and your stupid psycho guitar player stage faces... idiot. oh yeah,and nice lyrics. what the hell is that crap? \\"wake up, why dont you put on some make up\\"... huh? how does this become popular?? and they need to stop trying to rip off Faith no More unsucessfully. i admit ive heard a couple songs with good riffs and his voice at times does sound cool... then those moments are abandoned too quickly. they have a new record out with a single called \\"Cigaro\\". that says it all. that one song is so stupid and so bad....  it warrants throwing them in front of an oncoming train and basking in the flying guitar shards.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|Duran Duran's RIO is an incredible masterpiece, which perfectly marries the crystal clear treble with heart thumping bass and pounding rythmic drum lines.  This is however, not a remastering of the original as the title would suggest.  For those true DD fans out there who can remember the album cuts.  You will hear a difference in the production of many tracks on this CD.  Including,\\"My Own Way\\", the fade out being significantly reduced on \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\", additional keyboard chops added in \\"Hold Back the Rain\\", but the great keyboard beginning being replaced with just a short bass punch.  \\"Save a Prayer\\" is also cut down and reduced.  The whole reason I purchased the CD is I thought it would be the true representation of the original LP recording in 1982, as advertised.  Instead, I was disappointed to find it was exactly just like the CD version I bought in 1987. Despite this disappointment, the CD is still one of my all time favorites from the opening keyboard fade in on \\"Rio\\" to the conclusion of dangling keys on \\"The Chauffer\\".
0316172324|4.0|It is curious that Blink gets low marks from some Amazon reviewers. Blink is an interesting, entertaining, and engaging. Blink is a solid effort by an excellent craftsman. Mr. Gladwell tries to explain the unexplainable using example after example of real world situations and scientific study. The result is, in his words, a conversation starter. Blink is a thought-provoking look into the mystery of how we perceive the world. I liked Blink. Okay, there were some parts where I got a little bored - like the grading of mayonnaise!!!! But, from the standpoint of applying these ideas to communication, personal relationships and the marketing of products, Blink delivered even more useful stuff than The Tipping Point.<br /><br />Ray Dodd, author of \\"The Power of Belief\\" (Hampton Roads 2004)
B0007MAO0M|4.0|A return to the classic western of yesterday, \\"Silverado\\" recalls the sprawling efforts of Sergio Leone and the old spaghetti westerns while recycling many of the motifs of the best efforts from Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann and John Ford.  It's a pity that Kasdan hasn't rethought the film and added in additional footage. Perhaps the version we saw in theaters was the definitive version but given the wealth of material I doubt it. \\"Silverado\\" is greater than the sum of its parts with a number of strong performances from Kevin Costner, Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Brian Dennehy and others. Kasdan manages to echo classic films in this sprawling but exciting western adventure.<br /><br />Emmett (Scott Glenn) has just been released from prison and is on his way to Silverado to visit with his family when he's attacked by a group of outlaws. He's initially unclear as to why they chose him but it soon becomes apparent that they're hired guns sent by Ethan McKendrick (Ray Baker) to average the death of his father. Along the way Emmett must spring his kid brother Jake (Kevin Costner) from the jail of Turley for a killing that happened in self defense. Emmett has a guardian angel in the form of Mal (Danny Glover) a butcher who is headed to Silverado himself to help out his parents.  Emmett also saves Paden (Kevin Kline) a man left to die in the desert by outlaws who ambushed him. When Emmett arrives in Silverado he finds things haven't changed; Ethan McKendrick is still trying to dominate the town by installing his own sheriff (Brian Dennehy) a former outlaw who rode at one time with Paden. He realizes that as long as he stays in Silverado he and his family's lives are in danger.<br /><br />A beautiful and rich looking transfer highlights this first ever Superbit transfer of \\"Silverado\\".  This Superbit transfer sparkles and I didn't notice any digital or analog blemishes of note. The black level of the transfer produces deep, rich shadows and the vibrant colors haven't looked this good since the movie was released theatrically in 1985. There's some noticable grain at the beginning of the film but that's to be expected. This is the first edition to sport a DTS track and a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack as well. The DTS track has slightly better dynamic range but it's virtually impossible to tell them apart otherwise.<br /><br />Unlike the previous single disc edition of \\"Silverado\\", this edition has a number of terrific extras and has relocated the original \\"Making of\\" featurette to the second disc to maximize the bit rate for a better picture and sound. \\"The Making of `Silverado'\\" features interviews with Lawrence and Mark Kasdan discussing the origin of the film. Lawrence Kasdan has a series of precise images he wanted to portray and turned to his brother Mark to help him flesh out a screenplay that would allow him to keep those startling images and make a coherent story.<br /><br />\\"A Return to `Silverado'\\" features Kevin Costner discussing his involvement in the film. Although Costner had heard stories about Kasdan writing the part of Jake for him to make up for having to cut him out of \\"The Big Chill\\", Costner was never told that by Kasdan himself. \\"A History of Western Shootouts\\" is little more than a promo piece for 10 of Columbia's westerns with John Cleese doing the honors as narrator in discussing \\"Missing\\", \\"The Professionals\\", \\"The Quick and the Dead\\", \\"A Man Called Sledge\\", \\"Old Gringo\\", \\"The Man from Colorado\\" and others. Running almost 9  minutes, it's not much of a featurette consisting of scenes from each film briefly described by Cleese. \\"Columbia's Top Westerns Trailer\\" consists of a montage of scenes from classic westerns put together to advertise DVD titles for Columbia. Once again, it's little more than a promo piece. Finally we get \\"Along the Silverado Trail\\" a historical commentary about this western.  There's no commentary from any of the cast or Kasdan which is a disappointment and a bit of a surprise.<br /><br /> The reason to buy this is the upgrade Superbit transfer. It looks terrific here and the DTS track sounds especially good. There are only two extras worthwhile on this Suberbit Gift Pack and that's \\"A Return to `Silverado' with Kevin Costner\\" and \\"Along the Silverado Trail\\". Everything else falls into the category of promo pieces or filler. The 20 page booklet included is also quite informative but duplicates much of what is said in the \\"Making of\\" featurette. There's also a nice deck of playing cards included in this set.eason to buy this is the upgrade Superbit transfer. It looks terrific here and the DTS track sounds especially good.

B00008ADPF|1.0|This kind of music cracks me up. Same chord progressions, same lyrics, same music for EVERY SONG. Don't believe me? Last month Y100, my local rock station, played two Nickelback songs one on top of the other, to prove the same point. The songs had the exact same guitar, bass, and drums. The only thing different was the lyrics. It's hilarious how people can get rich playing the same song 10 times on a CD.
0783219695|5.0|Based on the true story of the astronauts that flew a mission to the moon, \\"Apollo 13\\" documents the disaster that almost caused these three men to be forever lost. During their flight the part of the ship exploded in space threatening to maroon the crew 205,500 miles away from home in the hostile vacuum surrounding them. Commanded by space veteran (he had circled the moon on Apollo 8) Jim Lovell, the mission had a string of disasters occur during their flight. Originally slated for Apollo 14, the crew was moved up in the rotation when Alan Shepard developed a raging ear infection. Then the crew's original pilot Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) who had trained and worked with them from the beginning tested positive for exposure to the German measles and was replaced by back up pilot Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) became ill during the flight becoming dehydrated and running a high fever. As the situation worsened in space, tensions ran high between Lovell, Haise and Swigert as Haise initially blamed Swigert for the accident, questioned his piloting skills and butted heads over their situation. Scrambling on the ground Mission Control lead by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) kept running into obstacles to help the crew return safely at home. The flight was met by indifference from the fickle media as the drama of the moon landing had petered out after the launch and successful landing of Apollo 11 and 12. While NASA did try to jazz up the Apollo program with more fascinating scientific experiments for the crew, funds began to dwindle and interest waned as the public became fixated on problems at home. This apathy was reflected in the complete disinterest of the public until the crew's life was in peril. A dramatic, powerful docudrama with riveting direction by Ron Howard (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\"), great acting by Hanks, Paxton, Sinise, Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan, \\"Apollo 13\\" continues to resonate particularly in light of the disasters that have afflicted the Space Shuttle Program and subsequent loss of human life despite all the safety measures NASA has taken over the years. \\"Apollo 13\\" reminds us that despite the appearance of routine of these types of missions, they are far from routine and represent significant risk to the lives of those brave men and women who fly into space.<br /><br />A sharp, vivid transfer with robust colors and deep, dark blacks are a highlight of this terrific transfer. Honestly, the previous edition looked just as sharp and just as good. With the exception of some minor digital blemishes, there's not a huge difference between the 10th anniversary edition and its older brother. This edition, like the previous one, sports an active surround mix that situates you in the Mission Control  and pulls you into the vacuum of space. Unfortunately, packing the original extras on the first disc sacrifices some of the higher resolution image quality by taking up additional disc space. Essentially, disc one IS the same release as the first edition (with a couple of extras deleted) but with a digitally remastered picture (although it's my guess it's still from the same high resolution source as the first edition).<br /><br />The resolution on \\"Apollo 13: The Image Experience\\" which occupies the second disc likewise looks terrific with slightly better definition perhaps because it was intended for a much larger screen originally. The sound for the Imax edition features an extremely active DTS mix that sounds slightly fuller and with improved depth than the 5.1 mix on the first disc. Again, packing the other extras on disc two is nice but sacrifices some of the available bit space which may have degraded the picture quality slightly.<br /><br />Missing from this edition are Bill Paxton's behind-the-scenes home movies showing his time in space school. Also missing are the extra that focused on the visual effects, comparison of the movie's key sequences to real NASA footage. Still here are the original two commentarytracks by director Ron Howard and astronaut Jim Lovell with his wife Marilyn.  There are the production notes from the previous edition as well as the original theatrical trailer. Luckily, the exceptional documentary \\"Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13\\" still appears on disc one. It's a great glimpse into the real events that inspired the movie but also focuses much more on the  behind-the-scenes making of the movie. Ron Howard's comments (made to him by the commander of Apollo 15) that by the time we went back to the moon (the prediction is that we'll probably not go back for more than a century) everyone would have forgotten what really happened spurred him on to be as accurate as possible in making this terrific docudrama. Seeing the actors in zero g on the \\"vomit comet\\" is a blast. Many of the weightless sequences were shot in zero g on an airplane that helps astronauts train for missions.<br /><br />\\"Conquering Space: The Moon and Beyond\\" provides a nice 45 minute summary of the space race and what prompted America to go to the moon in the first place. Opening with President John F. Kennedy's commitment to space exploration in vintage footage from 1961, the documentary touches on the highlights of the space race including footage of the first Soviet spaceships and the impact that the launch of Sputnik had on the world.  When the United States jumped into the space race, the US failed initially to even get their rockets off the launch pad. These spectacular failures embarrassed the United States. Featuring interviews with astronauts Jim Lovell, Shannon Lucid, Roger Crouch and others the documentary does a nice job of summarizing both the successes and disasters that dogged both the United States and the Soviet Union during the competition to escape a foothold on the moon. It's a nice compliment to the film.<br /><br />Since the acquisition of Universal by NBC, we've seen a lot more tie-in's between the Network and the studio. \\"Lucky 13: The Astronauts Story\\" is pulled from an episode of \\"Dateline\\" hosted by John Scott that came out around the same time as the release of the film. Again, there are interviews with Lovell and his wife. Featuring actual NASA footage from the Apollo 13 mission, it brings the reality of what occurred home. Interestingly, the movie tour of the space capsule actually has been seen by more people than saw the real broadcast.<br /><br />The two commentary tracks provide a wealth of information and most of it is more than the trivial variety like \\"where this was shot\\" info we've become accustomed to hearing. We learn, for example, that the crawler seen when the spacecraft is being transported is the REAL deal with Ron Howard driving it. Kevin Bacon had one of the most daunting tasks as everyone else associated with Apollo 13 is alive but Swiggert passed away over a decade ago. So Bacon had to interview people who knew him and come up with a portrayal based on other people's information.  Swiggert actually wrote many of the safety procedures prior to launch that ironically ended up being used to help save the Apollo 13 crew.  Jim Lovell announced his retirement at the press conference after Apollo 13 because he knew he had little chance of commanding another mission with so many people behind him in the program.<br /><br />The Lovell's commentary track is particularly revealing about what occurred in real life. For example, Howard came up with the subplot of Swigert coming onboard at the last minute and the unease of Lovell and Haise felt at having Swigert come onboard at the last minute. Evidently the nightmare that Marilyn Lovell had about the ship having an accident was probably caused because she watched the movie \\"Marooned\\" just prior to the flight. Marilyn Lovell points out the little mannerisms that Hanks did pick up from spending time with Jim Lovell. Lovell also points out that there were really two explosions. The first was the one they heard, the second they didn't hear but was detectableby NASA when the liquid oxygen began to bleed out into space.<br /><br /> A great docudrama gets another deluxe treatment on DVD. While I don't question that \\"Apollo 13\\" deserves it, it's too soon after the initial release to have this reissued again. Nevertheless, fans of the movie may want to upgrade this for the inclusion of the IMAX version of the film and the additional two documentaries included on disc two. Other than that, this is, essentially, the same release albeit with a nice, new digital master. Is the picture any better than the previous release? It's not noticeably different that I can tell.3: The Astronauts Story\\" is pulled from an episode of \\"Dateline\\" hosted by John Scott that came out around the same time as the release of the film.

B00004Z459|5.0|When I checked this C.D. out of the library, I was mainly looking forward to track number 8 (In The End) which I had heard on the radio before, but I was pleased to find that I also liked many more of the songs on Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park clearly has a gift with sampling, since the rhythms they select for the background always mix perfectly with the lyrics and guitars. It is also positive that their lyrics are fairly meaningful, they always have an interesting message to convey; and that the flow of the vocals is good and helps you get into the music (the guitar helps to do that job too). Overall, I would give Hybrid Theory a huge thumbs up and would recommend it to all hard rock fans. <br />I recommend: <br />Papercut <br />One Step Closer <br />Points of Authority <br />By Myself <br />In The End  <br />Forgotten <br />Pushing Me Away <br />
1400031354|5.0|\\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" a second installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith, deals with Precious Ramotswe who was now engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the owner of a car repair shop in Botswana. Unlike the first book which dealt a lot more with cases, this installment deals with just two cases. In the first case, an American lady who lost her son in Botswana ten years ago had returned to ask Mma. Ramotswe's help to find out what exactly happened to her son and in the second case, a butcher would like to find out if his wife was cheating on him. Alexander McCall Smith was able to provide more depth in these two cases, more so as compared to his first book. In addition, the author also provided more details about Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni in the sense of his character. Thrown in the midst of this was the maid of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni who felt threatened by Mma. Ramostwe's presence, as well as the new role that her secretary Mma. Makutsi, will assumed. <br /> <br />In \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" the readers get to know more about Mma. Ramotswe as well as her fiance, Mr. Matekoni. The author is able to vividly describe their personalities as well as their surrounding. Also in this book, we understand the connection that Mma. Ramostwe feels towards her country and its people. In addition, I enjoy the cases in this book and appreciated the way in which Mma. Ramotswe solved them. She once again proved to be a wise, inquisitive and compassionate detective. For those who are hard core mystery fans, this is not the book for you. However, if you are interested in learning about Mma. Ramotswe and the simple but effective ways she solved her problems, then this is highly recommended.
B00006879E|4.0|I got interested in Songs About Jane when I first heard track #2 (This Love) on the radio, and especially when I heard track#1 (Harder To Breathe) on the radio, which may be my absolute favorite song. All of the tunes on Songs About Jane speak something about love relationships, but aren't restricted to calm ballad-like melodies. Most of the songs are filled with lively guitar and percussion patterns, and display the lyrics in a way that progresses smoothly. Maroon 5 is already becoming a well-known band, and if you try listening to Songs About Jane you'll soon know why. <br />I recommend: <br />Harder To Breathe <br />This Love <br />She Will Be Loved <br />Shiver <br />Tangled <br />Through With You <br />

B00005JNNZ|2.0|I didn't think this film was anything exceptional; it's basically just another sports movie except with a school-related side plot. Although this movie delivers a good message concerning education and physical goals, the movie is ruined by such factors as repetitive shooting styles (it always has to be either a swish or an alley oop), Coach Carter's unbelievably corny attempts at imitating a game show host, not-so-brilliant acting, and the fact that one of the basketball players never speaks throughout the entire film. The only aspects of Coach Carter that drove me away from a one-star rating were that the situations were fairly realistic, and also that I usually find watching basketball interesting. I would not recommend this film, except maybe to people who highly enjoy viewing basketball.
B0006IUDXA|2.0|very disappointed. we are in the 21st century. every major production companies have digitally remastered their old TV series and movies except for one studio: Paramount. seriously: Audio - Mono??? and obviously there was no digital remasterization of the picture. also there is no special feature which there is enough space on the last disc for. the &quot;closed caption&quot; logo is there but there is no subtitles at all. what's even worse is that these are dual-layer discs: i've seen movies on a single-layer disc that are better featured (most of the old movies now on DVD from MGM, meaning a whole movie on one side with some special features: MGM put on one side widescreen, the other side fullscreen and all remastered. well some of them). who the hell were the people in charge of this project of putting MacGyver on DVD? sure they did a damn bad job: i'd never hire anyone with &quot;MacGyver DVD project&quot; in his resume.

B00003CX95|1.0|than try to sit through this piece of sh@# again.  I think it's the other way around though.  I think those of you who think this is a masterpiece are the morons.  I couldn't care less whether it's a little or a lot off base in its history.  Mel Gibson is so overrated, both as an actor and a director.  Just because you have millions to spend doesn't mean you'll end up with something of quality.  I suppose if you like period pieces, Gibson the actor and/or director, and think sprawling battles scenes are cool, then this is your movie.  I found it boring and ridiculous.  'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Apocalypse Now' are far better movies.  I'll admit, I don't care for period pieces, so in a way I was biased before I sat down to watch it.  Come to think of it, maybe that has everything to do with it-I hated 'Lord of the Rings' too.  Historical or not, these types of movies are ones that fall into the category of 'you either get it or you don't'.  I don't, and I'm content to be in the minority.
B000096FUD|4.0|This documentary follows Terry Gilliam's failed attempt to make a film based on Cervantes' novel Don Quixote. The film follows the rising wave of disasters that culminate in the canceling of the film only 2 weeks into production.<br /><br />I think this documentary should be watched by all aspiring filmmakers who can see how bad things can get on a film shoot. There was only one major problem with the film: lack of personal conflict. Everyone who has taken part in a bad shoot knows the amount of back-biting, cover-your-ass, and blame assignment behavior that occurs. Except for a few brief scenes, we don't really see any of this. Whether the cast and crew were on their best behavior while on camera or the documentary filmmakers decided to censor this in editing, these common scenes are noticeably absent.<br /><br />One interesting opinion I reached while watching the film was that the 1st Assistant Director (1st AD) almost certainly should have been fired. For one, the location scouting was horrendous. Anyone who has ever done location scouting knows that for such a major exterior shot, daily noise pollution and environmental factors should have been checked first hand.<br /><br />Additionally, when the extras didn't attend their weekend rehearsal (making impossible a shot on the assigned day), the 1st AD had no idea. It strikes the viewer that Terry Gilliam likes the 1st AD and stood by him because the AD was as disorganized as the director. It made me think of the classic line in Spinal Tap: \\"It's not your job to be as confused as Nigel, is it?\\"<br /><br />All in all, an excellent behind the scenes look at an attempt to make a film with a large scope.<br /><br />Dan Rahmel<br /><br />Author: \\"Nuts and Bolts Filmmaking\\"
B00005OWEG|5.0|I watch this movie whenever I feel depressed (and have a lot of extra time on my hands!)  After having read over 100 of the previous reviews (many of them fascinating-THANKS!), I guess I fall into the category of not really minding about the extra scenes.  After having seen the Redux a couple of times, I just fast forward through them, as I, too, think they disrupt the flow.  Plus, they're boring.  As much as the plantation scene adds intelligent background to our reasons for having been in Vietnam, it IS nearly unintelligible, and, like I said, boring too.  I suppose it would have served the movie best to have this extra footage as deleted scenes, and added the documentary as part of a special features package.  Commentary should be included as well.  At this point, I don't watch this to see a coherent movie.  It's like taking drugs for me-a place I can visit when I want to get away from the outside world and I need a friend who understands the mood I'm in.  Plus, the fact that the movie has the power to stay with you after you've turned it off is helpful (to me), just like a good drug.  As far as Sheen's performance that another reviewer ragged on, it's masterful.  He looks great, his voiceovers make a huge difference on the film's impact, and his acting has never been better.  Also, I agree with those who say this isn't a war movie.  It's a psychological (and metaphorical) one.  Its power isn't in its violence.  Its power lies in its depictions of emotions, philosophies, characterizations, and commentaries-specifically how they reflect what's in the psyche of man.  What also makes it so powerful is that these depictions are allowed to breath, so the viewer has plenty of time to let the impact sink in.  Love it or hate it, whatever form it's in, this is essential viewing for serious movie fans.  Lastly, I highly recommend (as some other reviewers have) the documentary on 'Apocalypse Now'.  Made by Coppola's wife, and released in the 90s, it's as mesmerizing as themovie, sometimes more so.  Hopefully, that will be on DVD soon...
B0002OERI0|5.0|An earlier reviewer speculated that there was no one over 30 who knew punk that would like this album.  Wrong.  I'm in my late 30s and still listen to the Dead Kennedys, X, etc.   <br /> <br />Yes, this is not \\"pure\\" punk, and I don't think Green Day is claiming that it is.  What it comes down to is this album contains very good punk-influenced pop/rock.  A few of the songs don't really work (including, IMO, Boulevard of Broken Dreams), but others are just great tunes (e.g., Holiday), and the album as a whole is strong.  People, stop obsessing over what \\"category\\" the music fits into and its degree of popularity and just LISTEN to the album.  Chances are, you'll like it.
630512762X|1.0|...so I thought it was about time I got around to seeing it.  Geez, what a piece of sh#@!!!  I know you Woo and action fans will rag on this review, but I don't care.  I liked the premise, and Cage nearly acted Travolta off the screen, but the movie was derivitive tripe--stuff that's all been done before, and much better.  I haven't seen any old John Woo films, so I can't compare this to them (aside from Mission Impossible, which was okay but hardly great).  But here's my question:  What is with you people who jump on the bandwagon of movies like this (and I don't just mean action movies either)?  'Braveheart', 'Get Shorty', and 'Eternal Sunshine on the Spotless Mind' are other mediocre films that come to mind.  These films get such accolades and endorsements yet they're stupid, overacted, and often, really boring.  If you want action that happens to contain a lot of violence, see 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Heat'.  At least these movies have some intelligence behind the filmmaking, not to mention memorable characters.  Even 'Way of the Gun' was better than 'Face Off'.  This is a movie for those who are willing to leave their 'brain at the door', who are impressed by names and faces rather than actual quality, and who don't demand intelligence and originality in the movies they watch.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Homework was amazing and everything has been down hill from there. Discovery was definitely worth buying and had some really great songs on it but this album is a complete and utter failure. The tracks seem boring, tired and uninspiring. Avoid this record.
B0007N1AI6|1.0|Like some of the other 1-stars reviews I agree that JP lost their Direction back in the Early 80s.  JP are like Metalicca, all their earlier stuff is awesome but their most recent stuff just sucks.  If you want to hear the best of this band I'd recommend 'Unleashed in the East', 'Screaming for Vengeance' and certainly some of the earlier albums like 'Sin after Sin' and Sad Wings of Destiny'.  This album is like their Painkiller album in that they are trying to keep up with bands that are 30 years younger than themselves, but its just all been done before.  Glen Tipton has always been a great player, but now he seems to duplicate all the young shredders ideas.  I'd recommend downloading a few MP3s before parting with your cash because I am sorry JP this is crap.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|In my mind, Franz Ferdinand is the best new band of 2004, with the Killers the only ones being anywhere near their level of excellence. The Scottish quartet take their name from the Archduke who was assassinated which started WWI, which is kinda weird. There is not a single song that I skip when I listen to this CD, and their guitars are absolutely stunning. The album opens up with some acoustic strumming and lead singer Alexander Kapranos singing some random lines about a girl, and then launching into a great chorus that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the song at all. This is followed up with the quite rocking Tell her tonight, and then my favorite two songs, \\"Take me Out and Matinee\\" Although they are quite different songs, the guitar work on both are masterful, and the baseline on Take me Out is Zepellinesque, if that's a word. The rest of the CD blends into one 20 minute long song that is pretty good, and 40' is a fantastic ender. Alexander sings with great passion about love and the such, and he has a great voice for it. Overall, if you like The Killers, Modest Mouse, or even The White Stripes, I would recommend this to you. 4 and 1/2 stars.
1401301010|5.0|The frontman to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis, has written a fantastic memoir of his life. He was raised by his hippie, drug-loving father, who exposed him to drugs at age 13. We hear about his crazy childhood and crazier days as a Chili Pepper, all about drugs, girls, and music. Kiedis's fluid writing at times rambles, but for the most part is very interesting. I finished it in a week.
6301640659|4.0|This gist of this film is clearly distorted by the rigor of   <br />collective defense mechanisms extant on both the hetero- and homo-sexual side of the proverbial fence. If the film is instructive at all it reminds the viewer of the thin line that separates us all in the arena of sexual inclination and drive. \\"Cruising\\" manages to convey, through the prevailing imagery that the title connotes, the psychic pitfalls rampant in the all too fettered terrain just off the lower Hudson.  While there is much to critique in this film, no one can deny that Pacino's characteristic tension perfectly projects the often horrific sexual ambivalence that is the film's main thrust. To the extent that the viewer permits himself to be entertained by the intimate dichotomy that underlies the  <br />murderous aggression, a reasoned sense of enlightenment may be the surprising result.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If I was from Idaho, I'd be angry with this movie...GOSH!!!  Actually, one thing I loved about this film is that even though it shows really, really weird people (every single person in the movie except for Deb), it's never mean.  It is funny in its own way, without trying to mock a given genre or time period.  It's never profane or lewd, and best of all, it's just plain weird itself.  I can honestly say that I loved it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|First off, let's debunk the myth that Hammer's Frankenstein films(generally speaking)were better than their Dracula films. Wrong. Curse of Frankenstein may have been Hammer's first gothic updating but Dracula was their flagship monster. And, most of their Dracula films were more entertaining than most of their Frankenstein films.  <br /> Now, what is there to say about this film that has not already been said. It's a classic. Check it out.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I avoided Napoleon Dynamite in theatres, put off by reviews such as Roger Ebert's.  When I finally did give it audience, it was in some hotel suite in LA, a soft robe, a few chuckles, then room service came, my girl came out of the shower, Napoleon went off, and I made a hazy mental note to give it a fair shot at some point.<br /><br />So, to speed things up a bit...the second time I thought it was very funny, the third time, funnier (and I don't mean just in retrospect, I laughed harder, and enjoyed it more).<br /><br />I've seen Napoleon like 20 times...eeezy!  It's going down in my regime of cult films with the likes of Office Space.  And, much like Office Space, it's no epic; there aren't any deep moral lessons to be had, any detailed historical accounting that will firm up your academic understanding of our place in the world.  Nope, just a concentrated dose of nostalgic hilarity.  Not in the sense that I wish I could be in High School again, or back in the 80's (a period that this film spoofs heavily), but more in the sense that it reminds you of simpler times and simpler concerns.  Nerd or not, most every reader cared deeply about the opinions of others then, about who they'd take to the dance, about whether they'd have to do \\"all\\" their chores (like feeding ham to their pet llama Tina).  I think if this movie - which is so oft accused of being devoid of plot - were to be forced to offer up some kind of lesson, or value, it should be just that:  it helps take our constellation of todays problems a bit less seriously by reminding us of how trivial yesterdays problems were.<br /><br />Plus it's got some sweet scenes!<br /><br />I'm sorry, but even if some disagree with my premise regarding this films value, how could anyone not find this movie flippin hilarious.  Napoleon Dynamite is NOT slapstick, it's infinitely less obvious.  That fact makes it harder for most to find the film immediately hilarious, but after a viewing or two, when your brain has ample time to digest the enormous volume of absurdity and texture, I think a good number of those who panned this film would be turned around.  This movie is an amalgamation of the High School experience, consolidated into various archetypes, then amplified to an extreme.<br /><br />Flippin awesome!<br /><br />If you don't agree with me, you should eat a decroded piece of crap!<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, California<br /><br />BTW:  Anyone who wants a Time Machine so they can go back to '82 should consult with me personally.  It's eeeeasy, I've already looked into for myself.mple time to digest the enormous volume of absurdity and texture, I think a good number of those who panned this film would be turned around.

0385659806|5.0|One of the most unusual books ever to come out, The Curious Incident is in a class by itself.  But then, its told through the eyes of an autistic teenager. Some may be put off by the overly simplistic writing style, but once you understand what the author is trying to do (and convey) youll fall right in line.  The entire attempt works wonderfully and youll be glad that someone came along to enlighten the rest of us as to how the autistic mind works.  I eagerly await Haddons next book and hope he does something equally as exciting.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This is the best LinkinPark CD ever made.But I think you could have left out the session you know the 12 song the DVD is really cool to.
B00000055E|4.0|This album is definetely 2pac's worst album after his death besides the albums that eminem produced for pac and nu mixx klassics (But its still a good album). The first disc has good songs like \\"Open Fire\\", \\"R U still down\\", \\"I wonder if heaven got a ghetto\\", F*** all y'all, and \\"let them thangs go\\". The second disc has good songs like \\"Ready 4 whatever\\", Fake A** B******, \\"do for love\\", \\"16 on death row\\", \\" I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (Hip Hop Version), \\"When I get free 2\\",and the best song on the album \\"Only fear of death\\".The album has some dissapointing productions but when pac starts it dont matter. His voice for me can be basically played over anything. Some other great albums are \\"Me against the world\\", \\"All eyez on me\\", and \\"Greatist hits\\". I've heard of the new album that came out internationally called \\"Ready 2 die\\" Jan 31. But united states didnt get it, cant wait til it comes. <br /> <br />ALL I GOTTA SAY IS MAKAVELI IS THE BEST FOR EVER <br />R.I.P.
B0006399FS|5.0|Maybe 4.5 stars not quite 5, but on this evidence U2 are still the best rock and roll band in the world. They have come up with one of their best albums, as good as my personal favourite \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" or any of their classic albums. Now in their early forties, Bono and company still sound like they really mean it.<br /><br />The single \\"Vertigo\\" is a great opener to the album, full of U2 trademarks but still sounding fresh and vital. Most of the songs cover familiar musical and lyrical U2 territory. Bono explores the self-doubting highs and low of emotional experience. The Steve Lillywhite production is as sophisticated as one would expect, but still allowing the basic ingredients including Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar to cut through.<br /><br />There is nothing particularly new here, just great heartfelt classic U2 songs. If you don't like what they've done in the past, you probably won't like this. They could possibly be criticized for sounding almost too much like themselves. I'd rather have that than a ton of other supposedly new music out there! Great.
B000002KO1|5.0|Got this LP when it first came out as a young teen - we all thought it was so cool when Chrissie Hynde shouted a curt \\"F**K Off\\" at the end of the album's classic opener PRECIOUS - in fact, this debut just might feature the BEST opening/closing tracks on any LP ever?!  How can you top MYSTERY ACHIEVEMENT, its menace, grace, drive?  Well, how about: WAIT, TATTOOED LOVE BOYS, BRASS IN POCKET, PRIVATE LIFE (later covered by Grace Jones), KID, and the list goes on.  Amazingly, Chrissie and Co. balance shimmering pop anthems with balls-out rockers and never lose an ounce of credibility - but even the lighter, softer side of Chrissie's songs have a poignant, melancholy sadness and a lyrical/thematic complexity to them - and all the better for it. After the original two members of the band died (RIP), the Pretenders were never quite the same, but at least we have this document to stand the test of time - along with LONDON CALLING and a host of other landmark records, 1979 was a brilliant year for timeless music that STILL KICKS A**
B00000DRDW|4.0|Seeger's covers album was my favourite Seeger for no other reason than the awesome power he delivers on those three opening tracks;McDaniel's 'Bo Didley/ Who Do You Love', the Stephen Still's anthem,'Love The One Your With'and a yearning, mournful rendition of Tim Hardin's,'If I were A Carpenter'. He got smoother as he 'progressed'into acceptability. Give me this raw passion any day! Using a cobra snake as a necktie, honey. Tell me. Who do you love? Bo never said it better. This is pretty seductive rhetoric, Bobby. I believed you back then.
6300215814|5.0|A treat.  The romantic comedies of the early 1960's were a special genre, and this one is the very best.  It is so well done that it is impossible to say unequivocally whether it is a comedy or drama--- it is really a plausible mixture of the two, and isn't that how life is?  The score is beautiful, echoing the ambiguous funny-sad mood of the story.  \\"Moon River\\" is an immortal classic and fits in perfectly here.  <br />There will never be another Audrey Hepburn. A flawless performance here!  <br />I would say this film was a direct predeccessor to Sex and the City decades later, only much classier.
1402714580|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.ust a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

1558908323|4.0|If you like David Fincher movies and other dark moods like that you'll probably enjoy this.  The style really triumphs over the story which is sort of lame.  Cockroaches are bred in order to kill some desease that is attacking kids in New York I believe.  Anyways they \\"evolve\\" or mutate and begin to kill people instead of save them.  So, there's an investigation because of course the main leads don't know what's going on.  Well this is a cool movie.  The only thing bad is that some of the characters are a little bland and the DVD sucks...<br /><br />Charles S. Dutton is awsome as usual fighting monsters (Alien 3), and actually dieing in the same way he did when he was directed by David Fincher.  Hmm...<br /><br />Well, the coolest guy always dies IMO.  If you like dark moods and good cinematography you'll enjoy this.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I was relcutant, I was resistant.  I questioned, I doubted, I was won over.  I dig that not everyone will dig this album, and that's ok, not everybody has to.  For me personally, Win has incredible vocals, very distinct, and they oddly catch you.  What truly impressed me was the amazing capacity for the intensely beautiful.  \\"Wake Up\\" stands out to me, personally, but the entire album was good enough to get me to take a (very temporary) break from \\"Picaresque\\"...so that in and of itself says something...
B00005JLWN|4.0|Ok, let me start by saying that Dimension has made a great movie here.  The atmosphere's are really like how I usually picture a Dystopian world.  Very grey and nuetral colors.  Christian Bale is really cool, but I like him better in Reign of Fire.  Our boy from Goldeneye Sean Bean plays a small part as Bale's partner at the beginning who discovers emotion before the movie sets in.  That one guy who's on a UPN show...ah..I don't know his name, plays Bale's new partner, sort of evil.  Well now let me talk about something confusing.  Christian Bale plays a \\"Cleric\\" who is a very highly skilled fighter used as an instrument by \\"Father\\" to take out people who break the laws of feeling emotion and taking their medicin which helps them be emotionless.  See, after WWIII the world decides that something has to be done, so they take away all free expresion and emotion.  Fahrenheit 451..yes.  There's even a scene where two guys in white clean suits burn the Mona Lisa with flamethrowers.  Anyway it's about Christian Bale discovering what it's like to feel, and he breaks down, but is good at supressing his emotion when he's around other people.  But is this really about humanity's inevitable dive into a dystopian society?  Or is it about cool action fight scenes?  Here's where something is strange.  For the first scenes the dystopian mood is set in showing us what a terrible place it is.  Than there's really outrageous scenes where Christian Bale turns into Neo and begins shooting everyone in sight without getting a scratch.  It's sort of hard to tell what the writer was all about, but maybe some of that is explained by the DVD features.  Regardless of what it's really about you should see it, because it's still a good movie.
0670033375|5.0|I have read Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel and found it fascinating.  His work tied together many ideas of my own and could be why I enjoyed it, however when a friend challenged the book's premise, I defended it successfully.  Diamond's works are always well thought out and he makes it clear where facts end and speculation begins. <br /> <br />His newest book Collapse is a worthy successor to Guns Germs and Steel. This work make clear and defensible cases for the cause and effects of human choices.  The book uses examples from contemporary and ancient history.  The most interesting part is what these lessons can mean to us now.  This is a book I will reread because the thoughts are so rich.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|Maybe they should have chosen another producer..., maybe Andy Sneap, I don't know... The way it is, with Roy Z producing, the album seems more like a Halford solo project.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing amazing about this album. It's not the masterpiece that hungry fans keep talking about. Anyway, it's a strong album, considering the extreme quality of everyone involved here. But it is one of the CD's that, without noticing, you will find that more and more time will pass before you listen to it again...
0316666343|2.0|The lovely Bones is a good book, but towards the end, it starts to get boring and unrealistic. I think it was extremely pointless to have the mother run away and then come back years later. Throughout the entire book, it could have also used more details. Overall, I would say it's a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0000AQS6R|3.0|I love this movie and was excited to buy the new Special Edition DVD.  I have been watching it on an original VHS release until then.  It seems to me that to create the widescreen they may have cut some of the movie off the top and bottom.  If you have both, compare for yourself.  One of the scenes that clued me in on it was when they were eating the overcooked turkey.  In the original you can see Clark poring a large amount of gravy on his plate.  In the DVD you can't see it. <br /> <br />Another thing I noticed is that during on part of Clark's speedy sled scene in the original, you could clearly see the rope pulling him.  In this DVD it may have been digitally erased, since I couldn't find it. <br /> <br />I'm sure there are other things different.  I love the movie, but almost just want to stick with my original VHS release.
B00025ETIW|5.0|i know it has suddenly become uncool to like my chemical romance because they actually sell albums now, and i think that's really lame. After hearing \\"i'm not okay (i promise)\\" i wasn't even going to buy this cd, but even that song has grown on me now. I decided to buy it, decided it sucked compared to \\"i brought you my bullets, you brought me your love,\\" and put it away for months. Then i played it on my ipod while in the gym one day and it slowly became one of my favorite albums. It definitely gets me going. and yes, it's admittedly way different from their debut, but i think it's amazingly consistent with the \\"horror\\" theme and just an all around, catchy, exciting album. Everyone really needs to get over the whole \\"they sold out so i'm too cool to like them now\\" mindframe because this is a great cd. And the reviewers that diss mcr because of their lyrics have obviously never heard of senses fail or half of the other sh*t thats popular these days. Compared to some of the bands out there, mcr's lyrics have some potential, at least they're not all about getting dumped. Also, i really can't name a band the mcr really sounds like; they're pretty original. their live show is always energetic and the guys usually walk around and talk to everyone so i give them props for being nice guys too. I personally love the intro to \\"You know what they do to guys like us in prison\\" but the album as a whole is amazing. If you don't like it at first, definitely give it a few plays; it grows on you.
B00026W82U|5.0|This CD is great and if you can, check them out live.  You will fall in love!

068987474X|5.0|I read this book quickly. I had trouble putting it down. While reading it I am thinking \\"Yes it is true. I just didn't want to accept it. Black and white. If they are interested they will act interested. Its not that difficult.\\" It put a lot of my relationship \\"issues\\" in perspective for me. Why waste my time on someone that is not all that interested in me? This is the first book like this I have ever been able to get through. It reads very easy using witty humor, honesty, and particular relationship instances. I found it very helpful. And actually after reading it it makes going out a lot more fun. The expectations are different for me now. Its great.
0671027387|2.0|I, like millions of readers was introduced to Dan Brown via The Da Vinci Code, which I enjoyed and which led me to immediately read Angels and Demons ( which stretched my imagination way too much for my liking).  A year passed and I picked Digital Fortress just before boarding a long flight.  I enjoyed it somewhat, but only because it deals with digital cryptography, a subject that interests me.  Three days ago, I picked up Deception Point, also to keep my mind busy during a 10 hour flight.  I found the book entertaining, but its ending pathetic.<br /><br />In essence, Dan Brown's books all follow the same basic structure.  There's a handsome, erudite hero (usually a university professor or scientist).  He meets a young, beautiful, young woman who is also very intelligent and whose skills are critical to the storyline.  Both happen to be conveniently unattached at the time they meet (and both are yearning to find \\"true\\" love).  The plot unfolds generally over a single 24-hour cycle containing too much action for it to be remotely credible.  The denoument is typical of old Hollywood movies:  the hero and heroine fall madly in love after barely escaping death.<br /><br />It's truly a shame that someone with the writing skills and imagination of Dan Brown can be so repetitive with the overall structure of his plots.  Read any two of his books, and the others will be dissapointingly predictable.<br /><br />I have just finished reading Deception Point and its sophomoric ending left me feeling angry at myself for having read a fourth Brown book.  The ending scene, where the hero and heroine make out in the Lincoln Room at the White House, is what would only expect to read in the tabloids.<br /><br />My advice:  If you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, do yourself a favor and stop there.  Do not spoil your sense of prior enjoyment by reading any of Dan Brown's other books.  There's a reason, after all, for why none of them had met any success prior to The Da Vinci Code's success.success.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book in high school. I found it very interesting and imaginative. It is a book I always recomend. It made an incredible impression on me.
B000001IQH|5.0|I cannot say enough about this album - truly brilliant, <br /> <br />AOCTW is by far the best punk album released in the last 10 years and possibly the since London's Calling. It a mass of raw energy with, clashing guitars, ska grooves and great pop hooks.  <br /> <br />Rancid are extremely talented songwriters and musicians. On AOCTW everything falls into place. EVERY track is amazing and seems to grow better with each listen.  <br /> <br />In addition there is great variation in style and subject matter from song to song.  I've listened to this album hundreds of times (almost every time I workout/run) and it never loses its magic. <br /> <br />Just buy it - don't burn it - its worth it. <br /> <br />

B000002TQV|5.0|Unfortunately, while this CD and many of Radiohead's CDs are very good to excellent, The Bends is the electrified, arena-rocked version of Jeff Buckley's Grace album.  Wait...stay with me here for a moment.  If you have Radiohead's Pablo Honey disc from 1993 and then you hear The Bends from 1995, you obviously notice a dramatic change in the scope of Radiohead's music.  Instead of the Nirvana-ish \\"Creep,\\" now you have the epic, soaring guitars of \\"Planet Telex.\\" Also, Thom's falsetto starts emerging as a major component of the Radiohead sound.  Not coincidentally, Buckley released his Grace album in 1994.  It has the fretwork of The Bends (and later) album(s).  The falsetto in Jeff's voice is quite distinct for 1994; of course, now the falsetto is a key component of a vast majority of bands (Radiohead and their followers Coldplay, Keane, Muse, Travis, etc.).  It is not too far a stretch to think that Thom and co. \\"borrowed\\" a bit from Grace.
B000005JAK|5.0|Candy Apple Grey was the major label debut from Husker Du after a string of brilliant records on the SST label.  And they don't disappoint.  The first thing you'll notice is that the production is a little crisper even than Flip Your Wig, and the songs benefit from it.  A shorter 10 songs than their usual tally of songs, this album still delivers.  The opening song, Crystal, is one of their best ever, with great lyrics spit out with venomous anger by Mould over his buzzsaw guitar, Norton's percolating bass, and some ridiculous drumming from Hart.  This is followed by Hart's excellent Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely.  The album has other awesome tracks, such as Eiffel Tower High, Dead Set on Destruction, All This I've Done For You, and Mould's two more introspective and quiter numbers, Too Far Down and Hardly Getting Over It, both of which (especially the latter) have amazing lyrics set to really effective music.  GET THIS ALBUM!
B0007MVXQG|1.0|I picked up this album because I'm a fan of Priest's old material and a friend kept raving about how the new album is awesome.  I'm still asking her what album she listened to.  Angel of Retribution is fabulously average at best, and a sad remnant of what used to be one of the best bands in metal at worst. I have no problem with bands rehashing their old stuff, but they should at least do a good job of it.    The worst part is, the songs keep getting worse as the album goes on.  Deal with the Devil is the only halfway decent song on the CD, and even that gets ruined by the chorus, which is easily one of the weakest I've ever heard.  By the time Lochness rolled around, I was praying for the CD to melt in my player so it would be put out of its misery.    I can't even give this album away. I have tried to give it to 3 of my friends, and they have all refused after hearing it, agreeing with me that it's one of the worst things they've ever heard.  I want my money back.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I had read some very positive reviews before I decided to plunk down my $5 and rent this \\"movie\\".  I even saw a glowing review from a \\"top 10er\\"  I was all ready to enjoy a nice movie which was admittedly out there.  Do not waste your time with this trash.  The one and only funny moment amongst all of the waste was at the very end and it involves a camera, I wont ruin it for those of you who still decide to sit through this horror show.  That way you can still find a reason to continue living.
0312995423|2.0|With The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown easily joined the leagues of the best-selling titans.  Digital Fortress, his first novel, is another pot-boiler, crowd-pleasing thrilla many will scoff at but few will put down due to boredom.  Come on, a lot of the chapters are only a few paragraphs long.  Brown was really aiming for the ultra ADD crowd with this \\"novel\\", and at times, the prose makes Crichton seem like Hemingway.  Still, if you're a sucker for this sort beachbag reading, you'll probably enjoy Digital Fortress.   <br /> <br />Yours without wax. . .
1400032717|5.0|It's been a while since I read this book, but I still remember the deeply satisfying, heart breaking ending that made me fall in love with this book.  Throughout it was funny and quirky, deftly concealing its clues along the way until they are finally revealed in the solution to the mystery, which was, if not terribly complex, definitely emotionally moving.  Last, but not least of all, I fell in love with the main character and felt like his parents, both frustrated with but totally devoted to him.  I want to read this book again and hopefully capture some, if not all I felt during my first reading.
B00005JCAA|4.0|The primary reason to buy this DVD set is NOT for \\"Meet Joe Black\\" (a forgetable, dry movie), but for the amazing \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" from 1934. For some idiotic reason this is the only way you can buy it - pinned to Brad Pitt's coattail. Frederic March was one of the greatest actors in the history of film, and his performance here is moving and fascinating. Anderson's screenplay gives him a lot of difficult material to interpret. Overall, a brilliant, thought-provoking film. It should stand alone and not have to share space with \\"Joe Black.\\"
B000002BMD|5.0|While I agree with the reviewer who called them an \\"anti-US\\" band (they are) and they are among the biggest idiots in the world politically (they are....just listen to their lyrics and some of their \\"arguments\\"), this album is fantastic.  A triumphant re-emergence in the wake of founding member Richey James Edwards' disappearance.  Some of these songs contain his final lyrics before he vanished.  Among the best songs are A Design For Life, Kevin Carter, Enola/Alone, Further Along, and Removeables.  I also really like The Girl Who Wanted to Be God.  A solid album and along with the harrowing The Holy Bible, their absolute peak.
B0000C6VXF|5.0|I've always thought \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" to be Elvis' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphones a la REM's \\"Up\\". I'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuances are even better enjoyed this way. Elvis' songwriting on \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was at it's most crisp, witty and insightful. Every track on here is a true jem...a shining jewel. Well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc. Some of these songs made me cry then and still resonate now. I'm glad I saw him on the \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" tour and glad I have this CD!<br /><br />I still get a kick out of how one track bleeds into the next with assorted yelps and screams.  And the lyrics...my God...at his peak Elvis really was brilliant!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I unfortunately wasn't introduced to QOTSA until Song's For the Deaf, but I now own everything of thiers. Queens has something that alot of today's bands don't, it is called dynamics. They are kind of a hard band to describe musically. Anyway this album is meant to be listened to over and over again, not like most disposable crap bands existing on the mainstream for the past 15 years! C'mon kiddies there is much more to playing guitar than 2 finger chords! Every song on this album is very good and on previous Queens album I like the arrangement of the songs. They all seem to flow into one another. I am happy that a band like this can still exist today. They don't write teeny watered down pop songs, nor do they follow some formula to churn out hit after hit. I am a big fan of Josh's guitar style and sound, especially the sound(it reminds me of Tony Bourge of BUDGIE). Most rock guitarists today sound like a swarm of mosquitoes especially live! Hopefully this band will continue to put out many more albums!

B000024D4R|5.0|This is it!  The best Pink Floyd album.  Wish You Were Here is a close second w/ perhaps a then close runner up to that in Dark Side of the Moon ... but then, I love all their stuff pre-The Wall.  <br /> <br />Animals is on my top ten.  BRILLIANCE unparalelled!  A timeless classic and a trippy journey where you'll want to remain forever in time.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This movie should not fade into obscurity.  I am a big fan of Russell Crowe, Al Pacino and Michael Mann, and they are all at the top of their craft.

B0007CNXUU|5.0|This movie is just so pure, so touching, charming, beautiful!!!  It's one of those rare movies that have no violence, no sexual scenes, etc.  It's the feel-good, family film of the year that ABSOLUTELY, 100%, deserved that Best Picture nomination and all 7 of the Academy Awards it was nominated for, especially for my absolute favorite actor, Johnny Depp!  He gave yet another flawless performance.  He never ceases to amaze me in every single role he has done.  His flawless acting and his outstanding communication with the boys and Sylvia was just so charming.  The whole movie was just so beautful.  Get tissues ready, guys, it'll get you crying, believe me, when I saw it in the theater this past February, I wasn't prepared, and my face was all wet with my streaming tears.  Every single actor/actress in this film was flawless, especially young Freddie Highmore, who's going to be Charlie Bucket in the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory due out in July, with Depp as Wonka!  I seriously recomend this movie to people of all ages!  Just fantastic...I have found Neverland with this movie...FANTASTIC!
B0006GAOCW|2.0|In what has to be one of the biggest ruses in the history of Hollywood last year somebody sold the exact same script to two directors and had their movie made twice. How else do we describe the eerily similar \\"First Daughter\\" and \\"Chasing Liberty.\\" Let's be honest, if these movies had come out 5 years apart people still would have raised eyebrows at the similarities.  That said this movie was quite bad and I just don't know who would be interested in this film. If anything it says that we like our movies just as we like our politicians: light and fluffy. There is no edge here at all. Good luck figuring out which party this president is supposed to represent (I'm guessing Republican, but it is highly debatable).  Plus this film's idea of rebellion is...um...sliding down a hill? Dancing on a table? Drinking alcohol? Wow...hardcore. I also find it a bit disingenuous when these princess movies make money off telling kids that really it's best to be \\"normal\\" and that being privileged is overrated, and then following it up with a scene of unrestrained greed. The reason they do that is that in reality all kids want to be rich far more than they want to be normal and the filmmakers know this. I also have to somewhat dump on Katie Holmes performance here. For somebody who seems to have potential choosing this cream puff role did nothing to impress me.  Even when she was supposed to be angry in this film she came off as timid. My question to you is this: Can Katie Holmes play any role other than Joey from \\"Dawson's Creek?\\" Can she play angry, mean, crazy. . .or is sweet all she does? In this case she was severely upstaged by Amerie who played her roommate. I also did not like the way that the film seemed to have no new idea's in its head. For example, how clich&eacute;d to have it so that Holmes' character doesn't like \\"Hail to the Chief.\\" For most of the film I didn't have the energy to build up a strong dislike it, but then it kept going and going, with happy ending piled on top of happy ending. By the time they got done piling happiness on me I was quite angry to say the least. **1/4f happy ending. By the time they got done piling happiness on me I was quite angry to say the least. **1/4
B000068G9X|5.0|You can't go wrong with this album. Danzig's maniacle lyrics and John Christ's blues/metal guitar stylings. Also if you are a Samhain fan you might recall the song \\"Twist Of Cain\\" and its back and as good as ever. Danzig definately has one of the best voices in all of history and he shows it here. I love every song on this album and they're are fun songs to play on guitar so have fun witht this album and enjoy.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|As a huge daft punk fan who loved homework and discovery, this one was disapointing. Extremiliy repetitive and at times annoying. some good tracks and a few catchy parts, but overall id say this one is okay. Dont rush out for it.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is an intimate look at two very complicated and very troubled relationships. A reviewer for TIME Magazine has called Closer \\"A love story for adults,\\" but this is a far cry from any love story you are likely to see. If this is love, take back my reservation. <br /> <br />Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two couples who try, unsuccessfully, to secretly swap partners. The film gets up close and personal with these four people with scenes that are so real and packed with so much emotion, you want to look away because they seem so private, yet you can't take your eyes off the screen.  <br /> <br />The cast is mesmerizing, each perfect in their roles. Julia Roberts is quite impressive as Anna, in one of her best performances. She is always easier to take when her trademark acting ticks are stripped away and she does a good job conveying a woman wracked with guilt who is nonetheless compelled to cause hurt. Jude Law is quite good as Dan, an obituary writer struggling to become a novelist, and Clive Owen is terrific in an Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning role as Larry, a dermatologist who meets Anna because of a cruel joke by Dan. Natalie Portman, especially, delivers a nuanced and unforgettable performance in her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance. She was most stunning of all in her first 'adult' role. I look forward to seeing more of her once the horrendous first three Star Wars films come to an end in May. <br /> <br />What makes Closer so interesting, aside from the across-the-board blistering performances and crackling dialogue, is that you might empathize with a character in one scene, and then hate their guts in the next. Everyone is a victim, and everyone is an abuser, although not always in the most obvious ways. Closer is very adult, and very clever; a classy, striking piece of work.  <br /> <br />Veteran director Mike Nichols' juggles the various time frames with consummate artistry and his subtle dramatic skill evokesmemories of his first film, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" (1966) - but there's no Elizabeth Taylor or Richard Burton here, although all four actors deliver unusually strong performances. You might feel the need for a cold shower after watching this film, but it'll be worth it.
038572179X|1.0|I am amazed at the enthusiastic reviews this book has received.  It is such a poorly written, poorly conceived story that I was actually laughing out loud as I read it...Could anybody really take either the story or the writing seriously?  First, the sentences were baggy and run-on.  There were lots (and lots) of adjectives and other verbiage that added nothing and clarified nothing.  Then, the character development was not believable: a snitty little tattle-tale grows up to be Florence Nightengale.  And even if she did, what would make me care?  Does she have any thoughts, depth, emotions, life events that would make her interesting.  I can't say because it is neither explicit nor implicit in the book, despite a profusion of unnecesary detail.  Lastly, the story line -requiring too much suspended belief for my taste- is far too thin to support 300 odd pages.  Where is all the hype and enthusiasm coming from?
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|I'm a huge Stevie fan, and I have the \\"At The Close Of A Century\\" boxed set, which is the best Stevie collection out there, but I still love \\"Original Musiquarium 1\\", his 1982 \\"best - of\\", it's nowhere as complete as \\"ATCOAC\\", but it does hold a sentimental value.<br /><br />The reason why this two disc set is so special to me is because it was the cd that turned me on to Stevie. It was about 10 years ago and we were driving out to my grandparents' summer home in Pennsylvania, about an hour drive. It was late at night and we all wanted to listen to something relaxing, so my dad put on \\"Original Musiqurium 1\\". The song that got me hooked was \\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\\". I was only four at the time, but I remember how enthalled I was by his music.<br /><br />Looking back on it 10 years later, I still love every minute of this cd, from the plodding intro of \\"Higher Ground\\" to the blaring horns of \\"Do I Do\\" to the simple romaticism of \\"Ribbon In The Sky\\" (a song featured in my parents' wedding video) to the funky \\"I Wish\\" to those timeless opening chords of \\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\\" and everything in between.<br /><br />My only wish is that since this collection was originally released 23 years ago, they could have added more songs to make it an anniversary edition. I would have been nice to have \\"As\\" (currently my all time favorite Stevie song), \\"Another Star\\", \\"All I Do\\", \\"Rocket Love\\", \\"If It's Magic\\", \\"If You Really Love Me\\", \\"I Believe\\", \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\", \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" and \\"Lately\\".<br /><br />But still, this is such a great collection. I think everyone should own this classic album of classic music by a musical genius.
B000002C1W|5.0|The Amazon review is dead on -- when Waters left PF, I thought the band would fade away and fall apart.  As I noted in my review of The Wall, \\"Great art requires technical skill and the ability to affect us emotionally or change the way we view the world. ... Roger Waters' music and lyrics are dark and disturbing.\\"  However, I also noted that \\"David Gilmore is one of the finest guitarists on the planet. Pink Floyd, as always, produces a universe engulfing soundscape...\\"  Waters' theatrical bent and dark, introspective lyrics were brilliant, and were the soul of the Floyd.  Without Waters, the band had to rely on the technical skill of David Gilmore.  The Floyd has done this very well.    Last Sunday, I watched a video of Roger Waters - Live In The Flesh, which covered much of the same material as Floyd did in the Delicate Sound of Thunder tour.  Although Waters' guitarist was very good, he was not David Gilmore.    What was left after Waters' departure from PF is still a great band.  The lyrics in this album may have turned from the Waters' dark introspective variety to Gilmore's social and political commentary, but the music is still Floyd's universe encompasing sound.  In this reviewer's opinion, this album is still one of PF's best.
B000003TA4|5.0|I think this album has the qualities to be an \\"underdog\\" album when you mention albums like: \\"sgt.pepper\\" \\"london calling\\" \\"pet sounds\\" \\"blonde on blonde\\" or \\"revolver\\". i say an underdog album because all of these albums came as a warning prior to its release that the album would be a masterpiece and an extraordinary work of art. On the other hand \\"nevermind\\" wasn't expected to be a hit on the charts nor a success among audiences anywhere.....its success was in the timing the band came about and the change the seattle grunge scene was about to explode....but going back to what matters....kurt cobain once said \\"music comes first then lyrics come second\\" and he is right and wrong at the same time......i think the lyrics played an awesomely important part not of \\"nevermind\\"'s success but of its timeless atmosphere and its influence for band at this time and bands to come........Cobain's lyrics were better than any metal band at the time and in the 80's.......the way he made his statements contradictory and poetic word play towards the feel of the inordinary style. At a fast pace...songs from the album became instant classics for not only nirvana fans but fans of alternative music since it has a very powerful appeal to many young music listeners....to those who are from the 80's, 70's, 60's or even 50's generation may not get the feel of this timeless album.....but imagine a band from every one of those decades that came out with a fresh,bold,raw album that was to the likes of \\"nevermind\\", imagine a band like the velvet underground coming out with \\"the velvet underground and nico\\" making the record an instant classic or a band like guns n roses coming out with \\"appetite for destruction\\" and respectively changing the lives of those who became instant fans.......''nevermind\\" did the same thing at a massive pace and accidently battling for the greatest album of all time with legendary bands of rock and roll. to those people who haven't listened to \\"nevermind\\" and who don't wanna listen to \\"nevermind\\" i think it might just be a crime against rock and roll not to give it a chance to listen to it, for it holds a place in the history of rock and roll and one of its finest albums ever.........
B0002YLC24|5.0|Set in the beautiful backdrop of Paris, Before Sunset is a gorgeously real story of two people, once lovers for only one night, reunited, again, for only one night. <br /> <br />     With optimism and wit, Linklater creates characters with whom you can't help but fall madly in love.  Not overtly sentimental, but not crushing and pessimistic, there is really only one way to describe this film; a perfect mean of realist drama.  Amongst comic book schlock and inane comedies, Before Sunset is a step in the right direction for film. <br />    <br />  If you have ever been in love, are in love, or are just looking for a film that renews a realistic sensibility in cinema, Before Sunset will touch you as movies so rarely do.
B00067189O|4.0|I like this album very much.In '97 I purchased the 'speed corrected' version. However I'm a bit disappointed - the miltichannel version only reads 5.0 not 5.1 and the rear channels (ambient - mostly) are not that different from the stereo version, which plays surround because of othe difereence signal.if they wanted an 'accurate' multichannel version they should have stuck with a 3 channel one ,as it was recorded. The docmentary was interesting but because of the sound (5.0) it only rates 4 stars. <br />Edd.  iegolden@shaw.ca

But I watched it again with some bros and it grew on me.  Its totally a movie to discuss afterwards and reminisce on the funny parts.  Classic part:Steak to the Head. Watch the movie and you'll know what i mean.  Hilarious, i even bought the flippin cd for When in Rome and Alpaville,classic songs!!  Not a movie for everyone, but was worth buying to me.  Da bomb flick!!

B0007O38F8|4.0|Alright every one keeps on dissing this album but honestly it's not that bad. It's definately no classic but it's not that bad. Of course it doesn't top Get Rich Or Die Tryin, he never will. Just like Nas will never top Illmatic or Dre will never top The Chronic. (not comparing 50 at all to nas or dre) I think the problem is everyone was expecting way too much out of this album. 50's flow really hasn't changed that much. And yes Disco Inferno's beat is a lot like On Fire's, and Candyshop's is a lot like Majic Stick's but who cares the songs are still hot, and there still topping the charts. For example Lil John has the same beats giving all kinds of different artists hits. I don't know how many different versions of the beat used for Usher's Yeah or Pitbulls Culo that have been topping the radio charts for I don't know how many artists. So all in all this album is pretty good it has some good songs, some bad, and some in between like most albums do. If you were expecting 50 to drop classics and rank up with the greats of course you will be dissapointed because it's not gonna happen. But 50 is still a good artist and he will keep dropping hits and will keep selling records. What you hear on this album, I think is what you should expect from 50 for now on. Not classic but i would say above average.

B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Fans like to bash this film as well as Trek 5, Shatner's directoral opus. However, it seems to me that both this one and 5 are much MUCH more like classic Trek story telling that Roddenberry liked so much. <br /> <br />Sure, this is no FIRST CONTACT, but we already have one of those. this is a more thoughtful and human trek story, and one well-directed, with some of the nicest looking effects we've seen. The cast is in top form and having fun. And like the original cast in 4, when they are having fun, so does the audience.  <br /> <br />Check this out with an open mind. And an open disregard for the rabid so-called uber fans who casually bash this movie.
B00079018K|4.0|For all the people who want to import the songs into their ipods, you have to accept the security certificate first. you can actually use the software that comes with it, copy the songs, burn them into another cd, and then use that cd to import the songs into your ipod. A lot of work though. <br />All in all, do not simply import them without doing this--you will get garbled tracks.  <br />All in all, i like this album--it reminds me of a good mix of old chemical brothers,guitars, and brit rock vocals reminiscent of oasis and the beatles.

0393312836|4.0|Using an immensely innovative way with words Anthony Burgess writes a stunning novella of grit of shock and brutal truth's. \\"A Clockwork orange,\\" working from a point in the future of \\"ultraviolence,\\" portrays the life of a modern day gangster in all his glories. Following him through the streets, ilstening to his street slang, it makes a world truly unlike our own. Developing a new culture, a new language, and unimaginable violence.  <br />   Told by \\"your humble narrator,\\" a boy named Alex with a quick eye for victim's and a smooth mouth for covering, it's honestly fascinating. The book is highlited by scenes dripping with blood. The entire read is just a trip because of the heinous crimes. The innovative happenings in this book are nothing short of terrible, either. Without going overboard, the author captures fear and disgust and loathing, using the spit fire mouth of Alex and the reactions of the people around him. <br />   The middle of the book throws you for a loop, digressing into the death's he's caused and the way the government plans on helping him to redeem himself. It's so farfetched that you can't help but being enthrolled with it. <br />   In the end, the book is serene, and you realize that he's come to a point of being an adult. In a way it's heartbreaking to realize that he's become one of the ones around him. THe one's he used to pick on and beat near to death. But it's all a circle, one that Alex may or may not realize.

But, over the last two weeks I have been enthralled with what we do have, and tonight I am ordering an extra copy just for lending to my friends.  I wouldn't let my personal copy out of my sight.  This is one of the great musical and television events of my lifetime, and it is for such a wonderful cause.  Buy this and enjoy it; and then get another copy to share!
1591396190|4.0|Chances are I just finished the book \\"The Medici Effect\\" from Frans Johansen, and found that the core ideas of this \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" are mostly the same but differently definited its name. Frankly, you could put this title as detailed case studies of \\"The Medici Effect\\" with more implementation guidelines. <br /> <br />But the most interesting thing is that while these two titles presenting about blended concepts from different fields of industries to generate \\"Blue Oceans\\" or \\"Medici Effect\\", it brought me back to the core subject of \\"The Parallel Universe\\" presented by the book \\"Hyperspace\\". There're some hints that you can feel their coincidence of ideas.

0767836324|5.0|This movie is soooo wonderful. It is very Heartwarming, funny, dramatic, and great for families. And fathers and daughters to bond. I say that because when i was younger it was more often to see me on my dads lap watching this movie {or other movies with Robin Williams in them} then with any other member of my family. So if your between the ages of 3 and 8, and you and your dad or your mom are really close, this is one of many Robin William movies that i recommened you watch.
B000002UAU|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Now, as a young black male, I am aware that the Beatles don't really constitute what most of us listen to, and its a concept album from them at that. But I'd always heard how they were one of the greatest bands of all time so I decided to get into them because I'm a music lover in general (who specializes hip hop and its derivatives). I like everything from Michael Jackson to Madonna to T.I. to Michelle Branch to classical to Avril Lavigne, and now I have to add the Beatles to my all-time fave list of artists. But out all of their albums I honestly expected to like this one the least because its some experimental ish and I didn't expect to connect with it. Well, lo and behold I really dig what the Beatles are puttin down. My fave is probably that eastern-influenced track (don't remember its name). It really is experimental but it seems to me that they succeed at every experiment they try, which is the true joy in hearing this album. You're hearing stuff that other artists (specially in rock) don't try, and hear The Beatles doing it very very well. I'm really feeling this, and I would definitely recommend it to those who are already into the Beatles and may not have heard it, or someone just trying to broaden their musical horizons.<br /><br />My one gripe with it (which is why it gets 4.5 and not 5): the Beatles have a habit of putting their voices in one ear/speaker and having instruments and stuff in the other, and that type of audio field split really annoys me. I like for the main vocals to either be surround sound or centered, not on one side or the other. But that's a minor gripe considering the scale of awesomeness contained in this album and I've learned to get used to it. That minor complaint cannot mar what is an otherwise great album. Rock on!
B00005JLEX|5.0|\\"Seinfeld\\" is the greatest show in the history of television, and this DVD set is essential to those who want to see how it all began.  You get the complete first two seasons, as they originally aired (many were edited for syndication), plus commentary, deleted scenes, and a lot of cool interviews and behind the scenes stuff. <br /> <br />Seasons 1 and 2 weren't quite as strong as seasons 3 and 4 (\\"The Contest\\" is the best ever), but you've still got plenty of classics, like \\"The Pony Remark\\", \\"The Heart Attack\\", \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", \\"The Revenge\\", and many others. <br /> <br />This is something you can't be without.  I hope they release all 9 seasons, because they all deserve to be immortalized. <br /> <br />Long live \\"Seinfeld\\"!
0375507256|3.0|I was quite impressed by the virtuosity of the author initially. It is quite difficult to write a book that encompasses different genres. But when I got past the half way mark, the whole book seemed rather empty and pointless. I felt that the unifying theme (if any) through all the stories was not compelling. I finished reading the book eventually, but came away feeling like I did not get much from it.
B0000009SE|5.0|Frank Zappa is unfortunately saddled with the Mr. Satire tag for so many rock music fans - that people tend to overlook his more ambitious/complex works. <br /> <br />This album is a treat and an important milestone in the ever-evolving tradition of rock and jazz. The playing is top order. Pity then that his contributions have been scarcely acknowledged. This deserves a place amongst the finest in the genre(alongwith Hot Rats and Grand Wazoo - simply superlative)
B0006UYOJM|5.0|That Ron Wood slide guitar on the last track, That's All You Need, so big and beefy, you can hear every nuance. Just great guitar, another wonderful example of classic Ron Wood guitar licks on some of the best classic rock 'n roll of all time. <br /> <br />The whole ablum is filled with great vocals, and great instrumental tone. Really a treat. <br /> <br />The great mastering, cutting, production- it lets you get swept away by the great music! Audio Fidelity 24K Plus is a success, if you love this album you must hear this version!
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin park was never my favorite band and will never been.  There cd \\"Meteora\\" kick off very nice with glass shattering at the end after the 14 sec kickoff.  Then \\"breaking the habit\\" start and it sound really nice.  honestly i love this cd when i burrow it from my friend and copy it for myself.  But in about two day, i was quickly tire of this cd.  I would review it track by track but this album doesn't deserve my review.  Do yourselve all a favor and don't buy this album! Period!
B000000OQF|5.0|Firts of all i am outraged to what this \\"Fred Smith's\\" Know-it-all review has to say on the matter. (the reviewer below) Im guessing for instance that his favourite band is Creed (or should i say Crudd), who came out about 3 or 4 years ago, Guns 'n' Roses on the other hand came out about 20 years ago...so, Fred Smith (if that is your real name) my little genius, (im guessing either your IQ is that of a squirrel, or you are about 10 years old) i think you need to go back to first grade math class because how in the world could Slash (the god of Rock) have copied guitar solos from Mark Tremonti's song book from a band that came out 15 years after Guns n Roses?! In fact slash probably influenced Tremonti's playing when he started to learn guitar. As a guitar player myself i have all of the Guns 'n' roses song books and have studied slashes playing for about 3 years, and it sounds nothing like tremonti's playing. Tremonti's playing is nowhere near as bluesy or as soulful as slashes. That goes for Axls singing aswell, how can Axl be a scott strapp wannabe because Axl sang on that record when scott strapp was probably still in a crib. I would also like to say that it is YOU sir who is the uneducated one in the ways of rock and roll! Its people like you that don't know a thing about good music. (who would ever want to be a scott strapp wannabe anyway) people like you let down Legendary albums like \\"Appetite For destruction\\" by bringing the overall review down to 4 and a 1/2 stars. I think what Fred Smith is doing here is throwing a tantrum and stamping his feet bacause he wants the 20 MILLION people that have bought Appetite for Destruction to like Creed. This has to be the most influential album i have ever heard to date, and I advise people not to listen to a word this \\"Fred Smith\\" guy says. Ok Ok so you like Creed we get it, it doesn't mean you have to put down other bands. Advice to readers: please read a few more of the OTHER peoples reviews on this album for backup of what i'm trying to say.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Darko is a movie that will speak to an entire generation of youth and survive the test of time. We say this with a certainty because of the elements where it succeeds. It has a horror element but it is not horrible in the sense of visual or mental disgust but instead a quiet fear--that same fear that Aristotle says is so important to theater because the audience must feel as if it could happen to them just as easily as the characters. It has an element of science-fiction but its plot (despite a charming continual reference to Deus ex Machina) is not reliant upon some kind of techno-babble postulation or solution. It has a lifelike ensemble of characters--of truly gifted actors giving fine performances--but none of the characters are overtly mean-spirited or caricatures of real people but rather a set of people earnestly attempting to do what they feel is right. There is even a striking moment at the end of  a film where a criminal is shown weeping at his own sense of guilt and hatred towards himself. Finally, it is a film that speaks directly and unflinchingly at the confusion of teenagers but still gives them a sense of something to believe in and the necessity for personal achievement.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD WATCH: <br /> <br />Current teenagers and adults who remember their teenage years probably all the way back to 1980 will find watching this film to be a moving experience. Kelly is deadly accurate in his many portrayals and the relevance to youth in this decade is still sharp. Aside from the coming-of-age elements of this movie, it shares some of the most similarities with some striking films involving romance and the chronic pathos of life. For example, the movie Happy Accidents starring Vincent D'Onofrio has thrilled many a romantic audience despite its speculative elements and those people would probably find a great deal of merit here and vice-versa. Also, more mainstream movies--decidedly \\"unspeculative\\"--such as Magnolia and Quiz Show also have audiences who would appreciate Darko and vice-versa. These are all movies that speak to life in the most important ways and we should not ignore them.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />Obviously, there's no cathartic rush of violence here. Movie-goers may be misled by the cover and title in to thinking it's some kind of R-rated Alice in Wonderland type romp which it most assuredly is not. For films of this excess--but still done well--look to Predator or perhaps A Clockwork Orange or other similar venues. Also, this is a confusing movie that leaves its audience with a heavy sense of ambiguity. This can be highly irritating to the movie-goer who wants to understand what is happening and yearns for a sense of closure. Indeed, this ambiguity disturbed Roger Ebert quite badly in his initial review.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
0151008787|5.0|This is the first Amos Oz book I have read so I have nothing to compare it to.  I loved it.  A great storyteller even about true events.
B00004Z459|1.0|The only reason they have so much credit is because they were on mtv and all.  Listen to band like three day grace and third eye blind!  Sure their not famous as linkin park but not all popular band are good.  From now on i'm not ever buying a single linkin park cd ever again.  I didn't buy \\"meteora\\" because i didn't know what it sound like at first.  But my friend suggested buying \\"hybrid theory\\" because a lot of people said it was better.  That is all a bunch of crap.  I rather buy the worst Green day cd (if they have one) than listen to hybrid theory boring song.   <br /> <br />The drumline and beat sound very similar to \\"Meteora\\".  And the 12 song on this album sound almost exactly the same.  Hybrid theory isn't as loud or Obnoxious as metora, but it still painfully boring and the rapping got to go away.  Linkin park is not a good band and will never been a good band if they don't come up with any catchy tune.  So don't buy this album, same goes for meteora and other linkin park album.  It just isn't worth wasting 15 buck on a band that doesn't sing very well or other word give me a very bad headache.   <br /> <br />Just don't buy linkin park cd if you like Green Day music or even good charlotte (which is my fav band)!  I think that all of it, and i truly hope it help all of you reading this.
0345452585|1.0|I was a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, that was until this book! A see-through plot and  &quot;the Club&quot; was just bizarre to say the least.<br />Hopefully the next book I read by Kellerman (if I read one again)will be better as this was a waste of my time!
6305971099|5.0|Don't expect this movie to give you the same amount of fear as the first Halloween movies, but expect to see a nice movie with plenty of scares continued off from part 4. When I watched it, I wasn't expecting this to top part 4, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this movie had a lot of scenes that kept me on the edge. <br />Jamie is in the mental institution for children that have problems. She's not making a lot of progress, but that's only because she's witnessed the evil that Michael Myers brings. She knows one thing for sure... he's back this Halloween. This Halloween movie may have the most exciting scenes that any Halloween movie has had. <br />This keeps you pleading for jamie and her stepsister to stay alive as Michael Myers hunts them down. It has terrific acting, wonderfully written script, and the horror that will make you scream out loud. This is one excellent Halloween movie that made the series as great as it is today.
B00063MBU8|1.0|I don't normally write spontaneous hate fuelled reviews but unfortunately I feel compelled to do so on this occasion. The song welcome to my life it the most self-pitiying sh*t I have ever heard. And I cant go anywhere without hearing the damn thing. The lead singer wines about how awful his life is. Yeah it must be hard to be a pop star making money of kids emotions. Most kids that listen to this will be like `oh I can really relate to what he's saying' etc. Well I have a message for you. Everyone has it hard growing up, it's completely normal to have difficult teenage years. But if you're rich enough to be able to buy this cd or watch the single on mtv then your life isn't that bad, seriously! What got my goat was that simple plan performed this single at mtv Asia aid. How can that guy stand there and complain about how hard *his* life is when thousands of people have lost their homes, loved ones and had their entire world turned upsidown? It's incredibly immature. Its easy to drown in self pity and think that the whole worlds against you but its just not true. Whenever life gets me down and I feel like complaining, I just think about all those people in the Far East, and then slap my self for being so self absorbed. Life isn't fair, its just better then death. Get used to it!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|No sophmore curse for this Canadian Hard Rock quartet (...or trio, I don't know whats up).  In a mere 3 years these guys came from being Nickelback Jr to kicking their Asses with thick songwriting and sold rhythm and a frontman w/ a great voice.  Pick this one up, b/c they are NOT Nickelback, but heavier, smarter, and more honest. <br /> <br />Check out tracks #2, #3, #5, #7, #8, and #12
B0007O38F8|1.0|I was a fan of rap in 1993-1997, between now and then i have quit listening to rap for the most part.  I do like DMX and Three Six Mafia. I picked up Get Rich or Die Tryin and I LOVED IT. So the first day this came out, i bought it and the next day i sold it. All the street elements are nearly gone, everything he hated about Ja Rule has come back at him and he is now a hypocrite. I wished this album was a joke. I guess it is time to give up on rap. Rap is supposed to make people in the street want to feel better and not like $&*% because they can't afford a Benz and A million dollar mansion. 50, you went the way of Snoop, Nelly and all of the jokes that are in the rap game.  There are some good rappers left, they just are not on tv.  You don't have to rap with N'Sync and Country singers to get attention.  I do like the new Game album though.  I miss Death Row so much. Now on to listening to Nine inch nails, Kmfdm,Rammstein, and Strapping Young Lad.
B000002UAO|5.0|What really makes this CD an alltime classic isn't so much that every tune is a standout in rock and roll history...not every song is. You can't even say every song is one of the BEATLES finest efforts overall. But what this album does do more than any before it is start to realize the possibilities of the recording studio and of basic rock/pop music to be artful. These songs are deceptively simple..when you REALLY listen to them, there's a lot going on. More than that, they nearly completely subvert what most people think of when they hear the phrase \\"rock\\": there aren't a bunch of wailing guitar solos, screeched lead vocals, or bashing drums here. But calling it their \\"country/folk\\" album is to not REALLY listen to how every song is filtered through a rock sensibility.<br /><br />I'll start with what I feel are the highlights: \\"DRIVE MY CAR\\" is a great rock number but rather than being driven by the drums, it's actually the COWBELL that does it. Another nice touch is the extra menace thrown in between 1:24-1:34 as Paul's bass is doubled up./\\"NORWEGIAN WOOD\\" is usually touted for first using the Indian sitar in Western music and that's surely one of its virtues, but there's more going on. Listen to almost \\"polka\\" oom-pah rhythm in the acoustic guitar at :49 and again at 1:46./\\"IN MY LIFE\\" is far and away the best song here..one of the finest looks at life and love ever written and a decided classic for all rock and roll. Ringo's drumming here is a masterpiece of economy...exactly what is needed is here and no more. The speeded up piano solo at 1:28 (to make it sound like a harpsichord) was a first for pop. John's falsetto at 2:10 is gorgeous./\\"NOWHERE MAN\\" is a great lyric and sterling harmonies. Listen for the brief building guitar figure at 2:03 and again at 2:31./\\"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE\\" is probably the most underrated track in the Beatles catalogue. The most flatout 'rock' guitar solo on the album is found here, starting at :57, along with a sneeringly misogynist John lyric. He's gone from holding her hand to grabbing her wrist...<br /><br />The others found here also have moments of wonder: \\"YOU WON'T SEE ME\\": This is Paul's show. The bass drives the song./\\"THE WORD\\": A fantasticly original bass part from Paul. The first 'psych' leaning with George Martin's harmonium at 2:02 and 2:33/\\"MICHELLE\\": Probably the first bass solo in pop music (2:20)/\\"WHAT GOES ON\\": A prime example of 'deceptively simple'. The guitar solo at 1:33 may be rockabilly, but it AIN'T \\"country\\". Ringo turns in his nicest vocal yet. Listen to the guitars in the right speaker...the scratchy sound of them anticipates the funk sound of Sly Stone./\\"GIRL\\": Listen for the 2nd guitar to come in at 1:30 (right channel) and at 2:00 for the minimalist 'solo' (right) during the dual acoustic guitar bridge./\\"I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU\\": If there IS a \\"country\\" song on this disc, this is the one. But even then, the breaks with George's guitar and Ringo on Hammond are definitely rock./\\"WAIT\\":With only one exception (the guitar build at 1:17), ALL the motion comes from the percussion....ALL of it. The music drop out at 1:59 is interesting, too./\\"IF I NEEDED SOMEONE\\": Probably the least \\"experimental\\" song here but George's best effort to date. Wonderful melody.<br /><br />The only real low point for me on the disc is George's \\"THINK FOR YOURSELF\\" which is a fairly mishmash lyric. All the musical power from the tune comes from Paul's fuzz bass, George's own electric is an also-ran. Even in this one, though, there's an interesting bit: Observe how the harmonies go DOWN at the end of the phrase in the chorus (the 'think for yourself' bit).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This album should be in every collection. If you don't own this, it's difficult to understand all that came after.John lyric.

0316172324|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I assumed it was about how an untutored, hasty, first impression would be just as accurate as a thoughtful, studied examination.  I was wrong on two counts.  To begin with, it seems the judgement formed in an instant may be more accurate than the one created with labor and agony.  Finally, the rapidly formed judgement is not an impetuous, irresponsible act.  The attention of the cognoscenti focus on points that make a difference.  Excessive information is ignored as obfuscating clutter.  In a blink, judgement is rendered. <br />    Certain jobs require snap decisions as a matter of course.  Soldiers, police, firemen, athletes and courtroom lawyers have jobs that cannot abide quandries.  How do they ready themselves?  Clearly the successful ones have prepared for their momentous minutes with countless hours of training.  If you have only your first impression- count on soon being wrong, ignored, disgraced or dead. <br />    Malcolm Gladwell applies psychological observations to the real world with a delightfully engaging narrative.  However, I am concerned about --Blink's-- lessons being misapplied.  Recently, I saw a political roundtable discussing the book and a pundit suggested that the successful politicians were the ones whose values and vision were so ingrained, they could make snap decisions and never regret it.   <br />    How we love those leaders of certitude who valiently sail the course of righteousness.  What citizens of a democracy most need is to recognize when obstinacy, prejudice and weakness is concealed by a patina of bluff and guile.  I would much prefer to be led by an expert who assembles other free-speaking experts, takes a vote and abides by the majority.  (See --The Wisdom of Crowds-- by James Surowiecki, who like Gladwell, writes for --The New Yorker--.)  That said, I have nothing but praise for this book's observations.
B00005JMUA|4.0|If you came to watch Kill Bill, Volume 2, expecting the same type of flick as Volume 1 you may be disappointed. While Vol. 1 was an action driven romp based on the old kung-fu style of filming, Vol. 2 is a more cerebral driven film based on the old spaghetti-western of the late 60's/early 70's. This is a slower paced movie, and as a result, a better plot-driven movie. You could say Volume 1 was merely a introduction to the main story of Volume 2.<br /><br />As with Volume 1, we are treated to a storyline that keeps jumping back-&-forth over a four-year period. After the climatic fight scene with O-Ren at the end of Volume 1 we start Volume 2 back at the masacure four years previously. We are finally introduced to Bill ( a voice only in Vol. 1), played nicely by David Carradine. And we get to see in detail the events that lead up to the masacure.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, Volume 2 is a slower-paced, plot-driven movie. Whereas Vol. 1 had three great fight scenes there is really only one decent fight scene here, between the Bride and Elle Driver (played surprising well by daryl Hannah). This fight probably has the most satisfying ending of all, which I won't give away. Just be forewarned, you could get a wee-bit squemish here. After eliminating Driver from the picture we are finally ready for the showdown between the Bride & Bill.<br /><br />Unfortunately, here is where the movie begins to drag, just a little. First, we have a scene in a Mexican Brothel where \\"Bea\\" finds out where Bill is. Then, we see her arrive at the hotel to discover that her daughter is still alive. Although this was a wonderfully played out reunion between Mother & daughter it only leads us to a long drawn-out scene between Bea & Bill where Tarantino must have felt he needed to tie up all loose ends. This part really was almost anti-climatic. We wait through approximately 15 minutes of explaination to see approximately 10 seconds of the climatic fight. It was a just wee-bit disappointing, I'm sorry to say.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the movie. And like the first, it is strangely additive. I would recommend it.ting, I'm sorry to say. <br /> <br />Still, I enjoyed the movie. And like the first, it is strangely additive. I would recommend it.
B000002H6C|5.0|whoever did the review with the title \\"suicide music at its worst\\" has no idea what they are talking about. You also gave master of puppets 1 star, arguably the best metalllica album. Listen buddy, music is about passion, not style or anything else u can come up with in your tiny unintelligent head. You judge albums by anything but the music.In your review of master of puppets u stated, \\"What's so \\"complex\\" and \\"intellegent\\" about four greasy dirtballs with huge mullets singing 8 minute songs about death and destruction and darkness?\\" First of all, who gives a s*** if they have mullets and are greasy. Its about the music. And they write fabulous music. Second, metallica is one of the best bands at making 8 or 9 minute songs seem like 5 minutes. why? cuz they are just so dam good. Im sorry the song doesnt fit your 3 minute, attention span of a raisin, radio friendly crap but some bands actually write music they care about. They dont care how long the song is. Back in those days Metallica were angry, and they wrote about angry sh*t and they were good at it. It seems like these days they just try to be angry. It doesnt work. Oh yeah, btw, radiohead is unbelievable. Go back to your good charolette.

B00004TA41|5.0|\\"Interstellar Space\\" is one of the most challenging and interesting pieces ever recorded by John Coltrane-- a duet between Trane (on tenor and bells) and Rashied Ali (on drums), there is little here to hold onto in terms of conventional structure.  Additionally, Coltrane plays with such an intensity and fire that as soon as the theme statements are out of the way, his playing can be downright furious.  Ali is able to maintain a sensitive accompaniment, joining in the fury that Coltrane shows and occasionally keeping the recordings grounded enough to prevent them from feeling indulgent. <br /> <br />Opener \\"Mars\\" should be enough to show the fire and intensity that Coltrane plays with as he tests the dynamic range and potential of his instrument.  There is little regard for conventional harmonic structure and Trane pretty much goes to war with Ali.  Similar in feel is \\"Jupiter\\"-- took me a long time to be able to really get into this (and I *LOVE* free improv).  Coltrane springs loose, breaking the boundaries of the instrument, wailing, screaming, playing the sort of fast runs he was known for, \\"speaking in tongues\\", he really pulls out all the stops.  Whats amazing is that its the briefest piece on the album, yet probably covers the most ground. <br /> <br />One thing that often separates Coltrane from his less interesting contemporaries is his ability to express any number of moods-- \\"Venus\\" opens in nearly a ballad form, and while the improvisation proves to be the most challenging, in terms of lack of expected harmonic structure, there is a delicate beauty to the theme statement and his soloing is breathtaking in its range of sound and power.  Trane eventualy turns into a man possessed-- moving through two different simulataneous melodies, alternating between ranges of the instrument before bringing it back together.  Again, Ali's sympathetic accompaniment shows a nearly psychic bond had developed between these two men in the two years they played together, and when Coltrane seems to be drifting and reaching to the point of sacrificing the integrity of the piece, Ali holds steady and reels him in. <br /> <br />Likewise very much different in mood is the album closer, \\"Saturn\\".  A feature for Rasheid Ali, opens with a magnificent solo drum performance.  Ali shows the complexity of his playing, and in many ways is more conventional-- whereas he was very much texture oriented on the earlier tracks, there's a stronger rhythmic structure below his solo-- it doesn't have that off-beat feel, but its really something as he manages both inside and out.  When Trane does come in to state the theme, it is vaguely reminiscent of \\"India\\", but again, Coltrane uses this as a springboard, maintaining that sort of dense \\"India\\"-ish feel before moving into territory similar to his protege, Pharoah Sanders.  While somewhat more melodic than Sanders was at this point, its clear listening to this that the teacher learned from the student, and when the theme comes back in-- we get some nearly straight swing from both Coltrane and Ali that sounds totally brilliant and fits perfectly.  Absolutely stunning. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks that augment this CD are equal in quality of performance as the ones that proceed, but may have been left out because they offer even less for the listener to grab onto.  \\"Leo\\" (originally titled \\"The Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost\\" on \\"Meditations\\"), with its aggressive and somewhat brutal theme, and with only Ali supporting him, Coltrane takes off and never looks back, pushing into the corners of his instrument's potential.  Ali gets a feature in this as well, first with a brief solo and then trading with Coltrane-- both men play inspired and with a fire even beyond that of the remainder of the performance.  \\"Jupiter Variation\\" shows Coltrane exploring the extreme upper register of his instrument and he moves relentlessly between phrases, never stopping. <br /> <br />This album is essential, rewarding, difficult, and rqeuires patience as it has its own way and your ears need time to adjust.  It is, however, well worth the wait.
B00000IN5G|4.0|The dueling guitar/keyboard solo on 'Hatebreeder' itself is worth the money. Along with that, 'Warheart', 'Bed of Razors', 'Black Widow', and 'Downfall' are also ass-kicking songs.<br /><br />All it took for me to fall madly in love with this Finnish f_ckers was a sample off of Follow The Reaper's 'Hate Me!'. Been listening for three years and my only regrets are that I didn't find out about the Boys of Bodom sooner!

B0007XT7V8|5.0|Theory of a Deadman is definitely a band to keep your eye on. With their first single, Nothing Could Come Between Us, I was hooked on these guys. But if you have only heard Theory's singles played on the radio, you are missing out the best part of an amazing band. Although their singles are great songs, my favorites, and the best songs in my opinion, lie hidden in both of their cds. Their self-titled debut was quite a first CD, leaving their sophomore album a lot to top. After listening to Gasoline about 3 times since it came out yesterday, I am loving every bit of it. Tyler Connolly's vocals are stronger than before, and the lyrics accompanied with powerful guitar work makes this CD a must buy. You shouldn't compare these guys to Nickelback; you should compare Nickelback to Theory of a Deadman. Watch out Chad Kroeger, Tyler and the rest of Theory are coming to steal your spotlight!!!
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein has done it again. This, their latest album, has got to be one of the best, if not the cream of the crop. Who would've thought that a heavy metal band, and a German one no less, could pull off having an accordian in their music? Rammstein did it amazingly well. Not even Till Lindemann's (the lead singer) gutteral voice could throw off what the accordian adds to the songs. Every song is a masterpiece in itself. I especially like \\"Moskau.\\" It combines the regular heavy \\"rauccous\\" of the traditional metal band, but it also excellently combines a female vocalist--and she doesn't sing with the expected gutteral voice, nothing like Till. Check out the audio clips that Amazon offers for yourself. You'll see just how great this album is. If you love the band's other albums, then this is a must-have for your collection.
B000003TBP|5.0|When I think of this album, I think of the time my friend worked at a record shop and simply hooked me up. I remember this album and it brings back a lot of memories. Most of the songs are really good. Becks best by far.
B000005RU2|5.0|This is the only live document of Mark 2 Deep Purple you'll ever need.  The superb improvisational skills of each member of the band are constantly on display; these are long sprawling jams travelling at breakneck speed.  I can't even begin to describe how enjoyable this record is to listen to.  Sure, these songs are incredibly long but excess was what hard rock in the 1970s was all about.  Each band member shines here. <br /> <br />There is one thing about this package that is a little bit confusing, though.  Even though I do own the 25th Anniversary Edition, the edition I own contains remastered versions of the studio tracks played here live.  I have looked but I can't seem to find it.  That's a good thing, however.  I felt the studio tracks were somewhat unnecessary and detracted from the whole experience, anyway.  Buy this set now, especially because it doesn't have the annoying and somewhat superfluous remastered studio tracks. <br /> <br />What's the long and the short of all this, I hear you ask? It is that no self-respecting hard rock fan or Deep Purple fan should be without this set.  100% classic!
0887307280|4.0|I found it really useful. I have a Real Estate Business and have 2 employees. We all are sellers and I was a sort of Sales Manager, seller, director... <br />It was frustrating not having a record of the clients who called to the office in order to follow up their requirements, not to mension the fact of not knowing other seller's client's requirements and having several sheets of paper with data of the houses we were trying to sell in several desks in the office. <br />After doing something about the mess we had, starting to follow a system and given specific tasks and formats to fill now we are organized to work and a much better follow up of our clients. <br />The following step is to establish a broader system in order to be able to let the business running by itself, a business not requiring me stay here all day long. And, now after reading the book, I know how to do it. <br />The only thing I didn't think is right in this book is that Gerber assumes that a seller may follow a system, not necessarily caring about the feelings of clients, and yet be a good seller. <br />
0393312836|4.0|I have to admit, I had a hard time starting this book, mostly because of the Nadsat words.  It seemed like every other sentence contained a word that I didn't for the life of me know, so I would be flipping back and forth between the book and the glossary of Nadsat words that a friend was kind enough to send me, making an attempt to figure out the translations.<br /><br />Once I got past that, though, reading A Clockwork Orange was a piece of cake.  Written by novelist Anthony Burgess, A clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex deLarge, a young delinquent who, in the company of his three friends, gets his kicks by assaulting, robbing, and raping anyone that crosses his path, and who enjoys getting wasted at the Korova Milk Bar, an establishment in the boys' neighborhood.<br /><br />Things go wrong, however, when one of their victims is killed in the course of an assault.  Panicking, Alex's \\"droogs\\" flee the scene, leaving Alex to face the music all by himself.  Convicted of the charges against him, Alex faces a rather lengthy prison sentence until he is offered the chance to participate in an experimental aversion therapy program which strips him of any ability to enjoy the things he did before.<br /><br />Thrown out by his mum and dad, being chased by hordes of his  victims, and very nearly beaten to a pulp by two of his former droogs, Alex seeks shelter at a house that belongs to one of his victims, but the old man doesn't recognize who Alex is until Alex starts humming an old refrain from his delinquent days while talking a bath.  When the old man finally catches on, he begins to harass Alex with a piece of music that was once a favorite, but that Alex can't listen to anymore without getting sick.  Tormented by the old man, Alex jumps out the window of the guest bedroom in a vain effort to end it all.<br /><br />When he recovers consciousness, Alex finds himself in a hospital bed, with his parents looking worriedly at him. After a tearful reunion with them, Alex is next visited by a doctor who advises Alex that the aversion program has been shut down, and that he can bring Alex back to something approximating his \\"old self\\".  It is an offer which Alex happily accepts.<br /><br />One of the things I liked about this book is the fact that this particular release was published with the 21st chapter which, for reasons unknown, was previously left out of the original US release and was never portrayed in the movie.  This chapter chronicles a visit between Alex and one of his droogs, and it provides a rather nice ending to the story because Alex suddenly realizes he's no longer the delinquent he used to be, thanks to his own conscious decision to abandon his former life.  I don't have a clue why the original US edition was missing this final chapter, but it does wrap up the story very well.<br /><br />All in all, A Clockwork Orange is a very good book, once you get past the polyglot mixture of Nadsat Russian and various made-up words that are a staple of Alex and his droogs.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I watched this one yesterday. I don't know how it is compared to the book, because I have not read the book, but I think it was well done and I liked it about the same as the second one.
0743455967|5.0|Thank-you Mr. King for this great book. I've never been the type to read books period, but for my freshman composition couse we had to read your book and I fell in love with this book. You have given me an oppourtunity to become a writer, but now I will never stop reading. The way you tell your story of how you were determined to be a writer and all the obstacles that came your way, will open any young readers' mind like myself. Thank you for giving future writers a chance. I will enjoy reading every book you write. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ...
0440416027|4.0|I think that this book is a great book, it is very different from the ordinary children's story which elevates it. It reads easy and isn't difficult to understand for younger children, but if you study the depth to the allusions you can discover so many things which makes it good for older kids, and even adults. From Icarus to Persephone and the archeaopteryx to the great William Blake and the many quotes from his works this story really creates a whole new level to fantasy.
B00005R62N|4.0|I found this while looking to a replacement copy of HELLBENT FOR LEATHER, which I had lost a mere fifteen years earlier. That's the funny thing about growing older: somethings never get old. LIke this band. I remember 'out-growing' them for a while, but the sound they created during my teens never left me. <br /> <br /> This repackaging was orginally my 'stand-in' until i could find a new copy of HELLBENT FOR LEATHER. What I found was a better album than I remembered. The addition of live versions of 'Hellbent for Leather' and 'Delivering the Goods' was a wise choice, as both are phenomenal. The new production is clear and crisp. Gone are the muddy over dubs of the original. In fact, my only complaint is they didn't do a live version of 'Take on the World' for this album. But, that omission aside, I highly recommend this.
6304508611|1.0|I first saw Carrie over twenty years ago when I was a young boy. I considered the film to be wonderfully creepy, particularly the final sequence involving Amy Irving. I saw the film again a few weeks ago. All of the actors and actresses gave excellent performances. They are all very talented and to be commended. But I must confess that upon watching it a second time I found the film to be terribly depressing. Perhaps it is not the film itself . Maybe the fault lies within myself. I find that as I become older I wish for the old days when good would triumph over evil at the end of the horror movie. I might be somewhat naive. I grew up watching the Six Million Dollar Man, Batman, and Star Trek. But they were good role models.Today,we see so much terror and suffering in the daily news. I doubt that back in 1976 when this film was made people could have imagined that students would be walking into schools and committing the kinds of atrocities that took place in Columbine High School. Recently, there were similar shootings in Minnesota. I do think that part of the problem--but not all of it--lies with Hollywood. The movies are far too violent. Young people need to have heroes to look up to and emulate. They need to be taught that human beings have a tremendous capacity for good as well as evil. As I mentioned earlier, with regard to Carrie, the acting was flawless, but it is no longer possible for me to enjoy a film in which the main character is tormented so horribly. There is so much hatred in this film. It appeals to our most negative characteristics. The saddest part, I think, is that in taking revenge upon her classmates Carrie ultimately destroys her own soul.
B0000027EP|4.0|I remember when this came out. It was a real \\"turning of the page\\" for Motorhead. The production was crisper. The songs were better. The guitars fuller. Of course, Lemmy's voice has never been great, but it wasn't as rough this outing. <br /> <br /> Many metal-heads hate this album because it's not just in your face, screaming guitar-fare. This has more depth than that. Oh, there's are plenty of rockers here (I'll Sing the Blues and Going to Brazil are real standouts), but there's more. The Ramones tribute song (R.A.M.O.N.E.S) is fun and the best non-Ramones Romones song. And the title track is quite moving. Lemmy's normally offensive voice manages to lend more to the ballad here than detract from it, as if it helps to paint the brutal story of the song. <br /> <br /> So, do yourself a favor and buy this one.
B000062XGD|5.0|I have been a huge Tom Hanks fan for many years and I have seen many of his movies, but I rate \\"Cast Away\\" as one of the best films he has ever made.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive. <br /> <br />Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee, and Helen Hunt stars as Kelly, Chuck's fiancee.  On Christmas Eve, Chuck is scheduled to fly to the Far East on FedEx business, but while in flight, the plane encounters a terrible storm and they are forced to deviate from their original flight plan.  This course change takes them over 400 miles off course.  Even with the coruse change, the storm is still raging, and soon, the plane, damaged greatly by the effects of the storm, plunges into the Pacific Ocean.  Chuck is the only survivor. <br /> <br />For the next four years, Chuck is forced to struggle to survive on a deserted island far away from any shipping lanes or air routes.  He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.  Naming the volleyball \\"Wilson\\", it becomes a companion for Chuck, who uses it to converse with and vent frustration.  Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.  With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.  After drifting for over 500 miles, Chuck is finally picked up by a ship and returned to civilization. <br /> <br />Upon returning home, he realizes that much of his former life has changed.  He is told that his fellow FedEx employees held a funeral for him when they thought he was dead, and his former fiancee Kelly is now married to another man and has a child of her own.  Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be togetherafter so much had happened to both of them. <br /> <br />The ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.  It shows Chuck standing in a crossroads trying to decide which direction to go.  He is also probably trying to decide which direction to take with his life as well. <br /> <br />This is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.  The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.  Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.  It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.  I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.  Other symbolic things in the movie included Chuck casually lighting a lighter and remembering his struggles trying to make fire, and picking up a crab leg and then immediately putting it back down after eating them for so long. <br /> <br />I give this movie my absolute highest recommendation.  Tom Hanks is excellent and the story is terrific.  Watch and see how one man's courage and will to live conquer all obstacles.
B00006LJ72|2.0|The music in this box set is wonderfull, and the artwork is delightful. That's very well ... BUT ... the arrangement of the music is completely senseless, there's 4 discs here, where they could've had it all and more on 3 discs! <br /> <br /> <br />What they SHOULD have done was to take the old 'Box Of Dreams' set, and then add a couple of songs on each disc to make it up-to-date and more complete. Personally, I think they should have done something like this: <br /> <br /> <br />Disc 1: 'Oceans' ... Orinoco Flow, Caribbean Blue, Book Of Days, Anywhere Is, Only If, The Celts, Cursum Perficium, I Want Tomorrow, China Roses, Storms In Africa, Pax Deorum, The Longships, Ebudae, One My Way Home, Boadicea. <br /> <br />Now fill in in appropriate places: The Triad (from The Celts), Wild Child, Only Time, Flora's Secret and Lazy Days (from A Day Without Rain). <br /> <br /> <br />Disc 2: Clouds ... Watermark, Portrait (Out of the Blue), Miss Claire Remembers, Shepherd Moons, March Of The Celts, Lothlrien, From Where I Am, Afer Ventus, Oriel Window, River, Tea-House Moon, Willows On The Water, Morning Glory, No Holly For Miss Quinn, The Memory Of Trees. <br /> <br />And fill in in appropriate places: Fairytale, Bard Dance (from The Celts), A Day Without Rain, The First Of Autumn and Isobella. <br /> <br /> <br />Disc 3: Stars ... Evening Falls, Paint The Sky With Stars, Angeles, Athair Ar Neainh, La Soadora, Aldebaran, Deireadh An Tuath, Eclipse, Exile, On Your Shore, Evacuee, Marble Halls, Hope Has A Place, The Sun In The Stream, Na Laetha Geal M'ige, Smaointe. <br /> <br />And fill in in appropriate places with Once You Had Gold (from The Memory Of Trees), How Can I Keep From Singing (from Shepherd Moons), May It Be (from The Lord Of The Rings soundtrack) and Lullaby (Song Of The Sandmen). They could throw in the Oiche Chiun video as an extra if they wanted. <br /> <br /> <br />This would give a 3-disc set with each 20 songs, seperated in themes like the original Box Of Dreams to ensure a good flow of the music. It would be much more complete than the present collection [in fact it would contain all the songs from her triad of masterpieces: Watermark, Shepherd Moons and The Memory Of Trees amd compliment with highlights from The Celts and A Day Without Rain along with a couple of B-sides and none-album material]. Also, it would be much more enjoyable musically than what they've come up with here. For me, this seems more like an opportunity to do something really great, which they just threw away, and instead they charge the fans a lot of money for a mediocre collection, that in fact offers nothing to the collection of normal CDs.
B0002V7ODI|2.0|I watched Hellboy with this preconception that it was probably going to be bad. I mean, the title, and the name of the main character, was pretty bad already. \\"Hellboy\\"? I haven't read the comics, but it sounds like the name of a comedic character who tries to be scary but is frequently the victim of his own clumsiness, perhaps tripping on his own cape, much to the amusement of his peers. But from the trailer, it looks like this movie wanted to take itself seriously. During the opening sequence, when the soldiers first find Hellboy and exclaim \\"It's a boy!\\", it felt like they were just trying too hard to justify the name.<br /><br />The stories has something to do with nazis using the occult, a sect of which is still active today. Hellboy is an agent for a branch of the FBI specifically designed to defend against \\"paranormal\\" attacks. The story feels like there's a lot of loose ends, and deus ex machina are applied liberally through the plot. Hellboy ponders with a psychic fish-slash-C3P0 hybrid and a pyrokinetic girl about the treatment of \\"freaks\\" on earth, implying that there might be others like them, but we never find out if the three truly are unique, or if, like in the X-Men universe, mutants are actually quite common. At the beginning of the film, it's quite clearly stated that when the \\"ressurection-monster\\" is killed, two more are born, and indeed, this is what happens through most of the film. But during the climax, when perhaps a dozen of these monsters have now been spawned into existence thanks to Hellboy's constant slaying, this time, when they are killed, they stay dead. When Hellboy's partner, John, is chained up, and Hellboy is forced to open the gates to hell, John waits until the last minute to slip out of his handcuffs, kill the guard, and save Hellboy. Why didn't he just do this from the start, and save Hellboy from the torment he was put through as he opened the gates? Very unsatisfying, plotwise.<br /><br />The graphics, on the other hand, were generally well done, though when live actor Hellboy and the the computer-generated Hellboy were visibly different shades of red. The fight scenes have a nice DragonBall feel to them (minus the projectiles and the flying), with lots of impact craters from when the characters are thrown. However, the fights don't feel as dramatic as they might have, because it seems that for all intents and purpose, Hellboy is completely invulnerable to high grade explosives, getting run over by trains, fire, electricity, samurai-sharp blades, and so on. In fact, the only time in which Hellboy is actually in danger of being physically defeated is by some sort of biochemical attack near the beginning of the movie, a strategy which his foe never uses again. This might have worked if the movie focused on emotional or psychological conflict, but really all of Hellboy's obstacles could be solved by pounding his fists into them.<br /><br />Music was not noticeable, except when it was overdone. There was a theme featuring stringed instruments that came up whenever we were supposed to feel some sense of sentimentality for Hellboy. But again, as it's always completely obvious that Hellboy will win every trial thrown at him in this beat-em-up plot, the music just made me roll my eyes. The worst offender was the scene in which Hellboy tells his girlfriend he would have cross over from life to death to bring her back, obviously an empty promise, given that he's completely invulnerable!, were generally well done, though when live actor Hellboy and the the computer-generated Hellboy were visibly different shades of red.

0140186409|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly a masterpiece of American fiction.  Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California.  Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.<br /><br />The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California.  Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road.  He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land.  He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.<br /><br />Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had.  The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down.  Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them.  And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet.

You will not regret it.
B0007OCG56|5.0|If you were like me and just thought Adam Sandler was only good for romantic comedies, this movie will make you rethink everything!  He was exquisite in this witty, sweet and thought-provoking picture.  To me this movie was about the unappreciated members in families that do all the work at keeping it together.  Two characters find solace and some much needed appreciation from each other.  It really makes you aware of the hard work families can be, but how much it is worth it, when you put forth the effort.  There's a point in the movie where these two characters share this wonderful moment with each other, and it became apparent to me that that's all life is, a series of moments that help to define who you are.  This was an absolutely excellent movie and I highly recommend you enjoy the experience!
B000001Y9I|5.0|I Like this release as well as anything the band this thru out their 35 year career.  All the songs are brillant.  I especially like Hey Cisco, Ted the Mechanic, Somebody Stole My Guitar, Cascades: I'm Not Your Lover,....... Heck I like them all, Ok how about this....... if I had to be hyper critical and choose a  worst song it would be Purpendicular Waltz because it drags just a little bit and still it would have been a high point  on Battle Rages On.  You know God Bless Ritchie Blackmore but let it be said IMHO that Steve Morse saved this super group's creativity.
B00004XONN|2.0|\\"Radiohead proved they can play what they want; will they now go back to their old stuff?\\" <br /> <br />  I like Radiohead. They had a very interesting debut with \\"Pablo Honey\\", made a pop masterpiece with \\"The bends\\", and reminded us all of why Pink Floyd used to be cool with the excellent \\"OK computer\\". It's interesting that every record sounds different from the previous one, except, perhaps, the first two ones, but that's irrelevant: we all came to expect quality music from Radiohead.  <br /> <br />  Thing is, \\"Kid A\\" has quality: quality production, quality sounds and even quality artwork. They just missed the quality songs. The album is too self indulgent, to the point it becomes annoying. Besides the opening track, \\"Everything in it's right place\\" (and, to a lesser extent, \\" The national anthem\\") it's almost cacophonous: there's layer over layer of, on a first listen, atractive sounds but they end up leading nowhere. It doesn't work as rock, it doesn't work as electronic and it certainly doesn't work as experimental. You keep waiting for the tracks to add up to something, yet they rarely do. It ends up burning you out after a few listens, instead of dragging you in. <br /> <br />  That this album is claimed by so many people to be their best is mind boggling for me. If you liked their previous three albums, i don't think you'll be able to dig into this one, even if you're wanting to. Now, if you like the sound but think, like me, that the songs just don't cut it, get \\"Amnesiac\\". The opening track alone in that record is better than anything in \\"Kid A\\", and proves that Radiohead didn't forgot to write songs while learning synths. It's a much better record - i don't know why so many people love to trash that album. \\"Amnesiac\\" is the record that \\"Kid A\\" should have been all along.
B000002L1L|2.0|Anya , Battle Rages and Solitaire  are very good songs.  The rest of this album was really a disappointment for me as a fanatical Deep Purple fan.   I honestly to this day listen to (the generally poorly received) Slaves and Masters more often.  To my ears it sounded like a group who rushed to get the Cd out prematurely.  In fact, songs like Lick it Up,  One Man's Meat. and Talk About Love Reminded me of reject songs off Ian Gillan's solo LP Naked Thunder.
0062502182|5.0|The book is a fable about shepperd Santiago, his travels, adventures, observations and lessons along the journey.  The book is simple, is an easy read but is full of seemingly straightforward but profound lessons about life including:  <br /> <br />- Our purpose in life is to achieve our dreams <br />- When we want to do something, the universe conspires to help us achieve this <br />- Always listen to what your heart has to tell you, there are no co-incidences <br />- Treasure lies where your heart belongs <br />- You will never be happy until you reach your dreams / goal <br />- If someone truly loves you, they will wait for you to achieve your dream <br /> <br />This is a truly thought provoking book as it forces one to think about whether one is pursuing one's dreams or simply drifting.  Those who do not with to chase their dreams are destined to an unfulfilled and somewhat empty life of `would have, could have, should have'.  <br /> <br />What is also interesting are the parallels one could of the characters in the book to one's we may know in everyday life.  The character of the rich merchant who sells crystals and dreams of traveling while never daring to do so is not difficult to find, for instance.  <br /> <br />While relatively simple, this book is a classic and deserves 5 stars for providing insightful lessons and stirring me into action.  Read it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I don't care how Christina Aguilera dresses; I don't care how she acts. I don't care about all that. I just know that girl can sing. She is so, so talented. I love the song walk away, cruz... I loved the whole album. I think it's just amazing, amazing vocals, very pleasant. I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br />People keep emphasising on how she's sexually explicit and all that, but that shouldn't really matter. That's who she is and how she wants to be. Who are you to judge? She's a singer; you should solely judge her on that and her stage presence. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's not Britney Spears - don't ever compare her to Spears. Aguilera is very talented. She knows how to sing. <br />She's truly an artist, and I respect that. Keep doing what you're doing, Aguilera.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|This is the same formula used by bands like the Rapture and Radio 4 from a couple of years ago.There's nothing new to their sound. They just arrived too late. <br />You can't really rock nor dance...the cd just goes from one song to another without making it easy to follow a pattern. It would be better if you buy 2 good records separetely; one pure electro/dance and one pure rock.
B0002858YS|5.0|For those of you with reviews that they are wolf in sheeps clothing need to get your head out of the dirt. <br /> <br />Firstly, remember when Green Day first came out? And how heavily English his voice sounded? Did anybody comment then? I don't think so.  <br /> <br />Secondly, at least give these boys a chance. Obviously somebody likes them if they are getting airplay on the radio. <br /> <br />This is a solid album, I have listened and listened and I can't get tired of it. Mr Brightside for example has formed a pimple on my psyche and I don't think I want it to go away. Find the acoustic version of that song, and you'll see that regardless of how Brandon sounds on the album he CAN really sing. It's not just some quick dubbing. <br /> <br />Please, buy this album. You won't be sorry.
B00026W82U|5.0|It's just shocking how this music gets deeper inside you with every play.  <br />I consider it to be a perfect album for a Sunday afternoon accompanied by your girlfriend and a bottle of wine. So European! <br />The back vocals on a couple of songs by Feist complete the baby rocking material. <br />Romantic, mellow and breathtaking are the best adjectives I can find to describe Riot on an empty street.
0790729628|1.0|Harrison Ford becomes a screen legend off of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and then he does this futuristic toilet of a movie. The story didn't make any sense and it was just a bad movie, you shouldn't combine film noir with sc-fi, no Maltese Falcon with the Jetsons, or it just didn't work with this movie. Ridley Scott directs great films like Gladiator and Alien,then directs this wasteland of a flick that shouldn't be apart of the future with or without flying cars. any one who think this is better than Star Wars than get the hell off Amazon. Hollywood Homocide might treat you to better Harrison Ford films. If you want good futuristic movies rent Minority Report or I, Robot. Make a better future by getting rid of  \\"BAD RUNNER\\" Harrison, don't think less of you because this crap you did.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Ohh when you listen to this album! <br />It starts as fast as you can handle and it continues on that lane almost through the whole thing. Punk rock at its most crazy and wild spectrum.  <br />Lyrics were written definitely under drugs influence, and they are so challenging that you feel compelled to sing them, trying not to get breathless. <br />Master pieces are: <br />Arcarsenal <br />Pattern Against User <br />One Armed Scissor <br />Invalid Litter Dept. <br />Rolodex Propaganda <br />Cosmonaut <br />Warning!! It can put you in a breaking stuff mood! <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|Very simplistic, yet they pull it off with flying colors.  Very few bands can do what Keane has accomplished.  They use few frills, no bells and whistles, but the music touches your soul without boring you to death.  Keane has done what is probably the hardest thing to do do in the music business: make great simple music.  The subtle things Keane does is where the genius lies: the \\"archaic\\" use of a piano, the timing and articulation of the vocals, and the magic behind their heartfelt writing.  They seem too young to be able to express emotions the way they do through music.  They seem like young Walt Whitmans.  Two roads diverged in the woods and I took the one traveled by Keane.  Most of the time sappy, sentimental music is painfully boring, but Keane is a much needed exception to the rule.  The best way to describe Keane: poets with instruments. <br /> <br />I used to think the vocals should be more refined.  But when I listened to it again, the pitchy spots set up the times when the notes are truly nailed.  The singer seems to be making an emotional journey and when he finds his emotional sweet spot he holds on for all its worth with a very pure sounding note.  Pretty smart: sad or agitated times sound stressed while times of hope or recognition sound beautiful.  Everybody's Changing & Somewhere Only We Know are great examples.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Now QOTSA, is pure Homme, just Homme and nothing but Homme but im certain that QOTSA have been Homme since the genesis of the band and that collaborations from Olivieri and Lanegan and Grohl have just provided interesting elements to the music recorded in previous albums but \\"the Queens\\" basic element is definitelly Homme and this time \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is the chance he have to prove that and he have done just fine, maybe not in the amazing way we knew before but fine, very enjoyable cuts we can appreciate here, \\"burn the witch\\" ,\\"Everybody Knows That You Are Insane\\" and of course \\"Little Sister\\", it just worths the money spent for this cd, maybe for the next record Homme should recruit the formula included in \\"Songs for the deaf\\" and the result as we already know will be even better <br />HM     <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|All of your recent albums sound like bad attempts to recreate what you did in the 80's and early 90's.  Please come up with something new.  The few songs that do have uniqueness are hardly songs.  Vertigo is a great example of this.  It is nothing more than catchy sounds compiled together.  Is it me or has anybody else noticed that much of U2's \\"music\\" has a disconnected, unfinished sound.  U2 has lost the art of bridging.  They have a Bob Dylan like meandering sound that posseses one quality: forgetful.  No offense intended to Bob Dylan.  He is the king of meandering, but he does it well.  The slower more emotional songs are boring unashamed filler.  U2's songs are either a bunch of hooks compiled together, or bad songs with no hooks.  <br /> <br />U2 is clearly riding the wave of their past on the backs of misguided, dare I say stupid, loyal fans.  Do the right thing and donate the money you make off of this crap to charities.  The money is dirty. <br /> <br />You want some real music: Keane, Scissor Sisters, The Killers, Maroon 5.  Even though you might not like the genre or syle of the mentioned artists, they all nail their specific niche with uniqueness and good song writing.
B000089CJI|4.0|Some might disagree, but if you take a typical Daft Punk track (something like \\"Around the World\\"), slow it down a bit, take some beats out, and add more lyrics, you basically get this.<br /><br />The guys' use of synths is excellent, especially when it's used against minimal beats and other sounds. In fact, the entire production is neither sub-par nor over the top; they found the middle ground that I find satisfying.<br /><br />There are some tracks that falls just a tad bit short of my, expectations, if you will. Even so, these tracks are HIGHLY tolerable.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are (in no particular order):<br /><br />-The District Sleeps Alone Tonight<br /><br />-Such Great Heights<br /><br />-We Will Become Silhouettes<br /><br />-Recycled Air<br /><br />-Brand New Colony<br /><br />There. That's half.<br /><br />Basically, this is the kind of album you'd probably like to listen to during a night drive. Me, I like to dim the lights, play the CD, and just listen.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|For those who enjoy excellent Irish/Gaelic music this CD is the new benchmark!  As a rabid NCAA basketball tournament fan it takes something special to drag me away from a key game on TV.  The PBS Celtic Woman special did it. Our local PBS station ran it up against the tournament, smart move. I could not look away. These women sing with such dignity and a vocal quality that approaches supernatural! And as we say, they are quite \\"easy on the eyes\\".    What instantly drove me to purchase the CD was Chloe Agnew's rendition of \\"Walking in the Air\\".  It is as beautiful a song as I've ever heard. As an Aerial Photographer I would say this song describes EXACTLY what I see every flight!  \\"...The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams...\\"  To say it had a profound impact is an understatement.    The appropriate superlatives for this CD have not been defined in our language. If I could give it six stars I would.    The Celtic Woman American tour this summer will sell out in many cities. I'll definitely be in the St. Louis audience!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling is with out a doubt 5 Stars.What can I say London Calling is personaly my favorate cd of all time. If you dont have it you must get it as soon as possibble.You wont be dissapointed, all of its songs are Five stars. <br /> <br />   ps the following bands arent worthy of being compared to The Clash: good charlete (fags) , blink 182 (fags), and Linkin park (fags)                THANKS FOR CHECKING MY REVIEW <br />                           THE CLASH ROCKS!!!
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is incredible! I heard of John Legend because I picked up the &quot;Hitch&quot; soundtrack and his cover for &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing&quot; captured my attention. His CD begins with a 44 second prelude that leads nicely to his first song &quot;Let's Get Lifted&quot; - this song is wicked! I love almost every track on this CD. I really enjoy how his different styles come out in each song and the addition of Snoop and Kanye on two tracks make &quot;Get Lifted&quot; THAT much more. My favourite song is &quot;Ordinary People&quot; - when I heard it for the first time my attention was completely taken away from the textbook I was studying. That song's been on repeat ever since! &quot;Get Lifted&quot; is absolutely amazing!
076790592X|4.0|In the book Tuesdays With Morrie, Mitch Albom uses 1st person narration.  Albom himself serves as the narrator.  The author has a distinct writing style.  He doesn't use exceptionally descriptive words, but the dialogue in the story gives a good picture of the characters and what is going on in the story. The authors word choice affects me as a reader because the simplicity of it makes it easier to read and not tedious. The author writes the dialogue very convincingly because the things said were actually said in real life. In the book there is a lot of dialogue between the narrator and Morrie. Narration is used, but it isn't as important as the dialogue, in which most of the information is revealed. <br /> <br />     The main theme of the book is even when in the last months of your life, you can experience happiness by enjoying the little things about life that are put aside normally. It made me think about the simpler things in life that Morrie had then appreciated and that how we should slow down and take advantage of the little things. The book was somewhat depressing because it describes Morrie's death. I liked the tie-ins to current day events. People who are looking for a fun, fluffy read should look for a different book. If the reader is looking for a meaningful, deep book, they should read this <br />
B0008JFMFQ|5.0|The story of \\"Hero\\" mirrors that of the Kurusawa classic \\"Rashomon,\\" whereby the \\"same\\" tale is told differently every time it's narrated.  The plot basically revolves around the deaths of three assassins who are determined to murder the king of Qin (pronounced \\"chin\\"), a powerful kingdom that is to unite China eventually.  The nameless hero, played by Jet Li, claims to have killed all three, and proceeds to present his story to the Qin king.  When the king discovers some discrepancies in the hero's story, the hero changes the story.  Finally, the king presents his own version of the events.<br /><br />The plot is more or less a ploy to present some beautiful and powerful scenes and doesn't quite stand on its own, esp. since it more or less copies the Rashomon formula.  But the film is, to repeat myself, both beautiful and powerful.  The kung-fu moves are dance-like as in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\\" but with more energy and more precision.  The hero is almost like Superman; whereas Superman is kind of cute, the hero here is all business, very professional, yet you can't help but feel some sympathy for his plight.  The arrow scenes are very carefully designed and leave the audience breathless.  The filmmakers employed thousands of extras (as opposed to using computer graphics) for the invasion scenes, which are again impressive.<br /><br />Hero breaks no new grounds in filmmaking, but it does a terrific visual job.  Underneath all its beauty and overwhelmingness is a story of faith and betrayal.<br /><br />I'll update this with specifics of the UMD version after I receive my pre-order for my PSP.
1592400876|4.0|Having studied English in college, I've always been a stickler for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. But I still learned quite a lot about punctuation from Truss' book, and had fun along the way. The author covers every kind of punctuation sprinkled liberally with examples of correct and incorrect usage. She also inserts humor every now and then, which is part of the reason why a book about punctuation has been such a hit. If you're a punctuation nut, this book is for you. But if you don't get too upset by misuse of punctuation, you might as well skip this one.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|First off, if you don't like movies filled with dialogue and no action stay clear of this one. Most of the film is just four characters talking to each other throughout the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. I thought this kind of film would bore me to tears, but thankfully most of the dialogue was clever and the acting really made this film shine. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were pretty good, but innocent looking Natalie Portman was great in her first mature performance. Clive Owen is what made this movie for me. He is probably best know for his recent film \\"King Arthur\\" and will be seen in \\"Sin City\\" coming out this Friday. He deserved the Oscar he was nominated for in my opinion (but I'm glad Morgan Freeman finally got one). I like the way he just takes apart Jude Law at the end, reducing him to tears and leaving in defeat. Didn't think I would like this one, but I am happy to say that it is worthy of a rental next time you are in the mood for a relationship/betrayal drama.
B0000028M7|4.0|hmmm...it's funny, I remember absolutely loving this album. This album got a 5/5 when I was younger. I loved it. I still love some of it, but after listening to this and Alice in Chains back to back over and over again, I find their self titled album to be the album most filled with everything I love about this band. Unlike most bands, this band were perfectly capable of acheiving perfection, which I believe they did on Alice in Chains (the album). This album still rules though. The songs are mostly very heavy, very solid, very well produced, and repetitive. Being repetitive without being boring isn't an easy task. Alice in Chains knew this and worked hard to master it. At their best, they wrote great riffs with enough hypnotic atmosphere and amazing vocal/guitar harmonies and feedback and wah-wah peddels to keep me very entertained and impressed. \\"Rain When I Die\\", for example, sports a guitar riff that would be easily forgetable if the bassline and vocal medody weren't so kick-ass. Delicious interplay between instruments is something that Alice in Chains were very good at. The riffs on this album are mostly good, but \\"Sickman\\" has a pretty weak riff with no saving grace except for the great chorus and the prog part at the end. \\"Dirt\\" has a cool riff, but it is too repetitive and the itself song is kinda bland because it gets bogged down. \\"Hate to Feel\\" has some interesting guitar and bass interplay, but some of the riffs and transitions in it are a little awkward-sounding. Every other song is amazing. My favorite songs on the album are tracks 1-4 and the last two songs, (\\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would\\").
6302508878|5.0|Viewed in context, King Kong points to what would (for better or worse [mostly worse]) become the American cinema's ability to create visual marvels that appeal to the lower brain. It is no mistake that the American showman (Carl Denham) exploits the giant ape for a dollar and then regrets the destruction of his shallow idealism along with his enslaved show piece.  Then the sentimental fool has the audacity to wax poetic at the end.  This is the American drama.  Superficial American idealism proves to be exploitive and destructive.  It's as true now as it was then. What has changed?  We were blind then and we are even more blind now. Absolutely brilliant allegory.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is one of those movies that will touch in you in that special kind of way.  Don't take that in a way I didn't mean it, like a pervert way because that's not how I meant it.  It will touch you though, in that special kind of way.
B000687M48|1.0|UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Nothing worse then bands that suck Live!!!!!  Good live bands are...Nickelback, Theory of a deadman, incubus, cypress hill, linkinpark.  nickelback is a great live show!!!
B0001CLGFK|1.0|This movie holds an esteemed place in my family's memory.  It is known as the worst movie we have ever seen.  We saw it probably around 1981 or so and nothing has beat it since.  Nothing happens - we don't belong to the culture that believes dark nothingness is meaningful.  It is boring, unrelieved nothingness.  Occasionally we recommend it to enemies. We want them to wonder what WE know that no one else does.  The answer, nothing.  We are not pretentious idiots.  Really.
B0007P3582|1.0|I'll break it down like this: <br />Power of the Dollar - Good <br />Get Rich or Die Tryin - Great <br />Massacre - Terrible <br /> <br />The industry has really gotten to 50 Cent, and because he's not smart enough to come up with his own lyrics anymore, he writes and performs what the execs tell him to, and it shows on this CD.  He must have completely run out of material and street cred.  In My Hood is the only respectable rap song on the album.  Disco Inferno and Candy Shop are great for dancing, but are a far cry from the artform that Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five brought to the masses.  On top of this lack of cred, there's the song Piggy Bank.  This song ruined any chance the album had to be good.  Its beat and lyrics are terrible.  Dead Prez would be ashamed that a fellow musician could stoop to this level.  All in all, I think 50 Cent needs to step back from the bright lights of fame, remember how many times he has been shot at, and think about where he came from before he makes another CD.  I'm just glad I downloaded this CD and didn't buy it, because it's a disgrace to the art.
0399230033|5.0|What an awesome, simple story for young children.  My sons love the black page with just the zookeeper's wife's eyes.  If I start this book with one son, the other comes running over as soon as I say, \\"Goodnight, Gorilla\\".  They can't get enough of it.  This one never gets rotated out of our book bin. <br /> <br />They have learned so much vocabulary from this story even though it is far from being word intensive.  They point out the keys, moon, balloon, banana, zookeeper's shirt and the flashlight on all of the pages.  Just today, one of my sons pointed out his own shirt after I labeled the zoopkeeper's. <br /> <br />Use this book with older siblings too!  I am a teacher too and would use this for children who have trouble writing.  So many times students won't write because they don't have a story in mind.  Show them the book.  The story structure is there, just have the students add the text.  I have done it with other books and the technique works wonders.     <br /> <br />Hooray, Peggy Rathmann!  Keep the good books coming.

B00006F2TV|4.0|'Spider-Man' does a fine job of introducing our web slinging hero as well as the character of Peter Parker.  Tobey Maguire captures Peter's personality well, in that he is able to convey his insecurities and helplessness in the beginning of the film.  He also does an excellent job of showing Peter's newly found confidence thanks to his new superpowers. <br /> <br />As for Willem Dafoe, he too does an excellent job as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin.  His wicked laugh hits the character's behavior right on and Dafoe simply lights up the screen. <br /> <br />Other than a few necessary inaccuracies (i.e. natural web shooting without Parker's self made web shooters), the movie stays true to the comic book both in its plot and in its character portrayal. <br /> <br />Finally, the ending does the movie justice and sets up for an exciting sequel. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Good movie, worth buying the DVD.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I just finished watching this film and the entire time I watched it, I felt captivated.  This film amazed me by how real it seemed.  I didn't feel like I was watching Hollywood actors act out a stylized version of how relationships work or \\"should work.\\"  I felt as if I was peeking in on fights between couples as they actually happen: raw, mean, full of censure and interrogation.  I also think that Natalie Portman did a great acting job as this is definitely not a typical role for her.   <br />As far as the R rating goes, there is very little violence, but the movie deals a lot with sex in many different ways including a strip club and a stripper as a main character. <br />I would definitely reccommend this movie for people 18 and over as it deals with love and relationships that may not resonate with anyone younger. <br />
0316776963|5.0|My favorite author is Tom Robbins and now I have a new favorite who writes at the opposite end of the spectrum.  With Robbins, we get heady, complicated extraordinary characters. With Sedaris and \\"Talk Pretty,\\" it's a vignette of that day in his life and it's terribly real, believable and every night in bed as I read, I was promised a laugh. Twice I had to quit reading because I was laughing out-of-control and my tummy hurt.  What a superb writer - [he] can drift through his day, his family, his work, his travels and just rock your socks with humor.  The narrator does not seem \\"straight\\" if I'm now using the word to describe sexuality.  What is pleasant, that's not the crux or heartbreak of his book.  Gender preference is just that, a small aspect of his family life, which is how it should be in societies.  And as I have struggled all my life trying to learn other langugages, I marveled at how well he did with French.  This man has a following in many areas.  Buy the book, you won't regret.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Wow, this was almost as bad as Punch Drunk Love!  Seriously, I watched this movie waiting and waiting and waiting for it to get better.  It was one of those movies where you don't want to turn it off because SOMETHING has to happen...but, alas, it doesn't.  I recommend that you stay clear of this movie and get something with substance.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|When the CD came out of the original stage show I bought it and have listened to it countless times. I saw a stage production in Toronto in '93 which was a Phantom 'fix' and have waited and waited for the movie. When it finally came to my small town I saw it three times in the two weeks it played. The first time was just overwhelming. When the first organ chords boomed out I thought I would burst into tears. The opening when the scene segues from present to past was stunning. Words are puny to describe everything I felt thoughout the whole movie. I cried everytime the Phantom said \\"Christine\\" just as I always do listening to Michael Crawford. It is so wonderful and much as I would have loved to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, this new cast does a terrific job. They must have felt the pressure of not being the originals. I've bought a larger screen TV, and am looking for a DVD player, all because of the Phantom. Until the DVD comes out, I listen to my CD in the car with tears streaming down my face.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Thank you, Mike Nichols.  For putting out an adult, absorbing, brutally realistic film about the capriciousness of human nature.  You may not like what you see, you may not even like any of the characters, but for anyone who has been through the agonies, insecurities and uncertainties of relationships, they will recognize many of the myriad facets as such portrayed in this film. Of course this movie was only a mild success; it's too unflinching, too in-your-face for most of the masses to endure. For once, the sexual dynamics in a film make sense; most of the time, sex portrayed in films is really idiotic, because the strain of movie stars schticking their way through such scenarios is obvious, rarely credible, always ponderous. Here, though, people act and talk with a frankness that mirrors reality. The dialogue, explicit, often crude, sometimes bittersweet-funny as it is, seems to have been culled from the minds and mouths of real people.  Nichols isn't afraid to expose the the vulnerabilities and fears that exist in human nature, and it is gratifying that some directors still exist who provide thought-provoking, intensely stimulating movies such as this is.<br /><br />  This may be one of Julia Roberts' best performances. For it places her in a new realm, that of an evolving actress capable of rising to complex material and responding superbly well to the situations and to Nichols'compact direction. Her well-known traits are kept under check here, and brings to the surface a far more interesting, multi-faceted persona. She seems more real, more human than ever.<br /><br />  Natalie Portman matches Roberts in every way, and she gives the most scary element in the film. You're never sure where she or her character is going to take you, and propagates the kind of fears that will strike terror in vulnerable men.<br /><br />  Jude Law also reaches new dimensions. He has a wonderfully expressive face, and he reveals, quite spontaneously, skillfully, the torments his character suffers.<br /><br />  Clive Owen gives a real star turn here, and in fact dominates the film. Owen adroitly portrays a man driven by his raging hormones, and better still, disdains to apologize for it. More than any male character I've ever seen portrayed, he is exactly who he is; Larry calls himself a \\"caveman\\" to Roberts' character, but he also shows that his love for her is genuine. Owen is at his most effective during his big scene with Roberts, when she tells him of her unfaithfulness and she intends to leave.  Owen's face crumpling into heartbroken pain is entirely believable, and cuts through to the viewer; you feel his pain acutely, while reviling him on another level. Owen is not only a brilliant actor, but is devastatingly magnetic and appealing; he is the perfect embodiment of the professionally and sexually driven contemporary man.<br /><br />Nichols and these actors make for a movie that you can't soon forget. It forces people to delve into interpersonal complexities that exist, but which are rarely portrayed.rs.  <br />  Clive Owen gives a real star turn here, and in fact dominates the film.

Time for him to put the mic down, go to school and get his diploma first! I am soooo disappointed in this cd, i'm not even going to sell it to someone else to listen to it. As a matter of fact,......., did you here the crack, that actually was the actual cd. No, I really broke it!
068987474X|2.0|First of all, let me say that the premise of this book is, of course, completely true.  That said, this book complete garbage.  It's nothing but a series of *fake* letters written to the authors and the same stupid advice, the same stupid line, repeated over and over and over again.  It's like reading all 2000 pages Marx's 'Das Kapital' only more boring. <br /> <br />I kept seeing this book all over the place, everywhere I went.  Finally one day, I was helping a friend of mine take one of her girlfriends home and I saw it on her girlfriend's shelf.  I asked my friend, \\"Jees, does every single girl in America have a copy of this book?\\"  To which she replies, \\"Yes and I'll lend you mine when I get home if you want to read it.\\"  So I did.  It took me all of 30 minutes, but it was the most mind numbing 30 minutes ever.  I couldn't believe it retails for $20.  Maybe as a guy, I'm just taking it all for granted.  However, know you can pretty much get all you need to know from reading the title right here and save yourself $20. <br /> <br />I really need to write my own bestseller using this proven formula. <br /> <br />1. Take a concept that is largely self-evident, but that people sometimes ignore. <br />2. Boil that concept down into a pithy, easy to say catch phrase. <br />3. Write down a thousand completely identical varations on that phrase. <br />4. Go on lecture circut and buy a house in Maui. <br /> <br />How about this.  Men and women are fundamentally different, but like to think they are they same and this leads to communication problems.  I'll call it 'Men are from Jupiter, Women are from Neptune.'  Hmmmmmm.  That doesn't sound quite right.  Let me work on it...
0201485672|5.0|While it is no groundsbreaking stuff, it is very useful for people who want to bring better design into existing code; or those who are just unhappy with the existing code. It clearly identified common problems with existing code and provides techniques to help you make it better. While experienced programmers have most likely used some of these techniques on their own, reading this book helps you remember/organize these techniques in your mind. One of the most useful things is that Martin outlines the steps to take to get to the desired code - each step is very small so as to minimize your chance of screwing it up.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|The interesting thing about this album is the way it jumps around and never seems to get nailed down to one sound.  Many tracks bring other bands to mind.  Sometimes you feel like you are listening to Radiohead, especially \\"I Never Came\\" in which Josh seems to almost be doing a Thom Yorke impersonation.  Some tracks bring the White Stripes to mind and some even sound like Incubus to me.  This is not a critisism, just an observation.  A good album.
B000056QCZ|5.0|Are You Experienced? (1967.), Jimi Hendrix's first studio album<br /><br />'Are You Experienced' is the first album capture of the legend on the guitar himself. What Jimi Hendrix achieved in the 3 or so years at the top in the world of music before his all too tragic death in 1970 is truly phenominal. No-one has ever been able to play the guitar quite like Jimi Hendrix and you see it in this album all too plainly. You could literally take away Hendrix's vocals in his songs and just listen to his playing and you would still hear the song words - the sound he produces from his guitar is like a voice speaking to you - thats how good his playing was! 'Are You Experienced' is fast approaching being 40 years old in the next couple of years and it still hasn't and will never lose its appeal. This album is listened to across generations alike and I'm sure that will be the case for years to come - this is what has made so many people over the years pick up the guitar and learn to play. Hendrix's music is so influencial.<br /><br />So, that's Hendrix, if you didn't probably know so already but the band he played in was the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix after not really enjoying too much success in the US in his really early years came to Britain and it was here he was discovered and really made his name. The two men who played with him in his band must not be overlooked. Mitch Mitchell was a more than capable drummer and Noel Redding, who sadly died a couple of years ago was an excellent bassist who provided the grounding for Hendrix to exert his brillaince. 'Are You Experienced' was the group's initial effort and it truly stands as one of the greatest debuts of all time as well as one of the greatest rock albums AND plenty of fans of Jimi Hendrix rate this one, along with Electric Ladyland as his best. The album contains the perfect fusion of styles. Jimi and his band give us a great dose of psychedelia in parts and then some real bluesy tunes also. Theres some good riffs in parts as well as some very catchy tunes and most of all, you hear the guitar played in a truly unique light.<br /><br />Two issues of this classic album are available, a US edition which has a mustard coloured background with the band pictured in a circle in the centre and a UK edition which has a dark background with Jimi pictured in the centre with Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell pictured to his left and right. DO NOT WORRY if you get either one of the editions as they both contain the same 17 amazing tracks but they are just arranged in a different order.<br /><br />Highlights of the album??? Well maybe the whole thing is the fairest reflection! It is a real 60 minute treat. Hits 'Purple Haze' with its famous opening guitar sequence and 'Hey Joe' the slower paced, passionate rambler are both featured. 'Third Stone From the Sun' is my favourite track - this is 6 minutes of serious psychedelia, with some weird and thoughtful sections to it with another classic guitar sequence which you will have been bound to have heard before. 'Red House' will give you a taste of the blues and 'Manic Depression' has a great drum rolling style to it with some good lyrics. 'Foxey Lady' is another classic and don't forget 'Fire', for me one of the catchier tunes on the album with some more killer guitar work. 'Highway Chile' is brilliant, the guitar playing literally screams and leaps out at you when you hear it. 'Wind Cries Mary' calls the album home further with its amazing atmospheric style - the best lyrics on the album are in this one, for me anyway - this track has been covered by many artists over the years.<br /><br />Hendrix made the guitar great and this album is a prime example. The Experience were a great trio of musicians overall and you see this clearly with this debut effort. This is personally one of my favourite albums in my collection and in my opinion should never be overlooked - it is way, way too good to be missed out on.ll as some very catchy tunes and most of all, you hear the guitar played in a truly unique light.

0345440900|1.0|I'm not a fan of this book and its theories. I had a very difficult infant (not that they aren't all difficult at some point!) and was told by a friend to purchase this book when my baby was almost two months old. <br /> <br />I tried desperately to get my baby on a schedule with little results. He simply wanted to be held and nursed all the time. I attributed it to my failure to do anything but be an 'accidental parent' as this book likes to call it.  <br /> <br />Eventually we determined that my son had a nasty case of reflux. Once we were able to help solve his problem things became easier and then I could just follow his lead to determine what schedule worked best for him. Reflux is a very common problem - in fact most babies who are colicky and fussy usually have some degree of reflux. <br /> <br />Oh and the breastfeeding advice in this book was horrible. Funny, I don't consider myself to be a breastfeeding nut like some women  and even I thought her endorsement of formula over breastmilk was totally over the line. I nursed my son for five months and I'm so glad I did! <br /> <br />I'm sorry I bought this book. I wish I could get my money back.
0553573403|5.0|This book was absolutely great. I could not put it down, despite it being a long book. It was in-depth and full of intrigue, betrayal, swords, sorcery and blood; all that make a great fantasy. The start takes a little to get pass, but stick with it and you will be well rewarded.<br /><br />I when from this book straight to the next, which was even better and am now reading the third and eagerly waiting the fourth. I love the way each chapter follows a character (about 8-10 characters in the book) as this really gets you into the mind of them, feeling like you are really part of the story. I really recommend this book, in fact, this series, to any fantasy reader.
B000068GA4|5.0|This is yet another awesome danzig cd. I really like ''Long Way Back From Hell,'' ''Snakes of Christ,'' Her Black Wings,'' but most of all, ''BLOOD AND TEARS,'' i say blood and tears is the best slower song from danzig, i like alot of the songs but them 4 are my favorites. Buy this along with the first and third.
0060955775|4.0|The book is very interesting and special. <br /> <br />I liked because this is history of a girl that wanted to die, but change her idea when she took into a hospital.  <br /> <br />In the hospital she knew a new life with love and friends. <br /> <br />The book shows how important is the life.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|The final hour of the first season might just be the best episode of TV ever done.<br /><br />I didn't read all the customer reviews, but none I read refer to the accurate shooting location.  None of it has anything to do with Colorado.  The Pilot was shot in Calgary, I guess, but everyone knew that humans don't belong there so they were forced to find a new location for the show's sets, atmosphere and surroundings. Those of us who have lived for long periods of time in both Colorado and Utah, where the series is filmed, can very objectively say that Utah ACTUALLY has everything Colorado THINKS it has.
B000001FT0|4.0|This is one of very few albums that I can put on and play from start to finish;  there are no \\"skip-over\\" songs.  My favorites include the well-known \\"Valerie\\" and \\"Still In The Game,\\" along with \\"Help Me Angel,\\" \\"Big Girls Walk Away,\\" \\"It Was Happiness,\\" and the hymn-like closing song, \\"There's A River.\\"  <br /> <br />Musical purists may not like the heavy keyboard and synthesizer sound (there is very little guitar work on this album), but Winwood plays and sings with such a bluesy feel that the sound does not come across as mechanical even when the percussion is provided and/or enhanced by drum machines or other electronic augmentation.  Winwood has a soulful voice and a soulful keyboard style, and these qualities elevate the album beyond the level of mere electronics and studio composition.
B0002OERI0|2.0|really... i've been a green day fan ever since their beginnings in 1988, and this album is not their best.  not only is there slow emo songs like 'boulevard of broken dreams', 'wake me up when september ends', and 'we are the waiting', but it sounds less punk than ever. <br /> <br />there are a few good songs that can satisfy: 'holiday', 'st. jimmy', 'she's a rebel', 'letterbomb', and 'homecoming'... but that's about it.  if anything, you might want to get those from itunes or something. <br /> <br />if want a good green day album, try one of the first four: '1039/smoothed out slappy hours', 'kerplunk', 'dookie' (my personal favorite), and 'insomniac', they're MUCH better than this one.
B00005JKNF|5.0|\\"Gosford Park\\" is my idea of a perfect English country house murder mystery. It's set in 1932, and all the costumes are appropriate for that era. The scenery is gorgeous. The home is beautifully decorated and filled with fresh flowers. It could be Castle Howard. The interaction and dialogue between members of the family and guests sets up the plot, and is the same with and among servants. The dialogue between the actors follows on in the way that real people talk. The plot thickens as we listen to their conversations. Although some people will probably disagree about who the murderer is, the victim is killed (and I'm pretty sure who \\"done\\" it), but it's left to the imagination who attempts, and why, to kill him after he is already dead. There are at least four, and perhaps more, persons who make excellent suspects. I like this movie so much that I watch it at least once a week. One of the things I love about it is Jeremy Northam's stylish singing. The songs are sooooo Noel Cowardish: romantic and filled with pathos or nonsensical and funny.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I can't think of enough good things to say about this album.  Fans of previous QOTSA works, such as Songs for the Deaf, may be slightly disappointed on initial listening.  Everything will sound solid, but without Nick, the gonzo element is gone.  Further listening will reveal that the gonzo element has been replaced with a more direct, go for the throat sound.  Not that previous QOTSA works didn't go for the throat, but this album rips the throat clean out.  But, the gonzo element IS pretty much absent and is missed.  I know that 5 is the highest rating on Amazon.com, but if QOTSA could have kept both the gonzo element and the amazing punch of this album, a mere 5 stars would not have been enough.    Even with the best of albums, however, there's a potential for nitpicking.  The guest appearances on this album are hard to make out.  \\"Burn the Witch\\" is a great song, but you have to listen closely to distinguish Billy Gibbons' (ZZTop) guitar work and vocals.  In \\"You Got a Killer Scene There, Man...\\" it's hard to determine if you are hearing or imagining Shirley Manson's (Garbage) backup vocals.    BTW, I saw QOTSA in concert on March 27, 2005, and they were incredible.  The songs where Nick sang lead, however, were out of the set.  Nick is missing and missed, but QOTSA is still great.  Also, if you are lucky enough to see QOTSA in concert, don't throw anything onto the stage.  Someone did that during the March 27th concert, and Josh added some choice words to \\"Go With the Flow.\\"  Apparently, Josh gets more than slightly upset when he needs to dodge an object mid-song.
B000002U82|5.0|One of the best albums ever in my oppinion.  Now I thought it was good by itself, but last night I was fortunate to come upon 2 tresures, 300 micrograms of LSD, and a copy of The Wizard of Oz that was synced perfectly to The Dark Side of the Moon.  My life will never be the same again.  Every fan of this album should watch it along with Wizard of Oz, and if you're daring enough, with a bit of LSD;).
B000687M48|5.0|'Anywhere But Home' is essentially Evanescence's debut album, 'Fallen', live on stage. Any true fan of Evanescence will enjoy watching this concert, and listening to the audio disk too. By true fan, i mean those who bought 'Fallen' for the whole album not just to hear My Immortal, or Bring Me To Life. This DVD shows the bands true colours and shows us just what they are, how the look etc. The bands appearence may shock some as they are a lot more gothis on this DVD. <br /> <br />As a live performer Amy Lee is brilliant. She is one of the few artists around, performing this stle of music, who can actually sing live. She is exceptionally talented to sit and play the piano and sing at the same time (its very hard....trust me ive tried!).  <br />The band sound almost like they are taken directly from fallen, they sound near perfect, which for a live recording shows just how good they are. <br /> <br />This DVD is a must have for and Evanescence fan! It shows you who and what Evanescence are and proves just how talented they are.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon combines depth of character, mysterious scifi, and quirky humor in this series.  A western style tale set in the \\"frontier\\" of space, the show focuses on humanity instead of aliens.  Each character has a fully developed history and relationship to the rest of the crew, and the plot slowly unfolds to reveal a larger picture. Given an open mind and half a chance, this show is thought provoking, highly entertaining, and provides a variety of personalities for folk to relate to.  Joss is brilliant at creating a familiar world of consistant phrases and speech patterns for each of his shows, and this series takes it a step further by incorporating an actual foreign language in place of common slang.  The crew holds true to their own code of honor, while trying to stay one step ahead of trouble.  Another plus is the unique, fresh cast selection, which is largely unfamiliar faces, who will hopefully become more familiar in the future.  They are releasing the movie Serenity based on the Firefly series Sept 30, 2005 and many fans are hoping that the show becomes 'uncancelled'
0679882820|5.0|...is connected to this book. When she was a baby into early toddlerhood, I read this book alot....really exagerating the noises...her  favorite was the thunder but really with all the noises, she got such a kick.....I have a picture framed of her when she was about 9 mos. old - I am reading the book making some stupid hand motion and she is just CACKLING with laughter....I suggest to parents who buy the book not just to read it but to make the sounds interesting....when it says \\"Knock knock\\", rap gently on their heads....When it says Pop pop, make hand motions to the popping....babys and toddlers will be entranced....as she got older, like 18 mos.,  I paused and she 'd make the  corresponding noise!<br /><br />I had the board book form....great for smaller hands btw....
0385513755|1.0|I am convinced that Dan Brown is a angry lesbian. Actually I would guess that Dan Brown's wife is a angry lesbian. Seriously if you just read this book and forget all the \\"lame controversy\\" that this book tries to create you will find that The Da Vinci Code is very poorly written. It reminds me of some dollar store mystery novel that should be thrown away and never be talked about. The characters are hardly interesting, the dialogue is poor, and the facts in the book were not researched at all. If you are thinking of buying this book grab a screwdriver and stab yourself in the foot. If you do buy this book take a look in the mirror and I guarantee you will see a overwieght lesbian women probably in your 30's with a bad mullet and a long upper-lip 'stache. It's your decision -make the call
B000089CJI|5.0|Wow.  Regardless of your musical preferences (or lack of musical appreciation thereof), you are on this page and if you do not own a copy of this CD then you MUST buy one.  If you fail to do this, you will be passing up (in my opinion) one of the best albums of the last decade or two (thats about as long as I've been alive which is the only thing keeping me from saying \\"ever\\").  It really is THAT good.   <br /> <br />The music itself is devilishly melodical in a modern and infectious way.  I would describe it as a fusion of traditional backdrops (pianos, guitars, etc), superficially emanating beats of various electronic synthesizers, and appropriately soothing vocals.  The result is  a feeling of enveloping euphoric goodness that flows through you rather than simply playing around you.  Trust me, you'll get addicted. <br /> <br />Enjoy :).
B000002UA7|5.0|Kate liked to experiment with music all the time, which endeared her to the critics (always on the lookout for something new and different) and to a lot of fans. She had six UK top ten hits in the seventies and eighties, together with plenty of other hits. The most popular of Kate's early hits (except her live on stage EP) are to be found on this excellent compilation, originally released on vinyl in 1986.<br /><br />Kate had her biggest UK hit with her debut single, Wuthering heights (inspired by the famous Emily Bronte novel of the same title), which went all the way to number one. The follow-up, Man with the child in his eyes, became a UK top ten hit. Two other UK top five hits are here (Babooshka, Running up that hill) along with several songs that made the UK top twenty and three minor UK hits. Sadly, Kate's duet with Peter Gabriel (Don't give up, a UK top ten hit) came a couple of years too late for this compilation.<br /><br />The diversity of Kate's music is impressive but her music is difficult to classify. Kate's high-pitched voice may not appeal to everybody - it's the kind of voice you either love or hate but it is very distinctive. And I love it.<br /><br />An expanded compilation including some of Kate's hits after 1986 is long overdue (there is plenty of room on a CD to include more tracks), but until such time as one appears, this is the only compilation of Kate's music there is. Still, quantity is less important than quality and this collection is certainly filled with quality.
B000002LR3|5.0|Primal Scream are a band that move musically in so many  different guises & Sounds, that If you became a fan of theirs, through a particular album, there's nothing to say that the next album is going to resemble the previous album, in any...way, shape or form.  A band that reflect the musical landscape of the current time, and arguably take contemporary influences and ideas, and fashion albums that bookmark certain  <br />periods in their career. <br /> <br />The year is 1991, and Britain is in the midst of a change in the current movement of music.  \\"Dance Music\\" has become one of the more dominant sounds to have shaped Britain's music scene. And the majority of the music buying public has become enthralled by it, many acts producing the majority of the dance music, had discovered the drug \\"Ecstasy\\" years previous, and were, making scintillating fusions of acid, House, Techno & Alternative Dance.  Primal Scream themselves had become no strangers to the Drug, and although their form of all-encompassing rock was extremely diverse, it wasn't truly representative of the explosion of Dance orientated music entering the charts.  That's when the band hooked up with highly regarded Dance producer \\"Andy Weatherall\\", who'd worked on everything from: downbeat, Experimental techno, IDM, Acid, Dance.  And would lend his considerable dance productions skills to embellish the album with a sunny-eyed optimism, and Hedonistic glow, (along with a helping of deep psychedelic / Exuberant arrangements). <br /> <br />\\"Movin' on Up\\", begins with a gospel-tinged soaring & joyous chorus, opening everything wide open and turning their previous sound of alternative dance-rock inside out by easing back on the rock dynamics, but not completely abandoning it, and fusing it with a effervescent exercise of modern dance sounds & imagination, with singer/frontman \\"Bobby Gillespie\\" singing plaintively \\"I've found what I'm looking for!!\\"...what exactly Gillespie has found isn't made entirely clear, (although it wouldn't take a genius to guess), and it's here that throughout the album a lot of the lyrical content can be open to more than one interpretation. <br /> <br />\\"Slip inside This House\\", locks 80's rave beats with a slightly psychedelic eastern guitar (possibly a \\"Sitar\\"), it's a highly imaginative fusion of two distinctly different sounds, and the influence on the production has \\"Andy Weatherall's\\" ideas stamped all over it.   Something of a throwback to the days of Warehouse Raves, through a restrained slower melody, this is far more considered & slower paced than anything the band have previously attempted, over which Gillespie cryptically chants \\"Trip inside\\". <br /> <br />\\"Don't Fight It, Feel It\\" uses a reverberated bass, to elastic effect, over which the tune is stretched over, before the bassline is interupted, with female vocals, and prominent squelchy synths, take precedence, almost neo-psychedelic in approach, and such a monumental step forward for what the band is primarily known for, that it seems impossible to link this new sound, to anything the band have ever previously done.  Interestingly the female vocals sing: \\"I want to Dance to the music, before getting High\\", alongisde minimal drum percussion, with the occasional euphoric looping keyboard bursts free, with surprising gusto.  <br /> <br />\\"Higher Than the Sun\\", brings a spooky-ambience to begin with, with various sampled vocal wails, throwing the listener into (slight) confusion, before giving way to a slow horror-soundtrack inspired arrangement, that begins to gather pace, then disjointed beats with synth melodies soar & Conflict against each other, with Gillespie singing a ballad-like \\"Higher than the Sun\\" vocal.  Layers of booming almost Breakbeat beats begin to take hold....a very unusual track by conventional song structure methods, but still arguably stunning. <br /> <br />The centrepiece track in-amongst this beautifully Euphoric rush of an album, is the breathtaking \\"Come Together\\", with a snippet of movie dialogue saying \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\", \\"We are Together\\", as church organs begin to swirl into the sound, mixed with synchronised hand-clapping (Possibly sampled from an actual Church congregation), and the minimal Drum Hi-Hat gaining momentum, before a gradually soaring arrangement of Dance Beats, begin to thump into action, driving the sound into a truly ambitiously soaked sound of Dance/Gospel Fusion.......\\"Together as one\\" is the chanted message of the group of female voices singing in harmony, and it quite a breathtaking air of euphoria surrounding it, unquestionably one of the best tracks on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Loaded\\", another of the albums strongest tracks, opens with more snippets of movie dialogue, with the sample \\"We Wanna get loaded & have a good Time\\", showing the tracks statement of intent, and couldn't be more apt.  Trumpet sections soar, minimal dance beats intertwine with everything, and shredding Guitars punctuate halfway through, being interspersed with more Clips of movie Dialogue saying \\"We Want to Be free, to do what we want to Do!!?\\", liberal use of backing female choruses, gives the track a level of unity & hedonism, that most conventional dance music couldn't possibly had to emulate....and to end the track with the sampled \\"We wanna get loaded, and have a good time\\", is a tremendous closer, for a truly stunning track. <br /> <br />To compare this albums against Primal Scream's previous albums is a redundant exercise, as it so out of step with what they've previously done before, that a reasonable judgement, becomes incredibly hard.  This is such a brilliantly realised and produced album, that is such a monumental step forward for the band, that those that listen to it for the first time, will (initially) have difficulty believing it to be the same band. Even more astonishingly, is the fact that even though this was created around the time of the Dance music boom (in the U.K.) in the early 90's, it doesn't sound horribly dated, listening to it some 13+ years later (partly due to Andy Weatherall's incredible production).  Few would argue, that this & XTRMNTR are the finest two albums Primal scream have ever made thus far, utterly essential.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Kill Bill 1 is better than this 2nd one, it has more action and \\"blood\\", but this is more... boring, because there is too much dialogue. There is 1 scene that is my favorite one, where Beatrix is under the ground. The story is very good, but this is a bit more boring than the first one, and the way Bill dies is a little disapointing, he should have died fighting!
B000002IWQ|4.0|some of my all time favorite rush songs are included on here, such as the incredibly strong instrumental track \\"leave that thing alone\\" and the underrated \\"between sun and moon.\\"  but there are corny parts that make me cringe, like parts of \\"alien shore\\" and \\"cold fire.\\"  The playing is outstanding on every song, but the lyrics are very occasionally embarassing.  However, it is a strong effort and on par with Roll the Bones as another good Rush offering from the 90's.  I personally like the cd's they released at this time, but many people do not, so explore this era carefully.  Just remember that this cd is a mixed bag, but it has mostly good songs.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Yes, that is the truth. Hesiod, the most famous epic poet after Homerus,  clearly said that Achilles, son of Peleus,  and Patroclus, son of Menoetius (Peleus'brother) were cousins. Other ancient sources confirm these data.  <br />So, much ado about nothing. But it is a shame that such an important detail has beeen ignored by all reviewers.  <br />Maybe Petersen, who studied the Iliad in a Gymnasium in Germany, knows some things about Greek mythology that other people don't know.  <br />
B000002H97|5.0|this cd was the first cd I listened to that just blew me away over and over again.  I had listened to classic cd's of this era before, such as Nevermind and the like, but I was beyond excited by the heavy intensity and arrangements in this cd that I had never heard anywhere else, especially in other metal bands (except for Queensryche, another of my all time favorite metal bands).  This began a brief infatuation with heavy metal, which I eventually abandoned in favor of older rock music.  But this cd and Master of Puppets are watershed moments in thrash metal music, and will always remain in my collection.  Metallica makes stupid music now, and this was the last good cd they released.  It is completely worth your money, as the guys show the great variety of musical emotions they are able to create.  the depth of this music is quite brilliant.

0975991477|5.0|A truly magnificent book! One of the most important I've ever read. Lipton takes what could be a dry subject and moistens it with humor and clear, clean explication. More significant, Lipton's research and conclusions stand traditional biology (what I learned in school; you too, probably) on its head. He is one of the few scientists brave enough to see and acknowledge the spiritual aspects of our humanness. In the Epilogue, Lipton says \\"In the end, these cellular insights serve to emphasize the wisdom of spiritual teachers throughout the ages.\\" This from a guy who taught at medical schools! This is like Copernicus telling us that in fact the earth revolves around the sun. <br /> <br />Altogether, a very warm and personal telling of the essential human story. I lent one of my copies to a friend. Now I have to replace it, because her mother snatched it from her and isn't giving it back! <br /> <br />Larry Valmore
0143034901|4.0|I do so love books with wind whistling down dark alleyways, rain pelting down, and shadows lurking, hiding mysterious goings-on.  The atmospheric touches in this book enhance the sensuality of the prose, but I have to wonder -- does the sun EVER come out in Barcelona?
B000000OQF|5.0|Fred Smith (The previous review) must be joking.  This is one of (if not) the best albums of all time.  Buy the CD and you will listen to it from start to finish without skipping any of the songs.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Lamb of God is a crazy technical metal band.  (Notice I didn't say \\"metalcore\\".)  These fellas have more talent in their sneezes than some other bands have in their playing skills. <br /> <br />As the Palaces Burn was easily a 5-star release, but Ashes only gets four.  Though the production is better on Ashes, the vocals have taken a turn for the worse, IMHO.  Randy Blythe sounded like an emotionally-devoid machine on Palaces, now he sounds like just another ticked-off metal maniac.  But we don't listen to Lamb of God for the vocals, right?  It's the fantastic musicianship that you get when listening to the band. <br /> <br />As any LoG listener knows, the riffs are just insane.  Don't get too attached to any one riff though, cause it'll change in a few seconds!  It really is a trip to hear the evolution of each song.  Kinda like Dillinger Escape Plan, but not as ridiculous.  Also, they get super high-fives for the incredibly amazing solos.  Gotta love solos! <br /> <br />I made the mistake of getting too attached to a couple of riffs.  Beware of tracks 3, 6, and 9.  They start out with some of the best thrash riffs known to man, but then change over to typical LoG rockin out.  I really wish those songs were straight-out thrash, but hey I can't complain. <br /> <br />Amazingified songs:  Hourglass, Blood of the Scribe, What I've Become, Ashes of the Wake (in which Chris Poland makes an appearance!). <br /> <br />Lame songs:  Omerta.  (Sorry fellas.  I still love you!) <br /> <br />Buy this album, and buy As the Palaces Burn.  Though I'm sure it's juat as stupendous, I still don't have New American Gospel, so I can't legally recommend it.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I loved it in the theatre, and I've watched it twice in the two days since I got it.  This movie is a great family story and a nice change from the typical Hollywood blockbusters.  Highly recommended!
B00080Z53O|5.0|Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2004, The Sea Inside is a fact-based story of Ramn Sampedro, a quadriplegic man who petitions the Spanish government for his right to die. Without the use of his body for 27 years, Sampedro desires above all else the right to be euthanized. His story is taken on by an association that goes by the name of \\"Die with Dignity\\" which is how he has a voice in court. <br /> <br />The story begins as a lawyer comes to Ramn to learn his story. She has taken the case pro bono to get his wish to die granted by the courts. This is the first person we see him encounter that tries to understand him; she is not the last. <br /> <br />Through these meetings we see how truly remarkeable Sampedro really is. We see the devices he has invented to assist him in his situation. We see the poetry his heart has poured out over the years. We are party to conversations in which he explains life and freedom of choice, he talks of a future he hopes not to have. Every person he communicates with is so deeply moved by him; it is humbling to see the effect one man may have on others. <br /> <br />Director Alejandro Amenbar (Open Your Eyes, The Others) brings to life this story of a man enslaved to his body. The movie is set in the house Ramn refuses to leave, though we see incredible landscape shots and are taken on an amazing ride as Sampedro jumps out of his two story window and flies all the way to the beach. Through his eyes we see how he lingers over the blue-green water. To this former sailor, the sea represents that which gave him life and ultimately took it away. <br /> <br />    The only thing worse than your son dying before you...is him wanting to. -Joaqun Sampedro (Ramn's father) <br /> <br />This was an absolutely beautiful movie. Try as I may to exercise my vocabulary, I keep ending up with the word \\"beautiful\\" to describe The Sea Inside. This heart wrenching tale offers various perspectives on both life and death. If you have ever taken the time to consider either, and even if you have not, this movie will be special to you. And I will warn you that there are a few times in the movie when not crying seems unthinkable. I cannot help the feeling that in seeing this movie in the theater last night I was a part of something important. I look forward to the DVD release on May 17, 2005.
B00006LLNV|5.0|Just as \\"The Harder they Come\\" and \\"The Big Easy\\" presented Reggae and Zydeco to wider audiences, the soundtrack for the movie \\"Frida\\" is a wonderful introduction to the varied and vital world of contemporary Mexican folk music.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|and I don't mean sad like make you cry. I mean sad like I can't believe Julia Roberts actually played a part in this film. Without a doubt, it has to be her worst yet. And Jude Law. Why would he bend to something like this? The only thing I'll have to admit that I did like about this film is watching Clive Owen. I think he's a hunk. But if he makes many more like this one, I'll lose interest in him too. Julia is one of my favorites. I hope she's more selective about her next script because this one sure didn't do her any justice. My advice on this one...FORGET IT.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|I can't believe Depp was passed over at the Oscars, he was so much better than Foxx.  This movie was all round good.  Directing, acting, writing, all of it was great.  I' am usually pretty cynical when it comes to movies, but I couldn't help but be drawn into this one.  Kate Winslet should not go without mention, she did a great job in this movie.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|What a great album.  Someone's in the Wolf is an incredible song, as are Insane, Little Sister, In My Head, Plaid, and Burn the Witch.  The album like mentioned above is a tale of two sides.<br /><br />After songs 2-8 is loses some steam, but those songs in and of itself make for a great album.  While it does not hold the firepower of their debut(but not many do) it is slightly less superior to both Rated R and Songs for the Deaf.<br /><br />QOTSA are the most gifted hard rock band of today.
6305972591|5.0|This film is absolutely perfect.  This is one you can watch with your kids/parents.  Children of the corn has a few scary moments but is mainly just an awesome thriller.  Malachi and Isaac are awesome in this film.  Stephen King is a genius and the plot to this movie is something almost as good as the original Halloween plot.  This movie has what most horror flicks don't...Personality! Definetly pick this one up.
B000002H6C|5.0|this was a pretty heavy Metallica album, really good stuff. Good from start to finish.
0780626966|2.0|1: The first Nightmare on elm street is the only one worth buying besides maybe 3.  Heather Langenkamp is perfect for her role, she is the sexiest thing...to bad you don't see her naked in this one. <br />2: Makes no sense.  This one doesn't follow the plot of #1 and people die before you get to know who they are.  No build up at all, and definetly not scary. <br />3: The only good one besides the original.  Heather is back (thank god) but once again, you don't see her naked. <br />4:embarrasing <br />5:also embarrasing <br />6: kind of scary but embarrasing <br />7: This is the worst one...Even though Heather/Nancy is back, for some reason.  This movie sucks, it is actually okay up until the very end when Heather reads off the book that says that the last six films were all fake.  Wes Craven is smart, but sometimes he is a complete dumbass.
B0006399FS|4.0|First of all, I'm sick and tired of people just flat out bashing an album or a band just for the sake of bashing. This goes for all you who have blasted this album and band with words like \\"suck,\\" \\"sold out,\\" and all the other colorful and wonderfully original insults written by folks who think they are music connoisseurs just because Amazon.com gives them free access to write out a review. U2 are brilliant musicians (and you, dear friend, are NOT!). There's a reason they've lasted as long as they have. There's a reason they're called \\"legends.\\" There's a reason Bono is as acclaimed and admired as he is -- worldwide!  Bono's voice and lyrics are second to none in the present day music world and his \\"messiah complex\\" personality is what makes him one of the all time greatest front men in rock history. And for those of you who claim they've \\"sold out\\" -- since when have U2 claimed to be an \\"underground band?\\" Look up the term in context to pop culture before you use it so liberally!  Since \\"New Year's Day\\" the band has been on the radio and on television. And while so-called great bands have come and gone through the 80's, 90's and the Present -- U2 remains. Deal with it! <br /> <br />Secondly, to bash this album is ridiculous. Is it as good as Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby? Of course not. Bands aren't supposed to churn out 'masterpieces' every time they release an album. So, let's look at this album for what it is: an album. A good album at that. Greatest of all time? No. Just as brilliant as (fill in the blank)? No (The same nimrods who blasted Achtung Baby when it first came out as \\"not the same U2 as Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, etc.\\" are probably the same idiots who are blasting this album today). Just shut up and enjoy the moment. Some of these reviews are written as if U2 made a J-Lo album! Relax. The U2 of the present will never be like the U2 of the 80's. U2 simply set out to do what artists do: they composed an album that speaks their minds and, along theway, hope that it resonates with fans.  <br /> <br />So, instead of bashing one of the all time greatest rock bands, stand back and appreciate a talent like this band is still among us. In a world where the music industry churns out Ultra-Crap like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, all the \\"emo\\" bands, and all the regurgitated nonsense (we are living in the worst era of music), be grateful a band like U2 still exists. This album is not great, and it is unfair to place it next to Joshua Tree and other albums like it. But it is a good album. A good piece of music to listen to. And it proves that even a \\"good\\" U2 album is greater than all the other junk that saturates the airwaves.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, U2 is forever linked to the all time greatest bands. Even the Beatles had \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and Led Zeppelin had \\"In Through the Out Door.\\" Yet we consider these bands as pillars in the history of rock and music. U2 stands along side these giants.  <br /> <br />Those who deny that are simply unhappy, cynical, sad wretches still looking for the glories of the past. Do us all a favor, you Gollums of the Review Board: Stay in the shadows grumbling over how everything sucks and keep it to yourself. <br /> <br />I understand this sounds like a pretentious, U2 apologetic, review. But I had to say something.  <br /> <br />Anyway, the album is pretty darn good.  <br /> <br />Now Vote 'YES\\" above and thanks for your time!
068987474X|3.0|There are some who find this book empowering, enlightening, liberating and virtually indispensable. The authors produce some entertainment and score some points but the bottom line is that this book is a shallow, manipulative tome, written by people from the equally shallow \\"Sex and the City\\" TV show. It basically depicts men as immature or untrustworthy, and women as virtuous creatures who only need wake up and smell the coffee and deal with the jerks accordingly. This is standard recycled fare and the authors manipulate it to the hilt for their mostly female audience. The fact that it is a man \\"revealing\\" this advice doesn't make it any less a retread. Now let's get down to bidniss.      1) IS HE NOT GETTING INTO YOU BECAUSE HE IS A JERK OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF AIN'T THAT HOT? Pandering to the mostly female audience, the authors hail female virtue and goodness versus male immaturity and perfidy. Those who play this game get more book sales, hence they dare not raise a key issue- He may not be into you, not because he's \\"a jerk\\" but because your opinion of yourself is hopelessy inflated and what you have to offer may not be that great relatively speaking. It is of course \\"politically incorrect\\" to raise such blunt questions despite all the blurbs about \\"honest\\" talk. It may be better for women to take an honest look at themselves, and what they bring to the table (it may not be all that impressive), rather than knee-jerk blaming of men for not being interested or commited enough.       2) HURT FEELINGS? WELCOME TO THE CLUB AND QUIT WHINING. NOW YOU KNOW HOW MEN FEEL: Much drama is expended on such \\"inconsiderate\\" male behavior as failing to return phone calls or e-mails. Curiously the level of female concern for \\"feelings\\" doesn't reach the same fever pitch when THEY treat men rudely and inconsiderately. Non-returned phone calls or e-mail? This is old news for many men as they are scornfully dismissed by women without a shred of common courtesy. It is unknownwhy females should expect any more consideration in 2005, when they do not see fit to extend the same to males (who are just supposed to accept it and \\"move on\\"). Proponents of so-called \\"simple\\" male needs fail to see that men don't like being rudely discarded, ignored or mocked, as is so prevalent in popular culture including the writer's own \\"Sex and the City\\" show.  Flash- they too are human. Again, many women need to quit whining and examine their own behavior in this regard. Do unto others..      3) WHY IS FEAR OF COMMITMENT \\"BAD\\"? Much anger is flung at perfidious males who keep hesitating rather than plunging into commitment. But why is this a bad thing? It is exceedingly wise these days for a man to proceed VERY CAUTIOUSLY before making commitments. With a high divorce rate and women initiating almost 70% of all divorces, men have learned the hard way about betrayal and that the supposedly \\"deeper\\" female \\"commitment\\" is also a shaky thing. In the divorce culture a man can expect little mercy from a system arrayed against him- one quick to ruthlessly squeeze him for the last penny, and quick to provide an array of subsidized public services to females, but a system quite cavalier when it comes to enforcing his rights in such areas as visitation, or in providing him institutional support.     Furthermore, the old breadwinner model is long gone- females are doing quite well in numerous fields and are paying their own way. Yet they unhesitatingly seek to assert control over the resources a man brings to the table, during and after marriage. No sane man would leave himself so exposed without taking a long, hard look at the woman pressing for \\"commitment\\". It may be that despite inflated female opinions, the investment package required in the female is not commensurate to the return.  In addition, matters such as religion, family objections, previous relationships, ethnicity etc. etc are quite valid reasons to cause commitment hesitation. It is not a matter offailing to return a phone call, or the so-called \\"not into you\\" as the \\"real\\" reason explaining male delay. The book's level of analysis on this count appears weak and shallow.       4) WHY IS MALE EFFORT TO SPARE FEMALE FEELINGS \\"CRUEL\\"? The book shows males reluctant to bluntly and harshly dump females. Instead they withdraw slowly, trying to avoid confrontation and spare female feelings. Yet this is seen by many as \\"players\\" at work. Why? Avoiding confrontation and sparing feelings are supposed to be among those kinder, gentler, celebrated \\"female\\" traits. So when a man does it he is a monster or a \\"playa\\"? Why the double standard? Would women really prefer a bluntly honest 2-minute breakoff of relationships since men are supposed to be more \\"direct\\"? The book doesn't say. Furthermore women play exactly the same game when they want to phase out or cool down a relationship- they ALSO let it linger, fail to return phone calls, etc.. Again, why is this fine for women but when a man does it he is a \\"jerk\\"? The authors claim to be \\"keeping it real\\" but they carefully avoid such questions.      5) \\"EMPOWERING\\" WOMEN OR PLAYERS? The book claims that the information \\"revealed\\" will help \\"empower\\" women. This might well be for some, but there is a level of naivete to this claim. True players have little to fear from this book. All they have to do is merely make their game more convincing on the surface- like returning phone calls more promptly, and murmuring the right commitment boilerplate. But once their objectives are achieved, the game is over. Women may feel \\"empowered\\" to break off at this point, but since the playa has already made his score, female \\"empowerment\\" just makes his dumping job easier. This book actually helps cut the playas workload. Indeed, since so many women are familar with this book, the playa need not go through an extended withdrawal period. All he has to do is start the process, and sure enough, the newly enlightened and empowered women will seize on the \\"signals\\" and will do the dirty breakup work themselves. Another added benefit is that she will go away feeling better and empowered, and also will take the onus for the break, while he is free to move on.     Readers, don't be fooled by the author's happy talk about \\"empowerment\\". Consider that it came from people writing for the \\"Sex and the City\\" TV show- a dubious fantasy land of $700 designer dresses and painless \\"relationships\\" bearing little relation to the hard realities of the street. There are better books than this shallow one such as Why Men Marry Some Women and Not Others- by John T. Molloy
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This CD is \\"Sweet!\\" Slipknot does sound different on this album, but they have no album that sounds the same. Their first big album was kind of Nu-Metal-ish and their second one was straight up heavy. This album shows that they can be well balanced when it comes to sound. I was looking forward to more heavy stuff like they had in Iowa, but I've come to appreciate this CD. You can pretty much tell that everyone in the band had a say in this album because of the different styles that they display. I give this album four stars because Slipknot hasn't failed musically. They continue to give the consumer raw emotion not only in lyrics, but also musically. I hope to see/hear more heavy stuff from Slipknot as they continue to make good music.<br /><br />Listen to Silent Civilians!
B000002KK2|3.0|Somehow I've never managed to own this album over the years even though I've owned and enjoyed a few other RLJ albums most notably \\"The Magazine\\", \\"Flying Cowboys\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Pirates\\". I found this one on vinyl for only $3 and since I'm still a big time vinyl nut I grabbed it. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed in the sound quality as it's one of the best sounding pop recordings I've ever heard but the material was only decent compared to the other RLJ I've heard.  <br /> <br />Last Chance Texaco is a beautiful song , Easy Money and Danny's All-Star Joint are a lot of fun, and the supporting studio musicians are right on point throughout but I can't say this album grabbed me from start to finish the way I was expecting it to. <br /> <br />This is certainly not a bad album but it's now the least favorite of my four RLJ albums that I own.
1400032717|5.0|I highly reccomend reading this book.  It is hillarious, entertaining, interesting and a learning experience.  A joy to read, and a must for anyone who has an autistic friend or family member and wants a better understanding of how their creative minds work.  Christopher's way of thinking is so adorable and entertaining.  I couldn't put the book down, and immediately after reading it, I lent it to my sister, who has worked with autistic children.  She loved it so much that she lent it to a friend of hers! READ IT and enjoy!
B00005JMAH|4.0|Of *course* it isn't as good as the book.  Movie adaptations almost never are.  Things have to be changed in order to work, and some things are inevitably lost in the transition.  <br />That said, it's the best one yet.  The first two movies were mediocre partly because they tried to follow the books too closely and brought nothing to the story- why would you watch a second-rate edited version of events when you can read the brilliant original?  <br />Azkaban was darker, funnier, and more believable.  The changes made to the storyline didn't feel forced or unnatural.  What won me over were the details; seeing the characters out of uniform or goofing off with magic animal crackers...they're kids at a magic school, but they're still kids.  The acting was excellent all-round.  <br />I can't see Phoenix making the jump to the big screen successfully: they'd have to cut it down a lot or make two films.  But if they do make another, hopefully Alfonso Cuarón remains the director.
B000002JS6|5.0|It seems no one can forget a truly good album such as this. It's an album that stands time and takes no prisoners. After their lead singer died this album was supposed to be like Pink Floyd's \\"Shine on you crazy diamonds\\". But you forget that after the first minute. It stands as classic AC/DC, maybe even takes it to higher standards, and always leaves us beging for more. Classica all the way.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Take Me Out. Geee, I wish somebody had done that to me before I had listened to this piece of crap. I don't know what to call there style of music except it's crap. And to the Grammys I have one question, HOW N DA H&!! Did these guys get nominated in the same catagory as Green Day? I listened \\"This Fire\\" and heard NO drums,Not a single drum. Hey Franz heres a hint, Ringo Starr and Tommy Lee,do I need to say anything else? Drums make good Rock music. Listen to my advice fans of Rock, if your in the mood for headbanggin',bicflickin' Rock, Buy \\"American Idiot\\" from Green Day, If for some reason you weren't, Buy this. It's not Pop, It's not Rock, It's crap.
0143034901|5.0|If you answer yes to both, run, run and buy this book...I gave five stars because I could not give more.<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon's \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is not for the literal-minded - it requires an acceptance that life can be lyrical, magical and melodramatic. Those who have compared this writer to Marquez are on the right track - if by Marquez they refer to \\"Love in The Time of Cholera\\". This book, like that one, belongs to a genre that I want to call romantic literary melodrama. You will either love the style or hate it.<br /><br />Read for yourself and judge. It brings a slice of Franco's Spain alive.
B000002UA0|5.0|In 1967, two landmark 'psychadelic rock' albums were released; Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. I can honestly say that Piper is superior (only slightly, however). It is delightly different, a little weird with cool use of sound effects. IMHO it slightly trails Dark Side Of The Moon as the best Pink Floyd album. The best song is...it's probably too hard to choose, but I like 'Bike' in a strange way. It's like what an 8-year old on LSD would write. :-). If there is a criticism some of the melodies are a bit simple...but hence, that is one of the great things about Pink Floyd.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|I've always found myself drawn more to Homme's side projects (Desert Sessions, Eagles Of Death Metal) due to their personal, more lo-fi feel to them. The Queens have always had a more polished, produced sound, with exception of a few songs. With this album, they've integrated that more self-produced sound into the album, and frankly I think they've never sounded better. <br /> <br />1. Lullaby - 5/5 - Beautiful introduction. Sets the mood for the what's to come. <br />2. Medication - 5/5 - Fast, catchy, sexy. <br />3. Everybody Knows That You Are Insane - 5/5 - Very druggy and ambient one second, fast and crazy the next. <br />4. Tangled Up In Plaid - 5/5 - Melodic, and again, sexy. <br />5. Burn The Witch - 5/5 - One of my favorites on the album. Billy Gibbons blues-y guitar and hoarse vocals really add a lot to the beauty of this song. <br />6. In My Head - 5/5 - Originally appeared on Desert Sessions 9 & 10. Sort of symbolizes the integration of that sound into this album. <br />7. Little Sister - 5/5 - Chock full of cowbell. Need I say more? <br />8. I Never Came - 5/5 - A very slow, melodic song. This is one of the songs you'd never hear on any of their other albums. Beautiful. <br />9. Someone's In The Wolf - 4/5 - Very intriguing and fast-paced song. It just sort of drags on and on. <br />10. The Blood Is Love - 4/5 - Another very good song that goes a little long. <br />11. Skin On Skin - 5/5 - The sexiest song on the album and another one of my favorites. <br />12. Broken Box - 5/5 - A very dancy song that's sort of reminiscent of Eagles Of Death Metal. <br />13. \\"You Got A Killer Scene There, Man...\\" - 5/5 - Another very sexy, slow song with very sexy guest vocals/whispers by Brody Dalle and Shirley Manson. <br />14. Long, Slow Goodbye - 5/5 - An ambient, but beautiful song to end the album. <br /> <br />In short, the Queens have injected a couple of doses of sexy into 'Lullabies To Paralyze' and it is my favorite album so far...
B0000C8AVR|2.0|Highway 61 is a 'masterpiece, the best rock album ever'.etc.etc. Even if I listened to this record stoned off my head I could not begin to share the sentiments of many of the reviews I have read on this album. Dylan, in my opinion, ranks as one of the most overrated musicians of all time. As a social activist and lyricist he was fantastic; but as a singer, a songwriter and composer of melodies he is nowhere near in the class of the greats (I'm sure you'll know who I'm talking about). <br /> <br />So before you rush out to buy this album, let me tell you a few things. <br /> <br />Prior to purchasing this album, I had heard 'Like a Rolling Stone' which, strangely enough, was rated 'Top song ever' by Rolling Stone Magazine, named after the song itself (strange, isn't it?). A good, revolutionary song I thought...what's so great about this Bob Dylan guy? So I went to Amazon.com and read all the reviews...all were praising so I thought, this MUST be a safe choice. But I suppose things surprise you now and then. <br /> <br />So they were selling Highway 61 for less than half price, so I picked it up. Then I listened to it the whole way through twice. And was like, 'what was THAT?' I couldn't even remember a single melody, save the first song. It was just a nasal voice sounding over instrumentation. No complex melodic structure, no interesting instrumentals, nothing. So what if it's the most brilliant poetry you've ever heard, if it doesn't sound good then it's not good music. For a start, the second track, 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' sounded very flat and tuneless. Other dissapointments included 'Tombstone Blues', and basically EVERY other track on the album. <br /> <br />But I guess if so many people like this album, why should you listen to me? I won't tell you whether to buy it or not, but from a personal standpoint these are the nine most overrated songs in Rock 'n' Roll.
B000001FKY|5.0|Every once in a while an album transcends it's own genre to become part of the mainstream.  It's even more rare when the genre is hard rock.  AC/DC's Back in Black did it.  And, with this cd, DL did the same.  There are several songs on here that make even the most conservative music lover reach for the volume knob to \\"crank it\\" when the first snippets of the song reach their ears.  It is simply perfection in its production, musicianship and songwriting.  This one should be part of everyone's collection for those moments when you want to play drums on your steering wheel in 5 o'clock rush hour traffic.
0140177396|5.0|I started this book in high school thinking that is was going to be boring, a stereotypical classic.  When I finished it, my thoughts about it were totally different.  The enthralling story takes place on a dusty California ranch, with a wide variety of characters.  Steinbeck uses the most descriptive language I have ever seen an author use.  His writing not only describes to you the setting, but it also puts you in it.  To show more proof to you kids who think this is still a boring classic, behold: swearing!  Steinbeck does not hold back in language; this is to show a large amount of emotions, as well as to give the story a flair. <br />This is the story of two men's friendship, which they hold, despite handicaps and obstacles that block their way.  A surprising ending caps off the story as a very, very good book (no wonder all the adults like it).  Also, it's a short read: only a little over a hundred pages.  Believe me, you'll like it.
B00005A46T|5.0|I have been a fan of Slipknot for quite awhile. I bought the self titled and only listened to Wait and Bleed..i really wasnt into screamin at the time. A couple of years passed and i heard My Plague and i immediatly picked Iowa up and it made me get into screaming in music. Now about the album. Iowa is the epitomey of heavy the lyrics are furious and angry and makes u wanna beat the f*ck outa something on occasions. The bad part is its very repetitvie in riifs. I would give it 4 stars but its the reason i like so many bands like mudvayne, death, cannibla corpse, deicide, coal chamber, black dahlia murder, vader, Cryptopsy etc. And it was rushed and it was still good. Peace out f*uckers.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Any movie going audience with half of Frankensteins brain would run screaming from the room if they were unfortunate enough to cast a glimpse of this trainwreck. This is a pure example of trying to use CGI to distract the viewer from noticing the complete lack of a tangible or entertaining storyline. If you're a filmographer studying computer imagery, this is a good film for research, otherwise it's sole value as a DVD is as a coaster for the drink you're going to need after watching it.
B0007O38F8|3.0|Probably deserves closer to 2 and a half stars but... Back before 50 Cent made it big with \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\", he was a hungry MC who had some skills and had things to rhyme about but now he's reduced to just talking about guns and his ego which gets very tiring after a few songs.  GRODT was a good album with some original ideas and rhymes but now he's just recycling.    1. Intro - Weird intro with plenty of gunfire.    2. In My Hood - I like this song. It's a nice start to the album with some crisp rhymes and a tight beat. However, it's no \\"What Up Gangsta?\\" 8/10    3. This Is 50 - Great song. 50's rhyming style on this song is very creative and he's got some good lyrics. The beat is very good. 9/10    4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight - Best song on the album. This is an excellent song about people trying to kill him and Eminem's dark beat is great. 10/10     5. Piggy Bank - Pretty weak diss track. He's only throwing about a line or two at each victim (Jada, Nas, Kelis, Fat Joe, Ja) and the beat isn't impressive. 6/10     6. Gatman and Robin - I don't know what it is but the title if funny to me. The beat is an annoying sample of the Batman theme but Em's got a decent verse while 50's just getting old already. 7/10     7. Candy Shop - Overplayed. Good beat with some ok rhymes. 7/10     8. Outta Control - Club song. Good beat by Dr.Dre and some ok lyrics from 50 but they're still not really about anything new. 7/10    9. Get In My Car - Very nice song. Funny lyrics and a good beat. 50 has the ability to be humorous but doesn't choose to do so very often. 9/10     10. Ski Mask Way - This sounds like a song Biggie would have done (but better). Good beat, hook and lyrics but nothing outstanding. 8/10     11. A Baltimore Love Thing - Great song. Very creative of 50 to rhyme as heroin to the addict. Good lyrics and beat. 10/10     12. Ryder Music - OK song. Nothing really to this one other than a slow beat and some slow rhyming from 50. Catchy but not great. 6/1013. Disco Inferno - I don't like this song. It's so generic and definately a radio-friendly song. 5/10     14. Just A Lil Bit - Ugh. That chorus is annoying and seems to make up 90% of this song. Nothing new from 50...again. 4/10     15. Gunz Come Out - Good song. Dre provides a nice, dark beat while 50 rhymes over it with lyrics of violence and guns but after the last 2 songs, it's welcome. 8/10     16. My Toy Soldier - Pretty good. Yayo provides a good verse and 50's pretty tight. 7/10     17. Position Of Power - Nothing that stands out here but it's not bad. Go ahead and give it a listen. 7/10     18. Build You Up - Supposedly Jamie Foxx sings on this but you can't really tell that it's him. Kind of an annoying beat and a forgettable song. 6/10     19. God Gave Me Style - This isn't that bad. 50 decides to take time away from his guns to give God a shout out to thank him for making 50 so great. 7/10     20. So Amazing - Do not listen. I don't know how 50 can insult Ja's songs and then make a horrible song that Ja would make. This is awful, talk about hipocrisy. I don't know what 50 was thinking. Olivia takes over for Ashanti on the annoying chorus that goes on forever and 50 rhymes about nothing. 2/10    21. I Don't Need Em - Very nice song. Good beat and rhymes to (sort of) end the album. Not very long but still a good song. 9/10      22. Hate It Or Love It Remix - The original version is better with just 50 and The Game but with Banks, Yayo, and Buck, it gets too crowded and they just force in short verses. 8/10    Summary - Disappointing
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now Redux is NOT a sequel to Apocalypse Now- it is really the director's cut of Apocalypse Now. It was released in 2001- and the orginial was released in 1979. This version is just as good as the orginial, adding in 49 minutes of additional footage- and the footage is described below:    -The extended version of the scene where Willard (Martin Sheen)meets up with Kilgore (Robert Duvall)- Director Francis Ford Coppola makes a cameo in this scene.    - A new scene of Kilgore rescuing a child.     - Scene with aircraft bombing the treeline has been extended and has new effects.    - Scene showing Kilgore giving Lance (Sam Bottoms) new swim shorts and Willard stealing Kilgore's surfboard  and then it shows Willard and the Navy guys hiding from Kilgore's choppers.     - Scene with the Navy guys admiring their Playboy mags.     - Scene showing Willard talking about Dilantenes.    - A 10 minute sequence of Willard and the Navy guys finding 2 Playboy playmates and Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance having sex with them.     - After Clean (Laurence Fishburne)'s death- this is the most famous new footage- the 25 minute French Plantation sequence- featuring Christian Marquand and a whole bunch of other actors. This scene consists of Willard finding the French people, Clean's funeral, dinner with the French people (during this part of the sequence- the French told Willard how they felt about the war- which is what made this version of the film better.) And, Willard having sex with a French widow named Roxanne (Aurore Clement).     - The last of the added footage shows Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) reading an article to Willard.    Words cannot describe the brilliance of this film. Ok, lets put it this way. This film holds a tie as the greatest war film ever made (with Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993)) No one should miss this film. Nobody. This film is a classic and will remain a classic.    Overall rating: 10/10
037571457X|5.0|The thing that really impressed me about this book, was the truthfulness with which the author recalls her childhood impressions and feelings about the Iranian Revolution and the following period. <br />Her story is a compelling one, that it is viewed simultaneously from an adult and and a child's perspective makes it extraordinary.  <br /> <br />Wow!
6305609705|5.0|Apocalypse Now is one of those films that in it's genre, is near impossible to match. This film is extremely good, and is absoultely recommended for ANY war/drama film fan. This film is at times violent and very disgusting, such as chopped off human and animal heads and full frontal male nudity. Still, that doesn't and can't affect this grand masterpiece, and it is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films. His other epic films are The Godfather (1972) The Godfather Part II (1974) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) the director's cut of Apocalypse Now.  <br /> <br />This film is a perfect example of demonstrating that war is madness. AND IT REALLY IS. In 2001, Coppola re-edited this film extending it's running time from 2 hours 33 minutes to 3 hours and 22 minutes. This version is called Apocalypse Now Redux and it is just as good as the orginial. An outstanding film that is not to be missed. And this film is NEVER boring.  <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 9/10
B0000AQVCL|1.0|LOOK UP \\"THE BEATLES,REVOLVER\\" NOW HOW MUCH DOES THIS CD LOOK LIKE THAT ONE? ALOT! SO MANY BANDS HAVE TRIED TO COPY THE BEATLES AND FAILED. THIS ONE ISN'T ANY DIFFERNT.

AFTER ALL THEY ARE BASICLY THE SAME THING. EXEPT THE BEATLES KICK WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MORE ASS!!!!!!!!
B000001DVD|5.0|Unleashed on the buying public in 1981, this is the Lep's sophomore release. The album features a striking cover by Hipgnosis (these guys were EVERYWHERE during the 70's and 80's). Produced by John \\"Mutt\\" Lange (of AC/DC fame), this record is an improvement from their first release, but they are still trying to get out of the shadow of AC/DC.  Do they succeed, or do they try to cash in on the AC/DC sound? Here are my reviews of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />\\"Let It Go\\" - Wicked guitar intro introduces the melody and song. A thick, thumping bass kicks in followed by Joe's vocals and surging guitars.  Joe sounds great!  A fast paced rocker that hits on all cylinders.  Nice harmonizing during the bridge, and then the song kicks into overdrive.  A furious guitar solo. Joe has some great wails.  A great hard rock tune.  \\"So stop your stallin' and your bitchin'\\"! Perfect! Classic! This song received alot of FM airtime and was a modest hit for the band.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Another Hit And Run\\" - Starts with a midtempo guitar, but builds steam as the bass and drum kick in. Strong bass from Rick Savage (this song was co-written by him).  Strong vocals from Joe Elliott.  Another rocking guitar solo from Clark and Willis (sounds alot like Angus Young of AC/DC).  A great song with tempo changes and a catchy melody.  A very good tune.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"High-N-Dry(Saturday Night)\\" - Opens with guitar intoducing the melody followed by drum and then Joe's vocals.  Bass and rhythm guitar then help drive the song into AC/DC territory.  Joe again shines on this song with some great singing.  Cool lyrics help make the song a winner. Great beat! Many a times I was indeed high-n-dry on a Saturday night! This was another hit for the band that received alot of airplay.  A true classic!  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" - The biggest hit of off this album. A ballad ala Scorpions \\"Still Loving You\\" (definitely NOT AC/DC).  Strong chugging guitars and bass help to make this a hardrock tune.  A very nice guitar solo from Willis and Clark.  Joe really sings with alot of emotion \\"NO! NO! NO OOO!\\".  Another terrific rock-n-roll song.  Great!  Rating - *****  Leads directly into:<br /><br />\\"Switch 625\\" - An instrumental (written by Clark).  Has some nice vocal harmonizing as well as very thick bass and galloping guitar. A pretty decent instrumental as far as these things go.  You don't get bored listening to it. Would make a great song if there were lyrics written for it.  Rating - ***<br /><br />\\"You Got Me Runnin'\\" - Power chords to open the song (AC/DC big time) followed by a thumping bass line and \\"Hey hey hey\\" from Joe.  Strong rhythm helps give it a hardrock feel.  Great vocal harmonizing by the band really helps to give it a poppy feel.  The great vocal harmonizing is what separates them from AC/DC and the other 'metal' bands at the time. Guitar solo is blistering (sounds way too much like Angus Young). Joe once again sounds great.  Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Lady Strange\\" - An unheralded gem of a song.  I really love the way Joe sounds on this cut.  Strong rhythm and bass helps lay a solid foundation for the vocals and harmonizing. A great, haunting melody really gives this song some color. Joe does some of his finest singing.  A very fast bridge really kicks the song up a notch. A very solid guitar solo. A fantastic song!  Rating -*****<br /><br />\\"On Through The Night\\" - I can't understand why this wasn't on their first album, but it's fine with me because this song ROCKS! Joe has a voice made by the rock-n-roll Gods!  He can't help but turn anything into a rockin' treat. A fast paced rocker. Tempo slows during the bridge but picks up into a galloping speed.  Cool guitar solo.  Once more a GREAT song! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Mirror, Mirror(Look Into My Eyes)\\" - Guitars introduce the melody and a strong, thumping bass comes next followed by Joe's vocals.  Joe again is great here.  A fantastic rhythm.  Strong, insistent. ANOTHER flat out great song.  Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"No No No\\" -  Punk meets hardrock!  A very fast paced hard slammin' song.  Easily the heaviest song on the album.  Drums are very predominant as well as the strong bass by Savage.  Sounds a litle like Judas Priest during the chorus (maybe Victim of Changes).  Furious guitar solo!  Joe really belts it out here!  Ends with a repeating \\"NO NO NO NO..\\"<br /><br /> Joe's screaming \\"NO\\" at the end of the album lets us know that they are NOT AC/DC clones!  Sure they have elements of AC/DC that are very obvious but that's not a bad thing!  Def Leppard is able to take that sound and give it their own twist with their very strong vocal harmonizing and melodies.  Overall, this was a CLASSIC, TERRIFIC, MINDBLOWING second release. The inside credits for the album gives a \\"Special thanks to Phil Collen\\".  This is interesting because Mr. Collen would take the place of Pete Willis during the recording of Def's next album. Also, Mr.\\"Mutt\\" would have an even bigger influence on the Lep's sound for their next album.  Was this a good thing or not?  See my review to find out.\\"No No No\\" -  Punk meets hardrock!

B0007GAEW6|2.0|So, every critic and hipster has been wetting themselves since the Mars Volta burst on the scene in the wake of At The Drive In. To put it quite frankly, this CD is overrated. I wasn't floored my De-Loused but both that and this CD are novel, very original, and somewhat compelling albums. Now, if I was to rate this CD on the basis of composition, scope, depth, magnitude, and originality, by all means it would be a 5. But, as far as listenability and songs sticking in your head...no. First of all, nearly every song has 230981 minutes of dead space quirky noises like Omar's solo CD. They didn't even have time to put Frances The Mute, the title track on the album because it clocks in at 77 minutes. How bout drop half the beep boop noises and throw a real track on? Thanx, MV, thanx. Track 1 is so frantic and hyper its pretty much unlistenable in my opinion. The Widow has a few cool melodies but half the track is again wasted. L'Via L'Viaquez is hands down the best song on the CD with its Latin percussion and mostly Spanish vocals, amazing. Track 4 is also really good, well, just track 4, not the accomponing parts of the track. And the last one is good if you have a long drive or like to get high I'm told...about 30 minutes long, maybe good to listen to once a month. So all in all, this CD is 2 1/2 to 3 stars in my opinion. Definately groundbreaking and more original than whats out there now, just slightly less memorable. Then again, I was never the biggest fan of At The Drive In...
B00006LWSF|5.0|BEST F**KING CD EVER I LOVE IT SO F**KING MUCH IT KICKS A*S <br />
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Thickly layered, punishing sound. Blastbeats, monstrous grooves, symphonic chords and a seething wall of vocals - like a heavier, tighter, scarier version of Morbid Angel. Behemoth doesn't have to rely on overt displays of technicality like hyperactive time changes or weird polyrhythms - they take a more simplified approach with their song structures, each part a sonic bludgeon of sheer brutality. That's not to say there aren't incredible displays of technical ability by all, but that's not the sole reason for the existence of these songs. Each has its own theme, its own identity, its own place within the overall flow of the album. It's not at all like death metal in the style of Suffocation or Internal Bleeding - nor is it  black metal by any means. Demigod is a synthesis of the two, essentially death metal with black metal overtones. The closest comparison is Morbid Angel, but that is really a weak comparison at best. Behemoth sounds a thousand times heavier, and there's none of the pointless filler that seems to litter every Morbid Angel album. Anyone who likes death or black metal should own a copy of Demigod - it's one of those rare epics that's destined to be a classic for all time.
B0000X61VE|5.0|As a long distance athlete running 50+ miles a week, I was horrified when I got injured leaving me not running for several long months.  This video was the only thing that saved me.  A really, really good all around workout, it helped me stay toned, without having to do a alot of cardio type exercises that I couldn't do at the time.   <br /> <br />I still use it every few weeks, when I don't have time to go to the gym or do any kind of outdoor exercise.   The music being used is excellent as well; Primal Scream, Revenge, Smithereens, and Seal. <br /> <br />I know there is alot of flak about this video, but thats probably because most people are lazy a**es. <br /> <br />Praise to Cindy and Radu!!!
0743243315|1.0|For a person like me, who hates not to finish reading a book, I had the hardest of the time finishing Brick Lane. Not badly written for a newcomer, but I there are so many other books that,  I think, describe the story of the immigrants in a better way.
B0007P3582|5.0|At first, I thought this album was going to be terrible based on all the reviews, and I had heard some of the samples and they didn't sound to good, but now that I have the album I think that it is actually pretty good. It grows on you more the second time listening through it, it probably isn't overall as good as Get Rich or Die Tryin, but i think that it has more minor hits, such as In My Hood, Postition of Power(awesome begining), and Just A Lil' Bit.

0786868694|3.0|I read all the reviews of this book with interest - Nigella certainly creates polarised responses - people either LOVE her or hate her.  This was the first Nigella book I bought, and on the whole I have enjoyed it.  However, in general, my experience of buying celebrity cookbooks is that I end up with a lovely book that I take great pleasure in reading many times (and drooling over the photos) but on the whole don't make a great deal of the recipes.  I think we buy these books because of the celebrity, their personality, their style and approach to food, not necessarily for a useful recipe resource.  We buy them for the beautiful pictures (and the beautiful people), for the stylish layout, and yes...for the expansive white spaces too.  Wise up people!  Realise this fact, and don't expect the books to be more than what they intend to be - ENTERTAINING. <br /> <br />Now, for some comments for and against the book: <br /> <br />So far I've made the Pumpkin & Seafood Curry (great), the Asian Spiced Kedgeree (again, great, but needed more fish sauce than she suggested) and the Hot and Sour Soup (great).  I have found the recipes easy to follow, quick to put together and lovely to eat. <br /> <br />While there are several recipes on my to-make list (seems to be a general consensus that the Lemon Risotto and Chocolate Cloud cake are fantastic), on the whole, I would say that in total I probably would never make more than about 15 of the recipes in the book.  Quite frankly, many of them simply don't appeal to me (Ham in Coca Cola?  May sound kooky and kitsch, but I think it's  disgusting quite frankly!  The Liptauer looks like congealed vomit, as does the bagna cauda....)  Having said that, this does not mean that I didn't enjoy reading about them - Nigella's saving grace is precisely her style and approach to food - her witty and charming prose makes this book a pleasure to read, whether or not you actually make the food.  Her relaxed and practical advice (e.g. substitutewhatever you've got in the pantry) mixed with her uncompromising love for cooking as a relaxing activity (e.g. references to the joys of 'stoveside pottering', or how the mindless repetitive stirring of a risotto can ease stress, or for entertaining \\"remember that it's not a test of your worth and acceptability: it's just dinner\\") result in, for me anyway, an inspiring read. <br /> <br />My main gripe would be that the book uses both book weight and volume measures - this is a bit annoying - consistency would be better (and my choice would be volume measures all the time).   <br /> <br />One more - the idea of providing 2 pages per section for notes is good in principle (I'm an avid adder of notes), but I think 2 pages at the end of the section is not the way to do it.  If I add notes I do so in and around the recipe, not at the back of the section where I would forget about them.  And, there is plenty of space around the recipes in this book, so that to me I'm actually paying for 20 blank pages that I'll never use. <br /> <br />Oh, and I also have to agree with one reviewer that boiling an egg and dipping asparagus into it is NOT a recipe... <br /> <br />On the whole though, its a book I have enjoyed greatly because it has inspired me to approach cooking as relaxation, as something that should be intrinsically enjoyable, not a chore. <br />
0553573403|5.0|After the horror of reading Robert Jordan and wanting to tear my hair out at idea that popular fantasy lauded such mediocrity, I was very cautious picking up another book by an author for whom I'd heard nothing but endless praise.  When I started \\"A Game of Thrones\\", I knew just in reading the first few pages that George R.R. Martin wasn't just a popular, yet run of the mill writer, he is, in my opinion, a grand storyteller on a level of his own.  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is not just an important work of fantasy, it is an essential work of fiction for anyone who adores a fast-paced, involved storyline.  In the first book of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", Martin introduces his readers to the inevitiably tragic Stark family, who, thrust into the center of world-changing events, are ripped apart and scattered, each character, from eight year old Arya to her heart-hardened mother Catelyn, tells a tale which feeds into a larger picture.  Martin has meticulously crafted a story which involves personal relationships as well as warfare and politics, and though his world includes countless characters and details, each person holds his own within the book, and is a well-developed, believable entity.  These characters are Martin's masterpieces- and the author writes of them with love and empathy so that as his readers, we come to love them or hate them too.  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is absolutely flawless fantasy, and \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is an essential collection of popular fantasy for anyone who loves a great story.
006056492X|5.0|I think young people may have trouble understanding this book, which is about the experience of life. Told with great compassion, Vonnegut, in fact and in fiction both, is a mature man looking back on the tragedies he saw in his youth. Being \\"unstuck in time\\" can be seen as a metaphor for intrusive post-traumatic memories, and dissociated dreams, both of which happen to someone who has undergone great trauma. Vonnegut had the horror of his mother committing suicide when he was home on leave in WWII, and going from there to being a prisoner of war, seeing his friends shot and being forced to dig for rotting bodies in Dresden.  <br />  Ethan Hawkes does a superior job of reading the book, gentle and without irony. I recommend his audiobook. ( Although I think they put pictures of World War One soldiers on the cover for some strange reason. )
0393317552|4.0|The reviews of this seem to jump around from really positive to downright nasty. This strikes me as being more a measure of the reviewers' agendas then reasonable measures of the book. I come at it from the standpoint of a lay person, with no real knowledge about this topic but with the interest of a fairly intelligent person. As such, I find the book really compelling, thoughtful, interesting. Many of Diamond's theories make sense to me and I'm glad to have had them explained. He touches on so many things that there's something of interest for everyone. I bet that even the people who think this was \\"boring, boring, boring\\" have left it with ideas in their head that they wouldn't have had otherwise. This is the sort of book that you can't help mentioning again and again in casual conversation. That's what I love about it. It activates and spurs thoughts and makes one excited about knowledge. <br /> <br />The things I'm critical of aren't that big a deal. I don't always find Diamond easily readable. This book is somewhere between a popular book and a text book, but it's not exactly either. There are a lot of \\"as I mentioned in the previous chapter and will cover in more depth in chapter eight\\" sort of moments, and this can feel a bit repetive. Also, time and again he poses questions, talks about possible answers, then heads off on to the next thing. There's very little feeling of closure, except in the way he comes back again and again to his fundamental theories. <br /> <br />But anyway, if this topic interests you this book will not disappoint. I thank the author for writing it, and after I've let my mind drain a bit I'll probably pick up his new book, Collapse.
0440234743|4.0|I have to admit I wasn't thrilled with the last couple of John Grisham books. I picked up a copy of The Testament at a local library book sale for a twenty-five cents and thought about reading it. As I was driving home, I decided that if The Testament was similar to the last two, I would cross John Grisham off my list of favorite authors. I wasn't sure if his writing style had changed, or if it was just me changing what I want in a book; but either way, I didn't want to struggle through any more boring books. I guess you could say this was Grisham's last chance to keep me as an avid fan.<br /><br />I'm very thankful that I decided to give Grisham one more chance! In my opinion, this book is right up there with his all time greats, The Pelican Brief, Street Lawyer, etc.<br /><br />From the beginning the story of Troy Phelan grabs you and won't let go. Troy is a billionaire who is tired - tired of his family fighting among each other, tired of running his many companies, but most of all, tired of living. Troy plans to have all of his children from three previous marriages in his corporate headquarters for the signing of his last will and testament. Since his children believe he has a brain tumor and will soon be dividing up $ 11 billion, they are eager to attend. Each ex-wife and her children are seated in a different conference room separate from the other family members. Troy, his attorney, and three psychiatrists are in a conference room and video cameras transmit the proceedings. The psychiatrists are there to verify that Troy is of sound mind and therefore the last testament will stand up under any scrutiny. After the meeting breaks up, with cameras still rolling, Troy surprises everyone by producing a different will and testament, signs it and then leaps out the window to his death.<br /><br />As if this mess isn't enough fodder for the entire book, Grisham adds another dimension to the story. It seems that Troy has left the majority of his estate to an illegitimate daughter, Rachel Lane, a missionary in the Pantanal of Brazil. Nate O'Riley, a burned out attorney just out of rehab, is assigned by the firm handling Troy's estate to find Rachel. And so begins a journey that takes the reader through the wilderness of unspoiled Brazilian jungles. We're treated to glimpses of how life is lived in the jungles of Brazil, which brings the reader to wonder, if only for a moment, about our society and lifestyles. Grisham compares the Phelans who are all spoiled, greedy and corrupt to Rachel Lane, who's entire goal in life is to help the Indian tribe she's lived with for several years without what many would consider the necessities of life. It's definitely the old \\"good versus evil\\" plot but made enjoyable with various twists.<br /><br />Grisham has great character development and shows a knack for mixing intrigue with self-study. It does have its predictable aspects, but has enough mystery thrown in to keep the reader amused and entertained. With this book, we not only wonder if we are living life to its fullest, but also wonder about our ideals.legitimate daughter, Rachel Lane, a missionary in the Pantanal of Brazil.

B000002BNB|4.0|Ghostface Killah or Tony Starks' first solo album, Ironman, featuring Raekwon, Cappadonna and the rest of the Clan is a signature Wu sound with the lyrics we expect.  A lot of the tracks for Ironman are samples of soulful and 70's music for Ghost's colorful lyrics.  Some of the titles are of personal experiences like \\"Wildflower\\" and \\"All That I Got Is You\\" with tales of heartbreak and growing up as a child in the poverty striken ghetto.  \\"The Faster Blade\\" is a Raekwon one verse solo on an unusual RZA produced uptempo sound that lends support for this release.  Two of the songs on here were previously released on movie soundtracks, but are key to the album's feel.  The off-beat \\"Camay\\" is like part 2 of the trios' \\"Ice Cream\\" that could be found on Raekwon's Only Built For Cubian Linx.  The hip-hop east coast track looped on \\"Daytona 500\\" is a fast paced relay that arms this solo debut well.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out.  When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to \\"Seven\\" started to float through my mind.  About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to \\"Seven\\".  Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan.  Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well.  About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed.  For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|First off....<br /><br />THIS IS NO DISCOVERY!  THIS IS NO HOMEWORK!  WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF DAFT PUNK BEFORE NOW HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.<br /><br />Ok back to the album.<br /><br />Basically after enjoying the success of Discovery, the French electric-pop duo decided to do another album.  Human after All, which is a total change from their happy-good times dance music.  Daft Punk's huge success with Discovery was I believe their lyrics, and the many different types of songs they created.  This album conversely does not have many spoken words at all.  Except for a couple repetitive songs with one lined words being repeated over and over again, this album practically has no words at all.  Except for the amazing spoken section on \\"Technologic\\".<br /><br />However, when you take away the peppy lyrics of discovery what are you left with.  Music.  Daft Punk in this album re-invents themselves musically by engaging guitars and powerfull chords into many of their new songs.  If Homework was their \\"dance\\" ablum, Discovery was their \\"happy\\" album, then this would be their \\"angry\\" album.  There is not one up-beat song on this album except for \\"Make love\\" and even that is darkened by powerfull chords.<br /><br />This album is not for those who loved \\"around the world\\" or \\"one more time\\", but for those who love the darker-heavy side Daft Punk.<br /><br />I highly doubt Leiji Matsumoto would want to make an anime musical to this album.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br /><br />Human after all, Robot rock, television rules the nation, technologic<br /><br />Least Favorite tracks:<br /><br />Emotion (EXTREMELLY REPETITIVE, BAD SONG FOR A CLOSER), the prime time of your life
B0000A118M|5.0|Where do I begin?  Trane surpasses our understanding with this work of art on record.  FULL of heartfelt expression of love, pain, desire, and a man who fully understands the what grace really is.  The album must be considered as a whole and not in parts.  It is one extended thought.  It is his relationship with God from beginning to end.  The hard times as well as the easy.  The omnipresence of God is in his notes.  There are studyings in Univeristy music classes on this one album.  There are books written on this one album.  Do not underestimate this album.  Do not merely listen to it; study it, analyze it, think about it.  Then pass it down to the next generation so that they will know and understand the greatest musical and artistic gift we've known.
B000002TYX|5.0|The Beatles- \\"Anthology 1\\" two disc set is an excellent purchase- for Beatlemaniacs. Beatles beginners should get their feet wet with a general career spanning best of set like \\"1\\" or \\"Past Masters\\". This is to spark initial interest with can't miss recordings. \\"Anthology 1\\" is for collectors. Many of the songs have inferior sound due to the fact they were shelved away and never officially recorded. However, the historic value of many of these tracks is remarkable. The Decca session recordings that were rejected are here. Two of the Beatles' first recordings done at Abbey Road studios are here, including a spicy cover of \\"Besame Mucho.\\" Other notable gems include 2 tracks recorded by the Beatles as the Tony Sheridan backing band when they lived in Germany, the early and best version of \\"One After 909\\" (it would later appear on the \\"Let it Be\\" record), and several recordings from the famous London Palladium show. And, you get the new track, \\"Free As a Bird,\\" which comes off as a solid yet unspectacular piece. All in all, \\"Anthology 1\\" is a great collectors item. The historical value in the recordings is significant. But it should also be noted that it is not a good starting point for those just stumbling into the Beatles' work because the numbers are often roughly recorded and aren't necessarily their best output. Highly recommended for Beatlemaniacs.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album is huge.It has 26 amazing songs(the only place I've seen more on one album is on a greatest hits).If you have listened to the whole thing through you might think that Roger Waters had gone crazy(he talks about worm lords).But the album is still a masterpiece.This is a must have for anybody.
B000001GQY|5.0|With a bit of skepticism I purchased this CD based on guidance found here and from Gramophone, both endorsing this CD with lavish praise.  How could a recording be THAT good?  Believe me (and them)... it is simply breathtaking stuff.  Seldom does a CD capture such a magical combination of composition, interpretation and sound.  Before Beethoven's Fourth (Concerto) and Chopin's First shared the highest place of honor in my library.  No more.  Brahms' Second is magnificent music and it is with good reason that this particular recording is declared the sine qua non of its performances.  The product of Gilels' piano and the Berlin Philharmonic, under Jochum, is to savor as one would a fine meal or a good book.  The music commands you put down what you are doing and listen.  When it is over you want to hear it again.  The First is equally compelling, although I can fairly recommend Serkin (Szell/Cleveland on Sony Classics) and Curzon (Szell/London on Decca Legends) as admirable readings and strong contenders.  More than a mere \\"makeweight,\\" the Fantasien (Op. 116) are fine performances and a delightful change-of-pace from the \\"more serious\\" concertos.  Like so many before me, I have nothing but admiration and positives for this CD.
B000002KHH|5.0|This album made heavy metal.The guitar War Pigs is so awesome.Iron Man is like an anthem to every guitar player out there.This album is a must have.
B0000CDL93|5.0|So, who do you believe???  Whether you think Stone is Satan or the Messiah, it's impossible to deny the power of this film.  I took the time to read all 243 previous reviews---that's how interested in this topic I am...  I'm impressed with the passion that you've all shown on this subject.  I'd love to tell you I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll, AND give you ALL irrefutable proof that it's the God's honest truth, but who would believe me?  Anyone who cares has already made up their mind.  What would it take (REALLY!) to get you to change your mind?  Have any of you ever thought about that???  I think that when I get to heaven, the first thing I'll ask is:  \\"What really happened on 11-22-63???\\"  But, for me, right now, in this life, I don't care any more about Oliver Stone than I do about Gerald Posner.  In fact, I would add those two to a list that also includes Walter Cronkite, Jim Garrison, Peter Travers, Dan Rather, Jim Marrs, Robert Groden, Earl Warren, Lyndon Johnson, Cyril Wecht and a sh#@load of others (Peter Jennings gets a special FU#@ YOU for his DUNGHEAD comment during a 40th anniversary TV special in 11/03), NONE OF WHOM I'D PISS ON EVEN IF THEY WERE ON FIRE.  How can you believe anyone at this point?  There's enough information out there to build a case for (practically) any theory you want.  I want the fu@#ing truth!!!  I can't believe that after this much time has passed that we still aren't any closer than we were in 1964.  The Warren Commission's investigation was a joke.  So many leads not followed, so many witnesses not interviewed, so many questions NOT ASKED, so many directions not taken...  Arlen Specter's work was pathetic.  He should be ashamed of himself for being that stupid or that naive, whichever is the case.  Humes burns the original draft of his autopsy notes (then later, gives a weak excuse for it), and nothing is done???  LBJ gets the limo cleaned and the interior replaced (BEFORE it can be inspected and photographed--HE DESTROYED EVIDENCE!!!), and nothing is done!!!  More than half the witnesses said they saw and/or heard shots from the grassy knoll/railroad area and the Warren Commission concentrates on those that said the shots came from the 6th floor window???  ALL the Dallas doctors said that the wounds clearly showed the shots came FROM THE FRONT,  but we're supposed to believe that they ALL MADE A MISTAKE and the monopoly on autopsy wisdom resides with the doctors at Bethesda???  A pathologist is 'chosen' to lead the autopsy who had NO (AUTOPSY) EXPERIENCE WITH VICTIMS OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS, and NO ONE DOES OR SAYS ANYTHING!!!  How the hell does something as important as the BRAIN get \\"lost\\"???  All this and more makes it obvious (to me) that there is no simple explanation for what happened.  Military/Industrial complex?  Cuba/Castro?  The Mob?  The CIA?  How 'bout the Secret Service?  Russia/KGB?  Oswald plus others?  How the hell are we supposed to know???  Reading everything that is out there just provides more suspects.  The real crime here is for those of us who are critical thinkers.  We know it's not a 'lone nut', but we're also skeptical of the myriad of other 'ideas' too.  I'm still reserving judgment in the (naive, I know) hope that more TRUTH will come to light before I die.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Were Green Day ever really 'punk', whatever that means? Dookie (which was not their debut by the way) had a lot of mid-tempo songs where the melody and meaning were the major aspect, and even the faster songs tended to be bouncy and catchy rather than particularly angry and heavy. I find the 'they've sold out' attitude disappointing, because these guys are in their 40s and should have matured by then. They've taken in different influences, written something unusual, varied and challenging. <br /> <br />Taking the tracks individually doesn't entirely sum the album up, but there are several which are distinctive. Making the title track the first single might've been a misjudgment, because it's not the most accurate representation of the album, being extremely angry and venemous - and certainly off-putting to anyone of Republican leanings. It's one of the stronger songs, but it's only one string to the band's bow. <br /> <br />At the opposite extreme we have Wake Me Up When September ends, a power ballad about Billie Joe remembering his father's death. While it's not up there with contemplative rock classics such as One by Metallica or All Apologies by Nirvana, it packs a real emotional punch and the vocals are stronger than you can ever expect. <br /> <br />The highlights of the album, for me, are Holiday and Letterbomb, both of which combine the bounce and anger of old with the lyrical structure and inspirational qualities the new Green Day aim for. Lyrics such as \\"I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\\" sum up the feelings of a generation in an articulate way, and ought to be as significant to those who can't understand youth rebellion as a concept. <br /> <br />The concept structuring was a big risk, and surely the reason why the album took 4 years. It's largely successful, telling the tale of a young man's attempts to break free, and his ultiamte failure to make an impression for all his efforts. Elements of this overlap with the seminal Zen Arcade by Husker Du, but this is far more accessible and wide-reaching (and therefore a 'sell-out', presumably?). The five-part tracks worek quite well, although the second one plods a little bit musically. <br /> <br />While I can't regard this as an all-time classic, or a match for the best tracks on Dookie, it really doesn't deserve the criticism it seems to have recieved from elements of all sides. It's not pop, it's not punk, it's not a sell-out, it's not a revolution, it's not the greatest record ever made, it's just a very good rock album.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's because I love all of U2's CD's.  If you are a U2 kind of person, then this is the CD for you because it has some of their greatest hits.  I would recomend this CD to anyone that likes rock n' roll music and that likes U2,either way, they both mix.  This was totally a home run for U2!!!
B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent is talentless. On the album he simply talks over the most simple backing music which is just repeated over and over. This is not what true music is all about. He is just as manufactured as Britney Spears only kids think he is \\"cool\\". It's a case of all marketing and no talent.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I discovered this band a couple years back when thy released their self titled album with the help of Nickelback's Chad Kreoger. I loved them then...and now that the have a follow up, I love them now. This Album is freaking awsome and can easily be listened to without skipping a single track. <br /> <br />My Favorite Track is #7 \\"Say Goodbye\\", which could capture the world with it's sound and lyrics. <br /> <br />#3, \\"No Surprise\\" is sorta on the poppy side, and I didnt really click with it,it's an alright song but not TOAD's best. <br /> <br />Do Yourself a favor and buy this album and support this band! They're gonna be huge! <br /> <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|\\"Closer\\" is a brilliantly smart human drama that is powerful at the very end. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen (who won the Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor Golden Globes and were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor, which were well deserved nominations and wins) give incredibly mesmerizing performances that are their best performances of their careers, thus far! This is Mike Nichols' best film since \\"Primary Colors\\" (1998). It's beautiful, sad, and, at times, trustful. One of last year's best!
1400032717|5.0|I read this book while on vacation in East Africa. It was interesting to be reading about the London suburbs while I was sitting on the beach in Zanzibar... anyways.<br /><br />This book was GREAT!<br /><br />The author captured the autistic character excellently.  The reader is instantly endeared to the main character.  Once you start reading about his adventures, you don't want to put it down because you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />Anyways, I was given this as a gift and I loved this book.  I wouldn't hesitate to give it as a gift to nearly anyone.
B0007P3582|3.0|First off this album isnt a classic but its not a total flop either. When i first listened to this i hated it and now its kind of grown on me but its nowhere near Get Rich Or Die Tryin but if i had the chance again i would've keep my 15 bucks in my pocket maybe if it was more like 5 bucks i'd like it more but keep your money its not worth it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the embodiment of every boy I have ever dated- combined with geekiness and nerdiness of all my high school friends. It is not only pure genius, capturing flawlessly the daily life of your average nerd, it is my bible, my bible in motion. I love everything about this movie. The subtlety of the humor is absolutely brilliant. I don't think that there are many who can't identify with at least part of this poor boy's struggle with the social scene. We have all felt like outcasts at some point, therefore each and every one of us seems to understand, if you have the mental capacity, the tragedy of Napoleon's situation.
B000003AEB|5.0|This album without a doubt is a rap classic, if you havent heard of this cd then u are no rap fan, I can still put this in and just let it roll through every song with hit after hit this is one of my favorite albums of all time i dont think i'll ever get tired of it.
B000002GXX|4.0|This was a weird release, especially with tracks like \\"Journey of the Sorcerer\\". Anyway, here's the rundown: <br /> <br />1. One Of These Nights - Very late night, very catchy. Great way to start.  <br />2. Too Many Hands - Pretty good, with Glenn Frey and Don Felder taking the lead towards the end.  <br />3. Hollywood Waltz - Hmmm, just meh. Very slow and boring for me.  <br />4. Journey Of The Sorcerer - One very odd track. Banjos and haunting lyrics. I'll pass. <br />5. Lyin' Eyes - A very easygoing track by Glenn Frey.   <br />6. Take It To The Limit - Randy Meisner's most well-known song with the Eagles. He has a great voice.   <br />7. Visions - The only song I know of where Don Felder takes the lead. Shame, he's a great guitarist, but he sings pretty dang good as well. <br />8. After The Thrill Is Gone - Another smooth track, with Henley and Frey swapping the lead every one in a while.    <br />9. I Wish You Peace - Bernie Leadon takes the lead again. This was his last album with these guys, and it does sound like a farewell. The song is kind of odd, though. <br /> <br />A good album. The most varied of them all, indeed. Great choice if you're a fan, but this might be a bit much if you're anything less.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This Masterpiece is about to win a Grammy!  It is my favorite song and favorite album of all time.  It is the furthest thing from what you might call \\"simple music\\".  It is uplifting and fills the heart with joy! I have been a big fan of PMG for 27 years now.  The Way Up (TWU) is by far my favorite CD from the Pat Metheny Group (PMG).    It is a wonderful, intense musical journey.  If your a true PMG fan, I think the chances are very good you will really enjoy this CD.  If your not real familar with PMG, you need to give this a try, as it just may change your musical life.    TWU is not something you listen to just a few times and begin to know it by heart.  You really need to listen to this 68:10 song 8 to 10 times before making a judgement.  It brings true joy and happiness every time I play it.  Enjoy!
B000002GVO|5.0|Okay, in all seriousness, here's the rundown: <br /> <br />1. Hotel California - One of my all time favorite songs, and enough reason alone to pick up this album. <br />2. New Kid In Town - This is a pretty good tune by Glenn Frey, and tells a story I'm actually pretty close to home to. <br />3. Life In The Fast Lane - Love this track. Very catchy and memorable.  <br />4. Wasted Time - You really feel the sad loss here. Great song.  <br />5. Wasted Time (Reprise) - The song itself was great, but it didn't need a reprise. Oh well, it's there.   <br />6. Victim Of Love - Another cool rock tune, but it should've come before Wasted Time and its reprise.   <br />7. Pretty Maids All In A Row - A passable song by Joe Walsh. <br />8. Try & Love Again - Randy Meisner's last song with the Eagles. A great song. <br />9. The Last Resort - A fantastic ending to a truly superb album, with Henley teaching an important lesson to us all.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Grab this now. If you want to become an Eagles fan, by all means, start here.
B00063MBU8|1.0|that reviewer is stupid along with simple plan. this is crap that was made for the trash can. if you want good punk, indie turn to ANBERLIN, mae,  copeland, senses fail, the academy is.. and armor for sleep.
B000002GYW|4.0|Actually 3 1/2 stars, rounded. This 1973 release is kind of odd to me, but is still good. Here's the rundown: <br /> <br />1. Doolin-Dalton - Kind of odd, as the song kind of goes back and forth. Still good.  <br />2. Twenty-One - A cool southern rocker, but kind of repetive. <br />3. Out of Control -  A good hard rocker. <br />4. Tequila Sunrise - A truly brilliant song by Glenn Frey. \\"Take another shot of courage.....\\"  <br />5. Desperado - The title track, you really feel the loss here. Sad. Great song by Henley.    <br />6. Certain Kind of Fool - Randy Meisner takes the lead here, and his high voice couldn't fit this song any better. <br />7. Doolin-Dalton [Instrumental] - Ummm.....not really needed. I don't know why this is here, but whatever.  <br />8. Outlaw Man - A catchy western rocker. Pretty cool tune.   <br />9. Saturday Night - A slow love song. Still good, though.   <br />10. Bitter Creek - Slow song by Bernie Leadon. Ummm, weird. Not needed. <br />11. Doolin-Dalton/Desperado (Reprise) - A bit different, but a good way to end this album.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line: A good album by the Eagles, but isn't one of my favorites. Grab it as a fan, otherwise, you could burn the better tracks, or buy it anyway.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|Director Richard Fleischer derailed the Conan movie franchise by making the 1984 \\"Conan the Destroyer\\" much more of a campy adventure than John Milius did with the original 1982 \\"Conan the Barbarian.\\" However, for this 1985 Conan spin-off of a Robert E. Howard inspired creation, the warrior-woman Red Sonja. In the title role is the statuesque model Brigitte Nielsen, making her film debut, with Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Kalidor, the Conan-clone who plays a pivotal supporting role in that he usually only shows up to save the film's heroine. However, given the idea that Red Sonja has been given her warrior strength to avenge the murder of her family and her own violent rape, the idea that a man has to keep bailing her own clearly runs against the character's ideology (and you just cannot ignore that sort of thing when the title character has been empowered by the gods as long as she keeps true to her vows and avoids sex).<br /><br />Arnold is a more engaging character this time around, which is rather easy since nobody is as sullen as Conan, and this is the first time where you really get a sense of fun in one of his movies (his serious resume at that point was the two Conan films and the first \\"Terminator\\"). The problem is that by the time he first shows up the best part of the movie is over, and for every decent moment provided by Arnold there are three or four scenes with Ernie Reyes, Jr. as the annoying Prince Tarn, reducing the movie to something like \\"Home Alone\\" with swords. The plot for \\"Red Sonja\\" involves a quest for a giant green orb and an evil queen (Sandhal Bergman), which makes it a lot like \\"Conan the Destroyer.\\" Indeed, the worst thing I can say about this sword and sorcery effort is that it made me like the Conan sequel a whole lot better, which is not whatt I was hoping for at all.<br /><br />One of the reasons we are surprised by how bad of a film we are watching is that the crew includes cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno and art director Danilo Donati, who usually worked with Federico Fellini, and the music is by Ennio Morricone, who did all of the epic scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. I know that neither one of those two celebrated directors would have touched this project, but one of their assistant directors could have turned in a more competent performance that Fleischer. \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" remains the best Sword & Sorcery film to date, and with his two entries Fleischer gets the lion share of credit for sending the whole genre right done the tubes. Milius is planning a King Conan movie for 2005, so there is hope, but those faintly flickering flames have gotten really small in the last twenty years.nilo Donati, who usually worked with Federico Fellini, and the music is by Ennio Morricone, who did all of the epic scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.

B000002GYN|4.0|This is where they started, back in 1972. But should you start here? Here's the rundown: <br /> <br />1. Take It Easy - A catchy song with lead lyrics by Glenn Frey. <br />2. Witchy Woman - Don Henley takes the lead to this haunting rock song. <br />3. Chug All Night - A cool southern rock song. <br />4. Most of Us Are Sad - As you guessed, this is kind of slow and sad, but it's still good. <br />5. Nightingale - Kind of odd to me, but then again, that's me. <br />6. Train Leaves Here This Morning - Hmmm, just okay in my opinion. <br />7. Take the Devil - A cool rock track. <br />8. Early Bird - A weird tune. Not my taste, but whatever. <br />9. Peaceful Easy Feeling - Another easygoing song by Glenn Frey. <br />10. Tryin' - Underrated track. \\"You can make it if you try.....\\" <br /> <br />A must-buy for Eagles fans, but I wouldn't start where the Eagles started; you might get the wrong idea about their music.
1401201911|3.0|Mark Millar comes up with a simple but interesting idea for \\"Superman: Red Son.\\"  What if the rocket ship carrying the infant Kal-el from Krypton landed in the Ukraine rather than in Kansas?  The idea of Superman wearing a hammer and sickle rather than a big \\"S\\" and standing next to Joseph Stalin on top of Lenin's tomb is certainly captivating.  The problem with \\"Red Son\\" is that Millar takes this idea and goes way too far in finding variations on virtually every significant element of the Superman mythos.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned when this story did not begin with Superman being raised by his Soviet parents on a collective in the Ukraine.  It was not just that Superman landed in America, but that he was found by the Kents.  How they raised him was more important than where he was raised, and Millar skips over that part.  Having President Eisenhower announce that the Soviets had Superman was a nice touch, transferring the paranoia about Sputnik from that period to the threat of a Soviet Superman.  But then there was Millar's reworking of the introduction to television's \\"Superman,\\" which describes the strange visitor from another world who, \\"as the champion of the common worker, fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, Socialism, and the International Expansion of the Warsaw Pact.\\"<br /><br />Millar does not just throw the kitchen sink in with this one, but pretty much every other fixture he can find.  Lois Lane is still a reporter for the \\"Daily Planet\\" but is married to Lex Luthor, the scientific genius of the age.  Wonder Woman shows up and this world has its own Batman on that side of the Iron Curtain and Green Lantern on this side.  There is also a point where you are going to be thinking Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Night Returns\\" than the original story by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster.  There are just so many changes here that keeping track of all of them and figuring out how they are coming into play in the story.  Ultimately, it is not that the Soviet Superman is most different here, but rather Lex Luthor without any rational justification other than the dictates of simple role reversal.  Superman landing in the Ukraine would make him Soviet rather than American, but what turned Lex Luthor into the guy who makes Albert Einstein feel stupid?<br /><br />This three-part comic book story is penciled by Dave Johnson & Kilian Plunkett and inked by Andrew Robinson & Walden Wong.  There are a series of \\"posters\\" extolling the \\"Comrade of Steel\\" in the introduction, but that style is extended in part to the storytelling itself.  A story about a Soviet Superman drawn in the style of Soviet propaganda art appeals to me, especially since I think this one really needed to look different to sell the story and a specific artistic style was clearly available to be emulated.<br /><br />\\"Saturday Night Live\\" did a skit once where Superman landed in Nazi Germany and used his x-ray vision to identify circumcised spies trying to get to Hitler.  That skit had a simple elegance that \\"Superman: Red Son\\" could use more of that approach.  Part of my problem is that I had a strong expectation that Stalin would have used Superman to not just end but rather to win the Cold War, and I was expecting that it was in subjugating the United States and the rest of the West that Superman would experience a crisis of conscience over his Proletarian ideals and the execution of a Soviet master plan for world dominance.  Less would have been more here, and there is a sense in which this story end, in a manner of speaking, where it needed to have begun to tell this variation on the familiar tale.oviet Superman is most different here, but rather Lex Luthor without any rational justification other than the dictates of simple role reversal.

Part of my problem is that I had a strong expectation that Stalin would have used Superman to not just end but rather to win the Cold War, and I was expecting that it was in subjugating the United States and the rest of the West that Superman would experience a crisis of conscience over his Proletarian ideals and the execution of a Soviet master plan for world dominance.  Less would have been more here, and there is a sense in which this story end, in a manner of speaking, where it needed to have begun to tell this variation on the familiar tale.
1594200106|5.0|It is rare to come across a book that stands out from the crowd.<br /><br />This book does just that with its originality, etheral plot, haunting tone and revealing characters.<br /><br />The story follows a young boy resolved to hang onto the past, when the door to his journey opened by his ecentric father reveals a new reality, with danger and intrigue included, which the boy is compelled to conquer, so that he may finally embrace and release his past.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|We can't handle the truth when it comes to a relationship. Yet, we yearn for it. We try so desperately to get it out of the one we love that when we do succeed, it's often a nightmare. How well do we really know each other? Do we ever stop looking for love after we find it? Why do we always hurt the ones we love? Those questions are the basis for Mike Nichols' \\"Closer\\", a film about casual betrayals between our loved ones. \\"Closer\\" comprises of some pretty unpleasent things but you have to agree that it's nearly accurate. <br />As for the acting, Julia Roberts (who could have been better) does OK. Jude Law's role is somewhat similar from his past roles but still manages to give a solid preformance. It's no wonder who the stand outs are. Natalie Portman proves that she's capable of handling herself in all situations most notably where she shares a scene in a strip club with Clive Owen's character. It's both daring and impressive. Clive Owen is of course another other stand out. He probably has the best line in the film, \\"Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!\\" This brings me to another great stand out; the dialogue. Since it was originally written for the stage, most of the dialogue is acted out very theatrically which some viewers may love or hate. Anyone who watches the film will get something different out of it. What I got out of it is this, \\"If you have nothing to hide then you'll have nothing to fear.\\" What my \\"other\\" got out of it was, \\"Don't ask, don't tell.\\" Hmmm. Maybe he has something to hide. Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to get into a fight now.
B00068C7WA|5.0|The perfect collection of 19 songs no fillers just excellent music to soothe the soul..highly recommended...Note this cd is available locally forget the import suggestion.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|After reading the sequel to Bridget Jones' Diary, I was less than thrilled. Helen Fielding's second round with the singleton was not up to par with her first book. The same goes with the movie. I can pop in the first Bridget DVD anytime. It's hilarious, sweet, and as charming as any Austen adaptation should  be; not so with the Edge of Reason. The movie is not funny in any sense of the word. The watcher sees poor Bridget go through one humiliating experience after another, and then there's the whole Thailand debacle. What is this, Brokedown Palace? I can safely say, though, that because of the many horrible changes/additions in the movie that were not in the book, I have a newfound respect for the novel. But what worries me is Fielding had a hand in writing the screenplay for Reason. All I can say is what was she thinking? I suggest reading the book, never the watching the movie, and for everyone to consider Bridget Jones' Diary the only movie!
B0002IVN9W|2.0|I have given this album at least 6 tries. The songs are jst weak.  I suppose i \\"should\\" like it, and maybe the next one will be good, but I'm not impressed
B000000OS2|5.0|This is the unplugged album of all unplugged albums. It was the risk-taker that worked out. It was the one that established the trend and so rarely gets the credit it deserves for that.  It is the one that Rolling Stone forgets when they compile their lists of &quot;important&quot; albums.<br />They render some of their own tunes real well in this, like Heaven's Trail, The Way It Is, and Love Song. The crowd interaction for Gettin' Better makes you really feel you are there in the middle of the crowd. It does take some getting used to though when listening to Modern Day Cowboy as an unplugged version, but it works. <br />What is impressive are some of the takes they have on classic tunes. The Beatle's We Can Work it Out is stunning.  The Stones' Mother's Little Helper is a fun take. Five Man Electrical Band's song Sign was of course the big hit of this album that made a lot of people do a double-take to the possibilities of unplugged renderings.<br />Also included are a couple of Tesla jams in Tommy's Down Home, which has some hysterically funny lyrics sung by Tommy Skeoch, as well as Down Fo' Boogie which is also fun.
B00004D3C1|2.0|there really is no reason to listen to this or any other fu manchu album.  they are the sugar ray of stoner rock.  If you can listen to this then listen to a kyuss album and say fu is better and then take a lie detector test, I will glady give you a mil. <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld has been the classic comedy of the ninenties, for three very good reasons: it's funny, it's hysterical, and it's side-splittingly hilarious. These shows are all fantastic, with the possible exception of the pilot, but, that show is nonetheless interesting to watch. Hours of informative bonus features top off the mix.
B000002HRE|2.0|I have been a fan of Metallica for only about 7 months. I first heard \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" and was amazed. Since then I have gotten every album up to the Black Album and have been blown away by each one. I had heard that starting with \\"Load,\\" the quality of Metallica's albums had dropped, so I put off getting \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload,\\" while I vowed never to get \\"St. Anger.\\" Well, curiosity got the best of me and I bought \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" at the same time. The numerous bad reviews both on this site and by professional critics did not prepare me for what I heard. I have made three guesses as to what happened to Metallica, and here they are: <br /> <br />1. (Putting the best construction on these albums) THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPEAT THEMSELVES- If this is the case, you have to give Metallica credit, even though the experiment failed. They did not want to become an AC/DC, who has released nothing relevant since \\"Thunderstuck\\" about 20 years ago. AC/DC has stuck to pretty much the same formula that got them fans in the first place. Maybe Metallica wanted to keep their sound new, so if this is the case, fans should not be mad at Metallica for trying something new. <br /> <br />2. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE- At the time of these releases, Alterna-metal and country were huge, so Metallica decided, \\"why not combine the two for a new sound?\\" After all, they took the two kings of the early eighties, hardcore punk and heavy metal, and combined them to produce thrash. They continued to produce heavy metal while heavy metal was still insanely popular. Now that the two genres mentioned at the beginning are popular, Metallica decided that they wanted to remain a relevant force in the music business instead of \\"Fading to Black\\" like most of thrash and even heavy metal bands of the eighties. <br /> <br />3. THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE MUSICAL GODS- They figured that no matter what they would spit out, they their fans would like it. In other words, their egos got too big. That would explain Hetfield actually singing here instead of his trademark growl. He decided that since he sounded great singing on \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" (and he really did, he wasn't wrong about that) that he could just sing all of his songs and have them sound great. He seems to have forgotten that the reason that he started using the growl in the first place was BECAUSE he couldn't sing. Metallica has also decided that what they have to say is more important than the actual songs themselves, which would explain the lack of heavy riffs or outstanding solos. With \\"Master\\" and \\"Ride\\" the lyrics were as much of an art as the music was. That was most of the reason that Metallica ruled, because they were the only ones with \\"intelligent thrash\\" while everyone else was singing about Satan and evil. The worst part of all this is that Metallica didn't have that much to say, some of the lyrics just plain suck. With nothing to sing about, it is hard to make a good album (the same problem that Ozzy's Ozzmosis had). <br /> <br />As for the actual album, to be able to appreciate it, you must have an open mind. They still include a bunch of their trademark hooks, which makes the songs somewhat more bearable for me. \\"The Memory Remains\\" is just a watered down \\"The God That Failed.\\" Using Marianne Faithful was a clever trick. Even though her voice is terrible, I'm guessing alcohol, critics have a soft spot for her. Many critics upped their rating for this album just because she was on it (Can you believe she is still putting out albums with that terrible voice?!). I'll let you decide which of the three above was in Metallica's heads when they wrote this, but only fans of alterna-metal or maybe southern rock will be able to enjoy this (I am neither).
B0006U4UAU|2.0|I dont want to bash LCD too much because I do like a lot of the beats and music on the record, though unoriginal at times - but why oh why does the singer have to utter the \\"duh\\" sound after every word he says.  It gets to the point that it's all I can hear while listening to it, that annoying \\"uh\\".  I dont see how this cant bother the average listener, almost every word being over-annunciated makes it sound very pretentious or like the singer has the flu or something.  <br />     I will give the CD a chance to grow on me but didnt think I would have to from the other rave reviews....it doesnt live up to the hype-uh.
B00003CX95|5.0|An instant classic, Braveheart is a magical experience. Although often criticized for being historically inaccurate, the plot was not meant to focus primarily on accurate history, but instead of one man's search for unity among his fellow countrymen.  <br /> <br />Mel Gibson's best performance by far..quite the versatile actor...the music in this film is tremendous as well, adding wonderful flavor to it's ethnic taste.....the fight scenes are exciting and never overly brutal....the love story situations are never overwhelmingly dominant in the film....and most of all, Braveheart, with its intelligent dialogue (gibson's passionate speeches are wonderful), is such an inspirational film for all, a true story of courage and bravery.
B000068FUS|4.0|Principle singer songwriter for the Drive By Truckers, Hood, makes several references to the duality of the Southern thing on an album he claims took 6 plus years to write and record.  What he never mentions, though, is the duality of Southern Rock Opera.  Like most people, I was blown away by this album.  I'm not (by an stretch of the imagination) a Southern rock afficiano, but enjoy The Allmans, Little Feat, early REM, current southern rock like My Morning Jacket, and even Skynyrd on occasion.  I was thrilled that this took many of the best parts of all those bands.  Unfortunately, the schtick of \\"Southern Rock Opera\\" wears a bit thin and hasn't aged as well as you would expect, even after a mere three years. <br /> <br />The duality of THIS Southern thing is it pulls off an almost unheard of musical hat-trick.  Sounds like a masterpiece first few times around, then reveals its true nature - a great bar band playing a Skynyrd tribute in more than just name.  It comes off with repeated listens as ameaturish.  That's not to say the album is bad.  Certainly not.  After all the negative things I've said of the album, I still rate it as one of the most interesting double albums I own (and I own a lot).  \\"Ronnie and Neil,\\" \\"Guitar Man Upstairs,\\" and especially \\"Let There Be Rock\\" are excellent songs, but they could have shaved the spoken-word songs, problematic Southern-life-bashing tracks, and many of the weaker tunes for a great single LP.  Perhaps, I'm just spoiled because I heard \\"Decoration Day\\" before this.  At any rate, Drive By Truckers are still one of the best bands of the 2000's. <br /> <br />Overall: 7 out of 10.
B00000163G|5.0|This album is defitenly 2pac's best album before his death. This album was the first RAP double disc album. It sold around 9 million copies and made him a \\"thug\\" and become very famous. Some tight ass songs are only god cn judge me and all eyez on me and much more. Great lyrics and bomb ass beats.I cant believe Nas used the \\"all eyez on me\\" beat to put into his song called street dreams, WHAT A FAKER. ALL EYEZ ON ME has to be in ur pac collection. THATS IT  <br />
B00025ETIW|4.0|My friend gave me both CDs, he said I should listen to them and I have. I like these guys a lot. They sound as if they have been through more than the average \\"punk\\" life. Helena is my personal favorite of all the tracks. It's sad, kinda creepy, and it has been stuck in my head for a week now. The video is pretty awesome as well, but the I'm Not Okay (I promise) video is better. Wes Andersen-esque videos on MTV make my day. <br /> <br />All in all, I would buy this CD. It sounds more mature lyrically and instrumentally than just about any new punk band out there. Plus, it's energenic and full of cross-references and jokes.  <br /> <br />A well-rounded, mature compliment to anyone's eclectic collection.
B000008M54|5.0|I don't know how I overlooked this gem when I compiled my Amazon list of the 25 best albums of the 1980's, because it was definitely one of my favorites of the decade, and it remains one of the favorites of my personal collection.  It's the best album from Mike Scott and company, nearly perfect in every way, with an often bombastically big sound (one of the band's trademarks). Yet it's a very organic record, relying primarily on acoustic instruments, including some very capable fiddle work from Steve Wickham (especially on the hard-driving \\"We Will Not Be Lovers\\").  And it wears its Irishness on its sleeve.  The engaging title track may be familiar, as it has been used more than once in movie soundtracks.  And there's an awful lot more to like here, from a masterful cover of countryman Van Morrison's \\"Sweet Thing\\", to more traditional-sounding tunes like \\"When Will We Be Married?\\", to a heartbreakingly beautiful musical treatment of the Yeats poem, \\"The Stolen Child\\".  This is one of those albums I revisit every once in a while to remind myself how wonderful it was.  And it still is.
B000059H98|5.0|I remember when this movie came out on video when I was extremely underage to view a rated R movie such as this one. But somehow I came across it, and from that young age (maybe 6, 7?) it was always my favorite movie.  <br /> <br />This film is a masterpiece of liberation; Tank Girl is the poster girl for it. She runs completely wild and free, something we all wish we could do. That is the appeal of this film - feminism, combat boots, and freedom.  <br /> <br />Many people will argue this is a poorly made movie, and yeah in a way it was: they had no money to make it. With what they did have everything was beautifully filmed, and I mean it. Until I heard critics talk of the movie I thought it was as big budget and high cost as any other.  <br /> <br />The playfulness and liberty that is shown in this film is remarkable, and I can only say I miss Lori Petty and wish she was a more prominent actress today. Tank Girl is a movie to watch for some feminine butt-kicking!
0671449028|5.0|We have several bedtime books for our 22-month old son (Goodnight Moon, Pajama Time, etc.) but this one is our favorite!  We always save it for last and enjoy snuggling as we \\"rock, and rock, and rock to sleep.\\"
B0002858YS|5.0|If you have not heard the songs on this, you must. Every instrument is playing something totally unique and different than the rest, and put together it sounds awesome. Of course \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is on this album, but the other songs that are not as popular are just as good. Get it. Go Killers.
630521610X|4.0|Very cool slasher movie that has every stereotype of a teen slasher and acknowledges them all during the movie.  Directed by Wes Craven he even appears in the film as a janitor dressed as Freddy Krueger named Freddy :).  There's even a line in the film: \\"Nightmare On Elm Street was great but all the sequels suck.\\" or something like that.  Anyway I think that having Drew Barrymore's name on the cover of the DVD is deceitful since she is in the movie for about 20 minutes or less.  That's the second movie that I've seen (first being Donnie Darko) that she's played this sort of undeveloped character.  Anyhow the movie keeps you guessing until the very end as to who \\"Scream\\" really is.  I first thought that the principle (Henry Winkler is great) was the killer.  They make you think someone is the killer, than you change your mind, than you change your mind again and again until the end.  It's a good movie, and I've got the sequel with me ready to watch, I'm itching to see it, but I doubt that it'll have characters as good as the first movie or someone who looked as much like Johnny Depp as Neve Campbell's boyfriend in this film.  Courtney Cox ;) will make Scream 2 ok.  Hopefully...
068987474X|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  Greg and Liz's book had an absolutely huge effect on my life.  I have been dating the wrong guys for years and I didn't realize that I should shove them aside to make room for the right one.  I read this book in one night since I couldn't put it down.  I felt like someone was shaking me out of my \\"dating coma\\".  At the time when I read it, I was dating a guy who I found out \\"just was not that into me\\" and I never called him again - ever.  And now I am filtering left and right and am more picky about who I want to date. Life is too short to settle!  I have been telling my friends advice out of this book when they have boy problems - I know that it's a little hard to hear sometimes but it's the truth! <br /> <br />I am going to read this book at least twice a year to remind myself to not settle for less than Mr. Right.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This was my only birthday present.  The year before was the Alien Quadrilogy, so I'll review this by disk like I will that. <br /> <br />1 The Matrix - 4.5/5 <br />This movie was the groundbreaking event that started everything in 1999.  It seems a little isolated compared to the epic sequels, but it's still the best of the three.  The new quality and sound transfers are excellent.  Looks the way it was ment to. <br /> <br />2 The Matrix Revisited <br />This is probably the best of the movie supplemental disks as the documentary is a streamlined flowing feature rather than little segments like the other 2 movies.  Interesting stuff and good cast interviews. <br /> <br />3 The Matrix Reloaded - 4/5 <br />The first time I saw this I hated it and thought it was too long.  Than I realised it's like 2 minutes shorter than the first movie and that it is extremely cool.  I watched the Revisited disk before watching it again, and it gave me a whole lot more respect for the movie. <br /> <br />4 The Matrix Reloaded Revisited <br />Cool segments on the enormous effort it took to make this and Revolutions.  Hats off to the filmmakers and a big F U to those who think they made these movies just to get a couple bucks. <br /> <br />5 The Matrix Revolutions 3.5/5 <br />I liked this better than Reloaded the first time I saw it, but now I realise that it isn't really as good.  It focuses more on the real world than The Matrix.  Cool special effects and a very epic feel. <br /> <br />6 The Matrix Revolutions Revisited <br />Good segments on the making of Revolutions.  It will give you alot of respect for the filmaker's efforts. <br /> <br />7 The Animatrix 5/5 <br />The balance of all these shorts combined makes it better than all of the movies IMO.  The Second Rennesaince Duo are the best 2.  I have indevidually reviewed these. <br /> <br />8 The Roots of the Matrix <br />Extremely modern and over my head.  They're brand new.  If I had been tired I'd have fallen asleep during this explanation of the philosophy and ****. <br /> <br />9 The Burly Man Chronicles <br />A continuous piece of the consecutive filmings of Reloaded and Revolutions.  Somewhat grueling, but that's good because it shows you how filmmaking for real is a grueling process and not as glamorous as it's made out to be.   <br /> <br />10 The Zion Archive <br />A whole lotta ****.  Pictures, and stuff.  Ad for the new game which looks like crap.  It's a good disk.  Character bios, sets, all the ships are here very good. <br /> <br />Get off your *** and get this!  Unless you think the Matrix movies suck, than U R CRAE Z. <br />
B00000I8UJ|5.0|A spectacular album, easily one of the greatest ever made. Buy it now.
B00005ASHM|3.0|w/ all due respect, the reviewer that pointed this album out as not being the greatest due to it's outside influences is full of . . . well, he's mistaken. this album is not the best for a simple reason really, brian wilson didn't write good lyrics. i'm definitely not going to say that the beach boys weren't talented musically, but the lyrics to PET SOUNDS, and every other beach boys' album, aren't good. the album also falls far short of SGT. PEPPER'S, and some other albums, sonically. bob dylan, the beatles, the velvet underground/lou reed as a solo artist all created great works of art. PET SOUNDS is not a work of art; it's just nice to listen to. again, don't get me wrong; it is nice to listen to. it's a great pop album.  <br /> <br />i think this is definitely worth owning, but be realistic people.  <br /> <br />p.s.  <br />REVOLVER isn't in the beatles' top 3 albums [SGT. PEPPER'S, WHITE ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD]; i don't know how it'd find it's way to the #1 album of all time considering this.
B000003TBP|5.0|\\"Odelay\\" is the album that established Beck as a superstar, and for good reason. It's an adventurous, yet insanely catchy melange of genres loaded with pop hooks and samples galore. <br /> <br />From the trigger-fuzz blues/rock/pop of \\"Devil's Haircut\\" to the resigning, affecting folk of \\"Ramshackle\\", and everything in between..you never know what will pop out next. <br /> <br />\\"Novacane\\" goes from Texas to New York in its course, seemlessly blending bluesey passages with hyper white noise and computer blips. \\"The New Pollution\\" has this turbelent, 1950's black & white pop feel, with commercial-esque interludes and stylish, jazzy saxophone samples.  <br /> <br />In terms of sampling, \\"High 5\\" puts everything else to shame; the dancefloor/raucous hip-hop number even samples a previous track from the album. How wacky is that? \\"Where It's At\\" is also a massive collage, and surely one of the most unlikely pop hits in recent years. <br /> <br />Other highlights include the heartbreaking folk of \\"Jackass\\", the sugar rush indie-rock of \\"Minus\\", and the infectious twang-covered pop of \\"Sissyneck\\".  <br /> <br />In theory, the album is a total mess. But Beck's knack for crafting clever, catchy pop songs makes this cut and paste job stick together and work a good 95% of the time.
6304056958|5.0|THE WOMEN, Clare Boothe Luce's blistering all-female comedy, has lost none if little of it's hilariously catty humour, more than half a century since it was originally released.  George Cukor directs the picture which stars almost every single female performer who was signed to MGM at the period.<br /><br />Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) discovers that her husband is having an affair with money-hungry perfume counter girl Chrystal Allen (Joan Crawford).  Aided and abetted by her cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) and her army of girlfriends, Mary sets out to win back her man...and teach Chrystal a lesson or two in the process!<br /><br />Other main roles are taken by Joan Fontaine as the meek little Peggy Day, Paulette Goddard as  wisecracking Miriam Aarons, Lucile Watson as Mary's wise mother and Mary Boland as the hilarious Countess DeLave (who keeps wandering around ruefully talking about \\"l'amour\\"!).  Virginia Weidler plays Mary's daughter.<br /><br />George Cukor earned his reputation as a \\"woman's director\\" thanks to this film, and while he was exceptional in drawing out thrilling performances from his leading ladies (Ingrid Bergman in GASLIGHT springs to mind), he was also no slouch in directing men.<br /><br />The Technicolor 'fashion parade' sequence is quite gimmicky and drags the pace of the film down; indeed it does nothing to advance the story.  However, this is just one small quibble.  THE WOMEN is a comedic masterpiece and justifiably so.
B00079018K|1.0|I wouldn't know if this cd is good or not.  I haven't been able to listen to it.  It's a lot of trouble to authenticate a cd I bought, waste a cd burning it on to ANOTHER cd I'm not going to use just to get it on my ipod. It's a shame too, I'm sure this cd is great.  If I see the anti-piracy sticker again, I'll just get it on itunes or live without it.
0380789035|1.0|The book starts out in prison, and immediately kills the first nice character that comes along - Shadow's wife. He is released, and heads for home.  We are told of this great love they had, but there is no emotion in this character whatsoever.  The next female character devours a partner in the act of sex as he worships her as a Goddess.  Honestly, I gave up shortly thereafter. This book did not kindle my interest at all. I had hoped it would be spiritually uplifting, something to link Americans with the deities of their own land. Instead, it began ugly and dark, and I saw little to cause me to think it would improve. Very disappointing, considering that friends had recommended this as a must read. It's a work of fiction, of course, and it seemed to be in the genera of books that take themselves too seriously, where darkness somehow equals depth.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral offers a gripping storyline, excellent acting and direction and a lot of edge-of-your-seat excitement that doesn't falter in the least bit (although it's nearly a 2 hour movie which isn't common anymore.) Just from the moment Collateral started I was glued to the screen. This film's taut atmoshpere, great dialogue, and great acting from Foxx and Cruise makes this an extremely watchable thriller.<br />Jamie Foxx plays Max, an LA cab driver who inadvertently gets involved with the murders of 5 people from a hitlist being carried out by a contract killer named \\"Vincent\\" played by Tom Cruise. I won't go into details, but this storyline is executed very well and doesn't get confusing or complicated at all like what happens with a lot of films of this nature.<br />And there can't be enough said about the performances from Foxx and Cruise in this one. Playing almost parallel-like characters (Max a hard working man trying to make ends meet who values people and their company, Vincent a contract killer who values no one's life) made watching Foxx and Cruise on the screen a very interesting thing to watch. Plus to see Cruise playing a character such as this was a breath of fresh air in his career in my opinion.<br />Great thrills, a lot of excitement and some really great acting makes Collateral a film I would recommend.
B000069AUI|5.0|As a music fan, I have to say that this is one of the best albums ever, probebly the best one in the recent years. <br />Coldplay give us 11 great song, so great that I can't pick only one favorite song so this is the shortest list I can write: <br />Clocks, God put a smile upon your face, In my place, A rush of blood to the head. <br />Voice of lead singer, Chris Martin, is outstanding and the music made by the rest of the band is absolutely tremendous. <br />Recomended for ALL music lovers. <br /> <br />      DON'T MISS IT!!!! <br /> <br />
B000003S0D|5.0|Lizard is a musical anomaly:  It's not rock, it's not jazz, and it's not 20th-century.  Where the heck do you shelve this?  Every other Crimson album is recognizable as rock with jazz and classical influences.  But this not only doesn't sound like rock, it doesn't even sound like prog rock. <br /> <br />And that's part of what makes this a great album.  This is a seriously dark album.  It's also so dense that it takes many repeated listenings to get what's happening.   <br /> <br />The first time I heard it I thought it was the worst album ever.  About one year later I gave it another try and suddenly there were things that made more sense.  If they could make Lizard HCl to help it absorb into your system a bit faster, maybe this album would be easier to appreciate. <br /> <br />A lot of folks have already broken the album down into respective songs, but I'll just say listen to it, put it on the shelf, take a year off, and come back to it.  The more you listen the more this makes sense.  In fact: <br /> <br />Yesterday I fast-forwarded through the whole album on my CD player.  Hearing brief snippets every 2-3 seconds (or however the FFWD works) gave me a new perspective on how the music arcs.  If you're familiar with the album, try it, it's fascinating.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|Do not listen to reviews that tell you that they don't sound like Nickelback, because they do. What is wrong with that. Nickelback is a great band and TOAD are on their way. It is nice to hear a band that incorporates great writing with great songs. These guys can sing and play. The standout song on the album is Santa Monica. (Not a cover of the old Everclear song) Hopefully they will release this song as a single. I hope more people warm up to this kind of music so that this band has a chance of making it beyond 3 albums, which seems to be a barrier for most rock bands playing today. Good luck guys and keep rocking. Since the new Nickelback album does not come out till the fall, thank you for an appetizer for the summer. Hope to see you on the road.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I thought not much of it... <br />...before I watched it. <br />Then it became a revolution: Napoleon was an instant classic. <br />But this is no Wizard of Oz, Godfather, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings mind you.  And this is not Ace Ventura, Austin Powers, or any other Comedy.  This is something beyond comedy.  It's a new genre. <br />The only reason one would label it a comedy is because it makes you laugh.  But no, comedies make people laugh because it takes a certain level of understanding or logic or knowledge to understand the jokes they make.  They are funny because of irony, puns, hints of stupidity and sometimes crudeness.  <br />This is not funny because of irony, puns, crudeness or just hints of stupidity (while some may argue that the film is just stupid).  It is because of the personalities contained in the film.  The way John Swihart molded these characters is a masterpiece. <br />When I finished watching this movie I discovered I had a headache, but I never wanted this movie to end.  You fall in love with the characters, and feel like they are your best friends, regardless of whether you are a \\"nerd\\" or if you are dubbed most popular.  The relationship between viewer and actor is linked in a way like never before.  So you end up with a warm feeling inside and a funny feeling, knowing that life can be stupid sometimes, just like this story.
0767834739|5.0|I think this is better than the original because it has a lot of action in it but as far as being a zombie movie of sorts it leaves a bit to be desired. For starters, the Resident Evil movies are not very graphically bloody which is what I like with zombie movies. I personally think DAWN OF THE DEAD the original is the best zombie movie ever made because it is realistically gory.  <br />I read the book to Resident Evil Apocalyse and I was sorely disappointed. I thought there really wasn't much about zombies in it but when I saw the movie I changed my mind. Probably because of the action.  <br />I think with this film series they changed genres. The first was really sci fi horror. But the second is really sci fi action.  <br />If you\\"re looking for a good movie that was made from a video game check out House of the Dead.It has more gore than Resident Evil Apocalypse and is probably a better zombie movie. But I like Resident Evil 2 better.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Okay, some of the long time fans of QOFTSA are not sold on this becase Oliveri is gone.  While Oliveri is a great bass player I can honestly say I do not miss his \\"death metal\\" vocals.  Granted this CD is different from \\"Songs...\\" but still great. It took me a couple of times through before this CD really struck a note with me.  Now I really love it.  Lullabies\\" is not as heavy overall as \\"Songs..\\" but I feel as a whole these songs in a lot of ways are stronger.  Check out \\"Burn The Witch\\".  Listen to this tune a couple of times and you want be able to get it out of your head.  Totally cool groove on this song.  As I said it is different from \\"Songs...\\" but still very good.  Check it out.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I thought Donnie Darko was a great portrayal of how we long for so much more than we usually take the time to realize in life.  It shows that we can be in control of many aspects of life; many aspects that most people never even realize.  Most people would have been asleep to many of the details Donnie was able to perceive about people (such as the fakeness of Jim Cunningham and the sincerity within his English teacher).<br /><br />I do not think this movie supports the usual existentialist claim that we create our own meaning in life.  The movie recognizes there is more than just becoming aware of and controlling as many aspects of life as you can.  Donnie chooses his own death in order to save his girlfriend not because it his simply the path he chooses, but because it is one of those moments that in the words of the movie \\"reminds you beautiful the world can be.\\"  In the end, I think the movie instead affirms that there is a best way of living with the choices that we have.
B00081PPX8|1.0|I hope nobody buys this item - it is clearly a bootleg. The seller has negative feedback for selling burned copies of shows. This is not an import. While it is true that the first single-disc release of Atlantis has come out in the UK, it does not look like this and is not region 1.<br /><br />The real Stargate Atlantis region 1 DVDs are not due until later this year. The first release, which contains the 88-minute pilot episode \\"Rising\\" is due on June 7th, and the full season 1 set is due in the Fall (rumors say November.) The pilot DVD will retail for around $25 (and cost much less on Amazon) and the boxed set has a suggested retail price of $70 and will probably go for about $50 on Amazon.<br /><br />Don't give your money to these pirates for shoddy burned copies.
1573226521|5.0|How else can I describe this but a masterpiece? I'm not even looking at it in terms of age here (Garland wrote it in his late twenties if I'm not wrong). I'm comparing it up there, with all the masters, and this is definitely one of the best books dictating Gen Y, the generation of IT, computer games blah blah. A truely wonderful book. It will leave you thinking. It will leave you wanting! It has the power to pull you into Richard's world and you will dream of joining him in his journeys (at least I did). An amazing experience. <br /> <br />  One of the things that made it score so well with me was it's wonderful plot. The plot of the search of a paradise but not actually finding one (a la The Lord of the Flies). The second thing is Garland's expression. He uses simple yet engaging expression to convey a story. he is delightfully sarcastic at the right times, relating the reader well to Richard. you can almost feel Richard's anger, frustration and elation. It's almost as if everything is happening in front of your eyes. His story is also insightful and full of depth with appropriate sidetracks now and then. The story flows smoothly without a hitch. <br /> <br />  It's one of the best books I have ever read. A firm favourite of mine! The very best of garland
B000002GLV|5.0|I agree with all the reviews written here except that no one mentioned the genius of \\"Exercise in a C Major for Harmonica\\". This has got to be one of the best live performances ever. To anyone who has never listened to this album, after you purchase it I recommend you skip right into this song, you will not be disapointed.
0393316041|5.0|Dr. Feynman was a person who showed us that you could be trapped in an 8 x 10 room with nothing but your curiosity and imagination and amuse yourself your entire life.  <br />In this book, he comes down hard on pseudointellectualism, fakery, hype, and  good old fashioned stupidity. <br />He proves that scientists have more not less common sense than the rest of us. Read this book and change the way you think
1573223085|5.0|Clients and friends kid me about all the business books that I somehow get to read.  Then they ask me what the best one is.  There isn't one, but A Whole New Mind is right at the top.  Especially if you're looking for that rare combination of topic, advice, and storytelling, Dan Pink has absolutely nailed it!  Reading this book will have  you wondering about the future of not only your work, but your family and your life as well.  More importantly, it shows a way past the wondering toward doing something that makes sense.
B0006399FS|5.0|Let's face it. Some people don't know any better. I suppose that it is not surprising that so many characters have stood up to put down \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\" Astonishing.With the better than 95 percent musical trash that constantly barrages the senses, it must be difficult to register a musical masterpiece on one's radar when it finally comes. Or maybe it's just that some people enjoy the sense of power that comes from indiscrimately criticizing without first taking the time to really listen and understand what they are listening to before they trot off to listen to the latest derivative rock crap.  If truth be told, I have never been a die-hard U2 fan. But there is a fine wine here. You savor its nuances; its entrancing, affecting melodies, its broad musical landscape and then you just drink it in and savor it some more, acquiring with each listening, a musical experience that just never leaves you. But first, you have to dump the sickenly sweet (or just numbingly pessimistic) commercial pop drinks that so many of us have become pathetically addicted to. U2's new album is testimony that there is still hope on the musical horizon. Love, peace, grief, angst, confusion, boundless joy. That's what's life is all about. The lads from Ireland have crafted yet another musical masterpiece for the ages and it ain't no PopMart. No one will remember much from next year's other Grammy winners 20 years from now. But they will remember this one.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|First impressions count.This may be true in many ways,but my ears have required a softly softly approach to this new addition to the QOTSA reputable catalogue of masterpieces.  <br />It seems that a high proportion of their loyal subjects were honouring the partnership of Homme and Oliveri but this clearly isn't the catalyst of the Stone Age sound.The signature on/off-beat & obscure guitar is firmly in place and it seems that Homme's more interested in experimenting with the partnership of guitar & vocals rather than the bass/guitar duel of the previous incarnations.Perhaps it can be said that the playful,spoilt-kid attitude that Oliveri brought into the mix is a sad departure,but this album hangs together with maturity & confidence.The fact that MarkLanegan has secured the opening 'lullaby' with his melancholia,suggests that despite his absence from the rest of the album,he is it's 'godfather'. <br />Of course,there is the muso-mate/girlfriend collaboration in the forms of Brody Dalle & Shirley Manson who add \\"sultry vocals\\" on the eerie \\"You got a killer scene there,man\\".But it's ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons who is the real guest of honour.His musical donations are unmistakable on Burn The Witch,& the bonus track Precious & Grace.With a homage to Sabbath,he effortlessly commands the mic & gives it some dirty Texan groove.Even though he seems to have missed the bus for the ego trip,Homme really commands the performance.He's created a mix of  experimental compositions which edge towards the dark-side,typified on Someone's In The Wolf & Blood Is Love,& own-brand catchy,riff-rich staples like Dressed Up In Plaid & Everybody Knows That You're Insane.The obvious single is In My Head with it's sing-a-long chorus,but the first release,Little Sister is perhaps the only other track which fits the commercial bill.Broken Box could be the song that never made the cut on Rated-R,& Skin on Skin has a perverse feel which is a distinct nod to Mudhoney.Long Slow Goodbye bids us a bluesyfarewell with a sinister Carmina Burana style finale.After listening to these 'Lullabies',paralysis isn't a problem.What's bothering me is the whereabouts of 'The Fun Machine Took A Sh** & Died',the 'misplaced' track of which we have been robbed Perhaps it's a cryptic sleeve-note tribute - the so-called 'Fun Machine' being a metaphor for the departed Oliveri.If this is the case,let the 'Fun-Machine' RIP.Long live QOTSA.   <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|I have been waiting years for the boy band and alternative band wannabe types to get the hell off of my radio.  The Killers have all of the elements of great 80's British bands.  They sound like so many bands rolled into one that it actually ends up being unique.  My husband and I have been listening to this album non-stop since I bought it last week.  It's fun, you can sing the songs, you can dance, you can remeber your growing up years.  What more could you want?
038073186X|5.0|One of the very few books I have read that has made me sit back and say, \\"wow\\". The book completely blew me down. If you have read any other books by Lehane you can see him progress into a great storyteller. This book while not as emotionally powerful as Mystic River, Shutter Island has great tragic characters and is a perfect mystery.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I could hardly wait until &quot;Gasoline&quot; came out, but I finally got myself a copy and it is an amazing piece of work. &quot;No Surprise&quot; was the only song I heard before the album came out, but it is hard not to like every song on this record. &quot;Hating Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Santa Monica&quot;, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, to name a few, are my personal favorites off &quot;Gasoline&quot;. This is a must get album and if anybody out there still think Theory of a Deadman is a &quot;clone&quot; of Nickelback, have a real good listen. Theory of a Deadman is becoming more of an independent band and getting away from there Nickelback label with there own material. Theory Rocks!!!!
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|Well let me start by saying that i have been a Queens fan ever since the Kyuss days, and that this album is by no means total crap. i'd say it merits three stars as a regular album, but coming from the same man that gave us Sky Valley, Blues for the Red Sun and countless other classics, this album is simply too tame for my liking. The production is perfect to the point of annoyance, and the whole work is centred on Homme's current style. What I love about the queens last two albums, SFTD and Rated R, is their intense diversity - losing Nick took away part of that breadth that their music contained. This album seems bland in comparison to the other two albums. The Queens are in a long decline (unlike the desert sessions and mondo generator), becoming more and more narrow minded with each album they make. Homme seems to have got his head stuck so far up his own arse that he's forgotten that all songs need not sound the same. Having said that, the opening Mark Lanegan track is fantastic, In my head is great (better on the desert sessions), but the album lacks any true standouts in my opinion. The guests are quite good if somewhat portentuously presented. Part of the charm of the desert sessions is that Homme allowed others in on the work, it was more of a group effort. This album feels more like a bunch of people adding to Homme's work, which is not what the queens were originally about. A damn shame, cause this is the first album of theirs that i have truly disliked. Sorry Josh!
0790733226|5.0|There's finally a movie about aliens that isn't showing aliens blowing the crap out of buildings and bridges. It's quite a good movie cause there's a sense of pace and structure without it being too long or just spurts of goodness laced in with long boring stuff. <br /> <br />The film opens very impressively with a shot of Earth outside its atmosphere with multiple sounds going on at once like songs and famous quotes and we do what could possibly the longest zoom out in cinema as we leave the solar system with the sounds starting to fade until we have left the Milky Way and then we see dozens of galaxies popping up. They then combine together into one little shiny light in a girl's eye. Quite neat but onto the story. <br /> <br />The little girl is Ellie Arroway, a quite gifted child with an acute taste for science and math and she becomes someone of huge intelligence only to sit in a chair at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico looking for signs of alien life. Her thorn in her side is David Drumlin, her boss and head of the Science Division. She ends up having to move to New Mexico's observatory and there she finds an alien signal filled with stuff so the whole world is now focused on her discovery even though she feels she's not being fully thanked. <br /> <br />One of the coolest scenes undoubtedly is all the radio signal decoding turns out to be a machine, an incredibly expensive machine that will send one occupant into a large energy core. Seeing her travel in this thing is quite neat but what happens afterwards is good since it reinforces the theme of the movie which is belief although some people absolutely hate it(like Mr. Garrison on South Park for one). <br /> <br />I can only watch the film now and then, just one of those movies that I can't really re-watch a little while after just seeing it but when I do, it's still good. And just a little note: the end scene with the Pensecola part, Jodie Foster looks downright beautiful the way she's photographed.
B0007G89G4|5.0|I bought this version of Stand By Me when it came out because it's one of my favorite movies and mainly also because it was advertied to be in Dolby 5.1 stereo.  It's not. The sound is in mono 2.0. The disc is the same disc as what was released in the fall of 2000.  The only thing that is added is a thin book and a disc which has 7 songs from the movie. Is the deluxe edition worth it?, maybe if you are a die hard buff of the movie but if you are just a collector of movies and want this timeless treasure in your collection, I'd recommend the special edition which you can pick up for half the price.
0743454529|5.0|This is a great story...really grabs your heart...be prepared to cry with this one.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Enough could never be said about how beautiful this movie is. If you ever loved your dad, or your grandfather, or any story-teller in your life...then this movie will hit home and make you really appreciate the wonder and passion of a man with an inspiring imaginiation.<br /><br />Big Fish is Perfect.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|A couple things bothered me about this production.  1.  the phantom promises \\"destruction beyond your imagination\\", and all he does is bring down a light fixture.  that's hardly beyond my imagination.  2.  During my favorite song, \\"Prima Donna\\", they remove the line where Raoul sings, \\"Is this her ANGEL of music?!\\"  3.  The Phantom whines too much.  Not a very masculine character  4.  in the end, all the soldiers of the French Guard are FOLLOWING MEG into the Phantom's lair.  They probably said to each other (in a french accent, of course): \\"we shall let the little girl go first into the dangerous cavern!\\"  5.  the semi-hallucinatory sequence where the phantom takes Christine down below is silly, especially the candles coming out of the water.  This is a scene best on stage where you can't distinguish everything and the opaque quality enhances the effect.<br /><br />Good points about movie:  Minnie Driver's acting.  New song sung by Christine.<br /><br />This movie is a renter.
B000001ELP|4.0|I've heard this is - to this day - the only Kiss album that hasn't gone gold. It's not perfect by any means (I seem to be the only person who thinks \\"Dark Light\\" is the albums low point) but has some of Kiss' best songs. Not only is it one of their - if not the absolute - best albums, it's the only one you can listen to once you've outgrown the rest of their music. It's impressive that they could do an entire album without once talking about their dicks.
6305078491|4.0|I think there's a weird kind of disconnect for modern audiences when they watch a silent film, and despite the fact that Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyre is in fact a \\"talkie\\", I don't think any movie could illustrate the point better.<br /><br />Sound in motion pictures was new enough when this film was made that the film-makers were clearly adjusting to the idea. Dialogue is minimal, sound effects are sparse enough to be jarring, and most of the movie plays like some victorian goth kid's fever dream. The combination of minimal sound and beautiful and atmospheric visuals make for something very unique and unsettling. Definitely worth watching.<br /><br />Hard-core vampire fans should be warned: despire the title,<br /><br />this movie is more of a haunted house story than a vampire story. If you're dying for vintage bloodsucking, you should probably check out that other 1931 vamipre movie. You know, the one starring the Romanian guy from Seasme Street.
0440217563|3.0|I keep saying that I don't like these books, but I keep reading them! So Gabaldon must be doing something right. Voyager, in particular, is refreshing because, in this youth-crazed world, it shows that love and passion are not the sole province of the under-40. However, as with the first two books in the series, several disturbing elements keep cropping up and leaving a bad taste in my mouth. To quote the late Ann Landers, Gabaldon seems to have \\"a geranium in her cranium\\" on certain topics, to wit: <br />1. Homosexuality. Jamie encounters yet another English prison governor hot for his body in the person of Lord John Grey. Gabaldon may be trying to overcome the accusations of homophobia generated by her portrayal of the sadistic Jonathan Randall in Outlander by making Grey a sympathetic character, but still, it was a bit much! Why is Jamie such a guy magnet? And what of his own somewhat ambivalent response, which carries over from Outlander to this installment? He is seemingly repulsed by Grey's advances, but later (I won't give it away) acts in a somewhat inconsistent manner in this regard. Is our Jamie secretly AC/DC? Gabaldon flirts with this issue in a very weird way. <br />2. Physical punishment. Once again, we are treated to a detailed flogging scene, though not quite as long as the similar scenes in Outlander. And once again, there is an erotic component to the scene as Grey watches from the window. Gabaldon intertwines physical punishment and love (both erotic and parental) in a very unsettling way. There is much discussion of the impending beating of Jamie's nephew, Ian, by his father, a task which Jamie undertakes himself because he got the lad in trouble in the first place. Again, this is described with relish and at great length, followed by a similarly detailed description of Jamie submitting himself to a beating by Ian, the whole depicted as a kind of bonding experience. Creepy. (And I have never been able to forgive Jamie for his beating of Claire inOutlander, or to excuse her for letting him get away with it--and, once again, Gabaldon portrayed the beating as a turning point in her growing to love him). <br /> <br />If Gabaldon dropped these themes from subsequent installments of this series, it could only improve what is basically fun, escapist entertainment.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh is the God of shakespeare today and this film is the god in his element, doing the play he loves and knows best. There is no other film version of Hamlet that can even touch the relm of absolute beauty and perfection that this one does. Kenneth Branagh brings us a rendition of Hamlet which makes the viewer want to cry. This man understands every single tiny emotion behind each of Shakespeare's sacred lines and shows them to the audiance with a heart breaking accuracy and feeling. Who ever understands the beauty of Shakespeare's Hamlet can not say that Mr. Branagh doesn't. He is supported by a beautiful cast and no actor in this film can be said to be lacking in their portrayal of their charactors, but it is almost certain that without Mr. Branagh's portrayal of the Prince of Denmark this film could not hold the beauty and understanding of the play it does. I feel Shakespeare could not have asked for more if he had done it himself.
B0006399FS|5.0|I love this album. It is the best. There is no track that i have to skip, i can just relax and listen to the hole thing and not have to skip anything. You ppl who review it bad are just bashing it, you probably dont really LISTEN to it. All those people who praised it, well done, you have fine taste. \\"Vertigo\\" is a great song and very catchy, but my personal favorite would be \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", i just love the high toned voice bit.  <br /> <br />Just get it, and if you dont like it then fine. But if you have any sense you will appreciate it somehow.
B000002B5L|5.0|This is one of the most amazing hip hop albums of all time. Just perfect. From Wyclef's guitar playing and rasta style flow to Pras' bass pitched voice to Lauren(aka Hip Hop's Bob Marley)Hill's amazing rhyming and singing this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm actually surprised that the Source did'nt make any 6 Mic ratings because this record deserves it. They broke up shortly after this but now they are setting a date to get back together after Lauren finishes her 2nd solo album and I can't wait. Now on to the review...<br /><br />1.Red Intro-10/10-Well first of all it's an intro but for an intro its actually not that bad.<br /><br />2.How Many Mics-10/10-Really tight hook by Wyclef and really tight rhymes from Lauren Hill.

Classic song, whether your ready or not to agree.<br /><br />4.Zealots-10/10-Wyclef's hook is a catchy blend of Reggae and funk, but it's Pras who really shines on this track.

Lauren rhymes are crazy on this track plus a hilarious Chinese Resturant skit afterwards.<br /><br />6.Fu-Gee-La-10/10-One of my favorite songs of all time, From Wyclef's Reggae style rhyming to Lauren's harmonic hook dis is a track ya'll gotta cop.<br /><br />7.Family Business-10/10-Pras is phenominal on this track, his rhymes are the best on this track than on any other one. Youre just waiting for the next member of tha camp to spit the whole track. Perfect, just Perfect.<br /><br />8.Killing Me Softly With His Song-10/10-Full Lauren track, no rhyming but can really make you sleepy...in a good way. Chilled out and the Fugees first big hit. Cop it.<br /><br />9.The Score-10/10-One of the best tracks on the album, tight samples, tight hook, tight rhymes, tight overall.<br /><br />10.The Mask-10/10-Jazzy beat and one of the most catchy hooks on the album beside \\"Ready Or Not\\". Wyclef has good rhymes and so does Pras but Lauren is the best MC on this track.

B00005LQ04|4.0|Quede creyendo durisimo en Argento! <br /> <br />That's the first movie I saw from the director Dario Argento,  nice Giallo with very powerfull in the use of colours, the opposite for any other horror movie, (dullness, lack of bright, colors...etc), but this one give the chills and even more than others. Very nice film and hope to watch more of this italian director.
0800177177|2.0|Except for the one who says it isn't boring all the one and two star reviewers hit the nail on the head --- but I thought you had to use WOODEN stakes for vampire hearts?  Baffling, meandering, jumpy, jerky, and muddled. It's puzzling enough to sustain interest for a time, but long before the end you wish it would. Nothing seems to work. Yet FFC throws everything bar the kitchen sink into this midden. Bats, rats, crosses, circles, blood, smoke, fire, water, lightning, rain, ruins, forests, prisons, loonies, garlic, steak, nudes, skeletons, lesbians. Nothing works. It's not frightening, funny, or stimulating in the slightest. At one point Dracula gets confused with Jesus Christ, would you believe. Strange, but not strange enough to matter.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This album is great! Michael Buble evokes the same feelings through his music that Frank Sinatra, yet he still has a sound of his own.  He as an amazing, smooth yet powerful voice that I could listen to for hours.  I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Honestly This is one of the most perfect Wu-Tang Solo albums you can get...What more can I say. Gza's flow on this disc is just brilliant and the lyrics are tight as hell. The production by R to tha ZA is just ill from Liquid Swords to Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth this album is possibly one of the most overlooked hip hop albums of our time. It really is a crying shame that the Source did'nt give this 5 Mics because of all hip hop records this deserves it more than any Record. If you don't have this album now...then definetley cop it...it's a must have.<br /><br />1.Liquid Swords-10/10-Tight opening with the Shogun line. Pretty cool kung fu sample. The track itself is pretty tight, Ill beat and tight lyrics. Classic.<br /><br />2.Duel of the Iron Mic-10/10-Like Liquid Swords opens with a tight kung fu sample. Track itself is a Classic. The beat is sick and the lyrics between Gza and Masta Killa are tight.<br /><br />3.Living In The World Today-10/10-One of the hottest tracks on the record.
