B001A1SY9M|1|Cheap Chinese knockoff! I thought I was getting a used oem mirror. This thing vibrates, the mirror sits inside the housing too far creating a blind spot on my spotter mirror and everything looks kinda warped. Now I need to spend money on another one........
B00EO4I8DY|2|Whoop Whoop! Looks GREAT on the front of the Silver Ice Silverado!<br /><br />Today - 5-17-2016 I'm revising my review. The red has faded so much so that it is about time to replace this. The rest of it is dull looking as well. Was good while it lasted.
B00PJPHEBO|5|I own a 2012 Toyota Camry XLE I4 Vehicle, I have had this plugged into it for the past month without any issues.  It has not killed my battery, nor caused any problems with the function of the car. I have connected it via bluetooth to various Android & Apple tablets and phones and they have all connected without issue and maintained a stable connection.  It works with the top rated OBDII apps on the App Stores without any problems either.  This showed me dozens of technical details of my vehicle and honestly it was pretty overwhelming!  I have not tried to reset any codes with it, as I haven't had any, but I don't see it being an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I have tried several other OBDII bluetooth devices over the years, most from eBay and they have all been very low quality and the connections were wonky.  TO be fair, I have only used this one for a month but it has been rock solid, very stable, and given me awesome amounts of information!  As I said, I leave it plugged it nonstop, I even forget it is there under my dash until I load up the app and it connects. It has not drained my battery which is a big deal, as the OBDII port tends to have constant power directly from the battery.  For the price, and quality, it is highly recommended.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company. I did not promise them a review but seeing as I used it, and I love to review things, I was more than happy to provide a fair review to help other users make an informed purchase.
B00FTBW1CK|3|Great product. No leaks like others posted ive went through big pudfles and alot of rain. Like pattern is different but i have hids in them thats why but great pattern and cutoff. Update 1-4-2016 one of the headlights is getting water in them. I don't even Judd run what's going on..
B00AQJYF2E|5|Just what we were looking for.
B00DHPT1IM|5|Very high quality auto reflector that is easy to put on and take off. Stiff construction that maintains shape and blows away cheaper, flimsy reflectors on the market.
B003V57NUQ|3|I bought 2 sets of these. Both were rusted and a powdery film of rust was all throughout the box. Assembly was more than I expected. One of the two boxes had clearly been opened and the parts were just scattered about. No big deal, but disconcerting at first. Finally, These are just a burden to put together and install. Seems to hold the kayaks well though...
B005GX3GFW|5|Perfect couldn't be more pleased :)
B00U2AZ12K|4|I was able to reset an airbag warning light on a 2007 VW that was set off by a hack at a shop that specialized in making keys for cars. Very pleased that it worked on the first attempt.
B000FFT0KQ|5|fits and performs as advertised.
B00B9IVRCW|2|the jack stop working after the first use and was very slow, tray it to reset but noting is working except the lite
B0024DYM3M|5|Exactly what I wanted
B00V93AJEE|5|Very good color and easy to apply.
B00JXS3BXI|5|So far ripped a couple of bushes out of my yard in minutes.Have no doubt about it´s abilities.
B004SRM2Q6|1|It'll look good initially once you've figured a way to rig it on somewhat tight. It'll even look nice when you turn a couple blocks. Anything more it becomes a struggle and a hassle. Highways are impossible to drive on with this unless paint and dings aren't an issue. Made my new car look raggedy once it started flopping.
B0013RIOMK|5|OMG these look amazing, I painted them Lime green and alternated them 1 black 1 lime green came out awesome on my jeep I also did the rugged ridge headlight bezels and painted them lime green as well.  Both came out awesome highly recommend them very sturdy plastic after installation have no fear of them falling out.
B000R5G0DO|1|Leaks everywhere.
B0096FM3Z0|5|Mats are awesome.
B0087NB23Q|4|I bought this intercom headset for my husband and I when we ride on our own motorcycles so we can communicate, and we both agree that we love using them, however I didn't give it 5 stars because of the background clicking/shuffling sound that we both hear. Its a little annoying, but our voices come through clear, so we are glad we bought them. It's just in the background. Just weird the shuffling sound, like someone is rearranging a closet or things on an office desk. Will continue to use them because our voices come through very clear.
B00002243Y|5|These cables are amazing - long enough to reach all the way around without parking nose to nose and work without issue.
B001DAH3M4|5|I bought this and could have one day shipped it for less than Autozone.  Instead I bought a prime membership.  I installed this unit and it started making juice.  Been a couple of months.  Made in China in case your wondering.  No core to worry about
B00BI3WLHS|5|Good.  Thanks
B003AOKF94|5|It was what my husband needed for his cj-7 jeep and is working great.<br />Thank you
B0007LEG2K|5|WORKS WELL!
B006QUOIPQ|5|Easy installation and a great look
B007HROEM4|5|Thes were delivered on time and are exactly what I was looking for.
B00G2TV7OG|5|It was daylight when I installed and they were bright then. When night time came in was even more impressed and it looks like headlights
B001JT1CEE|4|I bought it solely as spare project wire.  And to that purpose it's worked well.  Some of the casing was a bit chewed up on the ends, but electrical tape fixed that up.  The wire is solid enough, and the actual wire gauge is thick enough that overall I'm not worried about the wire fraying or snapping for any real reason.<br /><br /> There are better deals on wiring on Amazon the last I checked, but I didn't need an entire spool of wire.  So for the money this certainly wasn't a bad purchase.  It really just depends on your project size.  I used about half of it, separating the red in the black to color coordinate wiring lines.<br /><br />So if you need wiring, but not a lot of it, this would be a good bet.  The issue with the chewed up casing mars the product a little, but it isn't a big deal overall.
B0040ROND4|5|The constant running water stopped.  The part fit the pipe just right.  I recorded a video to show how it was to replace the old Control Stop Valve with the new Control Stop Valve.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpK-bytu-Ig
B00JJU931E|5|I called to make sure it will fit my 2005 avalon drivers side mirror. Well I didn't have to cause it was a laser fit! Couldn't be more satisfied. Easy to install and the traffic arrows match exactly over the old auto dimming mirror.
B00MO19XUQ|5|Fits great and looks great. And less cost than the BMW supplier wanted. Win-win!
B007TQI96K|5|Excellent product. Does what claims to do. Easy to work with.
B0009YDQE4|4|Since they were at no cost they are fine.  The rear mats are not very big, but I am satisfied.
B0012TZ2CE|5|Hate the cups. Being able to cap measured out two stroke oil is the way to go, for on the go!
B00NUJ7DO4|5|I love this keychain. Great quality. So pretty.
B00FWOKKGI|4|Wish it came with wiring kit but light is super bright and mounted great on rzr
B0002M9SUO|2|great product, but they only come with 55w bulbs, not 100w. Also the product seems not for US market, european market i guess.
B0034RKNPS|5|ok
B005GRAI86|5|everything I needed and the price was perfect.
B0073JQZ8C|5|Fits great. Thanks
B005ZMLIS6|3|part was fine and worked great
B000VKTUJQ|4|Not much to say.  It is a good alternative to over priced OEM filter.
B001GDJGJQ|5|Have a 1972 Ford F250 truck with no glove box space. this sits on the hump , does not move around and has plenty of storage for all the junk you need on a long road trip.
B00ODFODN8|5|VERY sturdy. Works great. Ordered a medium for my full-size GMC Sierra (large was recommended) and it worked fine for a slightly taller than level load. The mesh was, of course, smaller than my truck bed but the straps more than made up for it. I may order a larger one for my 12' trailer. Well worth the $$.
B005P5DMWI|5|This was an additional step for the passenger side (already had one for driver's side & rear corner) -- great quality & a must-have for large pickups!!
B001AN16WW|5|Fits bike well just a bit smaller that my old bags but is very sturdy.
B008BVVY1O|5|Good
B00KGIE7KU|1|Does NOT fit Honda 300 Fourtrax as described.
B00GJX1NYE|5|You just can't beat these harnesses for your tekonsha brake controller. Very high quality wire, sleeved to prevent abrasion or cuts, nice secure connection to OEM socket and brake controller. I can not even imagine bothering with cutting and splicing with these available and inexpensive. Definitely worth it!
B006FL1WWS|5|Bought this for my moms car. Easy install. Looks like it came with it
B00I8T4NX0|5|Really good
B008N44BAA|5|Good price for 1 of the best characters in video games history
B000CB94JU|5|Recently bought a 2003 Audi A4, when I would start the A/C there would be a musky odor that quickly went away. Other than tires, the first thing I bought to start upgrading and doing maintenance so I would know everything was up to date was this activated charcoal cabin air filter. The original filter's (cabin and engine) from 2003 were still in the car and they were disgusting. Immediately after installing this filter the odor ceased and there is a nice pleasant smell when the A/C starts now.  Changing the filter was super easy and only took a couple minutes to get everything back in place nice and tight. The engine air filter is a different story and it is quite the S.O.B. to change, I'm so happy with the performance of this air filter, I'll put a new filter in every year as long as I own the car.
B004A2D3QC|5|Fixed the problem I was having with my SUV sputtering at an idle.
B000C94DUC|1|I don't know what happened, but Amazon said this piece would fit my car but when the mechanic tried to put it in it was way too short.
B000E2CVDI|4|Good Deal
B00CLBTHJ6|5|Awesome M3 accessories!
B001PVUJJU|5|Fit and look great
B00O616LZC|3|Brighter compared to original light.  Too bad box packaging isn't secure. 1 of the bulbs was loose inside. The loose bulb damaged the secure bulb. The tip broke off and the filament was exposed to air.  When I turned on the lights, it turned milky white.  It was after I removed the bulb and examined the bulb and found the tip was broken/cracked off.  I ordered another pair and will probably arrive the same condition. Apparently the box doesn't properly hold the bulbs in place.  Sending 1st set back due to be defective. Ordered a 2nd pair. Guess I'll hold onto the 1st pair until the 2nd set comes in.  This way when 1 of the bulbs is broken, I'll have a good pair and 1 bad pair to send back.
B00092PXIS|5|good job for me
B000C2WFA4|5|just what I needed and fast delivery. Thank you
B000IDYKQO|4|Good product!
B005BB842O|3|I bought the Kuryakyn Panacea LED Tail Light back about Jun - Aug 2011. A good looking light that you can see.  Just after I bought the Tail Light went on a trip to San Fran down Hwy 1 and 101 from WA state., stopped to eat lunch and the Load Equalizer started to burn not fun trying to get your seat off with acidic smoke puffing up around you.  Ok., got a replacement Load Equalizer and finished the trip,  about a year later 2012 Harley-Davidson was servicing the bike and was moving it around without the security FOB and guess what, the Load Equalizer went again, H-D upgraded and replaced the Load Equalizer for free.  AUG 2015 - Kuryakyn Panacea LED Tail Light went out, only a few LEDs were working.  Warranty is 1 year on hardware and 3 years on LEDs.  Kuryakyn would do nothing to replace the tail light.  My local H-D sold me a replacement Tail light for cost. H-D gets 5 stars.  Cost for a tail light for 4 years = $200. We'll see how long the replacement lasts.  Silver lining after buying the new Tail light is that I now have a replacement controller and Load Equalizer...
B00CC2ZU4K|2|Bought these lights and they started great.. Only a few days in and fuses are now being blown. Contacted seller, no response
B0052FRX9E|2|This replacement is made of cheap materials and hardly works, find a different one to buy.
B00E6VM7HS|5|Worked perfectly
B00NLN8R44|4|If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. I had to do some minor trimming to get the passenger side to go over the tailgate hinges. 5 minutes with a grinder, no big deal. That is the only complaint I have about them! The price is far beyond worth it. The powder coat looks great and seems more like 3/16&#34; thick to me but who'd complain? Overall a great product and I highly recommend!
B0068EUQ9C|5|GoOf quality and looks
B00A6E25B2|5|That's. The correct. Tool
B0033COJLS|4|Fit my 99 Accord, a little tight and it took two of us but it works, and for the price!
B006G2MJZU|5|Fit perfectly and works great.
B00BGH0EAC|5|this save me alote of money it do just what I wanted it to do every man orwemen need one it easy to use
B0027A5L3M|5|My TIMKEN bearing was actually an SKF bearing, which is an excellent bearing. It was the same bearing as the original OEM bearing my Honda Odyssey came with from the factory. I have been using Timken bearings in trucking and on my personal stuff for years. Great high quality bearings.....
B00Y1HUCBA|5|Good and fast
B00J9OVAIO|5|Awesome product direct fit
B00LG07MZE|5|“Product as described. Easy to use. Fits my 09 Dodge Ram perfect.”
B0017K69MA|1|Not the magic wand it's made out to be. Streaks horribly. The concave shape is all wrong for the purpose it was designed for.
B007KA7PP6|5|Great product. Worked well
B004BFBK2W|4|Works as explained.  Some times a little static on screen.  But you can see where you are.  Not Fish eye which destorts.  Color's not the greatest.  Beats the He***  out of getting in and out of the truck to hook up the trailer.  Not all they need to come up with is a remote to raise and lower the trailer if it's too low when hooking up.
B004ROPQ2C|5|Excellent upgrade for your z wheels.
B001P2CKVY|5|Good fit
B00SH1SN6C|4|This portable jumper works well and we got the chance to test it on my friends Harley shortly after I received it. It had the needed power to jump start the bike so it works as advertised. The only improvements for this model are make it a bit smaller and add a jumper connection that would plug into the battery tender plug so that you do not need to remove the seat.
B001SZVXAM|4|Worked great and cheap.
B00FMV0WFA|5|Still think this should come standard on these trucks
B008H3YIV4|5|My husband diagnosed and replaced our golf cart with this new solenoid.  It has worked perfectly ever since.<br />Locally we were sold a smaller volt one.  It burnt out very quickly.  The 36volt did the trick!
B00YNF8SSE|5|Awesome
B000AM8C62|5|Noticed smoother high rpms.Stay on top pf oil changes though and you'll be good.
B00AN91GEW|5|great product, easy to install
B00J441264|5|Bought this for my best friend as a gift. Looks Freak'n Awesome on her blue truck!
B00HWJHCG2|1|It lasted a week. The first time I dropped my keys on the ground it broke off. Nicks very easily. It's crap
B00KTIR9RK|3|Broke after a month.  I would not purchase this item again.
B000BZIE8O|5|Well made and perfect fit.  Will last as long as the OE part most likely.
B00FLNKVYQ|5|Nice and bright, no heat, adjusts to fit the hood or inside the car (just did a heater core replacement, the light was well worth it), and stays put...Wish I bought one of these long ago.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Works great with my cars.  The auto settings is a real time saver.  Compact size fits well in my car's trunk. The digital pressure gauge matches my round analog gauge, so that's a plus.
B00CCYWJQK|5|It worked just like the one in the video on Youtube. I was very pleased. I had to use 60 feet of 1 inch PVC pipe to extend it far enough to reach my sewer access. The SewerSolution had no problem at all pushing the waste through that added pipe.
B0002KKIXC|5|I tried this on older stains and it lifted the spots right up. Awesome stuff. :-)
B005PZMKZI|2|Doesn't fit our backseat.
B00J4GSPDU|5|Great
B00O5C3LIM|4|Very good. I recomend it.
B000EQQPN6|3|The drums fit and work as they should but it has only rained once since installation (car was parked during rain) and both drums are already showing surface rust any place water touched them.  If aesthetics mean anything to you I would recommend either finding a different part or painting these before installation.
B00LNOTM0G|2|I drive a 2015 Subaru Forester XT Touring, I got these thinking they will help light up the road... But it doesn't... You can't even tell if they're on or not... They &#34; LOOK  &#34; bright, I'm not going to lie about that, they do somewhat match the factory HIDs.. Installing them they just scatter the light all around like a flood light. Doesn't project any usable light... It just looks nice and for those who just want to color match their factory HIDs. First pic shows both LED fog installed, second photo shows factory bulb on the left and LED fog on the right
B000NS1YJ0|4|Work just fine. Genuine Ford seals.<br />NOTE! Amazon says this does not fit, 2005 FORD F150 5.4 Triton. WRONG.<br />* They will fit*<br />I purchased part #3L3Z-6C535-AA. They are approx 2-1/4&#34; diameter. When installing, i put just a touch of dielectric grease on the outer and inner edge of the seal where it seats against the valve cover and the solenoid. Lube helps it seat into cavity.<br /> Do not order part #7L1Z-6C535-AA. They are too small.
B000CQ6INA|4|Great bang for the buck!!!
B000BHLTS4|5|Very comfortable & super price!
B000F14X48|5|Fits perfect on my 2014 Silverado Double Cab. Wish they had black.
B000CD578U|5|Back to original ride after 300,000 miles
B009XQKCQY|5|This volt meter is very handy
B002TSCGMG|5|Went on easily and flawlessly.  Can't wait until the day my elderly Star Trek fan dad finally notices I stuck this on his car window :)
B007ZTAE5A|5|use all the time
B00UZA1MW0|5|Thank You
B003IHPR4G|5|Superb delivery service by seller and excellent product.
B00C5SIEQ2|3|This works well but the bottom retaining nut for the shower is not quite wide enough in the lip. I had to install it with the rubber gasket inside the shower for it to not leak. The shower is fiberglass and the rubber ring when on the bottom would not seal- just kept squishing out to the side.
B00HR5YRPU|4|Bumper is nice, fit perfect. My only complaint about the makeup of the bumper is that the winch guard isn't welded to the bumper it bolts on. But hey its a less then $400 bumper. When I received the bumper it had a pretty good scratch in the winch guard as a lot of the other customers who had purchased one described. I didn't see any reason to send the bumper back over a scratch so I just put some touchup paint on it and its hardly noticeable.
B008CF9PEW|1|Does not fit my 2006 Jeep Liberty
B00K05KKYQ|5|Used this to replace my separate key & key fob for my 2003 Nissan Frontier.  You may have to shop around for a locksmith that will cut it for you.  It is better if disassemble & only take the blade blank to locksmith.  Pay attention when disassembling it can be tricky to put back together.
B003O6UDYK|5|The fork seal driver is a finely crafted tool.  It has been used already and worked excellently.
B005T4XTKA|4|Good Product
B000SKYV20|5|Looked nice and would have kept it. However, returned it as I decided to use the unit that came with the car. At the time wasn't sure the car's unit was working.
B001IF2BDU|5|fit great, and Don't take away from the looks of my truck
B00B8EUFWK|5|Paint matched perfectly, and it looks great on my car!
B0072UPAQK|3|With all the reviews I have read about N-Fab products, I felt comfortable ordering a set without seeing them in person. They arrived yesterday and I installed them, I was also caught off guard by having to drill an extra hole in each side. I was able to get it done with a speed-bit and the extra hole I felt was a necessary evil with this design. They are sturdy, but the fit was a bit poor, I can tell a difference in how they line up from the driver side to the passenger side. There is no gap from my splash guard on one side and a 1/2&#34; gap on the other. Wasn't able to adjust it out. The textured finish is nice. Overall, they weren't bad enough to warrant going through the hassle of a return, but I was disappointed that they didn't fit better. Maybe it's too high of expectations but the $120 step bars I had on my Silverado fit just as well. Not likely to buy N-fab products again unless I can see them in person first.<br />Regards,<br />Cody L
B00S0MWFBM|5|Great for the price.
B003072EO0|4|Works for me
B00G6INQCO|5|AMAZING!!  SAVED ME A BUNCH O HEADACHES ON MY 1983 MAZDA RX7 BLACK INTERIOR.  WAS A PERFECT MATCH!
B00GURR4BK|1|Doesn't fit and the silencer insert keeps falling out. Have removed since.
B00ZSDVKIU|5|Very happy.
B00BVL7M26|5|Works great!
B000WEIJ3O|5|Perfect for my car. Fast Shipping
B009PBYSMQ|1|Doesn't matter how you trim it, it won't fit anything else....
B0050NOL4I|4|I have had this cover for three years on my 2012 F150. It has worked really well for the most part. It has remained water resistant. The foam seals around the edges do a decent job, but seem to compress and stay compressed after a while. Driving down dusting roads can be an issue, but I know my truck bed is not dust or waterproof to begin with.<br /><br />While Lund can be a little slow on responding to contact, I found the the company was quite helpful it sending me a few new parts when someone tried to break into to the cover. I just contacted them about this model fitting the 2015 F150 and was clearly told me it does NOT and that the new one was in manufacturing. The new model number 951872, very similar. I explained the issue with Amazon.com indicating it would fit and was told that Amazon.com is wrong.
B00E3UM2RC|5|These are GREAT!!!!
B0001EFSTI|4|This is a keychain gadget worth having. Easy on and off, nice qaulity.
B004YID4DY|5|Lightning fast shipping! !  Super great product. Love it. Easy to install too.
B004GW3VFY|5|My hubby loved this bell.. great craftsmanship! Immage goes all the way  around the bell. There is a guy on a motorcycle riding thru the mountains and the road leads into the skulls mouth.
B00NQB6UDG|4|It looks great! Could just be me but I don't feel like it puts a lot of pressure to the brake.  It still works though.
B0068911SM|4|Seat worked well, I'm ready to go another 2000 miles. Hold down strap did not work with a GW seat.
B00PW30TTC|1|These looked great at first but I had problems with them from early on, they would cut in and out during driving, both sides. I waited too long to return them and then ended up throwing them out and got another brand.
B003KIYDAM|1|the shipping was fast but the demensions are all wrong
B00D0XHBKQ|5|Great seller. A++++
B007TY4SZ8|5|Good
B000IEH7IQ|5|great product and a great price. The Plasticolor company customer service is great.
B00BQVF8J0|5|perfect size for 5.5inch Lake country CCS pads
B004A2IFII|5|I don't always buy OEM parts, but in the case of Ford fuel filters, I do for my diesel. The Ford filters have a water proof membrane in them to stop water.  Water kills your $6,000 injector pump and injectors.  After market filters will filter the dirt OK, but they don't have the water proof membrane in them.  Buyer be ware
B00EUR6N1E|5|Great bars for the price.<br />Fit my e39 wagon perfectly!
B00GHSCM8C|4|Working so far - knock on wood.
B001BRYTYY|5|I've been running a K&N filter on my Xterra for a couple years, so when it came time to do the first filter change on our 2013 Rogue, I decied to go K&N again.  It hasn't been in the Rouge long enough to know how well it'll perform, though I don't really see much difference with the one in the Xterra.  What I do like about K&Ns, though, is that for the cost of two or three filter changes you can get one that will last the life of the car.  Sure, there's a little cost for the cleaning supplies now and then, but since we try to get 10+ years out of our cars, the K&N filters are worth it in the long run.
B005GYDBNS|5|Good filter<br />I didn't get a UOA so I dont know exactly how good, but the oil looked clean after it was used up, and according to the forums I used to research filters, it's a top 3 filter<br />Used on 2007 Nissan Frontier v6 with 5w30 synthetic oil
B00XZ9P11G|1|The steel was to hard to cut even for a professional worker so I have to pay for a new one that mean that I really bought was a chip

B0010T7Q7K|5|Awesome product, awesome service.
B00F5827DK|3|Why don't they have flat bottoms have to clean out the dirt when the compress into the ground.
B000765E30|5|EASY INSTALL
B005H533OS|4|last forever
B009FREAGO|5|Bought this for my husbands card and it is really nice. Closes easily, disappears with black interior etc.
B00LLJW22I|4|Looks nice.  My only issue is that its made of plastic.  Didn't remember it saying that in the original information.  However, it looks nice and gets attention.
B00VTWQISG|5|Great product! Great Company! Outstanding customer service, original seat cover sent me was to small, when I called them I actually got to speak to someone and they had me text them pictures of my seat so they could make a cover to fit, I sent original back to them and they sent me new one and had it back to me in a day!  Thank You Enjoy MFG !!!  Max Petzke
B00020CB2S|3|Dynamat Extreme does what it says it will do. I'm very happy with my now very quiet &#34;luxury&#34; car. But I've only given this three stars because this product is just WAY overpriced. I bought one bulk package of nine pieces thinking that this would be enough to cover all the panels that I wanted in my car - a Volvo 244. I quickly found that I had only enough material in the package to cover above the headliner and the floorboards but NOT the doors, OR the doors and above the headliner and NOT the floor. I realized that the Dynamat people did not misrepresent the product. They stated how many pieces are in the box and the size of each piece. Yes, I should have probably measured my car so that I didn't get this surprise. Once I realized that I not only needed more, I quickly also realized that, in order to do the job that I had envisioned, I would need at least one more entire box. YIKES!<br /><br />So for me, the bottom line is that it truly is quite expensive. Had I known this ahead of time, I would have gone a different route.
B00KBQBDB8|1|Did not work.
B00FJODH5M|5|I really like this.  For the premium price, you get a premium product that fits my 2014 Mazda3 perfectly.  It looks great on the inside and out.  It doesn't feel flimsy and I like the materials and construction.  I also like the storage bag so it doesn't get dirty when stored in the trunk.  Product was received promptly.
B00O64AK9M|5|Perfect for walking alone at night.
B000BVPU9Y|5|WORKS GRRRREAT....SCHMELLS GREATER...E-NUFF SAID...SEE YA!
B001JT1CGC|5|it is extremely easy to use and does not seem to leave a residue.  The price is right and product is good.  I use a lot of spray waxes and this is up there with the best of them.  Definitely recommend..
B00F5MUB66|4|So much better than the generic that came with the trailer. I didn't need the additional hardware.
B00L4TF32G|4|works great
B00JRH6D7G|5|So cute I love it!!!!
B001Q4XIHG|5|this is a good buy, fits well an no shaking,I would recommend this product.
B000ALBRFQ|5|The liftgate of my 2006 Chrysler Town and Country had stopped staying up, frequently hitting me in the head as I tried to unload groceries, cold made it worse.  After getting hit in the head one too many times, I decided to just fix it.  It was much easier than expected to get the old arms off, and these installed.  About 30 minutes later, much of which was spent wrestling the old ones that had been factory tightened off, these new arms were installed and working like a new van.  No more bumped heads from the liftgate dropping on me. Awesome, good price, and easy to install.
B004QDBPRE|5|Matched my OEM wheels perfectly
B00MU5X17M|4|FIT THE VEH. AT A FRACTION OF THE DLR. PRICE ARRIVED FAST TO THANKS
B007O1WXHG|5|very bright
B004YD5LXK|4|This product was shipped quickly and works as advertised.  I have found it helpful to tie up and tie down many things in my truck bed.
B00WVN7UWK|5|AAA+++++  they are awesome brighter than the stock buld YES i highly recomend these 2 hell YEAH......
B000H94F6E|5|This is a great little charger! I use it in our motorhome because the WFCO converter/charger that comes with many RV's is not sufficiently charging our batteries. The Schumacher Speed Charger will initially charge at whatever amperage is necessary to achieve 14.6 volts. Then, the amps will taper off to maintain the battery at 14.6 volts until only a low amperage is needed. Then the charger goes into a maintenance mode of 13.5 to 13.6 volts. If you look at your battery's web site, you will see that the recommended charging voltage is 14.6 volts...or higher! Not the 13.6 volts that a lot of chargers put out. You may think that 1 volt is not that significant but the battery's usable voltage range is only from 10 volts (Minimum) to 14.6 volts. If you are only charging to 13.6 volts then you are missing 25% of your battery's capacity and doing it harm by not fully charging it.
B006N94DZK|1|Piece of sh*t  the rubber Crack in 2 days. .....I never buy  ac Delco  again .......piece of crap
B001IS48KG|4|well made!  they do exactly what i wanted them for..

B00BAKMTG2|5|This product can clean so many things. We use it for things in the house as well as in the garage with good results.
B006LLB2UE|1|This did not fit our 1998 Volvo as indicated that it would. I firmly believe amazon should hold these companies reliable for wrong description and saying things fit when they don't. Tired of my money wasted when it coast me to send back that's not fair when its their fault.
B000C5CEKC|2|In spite of the results of the search, this item does NOT fit a 1987 Mobile traveler II on a Ford Econoline 350 chassis. My low rating is not for the product but the search engine.
B00BT0970O|5|Best seat covers ever! They're absolutely perfect. Easy to put on and the colors are very vibrant.
B00V8YPTX0|5|very comfortable
B00030DLEE|5|Works great ..
B007L2JNT4|5|Good product. Easy to put on and easy to take off when I am not towing.  The right mirror is not the same as original equipment on my truck so the image takes a little getting used to but overall I am pleased.
B0053ZAIYU|4|It was everything but 4 ft.
B000WO2TSK|5|Smooth and quite !!!!
B00QAYAPEG|2|Wasnt a fan of the material and very low grade or how they dont stay on
B0012TYU8Q|5|Worked fine
B009S957K2|5|THEY FIT AND WORKED GREAT.....FAST DELIVERY
B00IEKNFI2|5|I have a 1998 Honda Civic HX, this was the second time I've had to buy the same rotors but this time I bought for the 99 Civic si and they fit perfect.
B001H1I7Z6|5|Easy to apply and matches perfectly.
B001TCWLO6|5|Very good thanks
B0082ANA0C|4|this tool saves a lot of time trying to put the tube in another way just does not work
B000CO9FHS|4|Item arrived on time, and as expected. Sadly I was unable to use it
B005CBVJWK|5|fits the truck fine, glad to have it
B004K8V6XS|5|Worked perfectly the first time! Great price and perfet match.
B00590TQ4W|1|The mirror is way off the vehicles behind you look so far but are actually closer to you
B00AZJTCS2|4|It's good when you understand it , it's a bit slow when recharging a vehicle , the next thing if you are topping up a system it does not have a repeat function , mastercool should like into that feature like the charging scale .
B00S1WDSK8|5|Super bright!!
B007982OXM|5|have two and keep it in van works well
B000C2WBNU|5|Worked great, for a 78 ford 351m
B004TRKBOK|1|Broke on the first use, tried to use on an MVA.
B00XY0D7U8|5|Looked the same as oem nice product seemed to fix issue I had with truck very good price
B000KITSMI|2|Does not fit all R134A valves. I have a 2001 Ford Ranger Truck and it does not fit the valve stem.
B001HKZHIW|5|Awesome product! Works great. Every RV owner should have one. Great on time delivery and definitely would buy from them again.
B00VS4KI36|3|Got my lightbar in today and hooked it to the battery and everyone of my lights work with no problem thank u
B008CLN0W4|5|this thing just got installed, i  love it, now i need a rear one!
B0002KKTSG|5|Makes your glue, glue faster. The faster it glues, the better the glue goes.
B009HDQ8OS|5|excellent!!
B005617MRM|5|Easy install and very durable.
B004N6RBDQ|5|Amazing they work great i love them
B00837DITC|5|It was really a great product.  I am really impressed as to how accurate the fit was..
B00BNVK1NQ|2|This coolant is nothing more than GM Dex-Cool that's been premixed by ford and sold at a premium price.  Half the bottle is water.  I work in the automotive industry and Ford will not tell you this but we have tested it and that's exactly what it is.  We run Dex-Cool in all our police vehicles that require the overpriced &#34;diluted&#34; Ford orange with no issues.
B0083TZ7HG|1|Unfortunately I can't give it zero stars. Junk, don't buy. Was in the dome light fixture of my '12 Camary for 3 days with, maybe, 5 minutes of &#34;on&#34; time before it stopped working. Of course it quit when I needed it the most, at night. You get what you pay for.
B00T564EIY|5|This works great for my solar setup.
B00JBHY0PO|3|Good
B0022ZSYTA|5|AS EXPECTED
B007FHSABC|1|This cap is not a correct fit for a sportster. The vent tube doesn't allow for the cap to screw down all the way. Please make the fit corrections on our Amazon fit page.
B000CIMGCU|5|I will start off by saying I read a lot of things on a bunch of different JEEP forums that had a lot of mixed reviews about this shifter. i.e. They didn't notice as difference in the shifts, The shifts were too stiff, it wasnt worth the money, etc. etc. etc. Well those pansies need to have their JEEPS taken from them & go drive a Toyota Corola.<br /><br />With that said.....<br />This was one of the best mods I've done to my '01 TJ Wrangler, & I've done a lot of mods over stock. This shifter definitely exceeded my expectations. It takes a bit to get used to but once you do... you will LOVE it. If you don't love it... you shouldn't be driving a manual transmission. This is a shifter for real driving enthusiasts, people that really enjoy & know how to drive a manual transmission vehicle. The shifts are definitive, crisp, & A LOT shorter than I expected for a Jeep shifter. I was able to regain control of my front cup holder &#34;for more than just a can of soda&#34;  as the shift pattern is kept considerably centered & I'm no longer banging my knuckles on the A/C controls either. I love it! If you don't like your sloppy stock shifter, spend the money & go get one of these. Thanks to B&M for putting out a quality product!
B000CQOIR8|5|not too bad to install, had lots of extra parts left over.
B0002BGELQ|5|OK
B0073MFDY6|4|This radiator does fit but it is a rather tight fit.<br />The radiator cap from the old radiator does fit but it does not seal properly. I purchased another from a local autozone. It also fits but does not seal completely. When the cap is on I can squeeze the upper hose and air/water comes through the overflow tube. This is not supposed to happen.<br />It appears the neck is a bit too deep.<br />Shepherd Auto Parts, can you recommend the proper radiator cap?
B009HU9E3S|5|perfect fit
B000C5CEKC|5|Really fits and works great
B00NOCB1AE|2|Wrong size
B000RNY6OG|5|Awesome products fast shipping
B005H538S4|4|Really easy install and looks good.
B00ONDM07G|5|Hubby & I love it so much that we'll buy another for both of our Jeeps.<br />So easy to install, sturdy strong phone clip that will hold tight while wheeling or mudding.
B00E0CSN5I|4|Guage still doesnt work maybe not installed properly
B00LML7GJY|5|This is not the first solar-powered phone charger I've received. It is, however, the first one I've received that works the way I expected. I can set it on my porch when I leave for work in the morning, then plug my phone into it when I get home, and it powers up quickly. This has sufficient power storage that, after I had my phone charged up, I successfully charged two Bluetooth devices, giving me enough power to stream media as I wound down for the evening. As someone always looking for ways to reduce my carbon consumption, I'm already finding this device an attractive option.
B004KED87O|5|Great
B00TRWBRQI|2|It's a sponge, not magic.Any other sponge will do the trick, This one tore as I was using it to clean my sneakers. Do not pay $10 for a sponge.
B000PDONMI|5|fine
B00S1WDSK8|5|These are really nice light
B00YLZ7C3S|4|Great product. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that it came with no installation instructions so I had to use trial and error until I got it right.
B006G6VDQC|5|Still working so I have no complaints
B007T7TPE4|5|perfect
B000H0RDB2|5|thank you
B00DSD5WH2|4|Good
B00KY0DF9Y|4|I adapted it to an older FJ40 Land Cruiser. I don't how long it will last but I can tell you the following: The fan was somewhat bent but I was able to bend it straight with a little time and effort.  Looks like it was dropped either in shipping or during assembly. I took a star for that. It comes with a computer test sheet showing output at various rpm.  57 amps at 1800 and 92 amps at 6000rpm.  Turn on speed of 1600rpm. It appears all new, nothing rebuilt. It is a pretty good clone of the 12si. Dimensions are all correct. It did work on initial installation and after a couple of hours it still works.  Shows 14.6 volts at idle on the vehicle and charges as it should. I had to pull the unit apart to change the clocking, It comes at 3:00 and it was moved to 9:00.  The interior workmanship looks good.  Parts are all new. There is a slight amount of roughness when turned by hand.  I am not too concerned since everything is new. I have not loaded it to full output. It comes with a odd size pulley.  I suggest using the one from your old alternator.
B0002MBKBO|1|This product has completely come apart. I would not recommend anyone wasting your money on this
B00LH3MQ92|5|Amazing gloves. Fit perfect and look cool. I looked at other Harley specific brands and these looked cleaner/tougher and had much better protection. Want them to look cool but also protect, these do both
B001O1UE9Q|5|Great feel. Looks beautiful on a all black Miata.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Fabulous! Works great and looks Awesome!
B00KO6U8CK|5|EASY TO INSTALL ON TIME AND GREAT QUALITY!!!
B0023VFHYS|5|Fit my 2007 Chevy Silverado Classic body style perfectly
B0001EWCNS|5|Good product for a good price.  Fit perfectly.
B001PIAYU2|4|easy to install.
B004SL4XAU|5|Work perfectly on our FJ Cruiser!
B005IV0FN8|5|They were 10$ what do you expect lens fell off installIng a little  Little lock tight super glue good as new the connectors We're too small pushed them in little bite from the vice grips, not going anywhere best $10 I ever spent!!!!!! Plenty bright even in daylight take your tinted glasses off folks! Just got set number 2 for the rear gonna require a little drilling but will be sweet
B00SAMSIU4|5|Loved it!
B00KMDAF0A|5|Just love it, Perfect fit!
B00480BWA0|5|awesome product
B000C808SE|5|perfect!! 100% original
B00E822HN4|2|I've went through 2 different ones. The 1st Bluetooth went out on both speakers, and the one I have now only one side works. I'm gonna just get another helment.
B000KKOGLO|5|Worked great this model stoves loves to burn them out
B006BZIGL8|1|I put these in my Expedition at 98k miles. They lasted about 10k then started rattling at start up. After the oil pressure hits them they are quiet and it runs fine. I haven't replaced them yet. I now have 116k. I will get the Ford phasers next time.
B00KWEVZTE|5|Great quality OEM and made in Japan - not China. Perfect fit in my 2015 Mazda 6.
B007Y5LIC8|5|Simple install and fitment was perfect
B000EQNY1W|5|Seems to be a good quality part and works fine so far. Fit my Grand Caravan with no problem. Hopefully it lasts longer than the last one (about 2 1/2 years). Will update if I have any problems with this part.
B00TUA0ARE|1|Too tall to see over and too dark to see through.  But the worst was Hill Country.  I had the product like new, but didn't have the box it came in so they wouldn't take it back, even if i obtained a nearly identical box.  They told me to try selling it on eBay.  I had had it for two days.
B003V9TC10|5|Works perfectly. You can even double them up for extra length.
B00EC9QQXK|5|Good quality and easy to work with
B00YVHGTBM|5|Works flawlessly with the Carista app.
B001P27TB0|5|Resolved burnt out ceramic cat, ... hope it last. Really nice appearance.
B001EAQTRI|1|waste of money, time , effort and energy. this does not reduce noise in aux plugs from a cell phone to a car radio. this did not help my ground interference at all.
B0009ZEUU2|2|Unfortunately this filter did not fit our '13 Nissan Sentra - the edge seal is about 1/2&#34; too thick for the air box. A+ to Amazon for refunding our full payment and A++ for not expecting us to ship it back. I'm going to repurpose it into a piece of art.
B000GV8LLS|5|Fits my 2008 Harley Super Glide like a glove.  Much better wind break than the Harley windshields.  Would definitely buy again.
B001O07VI4|5|Looks good. Needed as a spare.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Good quality and fit in my car.
B003VLBPJA|5|Nicely sized for motorcycles/ATVs or any other use that requires a small cargo net. It has plenty of hooks all around and stretches - nuff said.
B001S836EU|5|I was helping a friend out who was on a budget. I determined that there was power going into the unit but not coming out, ground and signal were also good. When I installed the new one it didn't work. I removed it from the wiper motor plugged it in and felt the relays kick on. I lightly twisted the pins coming out of the wiper motor and put it back together and it started working.
B00AQJZ2OO|5|Total cost at dealer without the key; $260. With the key; $135.  Works fine.
B004XAXBFE|5|Great chain at a good price. I bought and installed this chain on my 2000 Honda XR650R dirt bike. By reading other reviews, I knew that it was coming with a rivet style link. Not a problem if you are prepared to install it. I have used chain lube after every couple rides and it has held up surprisingly well. Little difference from when I bought it about a year ago.<br /><br />My only quibble would be that it weighs more than 2lbs. As I am not racing, that gives me no real concern.<br /><br />I will definitely look at RK chains the next time I need to purchase a chain. However, that may be a while!
B00K6B4XJ2|4|i use these with tire nets on my car trailer.  Make loading and securing the various cars much easier, and keeps the straps away from the car body.
B00Y5F21NK|4|Looks and feels great
B002N1J5IM|3|This unit is inexpensive and installed into the existing vent easily. 3 stars because:<br />1) the on/off switch is junk and randomly turns on or off by just going over bumps out of the box. I now need to take the unit out and put a good switch in it.
B002ITBPI2|5|Perfect
B002OJ9YR0|5|Arrived in just 1 day!  Perfect fit for my ESCO brand OEM breakaway switch which FAILED after less than 1 year.  This Tekonsha switch looks and feels like much higher quality than the OEM unit that came with my new Flagstaff travel trailer.
B004MSYPLG|5|Good mbc well made and good materials. The clicks are very good for fine tuning as well
B00QMWQK2M|3|These worked ok for my truck and the price was right.
B004TMHF8K|5|These are really great lights. I was actually very surprised with the quality given the fact that these were just around ten dollars. It fits perfectly in my car and the lights are visible during the day.
B001IXQY62|5|Appears to be a quality replacement for my 10 plus year old old Hella/Philips ballast. Brightness is the same as the ballast it replaced.
B005ZGLGF2|4|for the money you cant beat these. comfortable and cool
B00XRPIY2G|1|Wrong fit even though told it would work for my car
B00OKY57DC|5|Came in the mail, today. Smacked it slap dab on my car's drivers' side rear window.<br />Love it!
B001GBLPHO|5|Perfect fit for the stock electrical port.
B000KL72DC|1|Bought these for our Ford Focus, they do not even come close to fitting properly. Passenger side is to short and the drivers side is to narrow. A waste of money.
B00E9EOZ9A|1|Cannot have the word Isis on it. Had to purchase another one without Isis on it.
B004XJMUSO|4|Seem to be good quality. We'll see how they hold up. They do look great on the sides of my TJ
B002R109DS|5|Great items. Fit perfectly. Took less than 10 minutes to install.
B00LPXQY8S|5|I love this smell!!
B0002JMFLQ|5|Just what my Son and I needed and could not find it locally. Great service.
B001AIZ5HY|5|worked like a charm on my 2001 VW Golf.  Didn't take too long and car definitely looked better afterwards.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Works very well in my Honda dirt bike!
B009DJV1MU|1|This is junk. Moisture in it after a few days
B000JWMML4|5|Back to original ride after 300,000 miles
B0022ZXO40|5|This is the net all others will be judged by. Well made!
B00P2D3VZG|3|Bulbs give out the perfect brightness and are bright white.  Unfortunately I am getting a bulb out warning no my ram 1500.  Philips needs to make a canbus version of these.
B00NP61VDQ|3|No way to know how scrapers work until winter arrives. in the meantime they look purdy
B00HETZBLS|4|Work as good as the more expensive ones
B0002Z9QSA|1|Used it once and it came apart made really cheap
B000WJA5ZY|4|nice to have just in case you could use it,  particularly if mounting it below the rear view mirror
B000UV6VDO|5|My grandson loves them said easy to install and the only one in town with orange lights!  He is working on more lights the seat and steering cover.  Great color for silver or black vehicle.
B008WVC0A2|1|The tool  is supplied by a third party and it appears that they have welded them together backwards. They crimp backwards when you try to use them. I emailed and asked if they could get me a set that are correct. They said that all I could do is reweld them myself or return for full credit. So I ended up taking them apart and rewelding them back together so that they work correctly now. They could have contacted the third party and got them involved but they didn't seam to be to worried about it.
B000C7NVCU|5|Great parts fast shipping got me going till I found out it wasn't my problem.
B00WO841EW|1|These were sold as made to fit a 011 Chevy Equinox.  They came and were made to fit a Volvo.  It would have cost more than I paid for them in order to ship them back to China.  They went into the trash.
B00SQ36L4C|5|Fits just like the original equipment.
B003FID1NW|4|Well, when I placed my order I wasn't even sure my car supported a key fob, so I took a gamble after having done some research on my car. Received today and could't be happier, except for the quality of the plastic used on the clam shell assembly (it's very much on the cheap side). Aside from that the unit works as advertised. In my 3 years with my used 99 Grand Prix GT I have never had a fob until today.<br />Pros<br />Programming instructions included.<br />Programming instructions easy to follow.<br />Unit works without defect.<br />Cons<br />The plastic is cheap
B003TSMQWU|5|This saved my bacon when I had to replace a screw in my car that was super close to the firewall. Literally less than an inch of clearance.<br /><br />Truly a situation where the right tool makes all the difference.
B003ILGY7G|5|Very satisfied & excellent quality! Durable and a  Very Happy Raider Fan!  I'm a very picky customer & won't buy or will speak my mind when something is made cheap!
B00IEYDZTC|5|Fast shipping. Tire fits as wanted
B00P2D3VZG|1|not working
B000C1PDKE|5|I put this on a 92 Jeep Cherokee Laredo and it fit like a glove.
B000XG8Q0W|5|Just what I was looking for.
B004FFHJ14|5|I am so happy I found a shield that was custom shaped to fit my 2015 Prius Hybrid. One reviewer indicated that managing it is precarious. No it isn't. You unroll it and install it. When it's time to remove it, you take it out, stand outside your car and roll it up like a poster, secure the Velcro, get back in and start your car. It's not taxing or difficult.
B00IOXQHRK|5|Thank s!  Arrived on time, I love them!
B000HS1356|5|I've been through a couple different motorcycle covers. Most develop holes and seem to disintegrate after six months or a year. This is without a doubt the best quality cover I've ever bought, and is well-worth the price if your bike is outdoors. I bought the sportbike-sized cover and it fits perfectly on my Ninja 500.
B00II5YD4S|5|Great to use! Saves you a lot of cloths.
B004DZ02SI|5|I bought one of these bags knowing it would be too big for my Suzuki Intruder windshield, because of speedo placement.  I found that it attached nicely to the rear seat area and was impressed enough that I bought another. These are great &#34;poor boy saddlebags&#34; for short trips. The seller was very prompt and courteous when contacted with a question.
B00PQ2AXMC|5|Came in fast. Exactly  what I needed
B00B9ETEVC|3|The keys did not work out cause you have to have the keys itself programmed as well as the remote and pay to have it ground.  cost way too much money!
B00SCLTXQG|5|Looks great!1
B00K5A9GF0|3|They worked and easy to put in.
B01177JJ2E|5|is perfectly fine in my lancer 2004 Japanese, one of the best buys I've done
B002TIUFWY|5|The best lube.
B011W8JA72|5|Excellent sticker. Trumps is our next president. Buh bye BO.
B000PSMVTA|5|Took some time to get a color match but when I did it looked great.  Better than buying a new car seat.  Can't tell where the tear is.  Great product.  Takes practice.  Don't be in a hurry.
B00V7W30UM|5|It was a perfect fit replacement to the original factory piece. And the price was so right.
B002OPCQII|5|I bought front and rear turn signal replacements for my 1990 Kawasaki Vulcan 750. They fit just like the originals and they're nice and bright! Recommended for anyone with the same bike or any Vulcans that use the same lights.
B000CERAV6|5|worked perfectly on my toyota pickup.
B009W2A27I|2|So weak!  Weaker than other lower torqued rating and old air guns.  Did not expect this from IR.  just a little bit stronger than my SK 3/8 drive air impact gun rating for 280 ft lb.
B00G620ZVU|4|Work well. Seem like a quality product
B004IZ85DW|5|Works perfect on 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8.  HUGE DIFFERENCE IN HANDLING, NO MORE CLANKING WHEN GOING FROM STOPPED. No Squeaking, made my wife love her car again.
B00RX78RPS|5|Bought for my 1996 Honda passport/ Isuzu trooper. Snapped right in after I took old ones out. I really only needed one because after I got one in it held up my back window. Night and day.
B000M5YYPU|5|Excellent for typical vehicle repairs- I have done several retrofits and this has been spot on for me!
B004K9ERI8|5|OEM parts without the dealer markup!
B004NW1SI4|3|I was not impressed with this product.  It did not give me the coverage I was expecting.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Planning to use on upcoming camper roof item installs.  Past experience great with this material.
B0023VFIZ6|5|as promised, prompt ship.
B004A30GXE|5|Best plug on the market. Progressive is a stand up company. No cheap import product. Made in the USA and quality is outstanding
B000XBCURW|5|The stuff works good. It leaves nice finish on the vinyl. Not shiny, nice.
B00U5OKH22|1|it does not fit in all the way.
B010OBP20M|2|DOESN'T STAY PUT
B000E7WLJW|5|This is an excellent bag! I bought it along with a CURT 18153 Hitch carrier. Together they make traveling so much easier. In love with the size of the bag. It expands to fit everything. The zippers are strong and held all the luggage for our trip. It rained several times and nothing inside ever got wet! I was so glad I had chosen this bag as all of our clothes for a week were packed inside. The straps easily and securely attached to the side railing of the hitch carrier. I am thrilled I purchased this bag. Don't spend hours over-thinking this purchase like I did. Get it! You wont regret it!
B00JIEX722|5|I cannot tell you how many of these I have purchased.  When they come and you get them out of the static free bag, you look at them and think, what have I bought for all this money???  Well I am here to tell you, they might look like nothing, but they are just the bulb for the task.  I also purchased the yorkim bulbs and they did not fit because they are too long.  These bulbs are right at the same size as the 194, etc. bulbs.  I was able to install these into the door lights of an 06 sequoia.  It looks like daylight in there.  If I cannot get the yorkim bulbs I will be using these because they are perfect!!!
B00BQYCIAO|5|Hold tons of water i almost zapped the whole bucket using this, firm on inside and plush on outside, keeps soapy, i used in tandem with a micro fiber wash glove for the tough spots
B000C23EAO|5|Great fit !!!!
B00DWVN08I|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Toyota Tundra SR5 DC
B000KZ1XVK|5|The remote works great! The instructions about programming was missing a step, but Google helped to solve that problem.
B00YB98WRE|5|Fits perfect, looks great easy to install
B000GV6DE0|5|Came as described. Awesome deal!
B004ME11FS|5|Works just fine for what it is. Satisfied.
B001QN8CIW|5|Great product, quick shipping, fair price! :-)
B004X5QPSO|5|Works great, great price
B001C5MEZ6|3|It is sized more appropriately for an adult rather than a child.  It is a large, but warm neck gater.
B00ODYHPMU|5|I love it.. but hate NY.. this is horrible making people pay this much for something.... NOT to mention because it's CA emissions the ONLY thing you can buy is this one and you can't even find it in NY!!!!!!! How goofy is that?  LOL
B00062ZPXE|5|👍
B0085DOQRC|5|It works really well. Makes paint like candy
B00E8B430K|1|Not for ducati 1098 2007 model
B00F6XA6F0|5|works great
B004JBOXJU|5|Not much to say about it. It's an air filter and it works as it should.<br />The price is a plus as well.
B0012INT98|5|Wonderful carrier!!
B003NIH4XW|5|Minor tweaking but Perfect fit. Looks like original
B004ZC3TFC|5|Excellent bit of equipment for the garage!
B000IZ9T4U|5|Excellent replacement for a failed actuator motor in my Ford Ranger.  Luckily when the original part failed it failed in full hot during the winter, now with the summer I needed AC.  This fixed that problem and the AC works great.
B001P2BHI6|5|Great price as described
B00NO3LLOO|4|EASY INSTALL AND GREAT DELIVERY
B0058FXMKW|5|A++++<br />Great service
B00YB5GAEA|5|Super bright, can been seen very easily  in dark. Great
B000E28CBS|5|K&N does it again....after having to hammer and pry the old filter off (NOT a K&N BTW) putting this one into the old R1150GS was a cinch! I will only ever buy these filters for my bike now. Never go to the STEALERSHIP for an oil change!  Check this out:<br /><br />STEALERSHIP - $79.95 special for oil change (probably + tax and whatever up sell you get suckered into) Call it $400 since you will do be impressed with them oiling the kickstand too...<br /><br />* Stamp in your yuppie book to prove you did maintenance.<br />* Maybe a loaner bike - Maybe a ride from a friend - Either way PITA<br />* Minimum 2 hour wait - likely bike gone for most of a business day.<br /><br />HOME - $28 for Gal oil; $10 for filter = $38 (delta - at least $42 possible $362 savings if you don't go for the works on the up sell)<br />* Stamp your own book if you care. Explain it during resale and the guy will think you really took care of the bike since you know what you are talking about.  Damn, do twice as many oil changes and he may think the bike is brand new... lol<br />* No rides or transport needed<br />* Less than 30 minutes<br />* Need a socket and Allen set; some rags and bucket.<br />* Put old oil into the empty oil jug and recycle at Auto-zone (or place of your choosing)<br /><br />I read some reviews about people torquing off the nut --- to that I say 6 ft/lbs of torque guys. That is the spec and only minuscule more than finger tight. Even if the nut was held on with bubble gum (it's not - seems to be pressed or spot welded) that is enough to hold it for 6 ft/lbs.
B001O0CC1U|5|Picked up some aftermarket wheels for my Camry and needed a set of lug nuts.  Just put these on the other day, and they worked great.
B002E5DT2A|3|This is a nice filter, appears to be a quality product, however it does not fit Freightliner Sprinter '03 2500 2.7. Unfortunately same happened at AutoZone, they were trying to sell the same filter. It is larger, it will not fit unless you trim it, which beats the purpose.
B004XZAJ0E|5|Oem part
B00E3M82XI|5|Great
B0031GTXQW|5|I was having problems with people stealing my gas cover, kids prank i guess But not anymore !
B00URUIKAK|4|Good product. No weird smell. Dramatically reduced the rattle in my truck from the sound system. I used 6 of the 9 sheets to fully cover the trunk in a solid layer, so I still have some left over for my doors if/when i decide to do those.
B00FEL0NXO|5|It looks great on our car!  exceeded our expectations.
B001SLEMZ4|5|had to put on upside down but works great
B00OFU33PU|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B0002F66EW|5|Fits like a glove...a big white round glove...for a tire.
B000IET39C|1|too noisy
B0016KFW1K|5|I have a 2015 bmw x5 35d with the m sport package and this hitch fit perfectly with no bumper modification. Total time to do the install start to finish was about 1 1/2 hours. Before you install, you will need plastic body tools (small pry bars made out of nylon) and a rivet gun for plastic rivets. The rivets that come with the hitch were the wrong ones for my 2015, but the bmw dealer had them in stock. Taking the wheel lip moldings off is a bit of a chore without breaking them, be sure to watch a youtube video first. Hitch fits nicely and looks like it came from the factory with it installed. I purchased a hitch plug from bmw to cover the square opening and it looks nice also.
B004TCZHSU|5|haven't used it yet but it will be fine
B002MF0O5C|5|Replaced the original lights like a charm. Remove three screws, the original lights, and put these in without a problem. Fit my 2004 perfectly.
B00K007R6U|2|I bought several of these based on reviews. They definitely get rid of any smoke smell. The smell they leave instead is cloying and reminiscent of a gas station bathroom. No thanks!
B00CLEUM6U|5|No Issues!
B0088WBI3A|5|Installed this on my son's 2000 tundra.  It fit perfectly and seems to be a quality part, solid and heavy.
B001QQD9DM|5|Great Product!, Good instructions If you are on the fence buy it you will not be disappointed!
B00O83OQJQ|5|Nice product
B00H6XPZN6|5|Nice price for good quality
B000ZFRFR6|3|IT SLIPS SO I PUT ELECTRICAL TAPE OVER THE RAIL FIRST..ALL GOOD NOW!
B0013FIMEW|5|great fit, as expected from factory parts.
B0010G9WMA|5|fixed the auto brake on my work horse motor home  - if your old one has fluid coming out of the electrical connector, you have only a short while to go.  can be changed without draining reservoir - I bought another to carry as a spare.
B009G4Y9RG|5|Speedy shipment and easy installation, and works great.
B00A6GHIZS|5|Perfect
B005DSRDUE|5|very nice
B003S62PC4|5|Perfect fit and great buy
B00AM3HBS4|5|These corner lights look great. Ive seen cheap ones with a plain design come apart on roads, plus they look terrible. These will fit right where your old ones mount and use the same mounting points. You cant go wrong with these.
B002SSP11A|5|Absolutely amazing !, .... perfect.
B005TW3GNC|5|Great kit, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS caliper. They look similar to the OEM parts and assembly work is seamless. I used them when installing the StopTech Brake Rotor and Pads. The old hardware might have still been usable, but for a small fee it gives you the peace of mind.
B001DESBW6|5|Yes. About the right thickness and stickiness. Note: clear is the universal donor here. It was all I needed. Now i won't get water condensation inside the lense.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Ok
B003NV7WXG|5|Best lighting kit I've ever seen. Very bright.
B00GWEU166|5|These LED bulbs were very easy to use as a direct replacement for the stock filament bulbs in my wife's 2006 Honda Accord.  The color is a pure white and they are *very* bright.  Once installed, they light up the entire interior (I replaced all 3 bulbs in my wife's Accord - two in the front and one in the back)<br /><br />REPLACEMENT:<br />You need to *safely* remove the original bulbs.  These tend to get very hot, very quickly.  The safest method for removal is to make sure the power is off to the bulbs (Keeping all the doors shut and making sure the switch is in the off position should do the trick) and using a small flat head screw driver to pry off the cover plates (Semi-transparent pieces) from the ends.  They're held on with two clips, one in the front and one in the back.  After removing the plates, gently pry up one side of the bulb from the holder and it should come out easily.  Use a cloth to pull it out (or to catch it when they decide to come flying out at you!)<br /><br />Installation is simple - Switch the lights on, open the car door and touch the silver contacts to the bulb mounts.  If they light up, press in until they set.  If they don't, turn them around the opposite direction and test again - if there's still no light, you might have a bad one, try again.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B00G1Y4QMM|1|Very bad I will have to stoppin amazon
B00LNECSFC|1|Had it two days and it started ripping
B000NK7992|5|Can't beat the price for what you get
B00QZCN2YI|5|This product DOES fit the 2014 Z51 convertible. It fits perfectly.  I verified the fact with the manufacturer before ordering it as the websites of some vendors imply that the WeatherTech cargo mat is different for the base and the z51 versions.
B000CO96FE|5|Solved a big problem for my car in a foreign country.
B0002AJR8E|1|Very very slow to pump the oil out of my boat, a Mercruiser with 6 quarts of oil in it took 45 minute to remove all the oil. Also, on 2nd usage, the tank collapsed after 20 pumps, causing it to cease working. Find a different pump to buy.
B0029DATX4|5|perfect!!!
B00RC9NH34|1|Sorry,its just to rough to put on a car.....may scratch the paint..also no hole to go over the roof antenna...will damage the antenna if you use it as well..
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|I can't really tell you how helpful this thing is.... really stop asking just buy it charge it and use it that is all you need to know. BUY it
B0075VE936|5|works!
B000B66UUW|5|As described and fit
B002T4MBES|5|I love this tool
B000C2UDW6|5|Looks just like OEM!
B008ZJS1F4|5|Love it...fits perfect, and well padded...nice design and all my biker friends want to copy me and get that exact same jacket...copy cats
B000CLN05E|5|Wagner is the Best at Least for me, so if you need brakes get Wagner Ceramic.
B00GT36UVA|5|works well for the basic gringo helmet. might want to consider getting the gringo S for the flip shield.
B000IYQLJC|5|Exactly what I needed.
B0031HRJ5S|5|Was glad to be able to buy Timken because of their great reputation.
B00TFDV28C|1|I received this on Thursday, put it in on Friday, rode it on Saturday and it quit working after about 10-15 starts. Very disappointed.
B000J2JED8|5|OK
B00HSE3E3G|5|Did the trick until the water lines inside my trailer broken. No fault of the hose.
B000FQ7NV8|5|Amazing I bought these with the front grill inserts and painted them lime green, they both came out awesome and was very happy with them.
B00CAY4TSI|4|Perfect fit for my DR Grader
B000AM8BJU|5|brings out such a nice shine and even smells pretty good!
B001C802UW|5|Fit perfectly, arrived on time. This is for the crew cab 4 door trucks, 1992-97. Weathertech makes the best products in the categories they offer. Easy installation.
B0028JLO3I|1|Does not do what it claims
B00AA7HXPI|5|GOOD PRICE
B001810SHA|5|An inexpensive way to reboot your older car's AC!
B00PW7YMPU|3|Ok just took awhile to break in!
B009DJM00W|5|problem solved
B008G1WI4G|5|Easy to install. Actually looks better than the original tail lights.
B0012TT6OO|5|Can't find locally. Good price.
B007TZBJI6|5|Exactly what I was looking for!  Fast delivery!  Thanks!
B0009V1WSE|5|nice items
B007OWYIWS|4|matched OK, had a rough finish vs the original had a smooth finish
B005C205JC|5|Excellent they look great
B008FQ6DNO|5|This grill looks just like the original on my 2003 BMW M3 Convertible, but it is better. As another reviewer mentioned, the locking tabs which hold it in place are metal, unlike the plastic ones on the original which broke off necessitating this purchase. Installation took all of 10 seconds. Line it up. Push it in. Done!
B0054RQ7NI|5|Was perfect
B002801NI8|4|Used on a 2015 Ford F150. So far so good.  The surface that ‘seats’ against the rim is smaller (narrower surface) that the nuts I took off.  Easy to over tighten... not sure if that is bad for the rim, but I got out a torque wrench and set it a little bit above the Ford recommended torque. In the interest of safety, I will check back on these reviews for a while and if I have anything to add I will do so... Good luck!
B004ZLAQRM|2|Perhaps my review is premature? I tried this glaze on my silver car and it didn't help it . I left off thinking that I will give it another try . And I also will try it on a white car I own. So my 1st impression was less than positive but I haven't completely given up on this product yet...
B001GJ3FIS|5|nice nozzle .easy on the hands.
B000UKF24Y|5|good
B002YKER7G|5|This is the best hand cleaner I have ever tried. I used the old cherry cleaner from the auto store and my hands were still stained after working on my truck, then I used this stuff and they came clean. It doesn't take a lot of cleaner, but it works much better to get your hands wet before you add the cleaner. The dispenser is great for my home shop.
B000CDAEAQ|5|Great windshield wiper blade
B00067BWWM|5|worked as intended
B000630358|4|You get the JAWS only, but they do fit most ratchet type crimping pliers.
B001B7RRUW|5|These boxes are awesome, I put one on each side of my truck bed.  Highly recommend.
B000OZS9Y0|5|happy customer
B00G5RTYYK|5|Just what my son wanted, they worked perfect
B00HZ0A4QS|5|Very satisfied!
B00A93TOWS|5|Arrived quickly, packed well, easy to install and looks awesome on the front of my STS-V!
B0026P8VYO|5|Good stuff, fast delivery, my girl loves it
B00AEK4BQU|5|Looks great painted with ease
B00B9HM0GA|5|Went on easy. Was a perfect fit. Good buy!!
B009DJSM0E|1|Poor company and poor quality product. Flimsy and cheap. Zero stars. The grill did not come with the insert as advertised. The company contacted me after e-mailing them and they said they made a mistake and would correct the listed. They refunded me $35.00 but have to correct the listing. Also be wary that my father had other dealings with them when purchasing a hood. The hood was poor quality and came dented. The refunded partially but when I closed the hood it dented in another spot! I had to go through the ringer to get a refund.<br /><br />AutoParts Giant: Are you going to correct the listing or simply try to mislead more people? It's been three days.
B00CEKBT40|5|Fit and works great ! very pleased.
B000QIPPI8|5|exactly like the original only it works , uses all the same connections
B00D3QUHCO|5|Works great.
B009X1UV1U|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING
B00X619KJC|5|Works great with my Aspect solar EnergyBar.
B009DJKT7S|5|Just as described
B00NEL6HK4|2|fits too tight
B00V1OIL14|5|Love it. SS & complete with locking pin. Perfect protection for the 2 outboard bumper &#34;wings&#34; if rear ended. Load goes to frame through HD hitch.
B000WAFJSG|2|Not so good.
B003HB5VTO|5|nice price
B009OBW29S|5|excellent wax.
B001KQ43SI|5|ordered two, came with jumpers works fine
B00BMEUUJ4|2|Fit ok initially but had to remove the tank again for something else and this was ripped.
B005K01GSA|1|Doesn't fit my 2013 Chevy impala. Waste of money. Don't waste your money on this product!!!!!
B003GZE81I|5|Great product and warranty.
B0014BAKLI|5|All is well.
B00ZI5E7YC|5|I took out the individual pieces and distributed them where I wanted them in the motorhome.
B00GJXM0DC|5|Exactly what it said it was. Fit perfectly and shipping was great. Thank you.
B00ATGGYT6|5|Very good quality. Had my car dyno'd gave me at least +35hp.
B00KAV9EDS|5|Diagnosed and cleared abs and des codes when my battery had lost power.  2004 Volvo xc70
B00JM5ZC70|5|I got these step bars today and installed them tonight!  The key to the instructions is to pay attention to the RELIEF in parenthesis.  That helps you identify the front, center and back parts since they do not label these.  What looks like a notch in some of the brackets is what they call a RELIEF.  So the square shaped notch is for the front, the oval shaped notch is for the center and no notch is for the back.  It can be a tight fit getting the proper sockets or wrenches up in there but just take your time and you will get it done.  It took me approx 2 hours to install these.<br /><br />The only issue I had is one of the hex socket button head screws did not have the hex cut out of the head of the screw.  It somehow slipped through the manufacturing process without being cut out.  I will be contacting Westin on that.<br /><br />Overall easy to install and they look great on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited!
B00Y195OR0|5|Great protection for what I need.
B000C543BU|5|Good price
B0033YLXUQ|5|My wife loved it..
B001EWVOZS|5|Great price
B007EYG6EY|3|Lenses were very good quality. Mounting brackets/adjusters were unusable ,had to swap with original factory mounting.
B0009XT7NY|5|This is an excellent tool for the a/c tech.  It fits R-12 cans, R-12 oil charge, R-134a cans.  Pretty much an excellent made tool-
B007JMTS14|5|Work great. I used a hydraulic crimper to fasten these to the 4 gauge wire and it worked very well
B004ZF39T0|5|First off, these lights are awesome. Really bright and perfect color. I got the 12000k and they look amazing on my car. Very easy to install and takes maybe 10 minutes. One of the ballasts didn't work so I called them and explained what happened, and they sent me a new one free of charge without any questions. Very good company and I would recommend these to anyone! Great product at a great price
B0002JN2EU|5|Magic...have a 10 year old Yamaha 40 hp outboard.  After I think I used some old mix oil...it ran like _____.  I saw a guy at the slip and he suggested seafoam.  I bought it here...poured it in with 7 gallons on new gas and oil (25 gallon tank) and within 15 minutes, not only does it fix it...it runs better than it has in years.  I will use this now every other tankful- forever.
B00MRCK23E|4|very bright, good for the money
B00J4Z9SIC|3|I feel it is a design flaw that these break so easily.  These replacement parts are not of the same quality as the original part.
B009PIIPHI|5|Great quality, durable construction and perfect fit!
B00030CY5G|5|I love it.
B000WJQAJE|5|Awesome Product, Cant wait to buy again.
B005MESQPA|5|like the sound
B00469N1ZC|5|great product but did not fit my boy, 5' 1&#34; 84 pounds and was too small.
B00KY98S0Q|5|Better than the Tesla supplied pocket
B00480J4PU|4|I love the CrystalVision lights both high and low beam. They shine at a much brighter rate and things are more clear. W/o the need to blind the oncoming drivers.
B0025QZMRI|5|Used it for all of the  plastic &#34;chrome&#34; around the windows and along the sides and front/rear of my 2005 Lincoln Towncar, including the &#34;chrome&#34; grill.  It went on very easy and required very little effort and left the &#34;chrome&#34; looking like new.  It had previously looked like it was tarnished with a marble effect.  I was trying to find another product that someone recommended, but I was unable to find that product and settled on this one and BOY am I glad that I did.  NOTHING could have worked better and I couldn't be happier!
B013VAKX5W|5|These LEDs are great step up from my regular lightbulbs in my car. I drive a Honda CRV 2010 model. These fit perfectly with my Honda, and these are great. These are supposed to be more power efficient and they should last longer. I expected a little more from the packaging, because the packaging seems sort of generic and a little plain. But they really do work and instructions were pretty straightforward. I definitely recommend these! I got this product at a discount for a review but all my product reviews unbiased.
B007V2EEW0|1|Keeps falling down in my 2011 Kia Optima...doesn't cover the inside of the windshield perfectly either.
B00PWXIEVM|5|Somewhat easy installation. Sturdy and quiet while driving.
B001J8M80C|5|fits better than expected
B003PO38P2|5|Bought for son's car. We keep 1 in each of our vehicles. Better to have it & never need it. Quality piece.
B0050SFZBG|5|This tool is awesome! Save yourself some cash and get this instead of new hoses.
B008VQP2YE|5|Way stronger and better built. Real Heavy duty.
B00BCRMAAS|5|Great product fit great did take about an hour an a half to install it looks like its actually the seats. If you take your time installing it, it will look good and stay.... I'm in an occupation where I get in and out all day long a minimum of 25-30 times it still looks good this went on a 2013 jeep wrangler
B001V8RWBU|3|Is a very good product however, the warranty is a joke...i called them because my Jack bend in a very weird way and I believed is a manufacturer defect. I sent the pictures and explained how it happened and I a here, 3 weeks later no respond.<br />800Lb tongue trailer and it bend in a 20 degree uneven campground driveway.
B000ALJ406|5|Matches perfect !
B00DP67WFW|5|I love this kit the best hid kit I ever bought great color fast shipping  error free comes with everything you will need just like it says on the description it's going on a year since I got the kit the bulbs are still nice and bright since day one still looks like new very bright on the road  everything looks so clear at night I recommend this kit to any one trying save money on the long run this kit last a very long time and really has 2 years warranty, not like the other kits that last only a month or 2. I will buy OPT7 products again again even for my grandma's car
B008WG5SLK|3|So first off, it's not paint ready right out of the box, you need to wet sand it with 2000 paper to make it ready then prime then sand again because well I guess for the price it's alright but there were some imperfections and scratches, looks like it was painted because when sanding it some of the paint cheaped off... Again you get what you pay for, the lip didn't fit in perfectly into the bottoms grill of my 2001 bumper but I can deal with it, other than that it's a lip that fits pretty well other than around my bottom grill, there is space and it's because it just doesn't fit well. There weren't any pictures when I bought the lip on Amazon so I thought to post some so you guys can see what it's going to look like, befores and afters.<br /><br />I can't stress this enough... YOU MUST SAND! Primer it, sand it again then primer it again. Seriously if you want it to come out nice so it that way. There will be imperfections on your lip.<br /><br /> Installation was pretty easy I used double sided tape and the screws that we provided.<br /><br />And sorry for not the greatest pictures I just toke them quickly.
B007CTQKVU|5|Works great and was a good price.
B00JA1C4MM|2|installed on a 2003 subaru impreza 2.5<br /><br />build/metal quality is good but the flanges were over 1 1/2&#34; off and had to stretch a lot to fit.. and after installation the pipe hits on the subframe when accelerating from a stop and at low rpm even after checking to make sure the motor mounts are tight the pipe is just extremely close to the frame. overall im not too thrilled with this purchase..
B00YLFSMWI|3|Customer service answered my original concerns (I am a dummy and should read the proper application steps). However, IMO the carbon fiber pattern is barely visible. From the pictures I was expecting a more vivid pattern, but in the end it was barely visible. As far as vinyl goes, it is quality stuff, but it just didn't match my aesthetic expectations.
B001DRLPXU|5|Good filter.
B002SEEC50|5|I ordered two sizes up then got it cut
B0031BTC4U|5|A little large but matches my pegs and grips.
B00RV7K0BY|5|Have not yet installed it, but will work just fine on my Nighthawk.
B00KNAUA5W|5|I was reaching the floor on my tippy toes so I decided to get this to help me gain confidence since I'm vertically challenged. Bike is now sitting comfortably lower, not a good idea if you run this in the track and your knees are touching the ground, but for a bike that I drive around town this made it a lot more comfortable. I'm playing around with the settings to find the right settings, but am happy with the bike now.
B00C5SGEQO|5|Fit perfectly on the vents for my Casita 17' Spirit Deluxe, no problems.
B00P9OF4EE|5|Great stuff, makes your car shine.
B0066SHPVW|5|Perfect fit for 2004 E46 M3
B00NWGZ3A6|5|To prevent confusion for others - Amazon description and pictures currently describe this as the &#34;MSR-P600&#34;.  What arrived was the &#34;UT120C&#34;.  The two units look exactly the same but for the name label and the specs are exactly the same so I suspect it is just a name change.  The Ektacity website only lists the UT120C.  I tested the multimeter in volt, amp and capacitance mode on arrival with accurate results.  Seems perfect for small project use and just what I was hoping for.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works well with Forscan, I'm very satisfied!
B004AJBJ7K|5|Fit my 08 Silverado with no problems!<br />Took off my tow rings then removed number.<br />I did have to however drill a hole in each mount bracket. You'll see where.<br />I did NOT have to cut my bumper. I just aligned brackets/arm and forced bumper back on with mounting brackets pushed snuggly thru where tow hooks were.<br />Installed tray and a 12,000 lb winch and was on my way.
B003ZHU45Q|5|Appears quite sturdy
B0024ECCJW|5|Working great. Easy to install. Was getting low on propane and really didn't want to have to unhook to go get some. At a 6 month job with hookups. This product along with a cheap electric hotplate will now allow us to stay put until the end of the job. Then I'll just put the anode rod back in until we're somewhere else for an extended period.
B000F2Z0QM|5|Excellent
B000E4NOLO|1|only half the movement works, after re sending the original only to find the replacement is defective...decided to live with less than satisfactory purchase.
B0068ETZNU|5|Good seller, great product for the money. No need to spend all that money on some of what the competitors sell. This is singlehandedly the best bang for the buck. I installed it on my efi sportser 1200 2007 worth every penny. Total setup drilled stock exhaust this intake and a powercomander 5 .
B005CLMQNG|5|Just what I needed, good product & fast service.
B000BQWLE6|2|Um.... Was this a magicians hat?<br />Should have read the reviews first, it can be useful in unexpected ways (maybe for rabbits)<br />Cute and small- might be useful in a car- but definitely NOT in an RV.
B000CQ6IIA|5|Great product does what is job well.
B013FZZUYM|5|Good quality ,this handle are very strong I strongly recommend
B00BMRRXSM|4|Worked just as expected.  It was a gift and it went over well.
B002BR1KVS|5|Gloves are one if the most important items to have.  When you go down you naturally put your hands down.  I went down wearing a different pair of studded palm gloves and they saved my hand and fingers.  The studded palm slid along the pavement while the pinky was protected by the extra leather.  I was able to push myself away from the pavement.  My hand suffered no abrasion.  For the money these are a good summer glove perfect for commuting.  They have layers of leather in critical areas.  External stitching.  Soft palm slider.  Excellent knuckle protection.  I rode for two hours straight with these gloves.  They were very comfortable and allowed me to interface with all of my controls very well. They flow air very well. These are some of the best fitting gloves of all the gloves I tried on.  Many of the track gloves, especially European were to tight and the next size up the fingers were too long.  Stay true to your size and add a half inch like the size chart recommends.  These are a great glove for commuting around town.  For the money you can't beat them.  I have other gloves for more aggressive riding but they cost $100.00 more.  And for a short commute they are not as comfortable.  A great every day glove.
B00T6JDPUS|4|I'm using these with my BMX race bike.  I just moved up to intermediate level and am new to clipping in.  The shoe is comfortable for walking around in at the track and feels really secure while riding.  I like the flap the covers the laces and the clip base is replaceable.  The sizing was right on.  I wear a 12 and ordered a 12.  At first they seemed a bit snug but have loosened up after a few sessions.  By my third moto they loosen up enough i often retie them.  Would recommend.
B004ZF39T0|2|Item came on time with 2 day shipping. When I tried to install the bulb, it would not fit into the housing. Reason? The O-rings are too thick. I have attached a picture showing what my old one (left) and the new one (right) looks like. Items look to be well made and sturdy but it is just unfortunate that there was a design flaw for the 2002 Honda Accord Coupe (2dr) EX. I shall be returning these and purchasing from somewhere else. Great pricing though!
B007HQ6E6E|5|Fit as expected, my mower is a Craftsman, so this will fit more than just John Deer<br />Thanks
B00QKW76ZE|5|good job for me
B00D60CQQW|1|Solid build. But look a bit loose
B010VUZGFC|5|I am totally satisfied i
B00FNXBTMC|5|Works perfectly as a replacement in my APC UPS.
B009AIK1N4|5|Great for split folding the seats
B0091VDZVA|5|Heavier than expected, but durable.  Nice tread.  Nice width.  Convenient fold with solid catchment fingers.  Nice shape to the ramp too.  Makes loading and unloading easy.
B003SWNVI0|1|On the third day of our trip, the top started to shred. We had to buy ducktape and pray it would hold.
B00N6NLM5A|5|This is a very nice sticker - a perfect rave item for my car and it was easy to place.<br />I love it! Thank you very much
B00HZ873UA|5|Ordered a 3865 got this one instead at no extra cost. Noticed alittle more power the shifting was was firmer. But I had previously installed performance exhaust system and a C.A.I. it's nice to know I have alittle more power in reserve! For my hemi charger!
B007B86Z94|4|good value for the price
B00DSOL2CA|1|I returned the first one because only one gauge lit up and the water temp was incorrectly showing hot. The replacement has only two gauges lighting up and the same problem with the water temp gauge. If the stock sending unit isn't going to work with the after market gauge you should tell people to get a after market sending unit or send one with it. It was expensive and is a cheap piece of crap.
B000COUPP4|1|The reluctor on my distributor also has a sleeve attached.
B001F1UDPK|5|Great price and very fast delivery
B00WYO2OYK|4|I hope I don't have to ever use it to jump a car, but that ability is there. I did use it the way I intended which is charging up a cell phone. It does ok with that. It does not have the same capacity as the older heavy style ones, but it worked fine charging the phone a couple times, before it needed a recharge.It is very light and and much smaller than what it replaced. Since I use it on a motorcycle it does what I need and the size is very important.
B004GCDIU2|3|Bought this and figured out it only fits 2007-2009 sedans. So beware of that
B00KV8U20O|5|Awesome and super bright.
B00XC15T3W|4|Work well and are bright. Slight pink hue, would like a deeper purple but hey for the money these things are great. I have these purple ones on my truck, and I also have green ones on my motorcycle. Still bright, work everytime.
B00JXYIGCS|5|Product 100% compatible with 2004 Ford Focus Zetec (Wagon).
B00474A1M2|4|appears to be good quality, and I use it only when I take the antenna off of the car
B00BQS7KHQ|5|fit 2000 vw jetta
B006YBB91I|5|Perfect fit for my truck and just in time for the fall season
B00KXK79BK|5|WORKED, stopped my JDM headlights from dim flickering when headlight was on then turned off
B00R56ZQCE|5|Perfect fit holes lined up perfect on my 2015 Jeep Patriot !
B00JLVF59A|5|I bought these for my FR-S as a replacement for my halogen Daytime Running Lights, and they're great! They are almost brighter than my LED Headlights that I bought.
B00AJ0D15W|5|Great value and looks good on my bike.
B00192KYE0|3|I wanted to use a trash bag so I wouldn't have to wash it out before packing up trailer.  However, I had to use clothes pins to hold bag in place which prevents zipper top from closing.  Also if you are camping for more than a weekend you will have to empty multiple times.  Think we will go back to using our larger pop up that doesn't zip for trash and using this for outdoor toys.
B000C9OTY2|5|Greta belt a lot better then I thought it would be.
B00QMWQSAG|1|I thought they would be heavy duty and they are not. Do not stay in place.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Its been great!
B002692308|3|Looks factory correct, did not fit very tight, thankfully it has 2 sided tape on the backside to secure it. For the price, not a bad buy.
B00PTQOF4W|5|Works great on my Maverick with a 40&#34; LED bar!
B00BMZO9EU|4|it worked out fine! i did have some welding done but it worked out . p .s. the ford dealer wanted 84.00 for this same hinge ass'y...thanks amazon
B0031GSSUE|4|work perfect in honda civic 1999
B000WZ4KBS|2|I should have noticed that this winch does not come with a strap. That made the $15 dollar winch cost 25 dollars and a week delay to get the parts together. Then once I had the strap I see the winch didn't come with a bolt to retain the strap winch means a trip to the hardware store and back. I could have a1500 lb winch for what u paid for this 600 lb winch. If it wasn't aReese it would have been 1 star.
B00KEIEIE2|5|Installed these on a 2014 and 2015 FZ-09. They fit perfectly. Make sure you take the stock cylinder spacer out of the clutch lever and install it into the new lever. It matches up with the width of the stock clutch lever bolt.  Otherwise it will bind and not be fluid. I'm blown away for $38 how well these fit. I don't see how I could justify spending $200 on a set of ASV's. It looks like these are the same as the Pazzo levers, but at about a 1/5th of the price.
B010CBVUX2|5|Look great
B000EDOT7I|3|Not sure if I like this yet.  I will give it another try.
B0042OX8WC|5|Great part,works like its supposed to. Showed up when i was promised.cant ask for more than that.
B00O7XYRQO|5|Wow, i like this Zone Tech New Driver Please Be Patient Automotive Car Vinyl Magnet REFLECTIVE.I am a new driver and everytime i was in the road i feel nervous cause some vehicles are really close to my car and i drove slowly .So no im happy i recieved this kind of sticker. I love it its easy to put cause it is magnetic.
B003UUA610|5|like it
B000QR6XJ4|5|Absolutely positively the BEST air freshener on the market.  This and the same company's orange based freshener are the ONLY fresheners I've ever used which didn't make me immediately regret I used them.  Highly recommended.
B005JPGTNI|5|For the price you cannot go wrong with this add on item.  It has everything you need for any small wet sand job.<br /><br />Value 5*<br />Quality 5*
B00LE38JPU|5|Fit as expected, Excellent product
B00BRAVCEK|3|The reception is worse than the original 14&#34; or so antenna that came with the car. It was cheap, and it does the job. I like the look of the shorter antenna on the car, but the reception isn't as great. A few trees, and i get some static.
B00A8NXRVS|5|Great look
B00COYNZJ8|5|Absolutely love it. Had it for 3 months and haven't had any problems with flaking whatsoever. It has really helped me keep my car cool these summer months, which is really important as I've been working with and driving around special needs clients. It does bend and get some creases from the hot sun, but those change the next time I put it up in the windshield. It also helps me find my car in the parking lot :) Would easily recommend this to anyone!
B000NU23CK|5|Great product sounds great
B00FFDPPCA|2|This really does not replace the original factory items. The upper Gasket is Too Soft. Therefore requires to slam the pedal for it to seal. Otherwise looses water in the bowel.
B00TKIC5LA|5|Fit perfectly on my scx10 deadbolt rtr, can't beat the price. I like that they don't have any logo on them and came with the screws that axial charges 7 bucks for a pack of 10 and you need 12 to do lower links and steering.
B001DDMB2I|5|Great tool to have. A must in cleaning carbs.
B0016C3SZK|5|As another reviewer posted, this is great protection for your rear bumper. My SUV has parking sensors and I wouldn't want them damaged. This protects them and nobody parks too close behind me.
B000M5Y72A|5|great product!
B00U7WOV8S|5|awesome upgrade to my rzr 1000
B0034ZYE5U|5|Easy install , came with wire harness with more than enough wire to reach on a 6 seater sxs along with  very easy instructions
B000E288JE|5|Great price, fast shipping
B000KL7NZE|3|Worked as expected
B0090UN116|1|I ordered the first set an then had to get another set an put both together to have one good set so it's ok
B00120IEE6|5|Fit and finish was great !
B00CGTVMBE|3|PROS:  No matter how hot the car gets, the wheel feels smooth and comfortable.  It seemed to be well made.  Cushy and easy to drive with once I moved those ridges out of the 10 and 2 positions.  The ridges do give a sense of more control somehow when the wheel spins back into position after a turn.  Attractive, matches my Ford Freestar van's interior perfectly.    CONS: Definitely NOT odor free.  It should say &#34;smells less.&#34;  To be fair the odor dissipates in a few days of heavy sun, unlike others that take months of smelling bad, but it does still smell a little.  So, not exactly accurate.  I also don't like the ridges in the 10 and 2 o'clock positions.  Uncomfortable, so I took it off and repositioned it for occasional contact.  Difficult to get onto the wheel.  It's sized for 14.5-15.5&#34; wheels and mine falls in that range, so I was surprised that it took five minutes of near breaking my fingers to get the thing on the wheel.  Conclusion:  didn't like it at first and considered sending it back, but getting it off the wheel wouldn't have been easy without scissors so I decided to keep it.  Now it's okay.
B00WL4GUPC|5|Looks nice on my scooter
B003RX2QQ8|3|Have not been able to get it programmed so it would work consistently.  Bought for back up, it  worked for a while only.
B008427D88|5|worked well
B0022XI24E|5|👍
B000VTLJBE|5|01 volvo v70xc. Used whole case to flush transmission. Transmission was slipping/hard shifts. Problem solved right away. Took only about 1 hour from walking into garage to driving away.
B000N9LCH8|5|The pump works great on my evinrude sportwin 9.5 hp. The fuel holds a good prime now and motor cranks on 1st or 2nd pull. I did have to purchase longer mounting screws as this pump is approximately 1/2&#34; thicker. Fuel line lined up perfectly.
B00D42AFS8|5|Love the new jump pack so stoked
B003O4S6B4|5|The blue LED lights I purchased worked very good I enjoyed seeing them on my bike unfortunately I broke one of them pressing on the board to install it as a 3m sticky tape on the back does not stick very well
B00WWXP4K4|5|Love it perfect size
B00B0201TM|4|Got these on sale at OC D-Store. I am size M for Alpinestars gloves and was planning on getting their GP Pro gloves, but medium were a bit loose and the small were too tight, especially around the knuckles. When I was at the D-Store buying the Laguna Evo jacket, I mentioned to the sales person that I can also looking at some gloves. I told him about the fit issue with the GP Pro and he showed me the Carbon Cover ST. Medium were a bit loose and too long on the fingers, so trying the small and were very snug, but at least not as tight as the Alpinestars GP Pro. The sales person told me the gloves should fit snug as they will break in and get a bit loose, which I agreed. He then suggested that I should wear them at home when ever I can to break them in faster as one would have more finger/hand movements during the everyday living compare with riding. So, I just wore them while vacuuming the house (about 60 minutes). They did break in nicely after about two weeks of wearing them around the house from time to time. Although the protection is slightly less comparing with the GP Pro, but they are also almost $100 less.
B00PB96L2Q|4|So far so good work mostly on American cars the only problem is some of the adaptors threads were. Bit short. Took seal off and used oring worked well
B002LCD9XU|4|Looks good. Goes on easily.
B0067UM6ZE|5|Perfect!  Fixed my '99 Chevy Blazer. Easy install.
B0009VIQ1A|5|This is my second California Duster.  The product is wonderful as all the dust clings to the duster.  It's a car buffs must haves!
B007OWYIWS|4|Perfect fit, more durable than the original.
B00AZMICOY|5|Great price compared to the name brand ones on the market and just as good (imo).
B001HQC8U6|1|wrong size and easy to break very flimzy
B001DRJO3S|5|Perfect fit and easy change once you get the filter cover off.
B00DKU2V1I|5|i was looking for something like this˜!!! have not used it yet but its 3M..... they run the world.... pretty much set the standards,.... so its gotta be good cause i bet there isnt any better.... cause if there was... its probably still made by 3M
B000M6XQUI|5|Good quality easy to install.
B000GV2PF6|5|install was really easy. excellent replacement for the original clutch. It definitely increased the &#34;friction zone&#34; of the clutch lever that most people complain about with the Vstars. The friction zone starts nearly at the fully clenched position. it will take a bit of getting used to since I rode the old clutch for 6 years.
B00FLFX1QO|5|Perfect fit thank you
B007ZUGIK4|4|the fan work really well, the horn sucks
B00IHHLLXI|5|excellent
B006O85ULQ|5|Excellent chain, had to really pinch the master link to get the clip on, but eventually got it on. Chain loosened after about 150 miles but one easy readjustment and it's been steady ever since.<br /><br />Very high quality, 10/10 would buy again.
B000CSGX3I|5|excellent
B000I4JPZE|1|First trip out with our new Lance 2285, we picked up a piece of metal in a tire. Placed Trailer Aid in front of good tire as directed and pulled the trailer up onto it. Bad tire (totally flat) was not lifted off ground, or even high enough to rotate or move. Had to call road service. Guy said &#34;those things rarely work, and when they do, they're dangerous&#34;. We have used it for leveling in uneven campgrounds. Buy a bottle jack!
B0000AY9HO|5|Nice product at a good price.
B00MU6VBBO|5|This AFR is the one to have. I have used in for years now and has given consistent results every time. IT works flawlessly and for the price it is a no brainier to get.
B00NLMDWRW|4|Came quickly, fits pretty good. Didn't have any issues with improperly placed mirror pockets. There aren't any! I just now received it, so can't speak for durability, UV resistance, but so far, so good, and the Motor Trend label on the front makes orientation, front to back, easy. I unscrew my antenna. Easy with a pliers, so I don't have to cut a hole. I'm betting I got my 30 dollar's worth. Giving it 4 stars only because time will tell if it deserves the fifth one.
B0091OE6II|5|I have one of these already but am selling the car so I needed new ones.  Pink!  That's my favorite color!  And arrived promptly.  These make life so much easier for me because I am short and round and having a seatbelt choking and cutting into my neck was not fun.  A friend introduced me to these and I would recommend them for everyone!
B002S70MP6|5|10 years and 177,777 miles later, my Acura MDX air wasn't cold and it was 91-degrees outside. I was hoping that this was an easy fix and not the compressor. Hopped over to the auto shop and picked this can up. I watched a quick YouTube video on how to do the refill on my system and then did it outside of my office. Couldn't be simpler. The only limiting factor was that I did this without wearing (the recommended) gloves and my hand would get hot from the hot engine. By the time I got about half the can into the AC system, my car was nice and cool again! Going to recharge fully (or to the end of the can) when I get home, but this stuff works and works great.
B000CPCBEG|5|Every fluid in my car is Red Line
B007V2BHES|4|Not as fit as customization should, but OK with the transaction and materials used for the sunshade.
B000KIMHRQ|1|Digital display didn't work out of the box.
B00OC94H8G|4|Nice product and cheap.  I don't really need really high quality tool to install the cam seals, don't need much force to install them anyway.  Shipping is too long, about a month to get it
B009DJZQS0|5|GREAT
B008RQGIO6|5|Great product !
B0009JB7GI|5|Its just as I expected it to be
B00TO2WD1Y|5|Awesome cover b/c it is EASY to get on (elastic), soft to the touch, and keeps the wheel from reaching 200 degrees when the top is down! Love it.
B00SYGN5I6|5|We loved it.
B00KIHC90Y|5|😃👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
B00IGJECR4|5|Amazing! Fit my Honda Accord coupe perfect! they looked perfect quality
B01114V3BI|5|It's legit! Plugged it right into my truck, identified the make, model, etc.... and then was able to easily navigate to clear a code.
B00HQT2K7O|5|Awesome product. Delivered on time. Exactly as shown in picture, very good packing. Good quality,It suits the FJ very well. Thank you APS
B000V528JU|4|This was 1.5&#34; longer than the stock end links I replaced.  Still fit however.  Just make sure you remove the old ones from both sides before attempting to put the new ones on.
B00N5C28BO|5|This works fine if you want to remove fuel from an automobile.  Very few will either fit into the tank or others do not have a long enough hose.  It also works with late model cars which don't have a traditional fuel cap.  As such you need to use the supplied funnel to gain access to the tank.
B00GHK6VDM|5|fit my 08 mazda 3 perfectly
B00J0Z0H36|5|Ordered this product Saturday afternoon and it arrive Tuesday of the following week. Talk about fast shipping!! The fob was a perfect for for my 2011 Hyundai and I couldn't have asked for a better deal.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and company.<br />Please Note: This is simply an empty shell for a fob that is already program!!
B00GGLVXG2|5|Works great with my Bluetooth scanner so I can just tuck it up out of the way and not keeping bumping into it. Will update if I have any trouble with this part.
B001EOV492|5|Arrived on time and packaged well. Good quality. Fit exact !
B0031XR1EG|5|It was what I wanted.  So it was all good
B004QHLG4W|5|Its been about 6 months since purchasing and installing....so far so good absolutely no issues. Came with everything needed to simply replace broken hub. I've used GMB parts in the past and have never had issues. Quality parts at an affordable price.
B000CRO4IK|5|Perfect for holding coins in the car cup holder.
B004QEKGDC|3|took me a while to install in, direction weren't that good....I'm also not that smart though
B010TRL3JU|5|great product - great company
B005HR17RG|5|Fits perfects looks good decent quality<br />Thumbs up
B00JHQ877Q|4|Great when getting cut off. Hiding the tank wasn't easy on my truck, but worth it. They are very loud!!!
B000CIV4PU|1|Item not as described. No brass connector was included.misleading and disappointing.
B00CE0MDKY|4|Really pleased with these lights.  They are fairly compact so not suitable by themselves as taillights, I used them for rear corner lights on my trailer , for that purpose they are great.  I'm deducting one star because 1) the silicone around the wires had visible defects, I added a little silicone to ensure they are sealed 2) there isn't enough difference between low and high, they appear to simply alter voltage to create low and high whereas other taillights alter voltage and illuminate additional LEDs .  Wiring is as follows red = stop/turn (bright), blue = running (dim), black = ground.
B00AYZB6Z4|5|First off, price and quality is amazing. No leaking, no condensation inside, all LEDs worked and they're very bright.
B007EXPBKA|4|Lot of uses. Sticks well
B008L423BQ|4|Great product.
B00TMLYMG6|5|They are so tiny that it will SHOCK you.  But my computer nerd swears by it.
B00I3RL1A0|5|Works on all of my BMW's
B00G66KNZY|5|This helmet is great. It fits well, there is much less wind noise since it is more aerodynamic and it also looks very cool. I haven't crashed and had to test its' protective capabilities and hope I never have occasion to do so.
B000630290|5|K&N is awesome, good fit for my 2004 E46 M3, thanks!
B010GW354Y|4|Love the look, durable. Both of mine folded during application. I've used a lot of these type and it hasn't happened before. It happened on both of these..
B0049MTHTA|5|EZ - Power great traveling companion for my Navigator and boat trips .... saves room.....  Great product seems very well made.
B00AECG828|3|I purchased this item to go along with Pro Series 63153 Rambler Hitch Cargo Carrier.  The net itself is fine.  The hooks are made of plastic and break easily.  After a use or two you will need to add in some bungee cords to make up for the broken hooks.  I'd buy it again because the net part does what I need but I wish they'd used rubber covered steel hooks like bungee cords do and just charged me a few bucks extra.
B00BYNWWWG|5|Nice and sturdy and welded better than the aftermarket Ines I have bought in the past.
B0105J19EG|5|Great  quality  patch that I  would  recommend  to all veteran  riders.
B000E28EK2|5|Installed on a 99 Jeep Cherokee. Great hitch. Just don't use the included form of mounting it. Buy nut strips and do it right.
B00M78820I|4|Great product and fits my 2015 Nissan Frontier almost perfectly.  I am happy with this product.  Took a little time to get the fold down to get it back into its storage size but once I figured that out it was simple.
B007ZXXQQK|5|Must have tool for stretch belts.
B004SSAF82|4|The cover fits my 2010 Honda C-RV perfectly.  I cut out a small hole for the roof antenna ( near the rear )  and that also helps when I put the cover on.  If you are covering a tall suv the cover slides off easily and  is a bear to handle by one person. The cover is really big unfolded and tends to be awkward for one person to handle. Its like a huge shower cap. I found that by putting it on from the rear first and slotting the antenna thru the hole it stays put until i can work it to the front using the mirrors next to hold it in place until I finally tug it to the front. It leaks water which Is ok by me I only want to protect the finish from tree sap and bird poop.  Its a good bang for the buck for my purposes so far.
B0049Z6JFM|2|The side seals weren't the correct size for my 97 Lesabre. Had to send it back.
B008T4YOV0|4|Seems to run a bit small (front to back), but a good quality product for the money.
B009OQ3K4E|5|Great for subtly sticking it to the PC crowd.
B0002JN2EU|5|Great stuff at a good price..
B002J858HQ|5|Smells like real leather, just as advertised. Kindof makes your car smell like a leather factory, or a new leathery car.
B00122EENE|5|Easy installation. Fits perfectly. Engine light is finally off. Will purchase again. Thank you.
B008BW2KJI|5|added my own RGB 5050 LEDS and works flawlessly,  leds were like 12 bucks for 16 feet! some soldering and a weekend and you have your self a custom motorcycle set up!  customer service will say it wont support the length of leds... have yet to notice a difference...
B00BN46SYY|5|Well Made and very nice.....
B007Z8VG30|4|Thought it may have been bigger. But still looks good
B01012DDYQ|5|These are the best all-weather floor mats you can get, hands down.  The manufacturer weather  mats are not even close!  They're worth the extra money to have.  I had these in my Nissan Altima, and now in my Nissan Murano.  Easy to clean and look great.
B00QYBJPGY|5|Outstanding product. Very well made.
B004QQCEO4|5|right tool for old R12 cars
B00CA5GOOE|5|I think this looks great on my car. Much better than the original, and also much better than the VG Shark fin, which looked like a big turd on top of my car. I have noticed a very slight decrease in reception when I am in low reception areas, but it works great in the city. It does say Stubby in gold at the bottom. I sanded this off.
B00LG07MZE|5|Just what I needed! good product at a great price!
B007J6KB6Q|1|Wrong item. It dose not fit 2001 BMW 325i.. Bulbs are too big. False advertisement.. Very disappointed.
B007N6S91Q|5|Great product and craftsmanship. Made in the USA. The kit comes with everything in the picture. I am sure this will last as long as the originals ones did if not longer.
B00CHXBR32|5|Exactly as advertised. Arrived promptly.  Just what i needed.  Very satisfied.
B003LNJWTI|5|Great product
B00D7HN0LE|5|Very easy installation, worth it's weight in gold! A must have for 2010-2012 Camaros if you are required to drive at night in poor lighting and road conditions. I have LED DRL bulbs and HIDS, with both of them on at night it is a world of difference!
B001GJ3FIS|4|Good quality for the money.  I'm generally skeptical of plastic nozzles because the handles usually break off so easily, but this one appears to be built better than most.
B001KR1BQE|5|On time and good price!!!!
B005KOZ25Y|4|Works as designed.
B008L4SXI8|5|Very nice looking
B00004Y61Z|5|Great Thank you.
B001NZKDIA|5|not the problem
B005FN58U4|5|Prior to buy this, I had used and enjoyed [[ASIN:B003UT3S6Q Sonax (230200-755) Wheel Cleaner Full Effect - 16.9 fl. oz.]] and it works great, don't get me wrong... but at nearly $1 / ounce, it's a bit expensive.  The smell also isn't the best and not something I want to breath in.  I did a ton of research and was about to buy AMMO NYC Plum Wheel cleaner but the cost for shipping was insane.  In doing research many people on Reddit and other forums seem to agree that AMMY NYC Plum is just rebranded Griots based on the smell and reaction.  On that, I ordered a gallon and it came in yesterday.<br /><br />The smell has NOTHING to do with how this stuff works, but I really enjoy it, so that's always a bonus.  I purchased a [[ASIN:B00DLJ0A0C Rubbermaid Professional Plus Heavy-Duty Spray Bottle]] from my local Wally-World because it was $2 cheaper, and it's a great spray bottle for this.  To wash the 4, 19&#34; wheels on my Audi S4 I used about 5oz total, according to the hash marks on the side.  I also use a bit more than the average person to clean the barrels and what not, so I'd imagine at the rate of use to get about 30 full washed of all 4 wheels per gallon jug, that's amazing to me!<br /><br />Most wheel cleaners have a very vague description on the back about use.  This is very specific.  There's also much debate about hosing your wheels down with water first then applying cleaner, or just applying it straight on a dry wheel.  Most will tell you spraying down with water first will dilute the cleaner, but Griots actually says to do this, to help losen and remove any surface dust and dirt.  I did this first, then sprayed the wheels down, one at a time.  The bottle also suggests 3-5 minutes of time, Sonax is 30-60 seconds.  I didn't time this exactly but I know it wasn't a full 5 minutes.<br /><br />As the solution dissolves the heavy iron materials it turns a reddish / purple color, a really nice touch.  A little agitation with a few wheel brushes and sponges I use and the wheels came clean very quickly.  A proper rinse and then dried with towels and I'm very happy with the results.<br /><br />In the photo, the clean wheel appears much brighter, but the time I got done washing the whole car and drying and back around for a &#34;clean&#34; photo the sun shifted, sorry about that!  The wheels are factory silver.nd the wheels came clean very quickly.

B008XDKQSW|5|Fits my 09 Turbo Great!
B0000AXQPA|4|Bought to replace problematic one installed on my boat.  Fits the same cutout but mounting holes different. A little hard to get the face plate on/off.
B0032J1KAK|5|These mirrors really make your rear field of vision larger!  They help to make driving safer.  Great Product!
B007H8DIG6|4|I had a terrible time attempting to place the locking wires into the gray plug. Ended up calling the vendor and they sent me the wire which was already connected to the gray plug! Worked fine. Played the the original and bent the small locking piece upwards more and it worked<br />perfectly. As they were only $20 I purchased an extra on to be sure I had one on hand if needed. When the spare arrived it already<br />had the wires connected! Go figure. I am guessing I was not the only customer that had problems attaching the wires to the plug!<br /><br />Vendors tech support was fantastic with answers within a couple of hours after notifying them about my problem.
B0048J4PKK|5|The lights/radio wouldn't turn on/off anymore when opening the drivers side door. Bought this unit to replace the existing bad unit.<br />Installation took a bit of time, it is really tight inside the door cavity. However, take your time and it will be well worth it.<br /><br />Of note, my truck (06 Silverado) has an extra white piece on the original unit that I had to pry off and superglue on the new unit.
B004GEA45C|5|Fit the same as OE for my Camry
B00CPE694U|5|This system met all expectations and works flawlessly. While driving at 45 mph, other drivers can hear the pa system inside their own vehicles
B000GVOQDK|5|Good kit.  Haven't installed it yet but it should do well.
B000WEMJRQ|5|A necessary accessory that allows you to use the cargo spot for all sorts of things without trashing your carpet liners. A nearly perfect fit as well.
B0002UNON8|1|Briefly covered scratches until car was washed...
B00912K9L8|5|Excellent
B004OK86SU|5|God sturdy product.
B0070Y34M0|3|Should have been darker and not easy to cut
B00CDUU8D4|5|I have a 2013 Ranger XP 900 (Orange Madness).  I would not say install is a breeze, but this is expected for me.  These types of products should come installed on the factory.  If you take your tires off, the install will be easier.  I did not remove the tires, so it can be installed without removing them.  These pieces are heavy (good), so it will help having someone give you a hand.  After they are installed, it will be a little bit tighter when you have to grease those fittings around your control arms...but I was able too...just make sure you have a flexible hose.
B004DDHXCI|4|Works just fine.
B0101U6OVW|5|It's on my truck now....quality perfect!<br />Ideal size...brilliant colors.
B000B5ZM6Q|4|Covers provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays of sun. They do need some way to secure covers in high winds.
B00HSO37B0|4|works as advertised
B007TJXHZA|5|Correct part, fast shipping.
B00CC2ZU4K|1|Horrible product, the ballast came defaulted. Returned this for the Kensum HID.
B000IYWWKE|5|Quick shipping, better and beefier than toyotas, great product
B00GZ05BCG|5|Absolutely fantastic.  Perfect color for the Chevrolet Cocoa/Dune interior. Keeps all my stuff under the rear bench secure.  Well anchored and sturdy.  I love it.
B006DA34M2|5|As advertised. Good price and shipment.
B001EP0HVM|4|product as described.. have been using Curt hitches for years.. bought this because my new truck is higher than the old one.. great drop hitch..
B00QD27F7K|5|It is working like charm.
B00IUP63A8|5|Awesome additive for a daily driver or a vehicle that is garaged most of the time.  Have been using these products for years and they do not disappoint
B003ZWG0UY|5|Excellent
B002J7VX4Y|5|Excellent product
B005CLML68|5|As described and worked
B00YV4E26Y|1|Very unhappy.  First time and only time I used it it fell apart.  The back end of push drill fell off.  It slipped and did not go into the drywall as if it didn't catch properly.  Am very disappointed and would like to return it.  Please send instructions.
B00J2VULQ6|5|Small enough that I don't have to throw away huge quantities of expensive material.
B00OOCP38O|5|They look and work awesome
B000ALG08K|5|Replacement high quality, fast shipping, recommend
B00JNVD79I|5|item as described! thanks
B004MDXVWK|5|Perfect! Tight area to mount Garmin 741XS. This was the soluton. Solid and simple
B00Z7KIZPA|2|If your purse is tiny, it's perfect. If you have a normal sized 2015 purse that holds phone, ipad, glasses case, wallet etc - it's very small. The photo looks like a nice sized tote bag style purse, but in reality anything bigger than you would drive with on your lap won't fit. And... if the webbed netting were stretchy - it would have worked; however the webbed netting is rigid - no elastic give - so back it went to Amazon's warehouse. Great idea. Poor Execution.
B00WJPGSD2|5|Great product, these are extremely well made, they must weight 10 lbs each, you can feel and see the quality. They are just like the ARB lights that are 6 times more expensive, in fact they manufacture them for ARB apparently. Save yourself the mark-up, and grab a set of these for your Jeep or offroad vehicle, you won't be sorry. The case functions as a heatsink and is powdercoated metal. They are EXTREMELY bright and easy to install also. They come included with about a foot cord, just enough to run behind your grille and convert over to different wire. These things will light up your path and a mile ahead!
B00HSNXYFK|2|The &#34;foil&#34; is so thin that it cuts easily...be careful during installation, and do not use where it may be touched.
B00C3075P8|4|It fit my 07 dyna super glide custom with little modification but shipping was delayed overall I think they are just as good as the kuryakin grips
B00O996TUI|5|Awesome
B00080QHMM|5|I bought this because my 99 cent tire pressure gauge did not go high enough to test the pressure in my Silverado. This works well for that purpose, I have also tested it against the tire pressure monitor reader in my car and with other gauges and it always gives me consistent and accurate readings. (+ it goes high enough to chest the tire pressure in bigger tires such as my Silverado). I had mine for three years and recently bought this one for my father for Christmas.
B00FALVU8A|5|The wax looks great on my car
B00OLVGGZM|5|Love my new mat. Had one in my other truck and got spoiled by it.
B000NOO798|5|Works.
B00D3YEGO6|5|This license plate frame now graces my wife's car. Construction and material quality is top-notch. The crystals sparkle nicely. There are some embedded finger prints from whoever glued on the crystals, but nothing you would notice from more than a few feet away. It was easy to install and replaced and old frame provided by the dealer. This one is much nicer, if a bit flashier. I like the Anti-theft caps both for safety and for how nicely they compliment the frame. This is a gaudy yet classy license plate frame, another win from The Friendly Swede!<br /><br />Tastes will vary when it comes to if this is for you or not, but the product itself is top-notch and it comes in a nice gift box. I received complimentary unit for objective review purposes.<br /><br />~ Kort
B006UY7I50|5|Excellent
B00ZV0X46G|5|Easy to apply and no-adhesive.
B00GOYN3Y6|5|Works just as expected; no problems.
B004SFRW68|5|very heavy duty. I used hydraulic crimpers to fasten them to 4 gauge wire
B00QJ3QGZA|5|very nicely made,, would buy it again
B00SOAVLO2|5|Switch worked great, I used it to be main power supply to trailer led lights so I mounted to fuse box panel in between the hot running to the battery.  I use this to power up the fuse box and then to a bank of switches running each LED in my trailer.  One flip closed and entire assembly shuts off.  Worked exactly how I wanted it to was easy to install and get running.
B00IEYDGZU|5|great looking product, shipped really quick , just what I ordered and at a great price, I will be a customer from now on
B0073G1TN6|5|Excellent product and simple to install.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|This item is not worth buying.  I have a VW Tiguan and there is nowhere near enough space between the two front seats to put anything of<br />size in the pouch.  The pouch is small, and my purse (which is not big) would not fit it in anyway.  I have left it in the car, but have only<br />put a (small) box of tissues in it.  Useless.  And I think it could eventually hurt your arm by reaching back at that angle to use the pouch.
B00TF3IXRA|3|its a bit too dim compare to 55w hid / other brand 60W LED
B00684TAYY|5|I have purchased replacement housings, not through Amazon, before. Those were made of inferior material and pieces started breaking of in short time. This one is the same material as the original which lasted over ten years.
B008ECC31U|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2007 Corolla CE. It took about 30 seconds to install.
B00802GIW4|5|Looks great and not problems with performance so far. Super easy installation on my 2008 Camry. Check that your bulbs come directly out of your headlight assembly or you are going to have to drill it out to make the wires fit. The 8000k is nice and bright and I did not have to adjust the levels. Well worth the $40 which is the price for a pair of nice halogens anyway
B004RCP6HE|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Rolls up easily aswell. Good price for what you get. I wanted one with the Audi insignia on it and this is their OEM one which is sold at dealerships.
B00IGJECR4|5|Bought these for my daughters first car. She absolutely loves them! They look great!
B00QBVFBGU|1|Dont buy this product ! Is not what's it described! Is more cheap that it looks on the blurry photo!
B000E7WLJW|5|Just recently went on vacation and drove 650 miles one way and drove through rain on way home, all of our belongings were dry and there is so much room in the bag to fit everything.  The straps that it comes with worked great to keep the bag from moving. Highly recommend this bag for traveling.
B000H2W270|4|Ok
B000X3EWBM|5|Seems to be holding up well on my SUV.
B00IKUGNTO|5|This sled holds the iPad in place better than I was expecting even over bumpy off-road trails.
B00A9T28S4|5|This wax really made my headlights look brand new!!!!!!! This stuff really works!!!!!!!!
B00XV4ZVA6|5|I was more than a bit surprised at the high quality of this jacket because it was selling for just $89.95 (at the time of this review)– my first impression that this was certainly a $150 to maybe almost $200 jacket.<br /><br />QUALITY-LUXURIOUS FEEL<br /><br />It’s an incredibly nice jacket that feels not only durable, but envelops you with a warm -- and I will even say -- “luxurious” -- feeling.  I mean, you get the immediate impression you are putting on a solid, well-put-together item that will not only keep you warm, but protected.<br /><br />I am just over 6-feet tall, and I have a slender build, I weigh just 155-to-160. This jacket in the X-Large size was almost a perfect fit for me – close the body, yet loose enough to allow excellent free movement of my arms.<br /><br />There are ways to adjust the tightness (or looseness) of the fit – thus you can “custom fit” this jacket to your body type. Amazing!<br /><br />PROTECTIVE PADDING<br /><br />The shoulders are padded with protective material – this would come in handy if you went for a spill of your bike – but also provides a feeling of warmth and comfort around the shoulders.<br /><br />The elbows are also padded on the inside and reinforced on the outside with tough fabric – but it is also very flexible and easy to bend your elbows.<br />Also has a removable spinal padding that will protect the ol’ backbone.<br /><br />In fact, all the padding in this coat is removable if you want a lighter feel!<br /><br />POCKETS GALORE – MORE THAN A DOZEN<br /><br />There are a lot of pockets, including on the inside flaps where a pocket is designed perfectly for a smartphone, and another four your sunglasses, and yet another small zippered pocket to boot In fact, this jacket has pockets everywhere – two on each outside breast, two hand/glove pockets, zippered pockets on the back – suffice it to say, you’ll have at least a dozens places to stash stuff in every quadrant of this jacket.<br /><br />Most of the pockets are zippered with heavy-gauge, high quality zippers that have smooth action.<br /><br />REFLECTIVE STRIPES<br /><br />Reflective stripes are positioned on the top of each shoulder and on the lower arms. This is an excellent safety feature that provides heightened visibility – and helps other drivers see motorcycles better. Much needed.<br /><br />COLD OR NOT SO COLD WEAR<br /><br />The interior lining of the jacket comes out by unzipping the inside. This means you can wear this jacket in colder temps, or use it for warmer days, such as a very sturdy windbreaker.<br /><br />VELCRO STRAPS<br /><br />There are Velcro straps around both wrists so you can snug this up around your wrists, and also a Velcro strap at the neck.<br /><br />EXTRA CUT TO COVER THE LOWER BACK<br /><br />The jacket is cut in such a way that you get a litte extra covering for your lower back – thus, when you are leaning forward on a motorcycle, you won’t get that irritating wind that sometimes swirls just above your butt. When you are standing up, this lower flap extends just a tad over your bottom (at least it does for m – again, I am 6-feet-1/2 inches tall).<br /><br />FLASHY LOGOS AND LOOK<br /><br />Finally, the jacket has patches that display the “Viking” brand logo—these are heavy-duty, raised patches – one just below the neck on the back, and another on the left arm. Another white-stitched “Viking” logo is on the bottom back of the jacket.<br /><br />CONCLUSION – AN AMAZING JACKET FOR AN AMAZING PRICE<br /><br />Yes, I did receive this jacket free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review – but I say without reservation and with true enthusiasm that this is an absolutely fantastic deal, and especially for just 90 bucks!<br /><br />This is a first-rate, very high quality, attractive jacket that has a design I will call not only “well-thought-out” but downright brilliant!<br />Most of the pockets are zippered with heavy-gauge, high quality zippers that have smooth action.<br /><br />REFLECTIVE STRIPES<br /><br />Reflective stripes are positioned on the top of each shoulder and on the lower arms.

B005PU4IMQ|5|Fit perfectly. Very easy to install.
B009OZA304|5|SO AWESOME ,  CANT BELIEVE
B000GTZZCS|5|Part was delivered quickly and was as advertised
B0041QC9B2|5|Used this adapter with my oil cooler I installed. Worked perfect and great chrome too
B01012DFUS|5|These are the best all-weather floor mats you can get, hands down. The manufacturer weather mats are not even close! They're worth the extra money to have. I had these in my Nissan Altima, and now in my Nissan Murano. Easy to clean and look great.
B00D3QQUGG|5|These really help with impatient drivers when I'm teaching my son. At least now they know why the driving is a little off
B00OUZM9PK|5|very good
B00FG2A6Q0|5|It has been 6+ months since I ordered these light fixture. It took me 30 mins as a rookie to replace it. It was a perfect fit. You will save tons of $$$$ by not going to to a dealership. The glass is still clear. It has not shown any signs of fading. Very nice product.
B00NLX6WXC|4|Good protective case but it doesn't fit my Golf R key.
B008G359LS|5|Perfect. Plug and play for my silver 2004 4Runner 4WD 4.7L V8 Limited.  No hiccups on installation.  Fit snug and perfect.  Wire harness was longer than the original, so I had plenty to work with, and came with the correct plastic connectors.  Power up, down, left, and right work with no deficiencies... We will see about the defroster come winter.  Toyota dealership here wanted $315 for one.  Got both here for less than $80.00.  All you need is a philips and flathead screwdriver.
B004EIAADG|1|We got this unit so I would have power at vendor events and camping.  We charged for 72 hours as instructed, then began trying it out.  The air compressor was good enough to fill our trailer tires to 65 psi, but shut off every couple of minutes, and had to wait up to 10 minutes for it to reset.  So, it would work in an emergency, but not good enough for regular use.<br />Second time we used it, we used it to keep our mobile devices charged while camping.  It only worked if you used the usb or 12v outlets.  Using the regular plugs caused it to shut down and sound a loud, high-pitched beep that didn't stop until you shut off and reset the whole unit.  It also beeped if we tried using more than one outlet at a time.<br />The third time I used it was at a vendor event, where I needed to use a 200 watt device to  preform demonstrations.  After about an hour (battery power showed 84%) it began to shut down and sound the loud beeping every time I tried to use it.<br />After the event, we tried using different outlets and devices to see what made it beep.  We discovered at this time that the 12v outlets no longer work at all!<br />We called customer service, and the gentleman politely told us that we shouldn't have been using the regular plug outlets.  What?  Why are they even there?<br />Attempted to return through Amazon, but they won't do it.  The company offered to replace it, but since 30 days have passed (barely) they will not cover shipping.  It's almost as much for shipping as it would be to buy a new one.<br />So, if you're in the market for a really expensive and heavy bicycle pump, or door stop, or night light, this is perfect for you!  If you want it to do something useful, like provide power, then I suggest moving on to something better.
B00AO9L18M|4|Good price, fast shipping, exceeded expectations.
B00ISLA1WA|4|Worked great.  Used it on the back of our trailer for a Cargo Hauler.
B0049J91H6|4|Really nice muffler, no big problems.  It didnt seem to be an exact fit.  I could get it on, but the hangers seemed to be a little far out, which is causing a bit more stretch on the rubber.  Overall great buy.  Almost 5 stars.
B005ZZH7U6|5|Have only installed one as it is a great match for the factory item. only very small issue I had to ream out one of the hole to make the mounting clips line-up.
B002ZKGY2Q|4|Good value for the money but it is no quiter than the original . easy install. And quality connector and rubber dampeners..  Update. I went back and took out the compressor assembly. I noticed that the air inlet fitting was hitting the OEM frame. I cut away a small amount of the frame so the air Inlett cleared the mount and reassembled.  It was so quite that I could not hear it run.
B0002YP7SO|5|Love it. So easy to use.
B00DZW28KA|5|Awesome purchase! Very nice color, i love the fact that we dont have to sleep on the floor! Lets the breeze in very nicely!
B0002Q80GS|5|bought this on April 24, 2015 received a few day later and has worked fine since.
B0081S9EKK|5|Great deal
B008E7TY7G|5|Worked fine. No issues or grinding.
B004MSMAPY|2|It's okay. It shouldn't be $100. It really doesn't have a low enough torque range, and the click mechanism is very soft below 40 inch pounds. The plastic pieces are cheap. If only the Excel torque wrench came with all of the necessary sizes, it's much better build quality.
B00BLTCFRA|3|Too small
B000B8LKZK|5|Fast shipping exactly what i was looking for.
B00R26B9PU|5|Very bright and, so far, highly reliable.
B001LTZ2X4|5|great OEM fit bolted right up, came with better than OEM gasket, no Issues great half<br />the price of the auto parts stores.I guess time will tell the rest
B00T0WPV3A|4|Fits just right for me.
B00877SL2M|5|Very bright!!!! Works very well!
B0015H8OW8|5|Great customer service I too had the same problem because it didn't say type s only on the description but they were helpful and I was definitely satisfied.
B00ACUELEY|5|replaced my air filter perfectly.
B003LIRMDG|5|Look good
B001R5D66M|5|WOULD BUY AGAIN
B0024E6UE0|5|Fit perfectly on my 2015 Casita 17' Spirit Deluxe vents.
B003Z4DA2I|3|These glasses are really cool looking but are most def not by any means high quality. Fit me good and comfy. Shatter proof lense. Good for yard work and such
B0007VANJK|5|Perfect fit.  Easy install
B000CB7D3Y|5|Fits perfectly in 2004 Disco II. Great quality.
B00J6AB42I|5|Used product on aluminum boat hull. Very flexible. May not be what I should have used for abrasion resistance on boat bottom. Seems to peel back to easily when running over rocky river bottom as in comparison to other paints. Very slick finish.
B004KAU7DQ|1|Terrible....even brand new, the bottle neck leaks around the seal......<br />  spray nozzle works good, but can still spray even when twisted closed!<br />  Not a good product to use for chemicals other than water.
B004BTEODK|5|Superb quality and did exactly what we wanted it to do.  My daughter repaired all the little scratches and nick marks on her 2005 Corolla.  She spent a couple hours but the results were fantastic.  All repairs were not visible to the eye.  This paint matched perfectly and there is plenty of it to last a while.  After all her hard work she parks farthest out in parking lot to prevent new dings/scratches.  Give it a try, you'll be happy with results.
B000MDY89O|5|Good product.
B005JC5BIA|5|Nice thick hook
B00D9EP5UY|4|Very good Product!
B00ONH8TZO|5|Perfect fit and finish. Glad I got it
B000GVECCA|5|Very good chain, had to be cut, not a huge deal, but the lube on gets on everything and doesn't wanna come off. Master link was a little tough against the o-rings. Overall, very high quality and works great on my Honda 350X.
B0012GTVVA|4|Works as expected
B0068QC5EY|5|Does its job
B00DSD7J8W|5|Real nice print quality and size is great too.
B00PYNOVGW|5|Awsome
B006X8BR8C|4|close fit... could be a bit closer on the top grill dimension but an overall eazy install and looks great. will have to wait and see how the finish stands up to the elements.
B002RCGVDO|4|I used these a couple of times when I replaced all the brake lines in my 98 Ford Windstar van. I replaced 7 lines exactly as they were from the factory. I used these to &#34;tweak&#34; some lines to allow the fittings to screw in. I didn't use them much but I was glad I had them when I needed them.<br />I mostly used [[ASIN:B003LT3UOU Brake Line Rolling Tubing Bender 3/16&#34; and 1/4&#34;]] for doing all my bends. It would have been a real pain to have used only the pliers. The grips are hard and not very comfortable. Again, I would get both tools like I did if I were to do it again.
B0124IWADA|5|Ordered the DV8 Bumper on a Thur. night and received it on Monday. Installed it Monday night in less than hour. Excellent bumper, I would defiantly recommend this bumper. No rattles and fit perfectly.
B005JU5XYE|5|These blades are amazing.  First, I live in AZ and the summers can go to 115 degrees F or more... I purchased these blades about 4 years ago for my vette and today they finally started to show streaking.  Granted, it doesn't rain much here in the desert, but the heat and sun can damage the rubber which is what I was concerned with.  I didn't want to only use my wipers 3 times a year only to have to replace them annually due to sun damage.  Not these though, they lasted incredibly long and I'm amazed and impressed by their quality.  I would highly recommend these.  Oh, and one last thing, installation, I replaced the OEM blades with these Bosch ones and one of the wipers on my car doesn't lift all the way off the glass such as a 90 degree angle like other cars I've had (designed that way) therefore removing the original OEM blades took a very long time.  Maybe 15 minutes because of the angle and such to wiggle them free, i was rather frustrated.  Installing the Bosch ones however only took about 30 seconds for each blade, the way they designed these installation wise is far superior than cheaper/OEM ones that came with my car.
B007MX5FYY|5|Looks and fits great
B005DJ9860|5|Very nice stitcher, nice weight and easy to use on patches.  Ball bearing makes it roll perfectly.
B000CO86BY|4|The pin that holds the jack stand fell out on one of them after like the third use.
B00HV0SEVO|1|I bought this for my 2014 honda civic, but there is a warning on the bottom that says the materials used are known to cause cancer and reproductive harm. If I would have known this I never would have bought it. DO NOT BUY THIS IT CAN CAUSE CANCER. It literally says it at the bottom.
B002OL7ZB0|5|The keychain is very cute and whimsical. It's for my personal use but would make a great gift for any Jack Russell lover.
B000IY8ODS|5|Nice increase in power. Great looking too.
B000H0QS54|1|You only get a single overpriced protector, which is idiotic since the lamps come in pairs, and the product description is misleadingly ambiguous about it. I ordered mine a long time ago and only just now tried putting it on. It broke during the attempt. Some shield. Glad I waited before ordering a second shield.
B00PBHOGQG|5|Great communication from the seller, they got me the bolts I needed to mount it to my bike. Gives a great custom look to my road King and matches the spike look I'm going for. Great price too. Visibility isn't too bad either.
B00QB2OCB4|2|Light is bright enough but the bottle opener really doesn't work.  Have to use it 2-4 times to open up one bottle.
B000MPQMCS|5|Did the job nicely ..
B000GZVHH4|4|It looks good! Works great. However I can't figure out how to wire in the turn signal indicator light. When I signal right or left both sides light up, I'm assuming that power is jumping across the indicator on the speedometer to the opposite side.
B00073W9KO|4|Looks good and was fairly Easy to install. The directions weren't very detailed and the pictures they gave were horrible. Fits perfectly on my Ram 1500 quad cab though.
B000KYX5MG|4|kinda stops working from time to time but nothing serious. and was 50 dollars cheaper that in the store
B00GO8RRAI|4|I did not want to drill any holes into my baby, and this was just the ticket.  Easy installation.
B004LFCFVC|5|They work great easy to use and a lot cheaper than a hydrolic leveling system.
B001IZKDZS|5|Fit just right very happy
B00OBW8XAC|5|I love this product. It really reflects the heat that you can feel.  I wasn't looking for a product that was so much like window tinting and making it so dark you can't even see outside but, rather for keeping the summer sun and heat out.  Product also says it help keep it warm inside.  I'll write another review if it truly does all that it claims here in Colorado.  So far so good.
B00B0TMYLS|5|Nice helmet I recommend it
B00FELSNCC|3|It is okay.  Was very frustrated when I got it due to the size I was expecting.  There should be a length and width measurement.  Seems deceptive.  Cannot finds a bigger one, so I kept these.
B000C9S4RU|5|Awesome fit.  Would recommend to buy
B0009JKI86|1|I had bought these around Christmas time, thinking they would work wonderfully. they came quick went on great but did not work at all. Smudges still left on my window just overall disappointed,  Rain X is usually great but this certain item  just not a great.
B0009OMYA6|5|Works well when the location is such you can't get a wrench on the sensor.
B00HVHGD56|3|worked good but broke very soon.
B00XAX4B9A|3|Didn't fit my Prius C 2015 as snug as I'd like which I was surprised by
B00CYSKNF8|5|good!!
B00A2YH1VK|4|I have a 2008 Honda Civic and it works very well. You have to make sure the seat is set so that it is not behind the door but right next to the door opening. While my car was being fixed, I had a rental car that was a late model Chevy. It did not work well on that type of seat as getting in and out of the car was kind of like getting in and out of a hole.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B00T6KYQX2|5|It is what it is. Good look.
B00877SL2M|5|I installed these in the rear lights that turn on with the headlights on a Kubota BX tractor.  They look brighter than the lights they replaced.
B00KTHZZ3Q|5|Worked great. Great price. Arrived fast.
B00KQ4ZMX0|5|These TPMS for the Fords are just awesome. My car is getting up around 100k miles and these are starting to fail. So I keep a couple on hand. They typically are $20. Much better price then at dealers $80. I take them to a tire dealer, they install them and reset the reader.
B004ME11FS|4|Worked perfect
B00OVB7LGA|3|I have a Mazda 3 and I expected this mat to be a closer fit to my vehicle, but it is gigantic and required a lot of trimming.  I wanted to return it but they manufacturer says they do not take returns for size issues.  I asked to return it and while Amazon authorized it I was never contacted by the seller about this.  Not very customer oriented.
B0146K3MYA|5|My Husband Love this so much and when i showed him this and we bought it. he said it's totally very good. and he said he can recommend this to his friends :)
B009DK1FXE|5|Items were delivered promptly and were as described/promised.  Thanks!
B005BNXQ8Y|4|Parts came quickly and as advertised.  Installed with any issues.  A good shopping experience (5 star means &#34;You Love It&#34; according to Amazon...really?)
B004I0FCWO|5|As expected.
B001VJS2FE|5|Works Great
B001DAHM16|5|This was an exact replacement for my 97 F150 4.2 V6. It was easy to installed with no variations from original coil pack. This was installed 8/26/15 the same day I received it so I will update this review if it fails to perform or fails completely. So far I am very happy with my purchase. This repaired my problem I had at stumbling or a hesitant when I started from take off.
B00M78820I|5|As advertised.... great product and does a great job of blocking out the sun in my 2013 Tacoma.  Very easy and quick to fold and stuff underneath my seat.  I love it and would buy another one if i needed to.  No question.
B0056OFWVM|4|They work quite well once you get the hang of it.
B0000VM18I|5|The is the best for killing bees and wasp.
B00VS8CGTG|5|Perfect fit! Fast shipping.
B001Q8IXW2|4|These make application easy but the only downside is the size and shape of it. I used daddy vans wax and the containers for it that I got are small and I feel like I would need to cut these in half but they still worked fine
B00HZXC4UE|5|Very nice look great on pur jeep
B000EQPNCA|5|The product works as expected to allow intermediate speeds in a right hand drive 2003 Sorento. It replaces a part that has a completely different looking metal section but the plastic and connection is the same. I have a picture of the old and new side by side.The holes lined up exactly to the old one. I changed it myself.
B00KMYYQ36|5|Really restored the waterproofing to my outdoor furniture cushions!
B00FQ0ROZS|4|The lights provide great illumination on the road and off road, the reason for 4 stars is the power line coming out of the side of the light housing is in tight proximity to where the mounting bolts affix to the bracket. In close quarters this could present a problem and may affect your ability to adjust it. I haven't on the lights for a very long time, so I can't attest to their longevity, but so far they are holding up well. Michigan winters will certainly put them to the test.
B001VDXMDW|3|Not what I expected I look like a dome head
B000C7QIAW|5|Worked like a champ, came damaged from the shipping, no leaks yet.
B0002KO29I|5|nice
B002KO7G38|5|Love it!
B00F11JID8|5|Works great and is brighter then factory installed light in  Motorhome.
B000IYSHY4|5|Nice replacement mirror.
B005KYOEGW|4|lasted a long time on my chrysler crossfire, didn't burn into oem assembly (these kits are known for getting super hot and doing that)
B00EOX2QJC|5|Product as described.
B00FZMGMDW|4|should come with both gaskets, otherwise perfect.
B003CXBVQE|4|Great value for the money.
B00GHT6SF4|5|fits perfect on my 2004 Avalanche.
B000CSD29Q|5|received quickly. Great product!
B00820NOWG|1|well made butt dose not fit
B002X6VXL4|5|Love it, use it 4 times already great product at a great price when on deal of the day.  :-)
B001GMHEAU|4|The Nerf bars were awesome, however the bolts that were sent to attach the nerf bars to the truck were not to specifications.  They wouldn’t fit and if I would’ve tried to put them in would have stripped out the bolt holes.
B007TYQUZO|5|Perfect for my toyota sienna 1999 left and right sliding doors
B002E1AYYU|2|The catch on the handle is made of 4 pieces of steel instead of a solid piece, weakest link by far
B003VZLJFG|5|Works wonders on some cars. Doesn't do a thing to others, give it a try before letting a dealership charge you $169 to fit one headlight.
B000BQYH6Q|5|light weight and sturdy construction.
B000C53S02|1|Shocks are easy to install, do not pay some garage for something that you can easily do, takes less than 30 minutes. You will need a jack to lift the frame to bolt them in place. Shocks added one half inch to height of truck, but my truck has the heavy duty tow rear end. It will raise your truck higher if your truck has the regular rear end. Shocks improved the ride when pulling a travel trailer and even when not pulling the trailer. It firms up the ride without making it stiff or jarring. Very pleased with this purchase.  Update on shocks after about 18 months of ownership.  Shocks (lifetime warranty) failed after about 1 year of use. I was not pulling my trailer at the time of failure and had not for 4-5 months before the failure. I heard a loud clank noise that sounded like I had run over a piece of metal on the road and had bounced up under the truck. I looked for damage, but could not find any damage to truck or shocks. I discovered the shock failure after hooking up to the trailer and the truck rear end dropped down low to the ground and had no bounce to it.   Contacted Monroe about the failure and Monroe said to contact the seller for all internet purchases. Amazon makes it difficult to return products 18 months after the sale, not able to find a way to do it. I purchased Monroe Gas Magnum shocks from local auto parts store and installed them, (found fluid leaking from the 58636 shocks) because I can not wait for Amazon's poor/no return on warranty products.  Do not buy automotive products from Amazon, buy from your local auto parts store and save the hassle of dealing with Amazon.
B00PQZPMYI|4|Quality is fine, I couldn't manage proper installation in my murano though, needed access that I couldn't get
B00JMOZDJI|4|Looks great, but It doesn't have slots on the bottom that would hold the plate. Had to use double sided tape to attach it to the bottom of the plate.
B001AZEMI0|4|A little smaller than expected, but not bad.
B003LZ4IK4|4|it works
B000GTWV3O|5|Very good product. Makes my motorcycle look sharp!
B0068NDBUE|5|OEM seal lubricant for the VW EOS hard top rubbers, works as promised. One bottle is enough for 3-4 times of usage.
B001ODB0ZG|5|Great!!!
B005HR3ULC|5|They look great
B000FW61SI|3|Not bad for money, but clips are made for a thicker visor that mine so without a shim under it, it falls off when visor is lowered.  Unlike many others though when lowered it does a good job of not leaving a gap between it and the visor for the sun to shine through.
B002OPLAY4|5|Great cup holder, easy to install. Not much more to say.
B00G6MQNWU|5|I was a bit skeptical regarding any kind of performance chip for my 01 diesel excursion, but I did a little bit of research.  Taking into consideration the price coupled with the reviews I decided to take a chance on the TS Performance Chip.  This is without a doubt the very best money I have ever spent on this vehicle.  I have the settings at STOCK, HIGH IDLE, 50 Hp, 75 Hp, 100 Hp, and 140 Hp.  Wi the setting at 75 Hp. I believed I gained about 3 mpg and man is this thing a rocket.  Such a joy to drive now.  Thank you for such a great product at a reasonable price.  I ordered mine from Gearhub and all I can say is their service is outstanding.  Thank you again!!
B00GT2FUB2|5|This just saved me from a long wait for AAA to jump my BMW x3 battery. I had my doubts about the XP-3, as a friend tried to jump my car with hers and it was a no go. I later found that high CCAs probably why I had to have a pro jump it.  Well, it happened again due to my poor understanding of the light switches in the BMW.  This time I didn't have to call a friend, I had just BOUGHT ONE!  My new friend XP-3. I was nearly convinced that this little thing wasn't even going to come close, but within seconds my car is running!  I bought the XP-3 originally for motorcycle jumps/touring trips, but I just may need to rethink this and get one to keep in the car!  IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS!<br />THANK YOU Antigravity Batteries<br /><br />I'm looking forward to testing the battery use with portable devices when motorcycle traveling/camping when quick and easy power source is not available.  Expect that it will work like a charm.
B003SNTINQ|4|Replaced the original window motor of the 2004 Santa Fe perfectly.
B00DQ2LTL8|5|They did the job.  Worked great.  Thanks
B007M47SW0|5|Part arrived just two days from placing order and we're just as described!
B00K01X65K|1|I ordered and paid for a C2 series spot light only.  What I received was a cheaper CI series.
B000E8V9RG|4|You can't go wrong with Purolator filters, they are better than most others out there.  I only wish that Amazon had not discontinued the two pack deal they used to have on these.
B012CGZTAA|3|Worked for a 96 Toyota T-100 with Dash Command application just fine. However, it did not work with my wife's 05 Toyota Avalon.  When connected to the Avalon, it made the ABS and BRAKE  lights come on. (I'm sure glad those two lights went back off after disconnecting!)<br /><br />I have since returned the item and have ordered the BASF version of this. It does cost twice the price but I am hoping for more compatibility for both of my vehicles as well as to help friends with their cars.<br /><br />Since it worked for one car I give it 3 stars. If it worked for both cars, (as advertised) I would give it a five star rating because coupled with the Dash Command app it worked well for my truck..My only suggestion is to contact  the folks at &#34;LeadYourLife&#34; to check for compatibility  with your particular vehicles before ordering.  I Hope this helps.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|The weight makes a difference.  Had to use a caucking gun to ensure a vibration free fit.
B00ENPQHTG|5|Great quality
B005QURVB0|5|I use these to stabilize bikes on my hitch-mount carrier.  Even put two together for length and nothing ever came loose.  I carry them with me all the time.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Great cargo carrier, purchased along with the ROLA 59102 Expandable Hitch Tray Cargo Bag.  Made traveling with two kids and two dogs in my Jeep Wrangler so much easier!
B00PT04YP8|5|Keep the nasty lot lizards away with these stickers!
B002LNI8GW|5|Little smaller than I wanted but boy, they're soft, tuff, and clean excellent: perfect for speed shine!
B00AQZBGAM|5|Perfect fit, all fasteners in the exact location as factory. Easy fix for damages or broken vacuum lines.
B00JCHNDVA|3|Writing seem to be stickers but still looks good
B00IZJU74C|5|Great quality, great price
B00PQH7YUG|4|I put this on my 2007 KLR650. it is brighter than stock, the low beam is a low small concentrated spot. the low is the only thing that I don't like. If you are in front of the bike and the light is on high beam it is very bright. good for being seen.
B00CQ40KVM|1|Way too big and could not be cut down to fit my car.  Will have to be returned.
B000BQR8TE|5|Worked as I expected. Now I can store my sewer hose collapsed and totally sealed
B00B81F06O|5|For my 1 7/8&#34; ball this hitch works great for it. If I were to use my 2&#34; or 2 5/8&#34; ball trailers, then I would add a small 1/4&#34; steel plate to the top and weld it in to give it the necessary reinforcement it would need for those
B000P0LGUI|3|The floor mats arrived on time. They are sturdy and don't smell like rubber. I'm giving them three stars because the holes don't fit the slots. I asked before the purchase if it would fit and was assured it would, however it does not.
B000W9N452|5|I'm a big fan of Engineer brand tools.  For basic wire stripping, cutting and crimping, this is a fine tool.  It's made in Japan so you know it's good quality.  I've used alot of individual hand tools that have been better than this one for for a 1 size fits all type tool, this does very well.  It regularly keep it in my tool bag and is one of my go-to tools for wire work.<br /><br />5 stars.  Great tool!
B00JZR3IEO|4|Works great slight lubrication and connected easy no problems
B0022ZV1MW|3|Nice smooth feel when at pace, I like planting my knee as it's my last resort to save a lowside so time will tell how durable these are
B00NWF61GC|5|Worked great
B0058W75Y4|5|The Tahoe looks great!
B006QGD996|5|Came in very handy for my recent move. Had many situations where I wished I had some rachet tie downs and now I'm glad I have them
B000C2APB0|5|Fits and doesn't leak.
B00SGGTDLC|4|It fit decent in my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk.
B0085IJVBI|5|Nice, easy replacement of the old one.
B00068OODU|5|Fast shipping, as described
B0017UBHQS|5|They also work good thanks.
B000RG6L32|4|long delivery time to Finland. The windscreen is OK.
B002M1MYUO|5|I purchased and installed this Fuel Pump Assembly in a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer ES. Worked perfectly and was an exact match.<br />Car had over 200k miles on the original fuel pump when it started to sputter out.<br /><br />Car has been running well since the install. Pump Assembly comes with the fuel pump and o-ring seal. No extra parts required.<br /><br />Will update if any issues arise in the new few months.
B00J4CTGBE|3|These were installed on a 2004 R1.  They are pretty well made.  There were no installation instructions.  A light to medium grade of loc-tite for the bolts is recommended.  This ideally would have been part of the kit.
B00DUYQPBG|5|very well built
B00YJL82GA|5|easy install, fit great, no problems
B00YB9U3P8|5|Excelente !!!👍🏻
B002A0KP8U|5|Awesome and long lasting I love this plate. It pretty much is exactly as picture shows so I don't know what more there is to say about it.
B0041CAECM|4|It fits OK considering there's so many applications it definitely needs tweaking in a few areas. a little grinding in a little bit and you can get it to fit pretty good. The performance seems to be improved
B008ETMV8I|5|These are so useful, I want to buy a &#34;Costco sized&#34; pack of them and hand them out to all my riding buddies.*<br /><br />*Not sold in Costco sized packs
B00E1SK2BO|5|Great product, prompt delivery
B001UG8S8O|5|I ordered this to put on my water bottle and it works great.
B00VJ2PVPC|5|Love them.
B0002YR83Q|5|Works great. Just what I wanted.
B000S2VZ6S|5|This did the trick. My Cruise control had not worked for 6 months. Replacing this fixed the problem. My leg, foot and ankle thank you!!
B00LEBLI82|5|I waited until the last minute to decide to upgrade my toyhauler to LED lights, before a trip. All of the lamps I used worked well. I changed all of the lamps to LED and never noticed the batteries getting low, like they had in the past. We did run a generator everyday, but with the incandescent lamps it seemed like we always had to be conservative with the lights. The color might be a little odd, but it is much whiter and brighter than the old lamps. They saved power and made the trailer much brighter, so I can't complain, especially for the low cost.
B00S5R56B8|4|Very easy to use well worth it keep your mechanic honest
B002IPQ5IG|2|ordered this for a 2005 Nissan Altima and received a 2002-2004 mirror instead, not that big of a deal its just a little smaller and doesn't fit perfectly really needed it or i would have sent it back so I installed it anyways
B00H1IPAUY|1|So...didn't need an EGR valve but was doing a tune up on my Jeep and this is one of those parts that gets replaced whenever I do one.  Didn't have a code before, had one immediately after (P0406) I installed this thing.  Still had the old valve laying around so I uninstalled the Dorman one, reinstalled the old one and the code disappeared.  Still yearning for a replacement, I went to AutoZone and picked up the brand they hock, hooked her up and no code.  After seeing the issue with mine first hand, decided to come on here and see if anybody else had an issue with this brand and alas...several people did.  Makes me wonder if these are recycled EGR valves that have been reconditioned somehow?  Anyway...total garbage so yet again, you do get what you pay for.  Word to the wise, the AutoZone part was like 40ish dollars but seems like a higher quality part so I would go with that for those of you who haven't made the purchase yet.  For those who have, we have the world's goofiest looking paper weight.
B001462JHG|5|cool looking
B000HUNHLM|5|Thick rubber not cheap. Fit well and havent had any problems since i put it on.
B0023VB6J8|5|part fit perfect great to do business with fast shipping A++++
B002BG4WX2|1|did not work for me. read all the reviews, I guess I'm one who didn't have much luck. 01 Bonneville would hold ac charge for 2 weeks or so. used Red Angel, and lasted 2 weeks or so... Obviously slow enough leak, expected it to work. Unimpressed with product.
B0014438D2|5|Tremendo
B006VZ3230|4|The product was as described, had my mechanic put it on the vehicle. I was disappointed in the flimsy-ness of the item, but it hopefully will hold up with the coming autumn and winter, The holes did seem to fit okay, and no new holes were necessary. I am glad I bought it, as now the wheel well will be protected.Only time will tell as to how durable this will be.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|Works great for cleaning my computer/car etc...it is loud though if that matters to anyone.
B00SZ70TP6|5|They fit great, and for those complaining about seeing the mounting hardware on the bottom, it is hardly noticeable unless you are coming at your truck from a much lower position than standing, or it is lifted 5-6&#34; off the ground.  The look is clean, and the chrome compliments our Ash Gray paint.  Easily installed in an hour or so.
B0007VCL22|4|Very high quality product and fairly easy installation (if you have large enough ratchet sockets). My only constructive criticism is I think the top side frame panel bolts should be keyed like the bottom ones, it's a very large bolt and difficult to get ratchet/wrench on both the nut and bolt to tighten to spec.
B00WKXP3RU|2|This cover did not fit my Honda ridgeline as expected. the cab section is too short. The remainder fit as expected.
B00V4049K2|5|My son uses my car a lot and it usually smells of cigarettes afterwards which annoys me alot. And from first day I started using Purggo I noticed the difference. My carvdoesnt smell like an ashtray any more. I love it.
B00AQZB0V2|5|My Ford Escape's back door was no longer opening due to water corrosion in the tailgate latch. The new latch arrived promptly, easy to install, and it works great.
B00GUJBT7S|5|Look sharp
B0000CBIK5|1|Poorly made. Did not work.
B006JRJVVC|5|Works great for our motorhome front window. Love it.
B00LEBLI82|5|Nice lights, good brightness, we'll see if they help not drain the Rv s battery.
B00DEJTGVI|5|oem
B00VGYXIL2|5|Great quality
B00NE33ORQ|5|Perfect fit.  BMW 1000k.  Nice blue color.
B00PQ49IJO|5|great..  no problems with it... thanks
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fits great!
B008WAEZYM|5|I want it
B00MFW0KO2|5|worked great.
B00271ZL9K|5|perfect
B00144CZRM|5|This product is Amazing!  You literally just spray on and wipe off.  Even the most terrible mildew stains are removed instantly!  This product saved time and our backs and our boat looks brand new again!!
B001PLWS9Y|5|Works great
B001BB8JM8|3|Works
B000JFJLP6|5|Powerful and easy to use!
B000BUU5YU|5|So glad I ordered an extra cord we have already used it.
B009AQS4IU|4|Bling bling plate holder.  Fun!
B000GVEY64|5|Works perfectly for road trips
B0058ED3GG|2|Not &#34;ultra&#34; fine. I was hoping they'd be finer than the plier I already have but they're the same. Decent quality though.
B000EQ6FHC|5|These were for my 2004 Volvo S40 T5, they were a bit more work than usual to put in but wow. I must say these brakes are champs.  I had to brake to literally avoid a crash and these babies brought my car to a beautiful stop. They stop on a dime, make zero noise, and were a good price.
B00GBONC68|4|Came already scratched, easy to install
B000JZUUME|5|this part fit and was exactly what we needed.
B00EC4OUT2|4|Good product
B006STTIVY|3|I've bought several, and they all end up falling apart or not spraying right after a few months.....
B00W47BDYY|4|Great throttle, very smooth action and does not stick like the one it replaced did.The throttle cable is a bit long though and I had to use the second mounting hole, meaning a much faster pull (I like it, you decide whether it's good or bad). Much less expensive than other performance throttles, so I'll be ordering another for my dirt bike soon.<br />My only gripe is the kill switch. Very cheaply made and the cable is nowhere near long enough to use.
B006RW5NNY|4|I purchased this item for my 2009 Scion TC. I have had it on for about 4 months now and it still looks great! It came in the standard orange packaging with the metal TRD emblem, 2 screw-ons, 2 nuts and 2 back plates (all are metal). It was easy installing this onto the car. However, you might want to tighten the head-less screws with some pliers. After that, just put the head-less screws through the car grille, slide the back plates in and tighten the nuts. After a little while, the back plates and screws tend to rust (NOT the emblem) and that is the only issue so far! Love this item and I recommend it to anyone looking to add to their car.
B002C0I9PY|5|People have said this is hard to unroll on your own. I don't find it terribly cumbersome. For the slight awkwardness it's size entails, I love how perfectly it stays up and keeps the heat out.

B00JF5LRN0|5|I couldn't be happier with my choice of cargo carriers! I thought and searched amazon endlessly for day trying to make a decision and the Curt 18153 was, in my opinion, the very best! I attached it to a MaxxHaul hitch converter on my Mercury Mountaineer and it was a great fit! It held enough luggage for four adults and three children for an entire week at the beach. I traveled from TN to SC over mountains and down curvy roads and I never had to worry about this cargo carrier. I put it together myself with tool s I have around the house an had it completely put together in about an hour. I warm, don't tighten the bolts until all screws are in, and THEN tighten. Learned that lesson the hard way. I did have my neighbor tighten the main bolt, just to ensure it didn't loosen on the trip. It has the perfect amount of room and I love the side rails which made tying down the products that didn't fit into my ROLA 59102 bag. It was simple. This makes traveling with other people and children a dream, as the luggage isnt packed under everyone's feet. Could not be any happier with my CURT cargo carrier, GREAT choice, you wont regret this purchase!
B0009NUG66|5|We traveled for over a week in Colorado (from Missouri).  We were in some torrential rains and a wide variety of temperatures.  Zero leaks.  This bag held up great and was relatively easy to use.  We fit 2 tents, 2 large athletic bags of clothes, sleeping bags, camp chairs and an air mattress as well a a few other assorted things in it.  I'm 6'5&#34; and did have to reach to get the straps across the top, so if you are a but shorter, you might need a stool.  The only other suggestion I have is to make sure you have the front of the bag stuffed full or you will get significant noise from the material on the highway.  We didn't do this on the trip out, but once I rearranged it there was no noise at all.  Great bag and a great value!
B007X65I7Y|5|Work well- maybe expoxy the hanle heads to the square shafts- some came loose
B0085IIZ3I|5|These gimbaled drink holders are perfect, but do they make wider diameter ones as well?
B009TDCHDW|5|Installed on my snow tires and haven't had any problems for over 2 years.  Worked instantly with my 2013 Honda Ridgeline.  I never have to do anything to reconnect when I switch between summer and winter tires.
B007ZGC9P6|4|Good price and since I didn't need adjustments to fiddle with, these work for me. They are replacing some Chinese-made coilovers that did NOT work for me.
B00NJRGD70|5|Nice, compact when stored. Works fine and fits nice on my ATS .
B007ZGKKMA|5|Good, bright lights for my tractor.
B0091I1ORU|5|First 30 days - works as expected. Traveled 3600 miles around North Canada on hiking/camping trip, Battery 100% at all times.
B002JR949K|5|This works great.  I should have bought it last Spring instead of late Summer.
B005G5SD7Q|5|these are amazing gripsf
