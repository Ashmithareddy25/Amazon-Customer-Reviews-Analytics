B00A1EOBJQ|5|I bought all the Nashville CDs. I love the TV show and all the singers and the music.
B003TSEL7S|4|Great book!
B0055QYKQO|4|If you buy this and you have an older power supply 600 watts or less be careful, this thing will not boot with out a good power supply.<br />I had to dish out another 100 bucks for a new psu, but it was worth it, the motherboard runs great does what it says it does on the box.
B00GU9E17I|4|Great story and collection of actors. It won't match Aliens for jokes or unique gun action, but that's OK. I bought it since I like the series and it's the only action Sci-Fi that interests me.  The score is the same as last time, but it makes for a good tune. The writer did well in keeping the scenes consistent and by making it 2 hours to make up for Riddick needing to heal. There was one spot where Riddick could have used the word &#34;epic&#34; but the Twohy could see how hackneyed it would sound. Thanks for making a great movie.
145168939X|1|I kept reading this book that I borrowed from the library, because I thought it might get better. It didn't. I finally gave up shortly after the halfway point. This book is just awful. It is disjointed to the point that it is difficult to follow. It feels like I'm reading something with pages missing. The worst thing is that there is no compelling reason to finish reading it. It is boring, and I have a lot of patience. (I read Jane Eyre, and Great Expectations.) I can't imagine how the movie about the same thing is going to be any more interesting than this drivel.  I wonder who greenlit this for a screenplay. Then they complain that movie watching is down. People aren't going to theaters because nothing good is playing.
B00003CXCT|1|I won't buy this for two reasons:<br />1) Fox is probably ripping us off again.  After two Alien box sets, three versions of X-men, and many other examples where they released two versions; there is no way I'm going to fall for it again.  I know that if I buy this box set, in four or five years Fox will release a better seven disc version, with both versions of the films and loaded with extras.  Which leads to the other reason I won't buy this.<br />2) I want the original versions of these movies.  I don't want to see Greedo awkwardly shooting the wall before Han fires.  I don't want to see Boba Fett looking into the camera as he walks by.  I don't want to hear the Storm Trooper say \\"oomph\\" as he bumps into the door.  I don't want to see Han walk over jaba's tail.  I don't want to watch the terrible re-edit of the end of Empire.  I don't want to have Luke say \\"You're lucky to be alive\\" rather than \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good.\\"  Worst of all, I don't want Luke to make that goofy scream as he's falling at the end of empire.<br />None of these things were in the original versions of the films.  They are \\"special\\" additions.  They wasted time putting in all those lame things, yet didn't fix the red boxes around the tie fighters and asteroids.  George Lucas, who fought against the colorization of Black and White movies, ruined his own films by adding unnecessary baggage.  I won't buy a Star Wars movie until I can purchase the original theatrical versions.
B0055V6EZE|5|I've always been a fan of Hugh and I know he is very talented with music. I was curious about this type of music so I bought the CD. It has become my boyfriend and I's favorite CD!!! I didn't even know I liked \\"blues\\". I really hope Hugh does another because I will be the first to buy it! If your thinking of buying it just do it, you won't regret it:)
0800141806|5|The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it.<br /><br />A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids.<br /><br />The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible.<br /><br />The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination.<br /><br />The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions.<br /><br />The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.<br /><br />The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.<br /><br />This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.<br /><br />And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUin the night in the sole presence of his partner.

B003Y5H5F6|5|Ok it could have been greater but I wont take away a star for a what if since I enjoyed the movie as a whole.<br /><br />Pros: 1. Selena was herself, she picked off the people in the lab building where she had been cryo frozen for 12 years and Im glad that time didnt mellow he almost ballet like dispatch of her enemies.<br /><br />2. Her daughter was delightful mix of her and Michael. The actress playing her was totally believable and indeed it takes a lot for a girl playing a 12 year old to his and snarl and be monstrous without looking stupid. She really was brilliant here beside adorabel.<br /><br />3. The revelation of who set off the chain of events of human/vampire/lyca fight for survival was a shocker.  It seems that the Lycans have been busy.<br /><br />Cons: 1. Time wasted on flashbacks not even done in sequential order. A wast of film time I thought. Who could forget the other movies to that extent.<br /><br />2. We really don't know what suddenly tipped off the humans as two the two different species living right under there noses, thought I suspect the Lycans needed panic in the streets to accomplish their goal of a super, hugh, silver resistant werewolf. Still though because the movie started with the human preventive measures already rolling on the TV screens it is a bit confusing. But then the Lycan scientists security precation may well have failed without outside interference with them being put down.<br /><br />3. The Lycans themselves were an odd bunch. They seemed more docile though no less deadly. They seemed to lack the grace they showed previously as they bounded after their prey and after catching, they were totaly absent that sink your fangs in and shake your head violently till you get a slice, they seemed less hungry then previous Lyacan generation's. Simply put, they were pretty clumsy and poorly tendered.<br /><br />4. How did the Vampires with their keen sense of smell and hearing not take note that something was going on in that big lab building which woul have stunk of lycans to all hell.<br /><br />5. What happened to the silver nitrate, the liquid silver bullets like the one that Craven used to finish of Lucian you would have thought they would be load with those. Thats a plothole and were were the Lycans Ultraviolet bullets? Both successful inventions seemed to go unused and the Lycans seem to die more by hide ventilation by regular machine gun bullets then silver.<br /><br />6. And where did Michael go? Didnt he sense his daughter? Male Parents are just as dangerous when it comes to their young as the female. Will another movie tie all these loose end together? Will Vampire and Lycan finally learn to live and let live?<br /><br />Basically what this movie needed was a moment called \\"The Prestige\\" as described in the Chris Bale, Michael Caine film. That one fantastic moment in the film that gets you jumping out of your chair and yahoooing that scene as the main one that made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />But if you like Underworld Series you will like this movie plot points and all, Kate is as beautifull as ever and the blood keeps flowing.<br /><br />In the end, on the roof where Michael was just seconds ago on camera Selena give a kind of we will rebuild and go on, almost Scarlet O Hara like. \\"As God is my witness there will covens in abundance again.\\"<br /><br />I guess its now up to Kate Beckinsdale and Len Weisman to see if they can bring this fantastic story stretching out over centuries to a respectable close?  I guess the best time to find out is to start googling in about a years time.
0743487486|3|A challenging but ultimately rewarding way to address issues in parenting. Ultimately  this has good run on effects into everyday life. As with all things parenthood, this should be read with an open mind and critically assessed before deciding this philosophy is helpful to you. For me and my family it has been so far. :)
B005LAII12|1|I choose the rating I did bc this movie wasnt that great<br />at all really it had 2 much bad stuff like drugs & bad lan<br />However my hubby like it.Just wasnt a movie I would have got if I<br />would have known it was gonna be more about just having 2 much<br />of a good time.There were only a couple parts in this that I liked.<br />Over all given even one star is being nice..I even told my hubby<br />he could have the movie it was his..He laughed through the whole thing.Have 2 say that what they showed on the TV<br />look amazing & so funny..Whitch is why I bought it but I was so depressed that it wasnt what I thought it was gonna be & the way it look on TV..Just glad that some1 liked it!
B00F3VOL38|5|gift he loved it
B000AQJPQE|4|Very cool product but the motors are kinda loud, the light is very dim and the planets atm kinda cheap BUT ... Hello, it's like, $30.. It does work super well so far bit I thought it was something to connect onto the light fixture but out runs on batteries and you have to still into your ceiling. My kid is completely entranced by it!
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Awesome
B00H8C4HZ2|5|As an immigrant its important to me to know about the civil rights movement and this movie portrays it from the two sides!
B0034DGPEU|2|Story was very strung out, did not provide much in the way of interesting topics for the main characters to work through.  Was mostly a dissertation of mundane daily activity.  The ending was terrible and very anticlimatic. It appeared the author was writing this entire novel so she could write a sequel.  Very dissapointing.
B00MUCX6AW|4|Liked it but...Tom Cruise...how could I.
B008Y212PI|4|Got this as faotd. Great concept. Complete scenes by solving pictogram logic puzzles.  it's obvious that the developers hope you will buy the other packs.  I just wish there was a larger, &quot;super pack,&quot; that would have them all for less than the price separately.  But I will probably buy at least one more.<br /><br />I also wish there was a menu where you could track how many puzzles / scenes you have left to complete in a given category. You can only cycle forward or backward in each category, hard, medium and easy. There's also no pause / exit button which means app must be fc to prevent it running in background and draining battery.<br /><br />5 stars for gameplay less one star for lack of menus, exit button and cost when compared to other simular apps like &quot;Cross Me&quot;.
B00B29J0I6|4|The free paid app of the day from the Amazon App Store for June 21, 2013 is Rescue Roby from Runaway Studios.<br /><br />This is a game which is rather similar to Red Remover and Red Wrecker where you have to remove platforms in a certain order and at the right time in order to get what appears to be a robot's head into a crate box that has the title character's head on the side of it.<br /><br />It seems like a fun game that is close to 5 star quality, but I am deducting a star for several minor reasons.  Every time you accomplish something in the Amazon GameCircle list, the game abruptly stops to show you your accomplishment right in the middle of a game.  That is also the only time you can see what the list of accomplishments are unless you press on the Amazon GameCircle button when you first open the app.  The app maker did not provide a link to the Amazon GameCircle accomplishment page on the main menu page of the app.<br /><br />Also I feel that many of the early levels I have played so far seem a little obvious as to how to complete them.  An example of this is when you have just one bomb in the level instead of 3 or 4 placed on the screen to confuse you as to whether you are supposed to use all of them or only some.<br /><br />For those minor reasons above, I am giving this game a 4 out of 5 star rating.  This would have made a much better free app choice than the Father's Day choice last Sunday, and it is really too bad Amazon didn't use this game instead of the hidden object game last Sunday.
B0047Y0FGY|4|This book was plentiful with hilarious analogies and I realized that Tina Fey was playing herself when she played Liz Lemon.
B00HXYKYIE|5|Loved this book! I have read all of Jodi Picoults books and this is one of the finest. Kept me guessing until the end, and oh how the tears flowed! Read it, you won't be disappointed.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Great game it's just like floppy birds but better because you can unlock different birds and the tubes change colors
B0050DIWFC|5|Could'nt put the book down. Well written & gripping. Makes you feel in the middle of the plot. If you like courtroom drama, this is a good read.
B00992CF6W|5|It says that it is updated but there is no update for me yet I hear all about it from my cousin but how do I update it !!!!!????!
B00BHMETKC|5|Best movie i have seen in a long time, was on the edge of my seat til the very end of this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I haven't read any Collen Hoover books until this one and I am so glad I found it. The story line is fantastic and the characters were very intriguing. This book mixed with all of my emotions; I cried, I laughed, I smiled, I got mad, and I even got butterflies in a lot of parts. I love this book and I will recommend it to everyone!! :)
B00BB8VRPM|5|Screenwriting Perfection. And the little boy, you just want to eat him up, he's so adorable.  This is definitely on my all-time best movie list.  Must see!
B0042LJTQO|5|Mr. Brendel performs an excellent suite of Shubert's compositions.  The quality of the recording is exceptional  and it will be a frequent choice for listening.
0385501560|5|I won't spoil any of the plot for you (I'm going to guess that you've already read all about it by now), so I'll just say a few things.  First, this is Chuck Palahniuk's most \\"hopeful\\" book.  While I love his past three books, it is kind've refreshing to get some hope thrown into his mix.  Second, Victor is a lot like Tender.  If you like Survivor (the book, not that ... show), you should like this as well.  Third, this is CP's funniest book, as long as you don't get offended by strong sexual content.  Highly recomended.
B004SIIBGU|4|I have thought that using the same software. No such luck; the most popular function s are included, rarely in the same place on the screen. Many times some on the android main screen will be 3-4 screens below.<br /><br />Just recently my ability to pay from the application was blocked so then I had to open my browser to complete the transaction.
B000002KGT|3|My inner indie snob cringes when I think of this record. Rumours is a huge chart topper (I think at one point the best seller of all time, only to be ousted by Michael Jackson's Thriller). Everybody from that kid down the block to your grandmother owns a copy. Most of this album is a classic and lite radio mainstay. The production is slick and overengineered. The lyrics, on the surface, seem to be the same ol' cliches spouted out about love and loss. All in all, Rumours should be a target of derision on the same level as '70s crap like Kansas, Journey, The Eagles, Steve Miller Band, and other AOR rawk.<br />But it isn't. I, like most of the reviewers here, have a really hard time trying to pan this record. Rumours is far from being my favorite Fleetwood Mac album--I tend to gravitate more toward the bluesier Peter Green incarnation myself (though that's almost a COMPLETELY different band), and among the Buckingham/Nicks/McVie albums the self-titled album and the double LP Tusk slightly outrank it. Still, Rumours ranks among the better pop albums of the '70s, and it's aged a lot better than most of their contemporaries thanks to strong songwriting.<br /><br />All incarnations of Fleetwood Mac benefitted from considerable talent--this time applied in a poppier, less guitar-driven direction. Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie are two of the finest female vocalists in music, and Lindsey Buckingham's guitar playing and vocal contributions are seriously underrated. These songs would be lacking in a big way without him; listen to that wrenching solo he lays down on The Chain, for instance. The beautiful vocal harmonies and shimmering pop guitars of this lineup are in full force. The only musical annoyance is the prescence of some cheesy keyboards (on Don't Stop and You Make Loving Fun, in particular) but that's a fairly minor complaint.<br />Lyrically, most of the songs seem to be nothing special...until you realize what was going on within the band. You could hear the strains of the behind-the-scenes soap opera within the lyrics (&quot;damn your love, and damn your lies&quot;). There's also some wonderfully poetic moments on Gold Dust Woman and Dreams.<br />My favorites on the album are Go Your Own Way, the beautiful piano lament Songbird, Gold Dust Woman (which features the best vocal performance of Nicks' entire career IMO), and The Chain, written by the entire band and clearly the album's centerpiece. Overall, Rumours is a great pop album, but it's not quite a classic, and it's not Fleetwood Mac's best work--merely their most commercially successful.ns of the behind-the-scenes soap opera within the lyrics (&quot;damn your love, and damn your lies&quot;).

B001PU8N0I|5|I am a huge Jane Austen fan!  I was a little unsure about this series until the Amazon reviews convinced me to give it a go.  What a great period drama.  Charles Dickens weaves a masterful tale and BBC sure knows how to put the pieces together.  I really enjoyed it!
B008JFUPK8|5|Love the way they portrait Superman in this movie. I will say that the battle in the city made me think of the buildings crashing down during 9/11. Comic books don't give you the idea that people are dying as the buildings fall but more of everyone is home safe except those unlucky few running away in the streets. Now I'm waiting for the next one.
B00BH0VSM6|5|This story was better than ever.  So much good stuff about Australia and the people.  Poor Harry.  He is definitely flawed and needs major help.  With his job it is no wonder he drinks.
B000VHMF0A|5|Not going to go into detail about Bob's masterpiece.  Would take too long.  Suffice to say that I would rank this album in the top 3-5 albums of all time...I mean of ALL TIME...since music was first recorded.  It's that spectacular!!  If you don't own it, you owe it to yourself to skip buying two or three fancy coffee drinks this week and instead purchase a &#34;Legend&#34; (pun intended).  I can not stress how awesome this album is on so many different levels the purchase would be a great value if you paid 5 times this price.  Buy it!
B000000W8C|5|What can be said for the verves best lp,..I was watching a bad movie on cable one night, and i heard a song in this movie, at some LA party type setting, it was \\"Slide away\\". Probable the most known song from their first LP. That song cought my attention, looked in the credits got the name and sought them out. Bought \\"A storm in heaven\\". Liked the cd alot, loved slide away, but I was unsure of there longevity. Kinda forgot about them untell I found out there where coming to town to play. Bought a ticket (even if your not a big fan of a group from over seas, never know if you will ever get another chance to see them live again) It was the \\"Norther soul\\" tour. I had bought a norther soul cd already and loved it! One raido staion was playing \\"History\\" off this album. It was a sami big hit for the band. The album instantly became one of my faviorte cd's (out of 300). Finally a band that will withstand the test of time! So i thought....every song on the album has a feel all its own.                                                                  History- synphony background loop with great lyics very smooth.                                     <br />Drive you home- folk rock but very powerfull sounding.  <br />So it goes- a blue eyed soul song.  <br />Brimstom Interlude- psychedelic rock. <br />A new decade- rock. <br />A northern soul- psychedelic rock hypnotic gitar. <br />This is only 6 songs that are just awsome. Not a stinker in the bunch on this cd IMHO. If u listin to this album twice you will be hooked...Only if u like good music. <br />Sadly to say the band is broken up and Richard Ashcroft is doing his solo thing. From what I heard is that the synphony loop they used in the back ground of \\"Bitter sweet synphony\\" was a track off a stones album. It ended with the stones winning a copyright infringement lawsuit and the rights for the song....          <br />I was fortunet enough to see this timeless band twice! I have 4 verve cd's and 2 Ashcroft cd's. Just  to let u know im a fan of this band. (could ya tell?)
B002VPE1AW|5|I know there are people who hated this film because of the plot or whatever, but as a history geek, the parallels to American history and Manifest Destiny are enough to make me drool.<br /><br />Yes the acting leaves a little bit to be desired, but the costumes, set design, special effects, and soundtrack more than make up for Sam Worthington's shortcomings.<br /><br />... and the historical connections!!! *drool*
B009JZWO3I|4|I enjoy catching up with The Good Wife via my Kindle when I'm travelling or just want to plug in and enjoy some of the best writing and acting on TV.  Disappointed in season finale and the storylines this season, but overall still one of my favorites on tv.
B001EC2J20|5|Not sure why people are asking &#34;why did they make this movie?&#34; my answer, why are you just watching this now? this triology, was part of the best ever made. clearly if you are just seeing this now, you missed out on the first come around.<br />the matrix is not just a movie, this has become a cult and rightfully so. there are talks and production for 2 new movies due out in the next few years.<br />for those who want a better understanding, take a look at the Matrix animations- for those wanting indepth look at the matrix revisited.<br />one will give you more of a background of the matrix and the other will give you other views to the matrix itself.<br />this might not be for everyone, but to see this movie almost 10 years later and ask why this was made, you need to really open your mind
0451419243|4|I liked this better than the first book. Read this one first and glad I did. I'm chugging through the first one, almost done, seems at times like a chore...too much fluff not enough history for me.
B004EPYZQM|2|I'm on the same boat as J.G. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.     If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like \\"oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him\\".   However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters. More than likely they would have just sat there spinning their wheels until their tires exploded or the cable would have snapped.
0793927501|5|Anthony Hopkins....WOW...Great outdoor adventure! Just in case anyone's interested the book he used in the movie (survival in the wilds) does not exist. It was just a movie prop..I know, I wanted a copy of it too...lol.
B00K4APIN0|5|AWSOME GAME!
B002NZTZ8S|5|My kids love it. I have a 2 & 4 year old and they really liked it. Great family movie.
B00KE3BAM0|5|I really love Jason Mraz and All of his albums. He's one of my favorite artists who never fails to deliver.
B003TXKSWU|5|I am neither a John Legend Fan or a Roots Fan, but this album may get me to listen to other work that both have done.  This soulful protest music, largely drawn from African American artists in the late 1960s through the early 1970s, is fantastic.  It has the classic soul music sound while updating it with new arrangements and commentary in the form of hip hop lyrics.  It has all the classic elements of soul music sounds while simultaneously conveying old lessons as they apply to our times and universal truths.  John Legend has a great sound here, and has really expanded his style from crooner into a man ready to push barriers to make a more meaningful and important music. Questlove and the Roots musical selections, arrangements, and playing are both respectful of the tradition while updating the sound for the modern listeners.  They play with musicality and soul.  If you appreciate great music that is both entertaining while challenging, this is your album.    I bought this on Vinyl with fantastic well designed packaging, a full double album photograph in the interior of the band, and vinyl record dust cases with commentary and descriptions of the tunes.  I was surprised both by the quality of the recording, the packaging, and the art.  I will also admit, that I believe most things sound better on Vinyl.  Clearly a labor of love by Mr. Legend and the Roots, it is packaged for a long shelf life.  This album is a must have if you simply love music.  It gets  better every time I spin the record.  I would suggest buying the Vinyl.  It is worth the money.
B004J64QSI|5|The 2012 movie was good but when compared to the singing on the 25th anniversary; it doesn't hold a candle.<br />If the singers on the anniversary DVD were in the show; it would have been phenomenal!
B00F91SCXC|5|Just loved the movie. And instant video. It was clear and there was no buffering.

B00005JOFO|5|After reading the book, actually started as a short story, I am shocked! I am a gay man and have been looking forward to seeing the movie since I first heard it was being made. Living in rural Alabama, the movie wasn't even playing at any of the 16 theaters in our area until 02/03 even though the \\"official release\\" was 02/16. I'm not in a hurry to see it at the theater, I would much rather see it at home. I was shocked simply because of all the hype which left me with a completely different idea of what the movie was really about, but after reading the book, all of the clips I've seen and the reviews I've read, now make much more sense. I'm sure many other folks have the same idea of the \\"Queer Cowboy Movie\\", but if the movie is anywhere near Annie's story, I just could not sit quietly in a theater and have my heart wrenched and twisted. To the best of my knowledge, the DVD is scheduled for release April 4 ... I've already pre-ordered!

0385339607|4|I find Grisham to be a hit and miss author, although lately he has been on such a losing streak that I've stopped reading his new novels altogether.  This one is a relative hit.  Rudy Baylor, in his final semester of law school is required as part of a class to provide free legal advice at a Senior Citizens home.  He meets an old lady who claims to have a fortune her family doesn't know about and she wants to cut them all out of her will and a woman whose son is dying of cancer when he could have been saved if their insurance provider hadn't refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.  When Rudy's post-graduation job disappears due to a merger of law firms, these two clients are all he has.  The insurance case has the potential to result in a huge windfall for the fledgling lawyer, if he can win it.<br /><br />It's a standard David vs. Goliath tale, when Rudy, who is so green he has yet to write his bar exam, takes on the insurance company who denied medical services to his cancer patient client.  Like most of Grisham's novels the lines between good and bad are too clearly defined for my taste.  Yes, Rudy has some anger issues and he isn't perfect, but he's still a stereotypical, bright, idealistic, well intended young man taking on evil corporations and greedy Ivey League lawyers.  Personally I'd like to see Grisham exercise more subtlety. Do his bad guys need to be so bad?  Not only do they deny claims, but they do it arrogantly, systematically, and knowingly as matter of policy, and to make matters worse they sexually harass their employees, fire people without cause, and lie, cheat and steal at every turn.  They are so blatantly evil it never requires the reader to contemplate an ethical dilemma because the right answer is always so clear.<br /><br />But I digress.  This complaint can be made about almost all of Grisham's novels.  What makes this one better than many of his other novels is that while predicable, it's entertaining.  There are surprising touches of humor and as with many of Grisham's better novels, some insight into the world of legal wrangling.  Yes, there are some pretty neat coincidences that work in Rudy's favor but even a cynic like me can find satisfaction in the little guy bringing down a giant, even if it is contrived.<br /><br />I thought the romance angle however was weak.  Kelly was less a person and more a vehicle for Grisham to demonstrate Rudy's noble chivalry.  But so what I guess.  It allows our hero to ride off into the sunset with his best girl by his side, and who am I to question a formula that obviously works.  I was entertained and that's more than I can say for a lot of novels that I read.many of Grisham's better novels, some insight into the world of legal wrangling.

0439023513|3|In the first book, Katniss was written as an unselfish girl who went to the Hunger Games as a tribute to District 12 in place of her little sister.  This was a selfless act.  Her fighting in the arena and her spontaneous actions were amazing as was her silly flirtations with Peeta and Gale, both of whom were not exactly great catches in themselves.<br /><br />The second book picked up where Katniss left off and cannot stand on its own.  I'd definitely call it a sequel to number one, as it dealt more with the rise of the revolution against the dictatorial Capitol with a president of the rebels using Katniss and she resents it fully.<br /><br />The third book was more of the same, but Katniss spun deeper into her own psychoses, not trusting people, not understanding what they're wanting her to do, not getting the importance of public relations (as the grown-ups do) and seems really, a spoiled brat!<br /><br />Later in the story her friends Gale and Peeta, two boys that vie for her affections, are themselves thrown into confusion as Peeta is somehow captured and brainwashed by the Capitol to kill her!  Her only recourse is Gale.  A man who has his own agenda to perform.<br /><br />The third book (praised by Twilight author Stephanie Meyer, OMG) is rushed, especially towards the last third of the book.  Without giving much away, Katniss is really quite a hypocrite.  She plans on stealing a device and doing her own thing, for example, as she wants to assassinate Snow (the president of the Capitol and Panem) but the person with whom she would steal has himself given her every courtesy and protection.  Then she's conflicted.  \\"I know I should be grateful but....\\"  Most of her dialogue is like this.<br /><br />Another annoying aspect of her dialogue is jumping to conclusions.  \\"He's acting that way because ___________ therefore _________ so I must act thus!\\"  And of course the character is not even close to being or acting that way.<br /><br />The last chapters too don't develop her mother nor her sister all that much either.  There is much tragedy with Katniss and she does not hold up well at all.  Her screaming and thrashing, the constant nightmares, it gets to be a bit much.<br /><br />The ending is not totally satisfying but is a surprise and the surprise was such that made the ending not predictable which I'm thankful.<br /><br />There is a film for the first book coming out soon.  I'm looking forward to it since the first book is really the best.  The whole \\"rebel alliance\\" stuff has been done to death however and made slogging through the third book a rough go.  She's a pawn in a rough game.  At the end, she's still a pawn, just surviving, not contributing.  Is that all?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Katniss is not the strong female character she started out as in the first book but she is clearly no Bella from Twilight.  There are other strong female characters in the book however that may make the book a worthy addition to any female teenager or young adult library.<br /><br />Other Suzanne Collins Novels:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0041T52UY The Underland Chronicles: Gregor the Overlander]]<br />[[ASIN:0545265355 Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]]<br />[[ASIN:1935618040 The Girl Who Was on Fire: Your Favorite Authors on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games Trilogy]]uch either.

B0025KVLSI|4|Reviewing a Beatles album is no easy task.  I think only diehard fans or critics would even attempt it.  Everyone else is just giving their opinion.  Not quite right?  I suppose those who listened to popular music in the sixties would attempt it as well.  Again, everyone else is just giving their opinion or betraying their taste in music.  For starters,  the Beatles music changed from disc to disc.  They played a variety of music and were not confined to rock 'n' roll.  this disc falls into their mersey-beat era but it is transitional as well and points to the future.  If you are someone who does not appreciate 50's rock,  or who does not appreciate early-mid sixties British pop and rock, look elsewhere I say.  To each his own.  If you like trippy music, try their later stuff.  This record is just really solid poprock, countryrock and plain old fashioned rock 'n' roll circa 1964.  Everyone else doesn't have to like it. In 1964-65, this was really good stuff.  I'm saying that and I'm not old enough to remember this disc being released.  But I do like a lot of sixties music and can recognize talent and creativity when I hear it.  This has always been one of my favorite Beatles albums because of the variety of music.  And the thing that I see most reviewers complain about, the lack of originals, is, to me, a bonus!  The Beatles were, first and foremost, a performing group.  The did play their instruments, and most of their early recordings were practically cut live, just the four of them playing and singing together.  Pretty amazing!  So this disc is a chance to hear those great cover version they used to play in the clubs with a little added production.  Pretty cool.  So , no.  I enjoy those covers as much as the originals.  As another reviewer stated so wisely,  this records \\"faults\\" are it's virtues. (I'm paraphrasing)  For me (and this is my opinion), this record, along with a few others, represents the Beatles very well.  And, by the way, all the years I have beenlistening to it, I never noticed that this album sound ragged and rushed.  Isn't that how they sounded night after night playing all those club dates from way back when?  And people still loved to hear them.

0440238609|2|Had the author not stupidly used the term DEMON for the people's animals, he would not have lost the massive audience his books otherwise might have gotten him. I myself refused to see the movie because of this satanic crud, and I will not let my children see it or read the books.

B00L9B7IKE|3|Took a long time for for the story to evolve and struggled to hold my interest. Took me a couple of weeks to finish instead of a couple of days.
B000002GQL|4|Most people's main observation about this album is how sad sounding it is, and the Moodie's own bad feelings during that time have been well documented. However, once you get past that, it really is a wonderful part of the Moody Blues story. Yes, songs like New Horizons and Isn't Life Strange are very sad, there are a few very happy and optimistic moments on the album, namely Land Of Make Believe and You and Me. The Moodies never could be totally negative, and this album proves that. And Ray, God bless him, as he so often does brightens things up marvelously with For My Lady.  Although it is one of the most introspective of the classic seven, it is also one of the best.
B00B22ASUM|5|Excellent book. I really enjoyed both the human and cat story. Very well written. Made me want to love on my cat even more. They are special.
B00H8C41XA|3|I am a fan of Forest Whitker and of many of the other fine actors who appear in this film, many in very brief roles. I had been looking forward to seeing things through the eyes of the main character, Unfortunately, I was left disappointed. Perhaps it was the miscasting of some of the characters or perhaps there needed to be a bit more substance. Not sure.

Thrilled a Neurosurgeon would put himself out to the world to read - there are so many 'non-believers' in this experience.  In his profession he put his patient's perception of him on the line - he spared no detail.  Thanks for opening this amazing happening to us!  Rated it 5 stars due to it's validity, it's personalization, and it reads as if you went thru it w/ him!  I surely recommend it to believers as well as skeptics!!

8866131350|5|The 18 month was very useful since I bought it mid year. It's small and portable enough to carry anywhere. I looked at the planner with the week on one side and notes on the other, and the planner with the week spread over both sides. Personally, I find the former more useful, allowing me to jot notes that pertain to the week instead of being forced onto any one particular day. Standard awesome moleskin quality.

B0089XH38M|2|Reports a unsecure setting on my Kindle Fire, BUT its built in solution just freezes up the AVG app, and the setting that it refers to apparently doesn't exist on my Kindle.  The Security alert reports that &#34;USB debugging is enabled&#34;, and that it poses a hazard if one is not a developer. It instructs one to tap the &#34;Open Settings&#34; control to disable, but tapping the control just freezes the AVG application.  There is no such setting in the Kindle Settings, so I don't know what the heck it's problem is.  Finally told it to ignore the alert, but this seems contrary to the objectives of security packages.

B000MXPE7O|4|I usually do not feel compelled to write reviews but after reading all of the negative ones for this film, I felt like I should; I saw it in theaters and  enjoyed it so much that I bought it when it came out a couple of weeks ago.  Yes, the movie is long and slow in parts such as the beginning, but it's still extremely well done.  I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not an option - the only thing keeping it from the full five stars is its length (nearly 3 hours).  It is an interesting story with a unique inside look at things we otherwise do not get the chance to see - not just the beginning of the CIA, but also of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society of Yale.  The cinemetography is beautiful and all of the cast gives believable, strong performances.  So, while it is long, it's also gripping and compelling.  I don't see where all of the bad reviews are coming from because it is a generally good film that keeps you enthralled with the story - and it's a good story.
B007HXL1V0|5|I am an only child and I just had my second daughter so I was looking for a general guide of how to handle sibling relationships, especially given that I have no first hand experience. My older daughter is 2 1/2 and my younger is now 8 months. I like the reflection techniques outlined in this book and use them with my toddler even when her sister isn't involved (it sounds like you're upset right now, etc). She has even started coming to me and telling me she feels frustrated or sad/mad. Some of the techniques are definitely more for when the siblings are older, but it helped give me ideas for how to set a basis for how I react to their relationship as siblings as they get older. I would definitely recommend this as a great book to get ideas from even if you don't follow it 100%. I think it is a great guide and I'm sure I will be rereading it as my girls get older and more conflicts begin.
B001NESPHC|5|Wow - what a voice!  Super sultry songstress.  Terrific CD.  Heard Melody initially on Pandora and decided to buy her album, and love, love, love it.
0062127241|3|I tore into the package with eager anticipation, looking forward to learning about the Amazing Journeys in the life of one of the most gifted songwriters of my generation. I gravitated to The Who only after Tommy -- never understood the guitar smashing, and only now am discovering some of their songs I'd never heard. At first I was impressed with this book, but the more I read, it seemed like the minutes of a business meeting. After Pete left The Who, the book took a turn downhill and detailed what to me were boring details of projects I couldn't care less about, and then it moved to the explanation of the pedophile charge. The last third to half the book is almost like one of those ghost-written political memoirs -- it details 'just the facts, ma'am, nothing but the facts.'<br /><br />I was relieved to finish it and I was almost disgusted that I took the time to finish it. I kept looking for feelings, about how it felt to live this amazing life, and how it must have felt to be around the geniuses in that band. There was hardly a word about Keith Moon, little more about John Entwhistle (both dead), and little more about Roger Daltry. Perhaps it was honest, but to be truthful, it was downright boring in spots, and I found it almost unforgivable what it omitted. I resented having spent time reading too many details about his business deals, and I was scratching my head about the LACK of details and feelings about the dalliances he included, and also about his marriage and current relationship. After living that life, and all those event-filled years with geniuses, after being around all those women, he still feels closed up as tight as a can of Heinz Baked Beans. Finishing this left me cold, disappointed, filled with compassion, and miffed at what was not covered, and at what was. Pfffffft!

B003GDYN24|5|Kelis has always worked in much the same area as everyone from Miles Davis,Prince and even Todd Rundgren before her in the sense that she has a strong eclectic tack to her music while standing on a very solid ground of her own unique style no matter what she does. What that really means for those who listen to her music is that it can be frusterating to hear one song and one album she does to another crossing so many bridges,especially for those who don't see beneath that down to her powerful,intelligent delivery she's maintained on all of her music. This is a short album,refreshing during a two decade period where so many were intent on filling every last digitally encoded bit on a compact disk. The music is a total rejection of convention hip-hop/R&B hybrids and rather embraces a heavily dance oriented ethic that lies somewhere between the work of Giorgio Moroder,Depeche Mode and Daft Punk-with a little Timbaland thrown in too. On the other hand this is not a gimmicky,noisy production.Multi instrumentalist Damien Leroy and DJ Ammo provide a series of strong Frankie Knuckles style house textures that go as quick as a wink into intense techno beats and often bassy,riffy interludes as well as a decidedly 80's flavor in the production. The two things that are the most impressive about this album are the strengh of the song writing:that sense of constructivism where different melodies are arranged together to form a whole as well as the spacious and broad minded choice of words in Kelis's lyrics,with lyrics mingling personal freedom with the idea of love and romance on \\"4'th Of July (Firewords),\\"22'nd Century\\",\\"Emancipate\\" and the wonderful melodic developement of \\"Acapella\\". These are not songs with singular,easy to follow beats and repetative self centered lyrics full of sexually obvious statements. In every sense this is an album that embraces both the not too distant past,the present and the future musically and in terms of it's lyrical intent it offers thoughtful,poetic viewpoints on romance and the nature of love itself as it might be for the open and empathetic. It will not appeal to everyone accustomed to much of R&B and the like of the past decade or two because it's very much a futurist styled venture. But we all have to remember with artists like Kelis this is something to be expected and respected.ent it offers thoughtful,poetic viewpoints on romance and the nature of love itself as it might be for the open and empathetic.

B003XURDAY|4|Watched it for the first time last week and I was blown away! For a movie that was made in 1982, it was so well done that it rivals modern sci-fi films. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. Star Wars, Blade Runner, Indiana Jones... Harrison Ford was cast in the best films of the decade!

More time developing the boy loves girl, the Father & Son, and the screwed up work relationship would have given this movie more impact.

B00003CXIP|5|Back in my junior year of college (circa 1982) I read a story called The Body by Stephen King that really touched me; I really could relate to the story and the characters.<br /><br />In The Body there's a preteen click of friends very similar to the band of mischief makers that I hung out with in my preteen years (circa 1972). To pass the time, they/we walked the local railroad tracks. They/we smoked cigarettes. They/we got bullied by the neighborhood bullies. They/we did traditional preteen stuff.<br /><br />One day, one of the band of buddies overhears his older brother (a local hoodlum/bully) telling the story of his knowledge of the whereabouts of a dead body. Upon relaying this intrusion to the rest of the click, they all set out on a journey down the tracks to see the body. And ultimately the journey is chock full of events that will stay in the memories of the group forever.<br /><br />So when I heard about 4 years after reading the novella (circa 1986) that Rob Reiner would do a film adaptation of The Body I just knew that it wouldn't...just couldn't...do justice to the book. What film adaptation ever does?<br /><br />Well, Stand By Me does (incidentally, so does Misery; you might say that Reiner is the king of King adaptations).<br /><br />Stand By Me was terrific. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales of growing up as a baby boomer that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).<br /><br />Importantly, the movie really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Body was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the life of some young kids in a small town; Stand By Me is The Body come to life.<br /><br />And kudos to the key young actors (Sutherland, Wheaton, O'Connell, Phoenix and Feldman) for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story, kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today...the world of growing up in the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br /><br />Stand By Me is a collector's item. Add it to your cart.carnations of the characters in King's story, kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today...the world of growing up in the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br /><br />Stand By Me is a collector's item.

If you are new to the Smiths (or maybe have a greatest hits CD), definitely get this.

B00BLCHZC2|5|This show, while not as violent or graphic as Tudors or Spartacus, it is a show that will keep you unable to watch away from great acting, and compelling characters.
B0015UKX7E|5|The ultimate New Year's Eve 1999 party.  The party every Prince fan would have wanted to attend.  Prince is at his very very best.  He was amazing as was Larry Graham and the NPG (Rosie Gaines) and guests Lenny Kravitz - Morris Day & The Time - and other special artists & guests.  Just when you think it was over...Prince grabs you and spins you around for another ride.  He gives you his hits - he sings blues - he does rock. Since I couldn't be there LIVE;  I am so glad that I bought it. I felt like I was there. He is truly amazing...but of course......he is PRINCE..!!!!!
B00BLCHZC2|4|I'm enjoying the show.  My husband doesn't care for it.  Thinks it is a little slow but I like the characters and how things are starting to play out.  I think most season 1 of shows are slow.  They need time to build a back story and make you hungry for more.
B00910Y1OQ|5|very exciting game
B00DR0PDNE|5|Thank you for your promtnes. Awesome device!
B00HMAMM52|4|Liked it
B009LDCZ7I|5|It is one of the most exciting new series made in the last 10 yrs. It is also frightenly believable.
B00DR0PDNE|4|It is good, and makes my TV Smart TV,  The only update I would need it is, Google Chrome should be compatible with IPAD so that we can cast the Chrome....  also not all video types are supported in Chrome presently...  In All Device is good
B00G4SS24I|2|Don't worry about lack of substance or artistry. She's young, hip and almost nude! Apparently, there is also a heavy dose of subliminal mind control going on. And if you play it backwards you can hear &#34;sucker, sucker, sucker.&#34;
B00IJ3ZSFW|5|Listen to all the songs....this is a fantastic purchase.  Support this amazing virtuoso, who knows when another artist like Pharrell will come along.
B00J2PRBNS|3|Good, yet Catastrophically overhiped
B008IJTFYW|5|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B0094BB4TW|1|It was really good until the new update then it stopped letting me go in so I have to go on silk browser good job kindle fire your doing great
B00E9A656K|3|It crashes alot. I got to Tier 3 and... it reset. Not from an update, just randomly. Please fix this.
B003XF1XOQ|4|Wish there was more! Although I was pleased with the ending, I would have liked to have heard more about the changes that took place in the epilogue.
B005HED11Y|5|They wre good in 1968, and they are still.  The remastered quailty just adds to the enjoyment.
B004FRX0MY|5|Love it!

1878424319|4|After reading several reviews on this book, I wondered if I shouuld even write a review.  What can I possibly say that hasn't already said?  But hey, that thought did not keep RUIZ from writing an entire book.  (ha-ha)<br />I actually like this book.  I agree that it did not hold any surprising revelations that completely altered my life.  What it did do is provide a good reminder for ideas I should be practicing, but have been slacking on.  Most people with any self-awareness probably try to practice these agreements.  They are common ideas to any religion.  Ruiz just worded things in a slightly different manner, providing a little freshness.<br />But for some reason, I rushed through this book.  Yes, it's a light read, but was I looking for something meaty?  Those who buy this type of book are usually on some type of spiritual quest.  Having high expectations, looking for something profound that can solve all of life's problems is unreasonable.  This little book was just a reiteration of a lot of common sense.  But hey, with all the negativity in this world, I need that sometimes!
B008NW67E0|3|I was somewhat disappointed in this sophomore release from Mumford and Sons. The songs just didn't have the originality and creativity that the first one did. It's still a decent listen, and there are a couple stand-out tracks, but I wouldn't buy this unless you are already a fan.
B00846REIS|5|I loved the fifty shades of grey series so amazon had this book in my list of books I might like.  I was completely impressed.  Had the book read in a few nights.  Cant wait for book 2!!!!
B00L23RCPU|1|Fell asleep
B005DR64OQ|1|This movie is not worth a minute of your time, but then you should know that already since it has Nicolas Cage in it. If you want to see a movie where everyone in it is as stupid as stupid gets, this would be the movie for you. I can't believe I watched the whole thing in hopes somehow it would get better, what a waste of time,it didn't. I threw it in the trash since I couldn't even think of anyone I disliked enough to give it to, I couldn't do that to anyone. I did learn a lesson though, I never cared for Nicolas Cage movies, but I thought I would give this one a chance since Nicole Kidman is in it (even though she has been in some pretty bad movies). What a mistake, some things never change, if Nicolas Cage is in it, it will suck. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE  The worst rating Amazon will allow is 1 star, I would give it 0 if I could.  Kerry Stansbury
B00ACP3OOM|2|My first unit worked fine for two months, then stopped being recognized by computers. Still charges when plugged into computer but with the wall-charger icon, not the \\"usb connected\\" icon it's supposed to have. So I can still listen to the songs I initially loaded,but can't change them. It's not a computer problem as I've tried it on three different computers with the same result.<br />The Finis site is very frustrating; it says I have to open a support ticket but won't let me actually do it: keeps demanding I register, which I did, then log in, which I do, then says invalid username/password in the support section even though the main site recognizes me. Same result on multiple attempts.<br />So it's usable but can't change songs, and I can't get any help from Finis. Not a very satisfying experience.<br /><br />Update (April 2): I was finally able to contact someone at Finis. After trying and failing everything they suggested to make it work, they had me send it in for replacement at my expense ($9.80).<br />The new unit arrived yesterday. The computer recognized it and songs loaded. However the power button does not work. The screen stays blank no matter how long the button is held (supposed to turn on after 3-4 seconds holding the button.)<br />I again had the exact same problem trying to open another support ticket on Finis' website. It would let me log in to the site, but not to a support ticket; kept saying username and password not recognized even though I was logged into the main site.<br />I have sent an email to my previous contact, now awaiting a reply.<br />This makes two defective units in a row, and I am out the shipping money for the first and probably will be out the same amount for the second. This unit was obviously not tested prior to package and shipping. Finis' quality control process is obviously deficient.<br />I would give up on it entirely were it not for the fact that my first unit did work well for two months and I continue to hope (against the evidence) that I will get a good unit that will work for years. Still, given my experience, I cannot recommmend this product.
B00N45U1MK|5|It's been quite a while since I had my expectations so far exceeded by a movie! Terrific plot! Touches of humor in all the right places, really great action, really good sci-fi!
B000E6UK32|5|Really love the way Debbie Harry works a song.<br />I really wanted the videos, not because the production is great, it isn't.<br />Whoever they had doing most of their videos must have been good at doing something else.<br />I bugs me that one hit wonders often had better video production then Blondie.<br />But I love seeing them work and hearing these songs.<br />A guilty pleasure?
B000SEFNMS|5|I enjoyed the entire heart breaking story!<br />Very well written.  I enjoyed the history of the previuos adventures and their conflicts in life driving them to explore.
B0010SKUYM|3|Enjoyed story very much, but this book was not complete in and of itself.  Ending leaves a number of story lines unresolved. One has to read the next book in series (1000+ pp.) to find out rest of story.
1439102430|4|This book complements the TV show well.  Great story line and unexpected ending, make this entry a good substitute when you are away or just to get more forensic info.
B00008GKEG|5|This is a wonderful set of DVDs! The videos are very clear even though they're vintage. I'm sure I'll watch it many times because it's easy to miss something.
B002PEP4C8|5|This book does not mess around. It starts with a violent rape scene and goes from there into a wonderfully written gem of a book. I loved The Lovely Bones, also written by Sebold, but wasn’t sure what to expect from a memoir by the same author.<br /><br />The part where she was in court being cross-examined was a little tedious, but it was necessary to show the excruciating process she had to go through to bring her rapist to justice. It shows what an inconvenient pain in the butt the whole process is and how you are the one who ends up being treated like the criminal for being rapable (yeah, I made up a new word). It makes sense why most women don’t prosecute.<br /><br />Read my full review here: [...]
B00CY1JUW2|5|this was a gift for my son he loved it also the fast service in receiving the download was great.
B0016B6ZKG|5|First of all I love Miss Donna Summer and the cd is wonderful just like the title of the cd CRAYONS each song is a color........
B003O86FMW|5|Excellent purchase. Thanks for the quick shipment and wonderful service for this book. My daughters love reading this series of books.
B00DH1G7DS|1|Input is cell then number with no way to change it. No options to set up the way you want to play
0736430512|3|Book is good, but binder is so tight, it is hard to turn the pages, especially for young children (like my daughter).
020530902X|5|I have no idea how many copies of this book I've bought over the years - but I never regret spending the $$$ to re-buy! As an author, I don't know how I'd get by without Elements of Style. And most recently, I used it while writing a style guide for a client of mine. If you write for a living or write occasionally for business, make this a MUST HAVE in your library. But don't lose yours as often as I've lost mine.
B004G600A4|5|I've been disappointed with most of the movies they've released in recent years.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and my wife likes it a lot too.  It has a good sense of humor and is appropriate for younger viewers, which sadly is not true of many of the animated movies these days.
B00GEEB730|5|Loved the character and story.
B002VPE1B6|5|A fine film beautifully rendered on 2-D Blu-ray. No need to have a 3-D version, when the image quality is like this. Good story, too. And a good price!
B000K4X5XA|5|I love the original Superman with Christopher Reeves, better than any of the new ones.  Charming
B0013LPS8E|4|Esta grabación contiene temas muy buenos del grupo, un sonido único y para tener como colección de un seguidor de estos grandes músicos.
B009HUB40Y|4|I really enjoy this group I just wish you got more lives in a shorter amount of  time. All in all it is fun though.
B0054JZC6E|4|This app is wonderful,  I just love love love this app! I like all the different games that are available!
B00005JKJA|5|Mulholland Drive is a multilevel masterpiece that I enjoy again and again. Own the movie so that you can appreciate its puzzles, artistry, dream symbols, unforgettable characters, and commentaries on the nature of film-making, the nature of evil,  and the mysterious connection between our inner and unconscious worlds and external reality. It will provoke emotions ranging from pathos to funny/funny. Naomi Watts gives an unforgettable performance surrounded by marvelous performances. If you watch this movie once and emerge totally confused, don't dispair! There are excellent explanatory reviews that can give you the basic roadmap from dream to reality. If you need help, read a couple of reviews, but find your own meaning! Once you understand that the first part of the movie is dream/delirium you will probably quickly perceive how the dream frays and then breaks, and the main features fall pretty simply into place.  If that doesn't work, try Blue Velvet. If you love it, don't hesitate to watch Lost Highway, and on the 13th floor you will finf Inland Empire. Mulholland Drive is a great movie to share. It is a love story. My wife does agree that Winkie's = Denny's but I will never be able to convince her that the evil-personifying \\"man\\" behind Winkie's is actually Diane Selwyn's dream substitute for her horrid former roommate. And that is perfectly OK.
B00A3NQNUU|5|This is my FAVORITE game on my kindle fire! I reccomend this game very much to all people who like a relaxing game. P.S. A LOT better than dragon story.
B002OR0RP0|1|Trite.  Predictable.  Wearisome.  But my 7 year old loves it.
0060776579|5|Harv Eker has hit the \\"nail on the head\\" with this exciting, upbeat, and challenging \\"How to\\" for those of us that want to break out of the poor mentality. I have read many books on this subject but Harv brings new insights into a well writen about arena. He has \\"passion\\" about his ideas and suggestions for mastering the inner game of Wealth. My wife and I have both read this book and go back and re-read many time. Good STUFF!!
B008UCJ7KO|5|I love Gideon and Eva, I just wish the next book was here already! I hate waiting!! This series is better written than 50 Shades,but the same appeal. Love it!
B00KFVE4B0|5|Well written and acted!!!
B000B8QEZG|4|Sure the lyrics are on the weak side and the themes are the same thing she's been going on about since Ray Of Light, but at least she has a message unlike most of her peers (i.e., Mariah, Kylie, etc.) The album was marketed as a message free dance-a-thon but that is not the case. Most of the songs are pretty dancey but not a lot is out and out dance. And the last half is centered around her views of fame, family, kabballocks, and what not. <br /> <br />This record is certainly a step up from American Life. While AL wasn't a bad album it was lacking in melody and memorable hooks that COADF has in abundance. Though I really wish she'd get over this minimalist kick she got on with Music and start writing better lyrics again. Oh well. <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Get Together,\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are a pop gold trilogy. \\"Future Lovers\\" is a grower while \\"I Love New York\\" is a rocking tune if you ignore the lyrics (york/dork, mad/sad/glad). \\"Let It Will Be\\" can be a bit plodding at first but really builds and takes off. \\"Forbidden Love,\\" \\"Jump,\\" and \\"How High\\" are the second trilogy. All single worthy. \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Push\\" are growers to but take effort to really appreciate. That guy on Isaac is irksome to me and Push is a bit to Gwenish. \\"Like It Or Not\\" finishes off a fine album, maybe some questionable couplets, but a good song. Oh I forgot to mention the vocoder/robo singing effects are perfection. <br /> <br />The Queen is back and looking sexy in leotards.
B000001EUR|5|&quot;Love at First Sting&quot; is with &quot;In Trance&quot; and &quot;Fly to the rainbow&quot; the best album of Scorpions.

054579191X|5|This is a great looking set. Shiny, well bound, dark print. All you could ask for out of a book.
0446401307|5|I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through.  It is great!
B003JTHXOK|5|Nicholas Sparks writes such beautiful stories. Loved this one. I am not great a writing reviews. However, I will just state I read this book in two sittings. It's been a long time since a book captivated my attention so singularly.
0451450523|5|Being such a fan of fantasy novels, I can't believe I just recently stumbled upon the book. This is such a gem; it is such a sweet reminder of the magic inside all of us. Whatever your age it will give you a sense of child-like wonder.
0375703764|4|I enjoyed this book, it was unique in it's style and content. There is a lot to learn from the \\"house\\" and it's inhabitants. I would recommend skipping the foot notes, they can slow you down, and be distracting - maybe that's the point.
1451695195|5|Everone should read this book. It's very comforting. My husband and I have seen the author interviewed on tv and he seems to be a sincere person. His perpective as a scientist is very interesting.
B00WKMP722|1|It only worked once after I've installed it.. if I open it, it doesn't want to load and just disappears like I've cancelled it.
B006YTTVHO|1|no
B0090P98Z4|5|I love this game great for the tablet and easy to learn how to play. I give it 5 star ratings
B0099Y2MYK|5|I had already seen season 1 and 2 and so as soon as I could, I ordered season 3.  Am looking forward to next year when I can get season 4.
B0091QSNEE|5|You really cant go wrong with Dr Panda. Both my kids love all of the apps (3 and 9 year olds) and I even find myself playing these with them. They are fun, great graphics and they learn from them.
B0055SWM08|5|great game with smooth graphics. nice pasttime trying to figure out the puzzles. makes you think other than just brainless shoot em up games
B0094M2ITG|5|Love this movie!
031606792X|5|One of the best books that I have read.  The story is great and you will love the Characters!!
0451204530|5|This book was so interesting trying to figure out who Luke was and what happened to turn his friends against him. So much at stake. I really cared about the characters. It kept going back to the fifties when everyone was young, so I couldn't wait to find out what had happened in the past and what was at stake in the future. And I didn't expect such a great romance. This book had everything!
B000003TAR|5|Sadly this is Nirvana's last studio album. Imagine if other great bands like the Beattles, Doors, Led Zeppelin, Ramones, U2, or Pearl Jam only had 2 major albums and you realize what a true loss losing Kurt was for all of us. Enough speculation on what might have been, instead let us celebrate what we do have. In Utero is simply a great album. I love the raw emotions from the over the top aggression to the soft melodies.  This album truly has it all. Nirvana is my favorite band. Kurt's words and the bands music spoke to me like no other band has been able to do. If you have Nevermind or Unplugged than you will like this album.<br />1. Serve the Servants. 9/10 Gets the album off to a great start. Good Guitars and drums good lyrics about fame and his father.<br />2. Scentless Apprentice. 10/10 A hard driving drumbeat starts this off then the pounding guitars open up. Kurt's screams are amazing as is this song.<br />3. Heart Shaped Box. 10/10 One of the best songs ever. Starts off with soft melodic guitars before your speakers get blown out.<br />4. Rape Me. 9/10 An amazing antirape song.<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle. 8/10 The weakest song on the album but it still is a really good song. The chrous of &quot;I miss the comfort in being sad&quot; is extra heart wrenching in light of Kurt's death.<br />6. Dumb. 9/10 Soft, acoustic song with often funny lyrics. Good change of pace from the other harder faster songs before it.<br />7. Very Ape. 9/10 The only problem with this one is it is too short.<br />8. Milk It. 10/10 I love the drum sound and the song breaks.<br />9. Penny Royal Tea. 10/10 This is often my favorite Nirvana song (it rotates). The quiet verses once again are complemented by loud choruses. The Guitar solo is awesome.<br />10. Radio Friendly Music Shifter. 10/10 At first I didn't like this song because of its abrassive use of feedback. After a few listens I realized how original and great this song is.<br />11. Tourettes. 8/10 Really good short punk raver.<br />12. All Apologies. 10/10 Another great song and fan favorite.<br />Nirvana changed the world and certainly changed me. I hope you get this album (and all their others) and let them change you.
B00BB8SKPW|3|was somewhat long winded, not what I would go to the movies to see. acting was less than expected from Denzel
B009NQKXYK|2|Watch Alien, now watch Prometheus.  Beyond the great cast and expensive effects, this film is let down by a wafer thin plot and poor direction.  It just doesn't have the excitement, pacing, or character development of Alien to which it was often compared.
0399247459|5|The book integrated numbers and nature.  For instance, the readers can learn the first few numbers using the book.  In addition, they can learn that caterpillars eat so that they can become a beautiful butterfly.  Moreover, young readers learn that what we consider destruction is part of nature.  In other words, if the caterpillar does become very hungry, he cannot become what he's suppose to be.  Most important, if children are not hungry for knowledge, they can't become what they suppose to become-butterflies
B00000DFSK|5|Having recently been lucky enough to see U2 at home in Ireland on the Elevation Tour (at Slane Castle), I just want to emphasise how brilliant they are live, and on this cd. Most of these songs were performed at the concert, and listening to the cd, you don't think they can sound any better... but they do when you hear them live in an open field full of 85 000 die-hard Irish fans. (who know every breath, guitar riff and word) =)<br />So buy this cd, and begin to experience their pure talent and utter genius- evident on songs such as the perfect 'With Or Without You', the haunting yet serene 'All I Want Is You', the mesmerising 'Where The Streets Have No Name' (brilliant, although Bono hates its beginning) and the best anthem ever, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. Once you have heard this collection of songs, you will HAVE to see them live to experience them in an even better way. The only downfall will be that it cannot last forever. =)
B00000HYXB|5|There is no other word to describe this album. This album has become my favorite metal album. A friend mentioned it to me and I have since bought all of Blind Guardian's other CD's. This one is the best. It is full of  complex and lush guitar arrangements that are well accompanied by the  drums, bass and other effects such as piano and flute. The vocals are  nothing short of incredible. Hansi has an incredible voice and the choruses  are unbelievable. Top this off with the story of J.R.R. Tolkien's  Silmarillion and you have something that is Majestic.
0156027321|5|I have already reviewed this item once.hERE are thirteen more words for you to ponder on what you did wrong.

B004GJDQT8|5|Just what I was looking for.  Received on time avd packaged so item would not be damaged.
B003Y5H5EW|5|Had to watch it twice before i finally got all of it.  After watching the<br />second time and understood what was going on I loved it.  Hope the<br />do a sequel to this movie.
0312321376|5|This book takes you methodically through individual cases of early childhood memories of past lives.  These cases are thoroughly and professionally documented, researched and objectively judged as plausible or not...all in a scientific manner.  More compelling proof that reincarnation exists.
B000PC0S5K|5|Eckhart Tolle has taken old truths and written them in a very fluid, easily understandible fashion.  No, we don't need to read the old sacred spiritual texts.  He describes why and how we add to our own suffering, and what we can do to lessen it.  Once you have gone through this, and you may wish to purchase the Power Of Now (his first blockbuster book),  your way of thinking, looking at the world, looking at yourself, and seeing what really matters most in life will be changed profoundly.  This is the perfect book for a book club, where the members are interested in spirituality, finding an easier/better/more compassionate & meaningful way to live. It's the kind of book where you read a few paragraphs and sit with what you just read. In the book club, it is wonderful to discuss those few paragraphs or a chapter, at a time.  People never tire of re-reading Eckhart's books.  I know people who are back to reading the Power of Now for the third time and A New Earth for the second.  I am one of them.
B00CHI5B7A|5|Perfect
B00BIPCY14|5|This show is not run of the mill. It cannot be classified into just one thing. Not just a court drama, not just political. Although some may say that all things are political, personal issues are not. This plot delves deeply into peoples' personal beliefs, biases, fears, ignorance, and strengths, all while offering an objective awareness of this world's human brokenness. Some may be offended by certain narratives concerning Christ, homosexuality, race, gender, lasciviousness etc., but The Good Wife sustains objectivity and tact in its presentation and entertainment. People who chose to enjoy drama may be influenced by any possible hidden or blatant agendas to influence thinking in any venue, but this series at least gives ones' intelligence and beliefs the courtesy of respect. This show is awesome! Definite 'page turner'!
B003UYUR0G|5|Love it
B007IXWKUK|5|I personally liked this better than the first book. It was more about their relationship. If you liked the first book I highly recommend this one.

1597801585|5|This science fiction novel, set in the not too distant future, has as its backdrop an environmentally ravaged, highly dystopian Thailand.  In this future, biogenetics have run wild, unleashing a plague of viruses and biological scourges, leading to worldwide famine and a breakdown in societies.  Carbon based fuels have run their course and energy is largely based upon power generated by human beings and beasts of burden (for example, treadle powered computers).<br /><br />In this world, generators and distributors of nourishment hold all the power (calorie companies).  Biogenetics is key to developing new food strains that are resistant to the many plagues that have destroyed most of the known crop sources.<br /><br />This novel bears a striking resemblance to Ian Macdonald's River of Gods, though I found this to be quite a bit easier and more enjoyable to follow.  Both feature a dystopian society set in a third world environment (Macdonald in India).  Where River of Gods foresaw a society rich in technology, particularly in the area of bioengineered life forms, the society in The Windup Girl has virtually collapsed.  Any technology found in this novel is in the bioengineering needed to ensure an adequate and safe food supply.<br /><br />As power sources have largely disappeared, and nourishment is dangerously scarce, the balance between the energy necessary to physically produce power, and the energy available from the scarce food supply is the key to survival.  As a result, the calorie is largely the measure of wealth and power.<br /><br />The characters in the novel are rich and well developed.  The \\"calorie company\\" agent, the windup girl (an archaic, cr&egrave;che grown life form), the yellow card man (Chinese refugee), the Dung King (think Master Blaster from Thunderdome) all play pivotal roles within the framework of the story.  Particularly interesting is the tension and conflict present between the Thai kingdom's ministries of Environment and Trade.  In the face of worldwide epidemics and famine, the Environmental ministry (the white shirts) held absolute sway and were rabid and uncompromising in their isolation and protection of the Thai sovereignty.  Now, however, international trade has reemerged and the moneyed interests have begun to reopen the borders to immigration and the import of potentially dangerous goods and food stuffs.<br /><br />This is a fantastic novel.  It is highly original in its vision of what environmental degradation and unrestricted bio-engineering could bring in the near future, without being overly \\"preachy\\" or pedantic.  It simply provides the resulting landscape, peoples it with fascinating characters and tells an engaging story.  Highly recommended.amine, the Environmental ministry (the white shirts) held absolute sway and were rabid and uncompromising in their isolation and protection of the Thai sovereignty.

B00005JLEU|5|Hello reader,<br /><br />I selected standard shipping for this movie, about 5-7 business days, and it arrived in 2. The case was still wrapped, and the disk was in perfect condition. It worked out of the box. Amazon made my purchase easy and delivered with incredible speed.<br /><br />As for the movie, it is a visual masterpiece and will sweep you up. Miyazaki shows all of his skills with this one. If you enjoy beautiful animation, great fantasy stories, or simply a fun adventure with interesting characters, this is for you (though in my opinion, everyone should see it at least once).
B00JB3MVCW|1|I just can't believe that anyone would attempt to pass this off as something from the Bible. It was ridiculous!
B001KR0BDI|5|I will definitely read this story over and over again and I look forward to more of Kristin Cashore's stories.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I was not forewarned as to the plot of this book so I'm glad that I had my cats with me to SPOILER ALERT comfort me as things got tough about halfway through. I was a wreck. I was fascinated how Green approaches a teenage relationship with such a fresh perspective and makes it real and not cheap or stereotypical when Twilight has cheapened true love a bit for us.
B006LSZECO|5|It has been a long time since I found a book this suspenseful.  Is it great literature?  No.  But, wow, is it a great vacation/summer beach read.
B008IJTFYW|5|Since I started using this program I fall asleep faster and sleep better longer. Wonderfully relaxing and I love how you can adjust the sound elements.<br /><br />It would be cool if you could save said combinations to a favourites or something.
B004SI663A|5|Anyone who watches his show knows he is more than just a comedian.  He has a lot of social commentary and reflections on living on both sides of the pond.  He also does not glaze over his own weaknesses and shortcomings.
B009ZZDNT6|5|This app is awesome. Are you noting this. Ahem well that's all except that you need to upgrade it to put music in your alarm. note this all please as I said on top thank you. Wait and I recommend this for the readers who are suppose to note this. Ahem well that all bye.<br /><br />Note please!!!!! :)

B001AII4RM|4|I could barely get through this book in college and while enough summaries of the movie have already been written, I will just say that the film does take a great many liberties with the characters and storyline.  The rest of this review will focus solely upon actual video and audio quality of the blu ray.<br /><br />VIDEO....<br />  Deliberately so, the film uses a rich and warm color palate highly CGI'd throughout the film.  The CGI is not just for the many special effects but the actors themselves have had a cartooning filter placed upon them for an animated look.  The blacks do go deep and contrast is quite excellent even in the softer and darker scenes.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low 30's.  At no point did I see any artifacting or resolution noise.  Being wholly CGI, you wouldn't expect any film issues since all is digital and, with this film on Blu Ray, you don't get any.<br />  Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV  monitor you are using and its accompanying  home theater processor and speakers.  I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.<br /><br />AUDIO....<br />  The film does default to a lossy audio codec so before watching the film, go to 'Set Up' and change the audio setting to the lossless 5.1 Dolby True HD audio setting.  The audio does make decent use of your surround system with all encompassing audio soundtrack.  However, there is really not a whole lot of discreet channeling to the individual front or rear speakers.  There is some but not as much as I expected.<br /><br />EXTRAS...<br />  There are plenty of quality extras included on the disc; there are various 'Making of' docs focusing upon special fx creation, costuming, the art of making and producing the film, some deleted scenes in HD and more.  Also included is an Ultra Violet version of the theatrical release.  I would rather have the choice to download to iTunes as I really do not like UV but it is what it is.<br /><br />While I am glad I found this for only 7.99, I do not think I will be watching it too often nor using it for a demo disc to show off my theater.  I do hope that this review has been of some HELP  to you in deciding your purchase.  All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the actual disc and not redundant summaries and acting opinions.<br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Okay folks, as much as I hate UV, I went to log in  and download the film any way.  It said that my email address is invalid.  It is the only one I have ever had and it was typed in correctly.  I contacted customer service with a message that there was a problem and today received this email from them<br /><br /> \\"Hello,<br />Based on the issue type you selected, we assume that you are having trouble remembering your UltraViolet login credentials.

B003UESJ9M|3|This movie was okay but a little on the slow side. Gweneth Paltro was definitely not the main person in this movie. It was the other girl. Much better actress. Overall all not a bad movie for country fans.
B000005QH3|5|This is a classic movie that is as much social commentary as car chase.  I remember watching this on a Saturday matinee on my local television station (long before the advent of cable television) and was mesmerized.<br />I recently purchased the VHS version and it was just as sweet twenty years later.<br />The premise isn't much: the main character, former member of society now riding on the fringe, has to get a car to San Francisco in 15 hours.  Load up on amphetamines and off we go.  The 'plot' is merely a vehicle for the ride.    <br />The car chase scenes are great and realistic (none of the special effects laden hocus pocus you see today) and the cinematography of the West is beautiful.  The characters, from the DJ who plays mystical guide to the helpers the driver meets in the desert, show life on the fringe.  I'm sure on some level this is a mystical, metaphorical journey of sorts but to me it is simply fun to watch.<br />The soundtrack is absolutely great.  It is kind of the O Brother Where Art Thou of the 70s -- the one that missed the radar.  It isn't music you hear on the radio and it certainly isn't mainstream in any fashion but it sure is good.  <br />I give this five stars quite simply because of the cinematography, the cast of characters and the music.  Well worth the visit.  They just don't make films like this anymore.
B00HEPDLFK|5|Great
B003UESJHY|5|This is a very good movie I love this movie I've only seen it five or six times I buy all my movies from Amazon
B005CRQ4XI|5|Cheryl Strayed is my kind of writer.  Her writing style reminds me of Hemingway's, that is, direct dialogue and commentary with very little use of metaphors. She talks to me directly, succinctly, with humor, without embarrassment or excuses or blame; no whining this author. That is a quality of writing that I find so difficult and so rewarding.  I read her book in two sittings and I wanted more.  I look forward to reading the best essays of 2013.
B004YXE438|4|This app is easy to use and enjoyable to play. The images available are pleasing to the eye and just challenging enough.
B0001UL7RY|5|I hear people tell me all the time how they think Avril's a poser and her music sucks.  But hey people lets be real, what she sings about is true and meaning full.  She's also not a poser either, she does her own thing, she's creative.  Just because she doesn't wear low riding jeans or low cut shirts doesn't mean her music isn't as good as Britney Spears (who everbody in the world loves)  Britneys old news, we need something new and Avril's got it!!! By the way go out and buy her 2 cd Under my skin.  It's really good and maybe you'll give her a second chance after all she is only trying to  entertain you anyways!
0064430170|5|Love this book! My kids got this when they were babies and now they are 8 and 10 and we still love to cuddle up and read it!
B007FEFLTO|4|I CHOSE THIS BECAUSE I HADREAD THE FIRST OF THE TRILOGY  AND LIKED IT VERY MUCH.  THIS<br />ONE WAS OKAY, 'THO NOT QUITE AS GOOD.  I PROBABLY WILL READ THE 3RD ONE HOWEVER.
0060537639|3|I received my second MA in Chinese history back in 1998, and I spent 20 years recording history books for a blind history professor. My chief paper at school was precisely the Ming voyages and why they were discontinued; my main sources were Louise Levathes's &quot;When China Ruled the Seas&quot; and Mark Elvin's &quot;The Pattern of the Chinese Past&quot;. My reaction to Menzies is that first I wouldn't accept uncritically all his assertions; I've been around long enough to know that authors sometimes fudge their data to support their pet thesis. But on the other hand, I wouldn't dismiss his book out of hand either. He's stated his thesis and now it's up to the scholarly community either to confirm it or to refute it. It's interesting that Levathes has already panned the book in a review that she wrote for the Washington Post; she based her criticism on what is already known about the Ming voyages. But I sincerely doubt that hers will be the last word.
B0050DIWFC|5|I cannot say enough about this book.  It was so cleverly written.  I could not put it down from the time I started to read it.  Can't wait to read more from this author.  This book has everything you could want in a story wrapped up into one.
B000FVE3BG|5|Muy bueno<br /><br />Gracias !!
B00AQ3K8IU|1|An infantile romance rag with trite sexual descriptions.<br />This was recommended when I purchased the Dragon Tattoo series and I don't understand why someone thinks this book is of a genre that relates to those three books?
B00A3NQNUU|5|Fun<br />Great enjoy it and love the game hi bye stop the pie ha ha ha hahaha haha ha ha ha ha ha ha
B004UUKDNA|5|First heard FosterThePeople during The Today Show.  Was so impressed with the music that I purchased Torches.  The album is really great.  The songs are uplifting and filled with energy.  Also appreciate the complexity of the music, which has the potential to become classic.
B001NY42KQ|5|I think this is the best of the \\"High School Musical\\" films - mainly because of the detailed dance scenes. I like the extended additon because of the special features and the sing-along. Worth the price, especially considering the regular prices in the stores.
B005DJREGQ|5|mesmerizing.  I find in her place...feeling and seeing what she sees.  The writer is insightful...I am finding myself better able to describe what is going on around me more creatively!
B000065K6N|5|I love this movie!!! It runs smoothly. I've had no problem playing it.
B00BVYNSLC|3|A new edge.
B000LPQ6DE|5|I'm not one for writing long reviews, but if you're given to an appreciation of 19th century authors, period films, and Toby Stephens...this is a \\"must see.\\"    It's excellent.
B000SEGUDE|4|If you enjoyed 1Q84 by Murakami, read Cloud Atlas.  It combines just enough magic realism, sci-fi, and classic literature to meet the avid reader's needs.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Really like this story. My daughter and I are reading it together and we like all of the characters. She reads the books and I read from the Kindle.
B00CSCJ09K|5|as always I found it very enjoyable
B001MSMULG|5|classic Silva-fast paced and gripping throughout.He's the best of the genre.
B00821OX98|3|It's a good show. A cross between V and Walking dead. So far I've enjoyed it. It could use some better character development though.
B004MC8CA2|5|Great bible app!

B004EV38JQ|5|This book was recommended to me, and I got it for my grand daughter. We love reading it together any time we have a chance, and talk about it in our every day life.
B00W6XM002|5|I was checking everyday for this to be available on my Kindle. Finally. Yay. This game is a lot of fun to play.
B00IRISI42|5|Plan on reading this quickly.  Can't put it down.  One of Baldacci's best in quite a while.  He was in a slump not now.
B00G7QPYX4|3|So So movie.  Didn't like the ending
B005GFPZYK|5|It's not every book that is able to pull you through every emotion, but this definitely did. By the end, it was as if an old friend was talking. Thank you Chris Kyle for my reenergized patriotism, respect for the troops, and sharing your views.
B0074MZSPO|5|I recently purchased this album on vinyl and have not stopped playing it for several weeks now!  The guitar work is very rich and well recorded and mixed, and her vocals are incredible.  The band sounds a lot like the Black Keys and then add in Brittany's soulful voice and it is magical!  Can not recommend this album enough.  Every song is good, and on vinyl, the sound quality is amazing.
B006LSZECO|4|I found this book to be a very good well written mystery. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama.
B00J3AW23G|4|Picked this up for free. Have been enjoying it. It's simple and a great time kill.
B00069FLC2|4|Taped in Cardiff. Released (by Silver Eagle) in the U.S.!  <br /> <br />All the Shads things you'd expect; a few you might not; a couple of Crosby, Stills & Farrar* songs; some they recorded with Cliff. Keyboards for the most part mixed way down (who wants keyboards on a Shadows record?). red Fender Telecaster and white Burns Bison electric guitars**; acoustic on some numbers; a few vocals. <br /> <br />Also included is an about 40-minute interview with Bruce, Hank and Brian. Did'ja know that the idea of \\"steps\\" was appropriated from The Treniers? That McCartney pitched them \\"Here, There and Everywhere,\\" then reneged? That Jimmy Page plays harmonica on \\"Time Drags By\\"? That Tony Meehan's departure saved Brian from the pit band of \\"Stop the World\\"? All here and much more. <br /> <br />The tune listing is from the CD, but it's identical. <br /> <br />Disc: 1 <br />1. Intro - Apache Medley <br />2. Riders In The Sky <br />3.

The micing is very tight, so it sounds more like a studio set than your typical \\"live\\" rock concert. I like the way it is, where you can hear everyhing, The audience, most of whom probably grew up with the Shads, aren't particularly demonstrative, though they seem to be having a good time -- rattling their walkers, waving their canes in the air, etc.***.  <br /> <br />* note: joke <br />** this is important to some of us <br />*** another joke
B00B4804KS|5|Great movie great price fast shipping
B003JTHXOK|4|I really liked the book. Couldnt put it down. Although storyline is very much like the Anna Quindlan book Black and Blue. Both books are excellent.
B00EOARZ4G|4|Even tough the late Tom Clancy writes fiction, this book truly predicted current events.<br />Great novel!!!<br />Clancy never dissapoints !

B001TH16DS|3|I've been a fan of Star Trek, the Original Series since the show first aired. For my money, there's no better Starship captain than James T. Kirk. Sure, they were hokey episodes. I always laugh when someone, usually Scotty, would grab what appeared to be a wrench when he crawls under a supposedly futuristic, ultra-high tech instrument panel to fix something gone awry. And don't even get me started about the incredibly low-tech monsters and special effects that graced the show.    Still, when I think of Star Trek, I think of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and the rest of the Original Series gang. It didn't matter to me that things looked hokey. That added to the show's charm.    With the advent of Blu-ray, I couldn't wait to see my favorite sci-fi series married to the most advanced viewing medium yet invented.    Imagine my disappointment when the first season of Star Trek arrived and I saw a better picture, yes, but also an icon in the upper right of my TV screen that told me I could watch the low-tech special effects if I clicked the \\"Angle\\" button on my Blu-ray players remote. After spending two hours searching the Internet, reading posts, perusing reviews, and discovering -- much to my dismay -- that the icon can't be turned off! There it is, in every episode, distracting the hell out of me, taunting me from its perch. What Einstein designed that?    On top of that, the enhanced special effects look *more* hokey than what the series originally offered. They look cheesy, as if they're from a 90s computer game. The Enterprise looks absolutely plastic and, worse, lifeless. Some of the sets also appear to be newly built, digitally. I'm not 100% sure about that. But they sure do look odd compared to everything else, like they exist as CGI. So they, too, look \\"fake\\" (as if I was ever fooled into thinking sets on the original series were \\"real\\").     To make matters worse, the sound is dodgy. On some episodes, I have to turn up the volume extremely high to hear what's going on. Then, when the show ends and it returns to the main menu, the sound blasts me out of my seat. To get better sound, I have to flip the switch to \\"Mono\\" so that the sound is more focused and balanced in the center-channel speaker. So I can't even use the setting the BD player automatically chooses based on the type of signal it's getting from the discs themselves. What's up with that?    Is it my equipment? I don't think so. I have a brand-new Philips 42\\" TV with 50,000:1 dynamic contrast. Even 70-year-old movies like Gone With the Wind are so crisp it's like watching real people out of a window. My receiver is brand-new as well. It's an Onkyo that makes everything sound terrific. The speakers? They're B&Ws, wonderful speakers. The Blu-ray player is also a brand-new item, a Philips.    So, with all of that equipment, most of it brand new, I should be able to enjoy Star Trek: Original Series, Season One with no problem. But I can't. Between the sound -- that fluctuates between horrible and so-so -- and that darn \\"Angle\\" icon that I can't make go away, I'm irritated beyond belief. (For the record, I own a few dozen Blu-ray discs, the images on which range from 1939 to 2010. I don't have these problems on any other Blu-ray.)    The picture, although much improved (and, boy, does Spock's make-up look strange with such on-screen clarity!), does not offset the rest of the problem I've encountered.    I've watched a half dozen episodes so far. I'm not sure I'm enjoying this experience enough to buy Season Two and Season Three, as much as I love those original episodes.     My advice to anyone considering this set is to think long and hard about it. The two main reasons to buy Blu-ray are (1) picture enhancement, and (2) sound enhancement. Star Trek: Original Series Blu-ray blows it with both. So what's to gain by buying the Blu-rays? I'm not sure yet.    So the choice is yours. Remember: Caveat emptor.
0783204914|5|This was the first Al Pachino movie I have ever seen,  and I fell in love with him, his acting was fantastic and it is no wonder he won the academy award for his acting. His protrayal of a recently blind &quot;war&quot;  hero,  it was classic. This bitter man stirs up all kind of emotions in us  as we see him shut everyone out of his life,  like his neice who takes care  of him despite the unkind treatment she  rechieves from him. But lets not  give Pacino all the credit because Chris O'Donnel was also really good. His  protrayal of a timid prep school student employed to watch a blind bitter  man for thanksgiving because he could not afford to go home, well it's  excellent,  which is saying alot considering he had to act with the  greatest actor.  Like come on no one can convince me that the hotel room  sence with the gun and the &quot;trial&quot; scene back at the school  weren't two of the most moving scenes in movie history. I truly think that  one could not have done it.  Well lets could you imageine this movie with  Leoardo DiCaprio,  and Dan Akrod instead,  yeah right.
B0098460O4|5|These 2 young singers are going to have a Wonderful Singing Career ahead of them. Their voices complement each other so well and to listen to them you would never think such powerful voices could come out of such young people. When they open their mouths it's as if Total Beauty is escaping their lips. Truly Wonderful.
B002VRZEYM|5|loved it, very informative. It was one of those messages that most don't want to hear, but need to hear.
B00A6CCF0K|4|Good \\"whatever happened to..\\" story. Anticipated Danny would have a troubled life after the Overlook ended. Strong New shining introduced, not the greatest villain to go up against.  Good read. On to the next.
B00IG2DOKM|5|Love this game ,and as a result of having played this game on Facebook ,have learned to utilize the expansion aspect. The game holds your attention,wanting you to come back for more.
B000W8HC8I|5|I'm a sucker for great memoirs, nonfiction and this is right up there with some of the best I've ever read. I first heard about this when I saw the trailer for the movie directed by Scorsese, starring DiCaprio. Then as I started looking into the story i became very intrigued with it. So i purchased the book and I'm so glad I did. Great story and I would say great characters, but they are all real people. Really shows how for some people money can be everything and how it can cost them everything in the end. Bits of Wall Street and bits of Less Than Zero.
B001VB8UAE|5|It is true that Barbra's voice has changed over time.  In the 2006 concert DVD you will notice that her range is lower and there is, at times, some hoarseness, which I did not notice at the two concerts that I attended.  Nevertheless, it is still a remarkable instrument and her interpretive abilities are in full force.  If in doubt, simply listen to \\"Unusual Way\\".  I recently attended a Celine Dion concert and, although her voice is in top form, as an audience member, I did not feel a connection to her singing.  When Barbra sang \\"People\\" at the St. Paul concert, I was astounded at her ability to deliver this song to the audience after 40 years of singing it.  She simply touched us all at the level of Soul.    In the 1994 concert DVD, Barbra was in top vocal form.  I especially recommend the 1994 concert CD which is taken from her New York performance.  Her rendition of \\"My Man\\" from that concert is vocally stunning.    Well my friends, I think that this 2006 concert DVD is Barbra's swan song, at least in terms of singing concerts.  So don't be overly critical; simply watch and enjoy one of the greatest performers to ever grace the stage.  When will we see the likes of talent like this again?
B008ZVJE3A|4|Good comedic movie  with cameo appearances by many stars.
B00IRISI42|5|Another captivating Baldacci novel.

B009NFHF0Q|1|A story about a boy growing up with some abuse from his father. After reading 70% of the book I gave up on trying to find a theme or any redeeming value to this fantasy.
0061150142|5|\\"The Pact\\" by Jodi Picoult is one of those books that you will never forget.  Picoult points to what True Love should be about, along with examples of soulmates- how far would you go to make the one you love happy?  At what point do you say, \\"Enough about what you want, what about what I want?\\"<br />This is a story about suicide vs. murder.  It's a hard topic to discuss, but as Picoult often does- she flourishes with its descriptions and jumbles your mind - causing you to always second guess your original answers.<br />Picoult's story is wonderful. It has stayed with me for the past six months since I've read it.  It's one of those books that you want others to read, but you don't want to lend it out at the chance of never seeing it again.
B009D0LBRO|5|This is a great running game with almost safe to say best graphics&sound out in the market.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, difficulty is alright. It's not impossible to beat every single level with perfect score.<br /><br />it is worth every single penny.<br /><br />I've been looking people complain about this game is not story line game like other Rayman series is..<br />I don't know how people would just spend their precious money without viewing or researching a single video of what they are paying for.<br /><br />Their are tons and TONS of videos and reviews of this game. You should have checked before you actually PURCHASE (means PAYING for) it.<br /><br />Please stop complaining about how this game is designed and how it does not fulfill your needs. This game is meant to be like this and it's your fault that you purchased it without looking at anything.<br />Reviews and sneak peaks about this game was out for weeks ago before this game released.<br /><br />Please consider what you are paying for if you have any concern about your money.
B00L23RZO8|4|Visually a feast but the character development was subtle and lingering in what, at first glance, seems like a zany fantasy.
1616550414|5|A book collection undoubtedly spectacular, with all the magic world of The Legend of  Zelda, thanks for all Shigeru Miyamoto
B00ESNE696|5|One of the best tv series we've ever watched. Huge fan of Seinfeld, West Wing, Dexter, etc. this tops them all!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Omg I love this game!!! I could play this all day every day very addictive!!!!! All my friends and family have this game and when one of us is stuck on a level we egg each other on! Also to see who gets the higher score!!
B00HBQWGXK|2|To wordy
B00IRISI42|5|Great story. Well worth reading
B009VIZDLI|4|Absolutely loved it . I loved the way Don expressed himself - I found it so funny, with his excessive use of the English language - almost robot-like. I didnt want the book to finish and was left in the dark somewhat about who Rosie's dad actually was. I deducted it must be Phil afterall. Would highly recommend it.
B000001GXJ|5|I first heard this opera purely by chance one day while scanning through the radio dial in my car.  It was playing on National Public Radio one morning and as soon as I heard the music I was hooked.  This is the most beautiful piece of music I've ever listened to.  It is amazing to me that this opera has remained so obscure to the general public.  In fact, until I stumbled across it playing on the radio I had never even heard of the title.  I have been a Jose Carreras fan for quite sometime and when I decided to purchase this opera on CD I deliberately searched for a version with him on it.  I read several of the other reviews on Amazon before purchasing it and I have not been disappointed.  The best surprise for me was when I heard the other singers on this recording.  Freni is excellent. I honestly can not think of a single weak spot on this version.  The entire cast is incredible and will simply blow you away.  If this CD had cost me ten times more money than it did it would have still been worth every last dime.  If I had to throw every CD I own away and was only allowed to keep one CD this opera would be the CD I would choose.  Buy this version and you will thank me later!
159420229X|5|What an amazing book, its catchy and interesting from front to back. I highly recommend reading this book to increase your understanding of memory.
B0094K1WZE|4|As with all of the Mission Impossible movies I found this to be exciting and full of action. All of the actors/actresses did a fantastic job as always.
B004RL9T50|4|Quick and witty with a good message. Funny and entertaining. The whole family sat around eating popcorn and enjoying a good movie together.
B000LPQ6DE|5|I love this film. It is the best video of Jane Eyre yet. They stuck so truly to the novel, I don't think anyone could ask for a better. It is wonderful! Totally worth the money!!
B00CLNVOL8|5|Classic comedy about a witness to a murder going into a sort of witness protection program, which places her in a convent in San Francisco.  Hilarity ensues.  Great singing included, to boot.
B00C061HZY|5|Definitely different from their old stuff but still enjoyable to listen to. This is an album that needs to grow on you but once you listen to it more and more you will enjoy it
B009KS4XRO|1|not crazy about it
B00BI5IXL4|4|Singing wise I still prefer the 10th anniversery edition but for translating a musical to a movie I thought they did a great job!
B00AF6MF9I|4|Great game pretty fun and b b b b b b.  BBC  add  Dr d  as.  Z  s  as<br />. Dr add s d  gift
B000BCE918|5|excellent ,loved them great seller
B007V5CF5K|1|The game was pretty good until you get to the part where you need the record and<br />it's stuck under the menu button. Very frustrating!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Nice detail, intrigue and surprises.  Kept you wanting more. Loved the historical aspect from the Deep South in the past and current day.
B004GJDQT8|5|5 star
B00L9B7IKE|4|A quick, entertaining read with a twist. I expected it to be an amazing book according to the reviews I've read, but it didn't quite live up to that. Enjoyed the way the chapters were written, broken into &#34;Morning&#34; and &#34;Evening&#34; sections.
B0002OERI0|5|I'll admit it right off the bat, I hate George W. Bush, and I want to smack every person who celebrates his're-election'. When Dubbya 'won' I needed something, I needed something that I had never had before. That was American Idiot, I needed a very specific song to vent my own outrage to, and that was Holiday.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a Green Day fan, I never liked their music, as fellow rebellious teens shoved their music in my face, I only felt annoyed. I didn't like the aftershock-punk that echoed in their music, much more immature and indirect than their so-called forefathers. I ignored their Good Riddance inspired radio swagger; I didn't hear American Idiot, the single, until many weeks after its release.<br /><br />When I listened to American Idiot, I instantly felt that outrage which died with the rise and fall of nu-metal phad Papa Roach, that outrage I thought died with Disturbed's freshman debut The Sickness, the outrage now popped out and overdone by nu-metal late comers Linkin Park. That very same outrage which blazed forth from the fathers of the thought-to-be-dead Punk Rock genre I found in American Idiot.<br /><br />I have to say, the people who're going to hate this album are Right Wingers, and those \\"Punk\\" rock fans in their teens that were devout Green Day fans from the start, some fans are going to love this for it harkening back to the days of blatant outrage. Some on the other hand, aren't going to find it simplistic enough, nor directed at parents enough, or too directed, and will probably end up sticking with any number of vanilla Punk-Pop bands.<br /><br />I haven't heard a Rock Opera in many years, but that is essentially what American Idiot, the album, is, it's a politically outraged Rock Opera, the rarest kind in Americas corporate run music industry. Jesus of Suburbia is one big song, and it rocks and styles with a kind of confidence and irony I never got to miss in current music, because it wasn't there. I'm going to cop out and give a per-track score for the sake of space.<br /><br />American Idiot 4/5<br />Jesus Of Suburbia 5/5<br />Holiday 5/5<br />Boulevard Of Broken Dreams 1/5 - (I Really, Really, don't like this song.)<br />Are We The Waiting 3/5<br />St. Jimmy 4/5 - (4, for the vocals that bring the song to a close.)<br />Give Me Novocaine 5/5(Great song to drift to when feeling numb, prettiest song on the album.)<br />She's A Rebel 1.5/5 (Outright boring in my opinion.)<br />Extraordinary Girl 3/5<br />Letterbomb 3.5/5<br />Wake Me Up When September Ends 4/5 (My friend effin' loves this song.)<br />Homecoming 4.5/5 (The ending is a big cop out.)<br />Whatsername 4/5 (A kind of longing to this song, I like it.)<br /><br />I love the story it tells, it's an interesting plot, ending pretty harshly, the choruses are more harmonic, which is probably why they're being called sell-outs, Green Day probably are selling out, they've created a very strange image for themselves, I question what their next album could possibly sound like after all of the press on American Idiot. Usually when a band really hits it huge like this, one of two things happens, they falter in every way under the pressure, or they up the ante, and with a raised bar like American Idiot, I question them being able to.<br /><br />Recommended for those willing to ignore the press and take the album as it is, stop judging every vocal cord that you may or may not have heard in some song a decade ago. Take the music for what it is, stay away conservative bible-thumpers, and rock on.<br /><br />Overall 10/10sake of space.      American Idiot 4/5  Jesus Of Suburbia 5/5  Holiday 5/5  Boulevard Of Broken Dreams 1/5 - (I Really, Really, don't like this song.)  Are We The Waiting 3/5  St. Jimmy 4/5 - (4, for the vocals that bring the song to a close.)  Give Me Novocaine 5/5(Great song to drift to when feeling numb, prettiest song on the album.)

B002M9WW30|4|Great Collection of Rocky Movies.  Four are fantastic; two not so much but hey, overall I'm satisfied
B008Y78AO4|4|QT directed, need I say more? Okay, Uma, she was awesome.
B002RAREAK|5|in this cd i thought usher showed how devoted he was to his music and his fans. usher put songs that reminded people of his previous cd confessions. this cd is great to listen to when drive or around the house. the cd has a number of catchy songs.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Good action nice role for Tom. Good story line. Nice twist nothing just straight forward and predictable well done movie
B00H8AXO1W|2|We have seen this plot a zillion times but the twist here is the handsome stud dating the plain girl is replaced by a plain boy with a lot of personality.
B008JJM88Q|1|this game is so boring I really didn't like it it was so boring to me but I think u might like it its just my opinion
B00003CXRP|4|Cast Away is an entertaining movie about an extremely punctual man who gets stranded on an island. The move has some really great moments. It is great to see how Tom Hanks must adapt to his environment. This is no tropical paradise, but more of a tip of  a mountain sticking out of the ocean. The only complaint about the film is the length. The first section could have been shorter, more island scenes, and drastically cut out the end. I just want a good survival movie, so the character builing story of the him and the girl does not appeal too me. This is an entertaining movie.
B00KWVZ750|4|Good
B00LXLM05I|4|The game is alright. A few minor bugs. Nothing to keep me from playing. :)
B0086700CM|5|Very exciting!  I LOVE this game.<br />All you do is pay attention, and have fun!<br />Enjoy, and be carefull!<br />Happy Holidays!
0345536886|5|Another great book by one of my favorite authors.  The book arrived in good condition and in good time.  The price was right too!
B00MIA0KGY|5|great
B005DJREGQ|4|Good show.
B001BZRUR4|5|I would recommend this book to anyone who could appreciate this style of writing. It is not straightforward prose with normal structure. Also the ending was not unexpected, just waiting for it.
B0051ANPZQ|4|Ok if I had to say anything why kill the dog... other than that it's a great book<br />Love it!!!
B00IG2DOKM|5|I am so addicted to this game, I love it!!!
B0049J0CTM|3|Is this an SD card for a cell phone or the actual DVD?
0142004235|5|I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan. I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing. You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them. I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times. Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book. What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy. It was wonderful and so portrayed this book.
630575067X|5|in this one,there is a council of jedis who rule everything and keep the peace.yoda,ben,some black dude and on like that.a younger ben finds a little kid-who is called anakan and later vadar.that kid wins his freedom with bens help in a very cool pod race.ben recognizes the force in the little one and decides to train him as a jedi.the bad guy is darth maul who has a double bladed light saber-very cool.hes the coolest  looking character yet.i think peple came down too hard on jar-jar.hes a dork but there have been a lot worse.the kids will like it.it is the 4th part but the first episode.everybody should go see this one because just anybody will like it.anakans mom was pretty nice if she cleaned herself up.this movie isnt as good as the tv says but they blow everything all out of proportion anyway.this movie is abselutely incredible though.i think the black dude may be in the matrix too.its good too.the special effects are good.after this there is one more.then there is an animated short film.there is also another one on the way next summer.
B0054NQZ9S|5|Like my real life so it resonated
B00PEJG1K0|5|This album is the return of the band America grew to love, and hate. The atmosphere is a strong combination of some kind of backwoods voodoo ritual and blues/goth rock. This album is a great introduction for new listeners, but does not take away from the classic Marilyn Manson sound fans have loved. Worth every penny, even if your coin is looking to thin.
B001TAJGO6|3|I really wanted to like it more.<br /><br />Maybe it was that annoying female lead, with the different hair colors. Was that supposed to be important, that she had red hair, then blue hair, then green hair?<br /><br />Is that like a \\"costume drama\\" where some people are all excited to see the actress wear different outfits every scene?<br /><br />Sorry but it is just wasted on me.<br /><br />I like story, plot, all those things, not hair colors.<br /><br />I kept thinking, shouldn't I instead be watching Memento again?
0521673763|1|Was an alright book.  had to have it for a class.  The class and professor were awesome, the book was pretty good actually but quite intense....
B0007TKNII|3|I loved this movie and it is a very worthwhile purchase, but I just expected it to contain special features and had no idea that the actual movie was the only thing on the non-special edition versions like widescreen and fullscreen.  What a bummer.  I know I should have looked more carefully, but why can't all of the discs have the special features to make things easier.  Anyways...not a critique against the movie...just a beef with the packaging and so forth.  In short, don't buy the non special edition versions because they will lack any fun features, which a grand movie like Phantom needs to include!
B00B2QA646|4|I didn't expect to like this as I am a fan of the Garbo and Vivien Leigh versions.  The weakness of all previous versions is that it is impossible to be true to this long and complicated novel.  This version does do that better than any other.  It also attempted an elegant new presentation so those of you that are fimiliar with other versions or have read the book will see it presented in a new and enjoyable fashion  for a new century.  Lovers  of this classic will appreciate that parts of the book usually just neglect are presented. This version stands alone in this often told story.  Itis simply impossible to follow the book even when presented in a mini series format there is just so much material.
B003UESJFG|5|Love this movie
B007IXWL2C|5|Loved it, I wish it was a little more explicit. Looking forward to the sequel,once again the author dose an amazing job of pulling you in.
B00006L9X7|1|I wasted money on this DVD because of a lack of information in the Amazon description.  The Amazon description did not explain what Region 2 meant and I bought the DVD to show to my grandaughter.  Since I bought it ahead of her visit, I did not realize that this DVD would not work in the U.S.A.  It was made for the UK.  Consequently, I no longer had the documentation necessary to return the DVD and am out the money.  I was very disappointed in Amazon.  I have also found this with other products.  Amazon needs to provided more detailed information in their descriptions of products so the consumer is fully aware of what they are purchasing.
B00001P4RI|5|I was stunned by how beautiful this album is.  It's not Dead Can Dance which is, frankly, a good thing.  Enough with the DCD worship already.  It's time to move on and he has with this amazing album. <br /> <br />Exquisite sound: fragile, lovely, sad.  His voice has never sounded better.  The absence of percussion is refreshing.  Just beautiful songs in gorgeous minimal settings.  I'm sad he hasn't done any more.  I love this album!
B00118DQYC|1|I am not able to watch this movie due to the region code on the play back.  I need to return this movie ASAP.  Please respond to my request!!
B00C1S9G90|3|This is not really a great season by itself, but it has some really stellar episodes like &#34;Measure of a man&#34; and &#34;A matter of honor&#34;.
B00N11MX1Y|2|Great voice, but WOW, what a mixed-to-lousy group of songs. Highlights, and there aren't enough of 'em, are &#34;California Dreaming,&#34; &#34;I'm Not in Love,&#34; &#34;In My Life&#34; and the relatively obscure Dylan title track (wonder if Elvis Costello had a role in suggesting that one). The rest is--well, terrible. The production by ace schlockmeister David Foster is molasses mixed with treacle.Good lord, who wants to hear this wonderful woman dueting with Michael Buble and/or Bryan Adams? Or songs on the lowest-common-denominator level of &#34;Superstar,&#34; &#34;If I Take You Home Tonight,&#34; &#34;Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word&#34; and &#34;Don't Dream It's Over.&#34; It's causes actual physical pain to endure some of these. Her 2012 outing &#34;Glad Rag Rag Doll&#34; doesn't get the get much respect, but for me it's 4 and 1/2 stars to barely 2 for this one. That was an artist reaching for something interesting, digging into a song selection largely unfamiliar to her audience...which is why it was often reviled, of course. This is MOR, playing it safe tripe.
B00MIA0KGY|2|I love Barbara Streisand but the renditions are soooooo off and different that I didn't really enjoy it like I thought.
B00JDWJV92|5|Good album. I love the original versions of the songs. You can hear that they were done in the 80s. The songs are well written. Blue Gangsta sounds a lot like smooth criminal. I like the message in the song do you know where your children are.
B00CB4ET0K|5|I really Enjoy This game. It's Definitely A Good War Game That They don't make To Often For Tablets. I would like to see other games like this based off Vietnam War.
B0000029GA|5|The first time I ever heard of Nas was when &quot;It was written&quot;  came out in 1996. I thought he was average m.c.Then I heard him in  &quot;The firm&quot; album I thought that he soldout with that mafia B.S. 2  years later I purchase &quot;I AM&quot; after hearing &quot;Hate me  now&quot;. The intro of that album played snippet from &quot;Illmatic&quot;  I never knew nas had a album B-4 &quot;it was written&quot; The intro 2  &quot;I am&quot; became my fav. track. A week later I brought  &quot;Illmatic&quot; and I was shock 2 hear how nice &quot;Nasty Nas&quot;  was. Nas display skills that very few m.c.'s will ever have in song like  &quot;The world is yours&quot;, &quot;Halftime&quot;, &quot;One love&quot;,  &quot;Represent&quot; and my favorite &quot;It ain't hard to tell&quot;.  Nas can say all he want that he mature and he older now but true hip hop  heads know that nas's soldout. He could have been the next Rakim but he  rather go for the platinum then the respect from true hip hop heads.This is  a album that all rap fans should have in their colletion.Nas if u reading  this please leave trackmaster production and return 2 Pete Rock, Dj  Premier, &amp; The Large Professor. We need more hip hop like this cause  there just 2 much cash money garbage now in hip hop.
B0064MGU98|5|If you liked Lost, 24, Homeland, Sopranos...You'll probably love this too.  I can't stop watching &#34;just one more!&#34; Love it.
B004W1GCNC|4|I was a little lost when season two started without two of the main characters but otherwise a good story line
B000YIGNKE|4|While I agree with other reviews which accurately reveal that this adaptation is not 100% true to Miss Austen's cherished novel, it is still my favorite version of this story. Sally Hawkins is magnificent as Anne Elliot. It took me a long while to pin-point what I love about Hawkins portrayal of Anne. She is the 'llama among horses.' Confused by that? Llamas have a very calming effect on wild-spirited horses when kept in the same locale (look it up). Strange analogy it may be, but I find that to be one of the most endearing qualities of Anne Elliot- though not the most desired creature, she brings serenity to the often trivial crises in her life. As to Rupert Penry-Jones portrayal of Frederick Wentworth... it simply does not get any better.  He is the master of unspoken words and pain impossible to hide. This movie captures the morbid tension surrounding disappointed love in a fashion that I have yet to find in another movie. Having read the book, I have found distinct discrepencies. However, that falls to the wayside as the general emotion and feel of the book is perfectly portrayed. The only reason I must give it a 4 star rating is the last street scene. While I absolutely LOVED it, it would have been absolutely unacceptable for the time period. If you love Austen, have been slighted in love, or enjoy superb acting, WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B003G4W49C|5|Very enjoyable.
B003UYV08E|5|I bought this book for my nephew for Christmas and it was just what he asked for.  He loved the movie in the theater and wanted to add it to his personal movie collection.  Great movie....lost of action.  Great delivery.
B004SJ3BCI|5|I have all the Angry Birds little games and they are very entertaining like at airports and just about anywhere when you want to kill time and have fun.
B007D2XSW0|2|Great Program, But Pics Won't Save. Fun To Play With, But If You Can't Save The Edits, Then What's The Point?
B002QRWJA4|5|Love it! Every moment! Can watch it over and over.
B00001W9G0|5|This is right up there with Gone with the Wind and Color Purple and Steel Magnolias!! Funny, and tear jerker at the same time!! Will watch over and over again!!! Love the Streisand Redford matchup!!!
B001FVV2X2|5|ILOVE Fringe! I didn't realize some of the little bits and pieces missed just from commercials like the Observers popping up during a scene! So glad this is on Amazon!!!
B004GHNIRK|4|This was tough to get through, but this book is so much better than the movie. In fact after I read this, the movie made me mad since they got so many things in the movie wrong.
0780021150|5|While watching this story unfold, I found myself on quite a rollercoaster ride of emotion. First, I hated Beckert (Peter Lorre's character) for luring innocent little girls to their hideous deaths. Beckert is scary due to his ordinariness, his gentle face and small stature. He's the opposite of what we tend to expect (even today) a child molester / killer to look like. I really wanted this guy caught! I cheered for the cops to nail this maniac at all cost. Then, I wanted the underworld types to nab him and dole out their version of justice (regardless of their selfish, criminal motives). The scenes of the crooks surrounding / hunting Beckert in a deserted office building are paranoic and intensely claustrophobic. I could feel the terror in Beckert's head. No longer the predator, he was now the prey. Once caught, he is taken to a deserted brewery and put on &quot;trial&quot; by the crime bosses. Beckert must plead for his life before a mob that's not all that interested in his side of the story. He delivers one of the most desperate pleas for mercy in movie history to an audience concerned only with his destruction. Just as the mob leaps at him to tear him apart, the cops arrive, becoming Beckert's (temporary) salvation. In the end, we are left with the words of one of the victims' mother. She sadly states that while Beckert may die for his crimes, this will not bring her baby back to her. Such is the great paradox of justice. Fritz Lang gives us quite a lot to think about in this legendary tale. Buy it and see what I mean...
B00AQF8CJ0|4|This is a fun, different version of a matching/puzzle game. It is easy to pick up and do a level or two. The graphics are bright and cartoony. Getting all the different combinations helps replayability.
B001TH16DS|5|Never been to a convention but have been a huge fan of Star Trek since the first broadcast in 1966.  Season 1 on blu-ray is outstanding.  For purists you can watch the original special effects and listen to the original sound track.  But if you are daring enough to \\"Boldly go where no man (in this case) has gone before\\" you will re-experience Star Trek.  The film had been cleaned up extraordinarily well and enhanced.  The special effects do the kind of justice that this series deserves.  The sound track extraordinary.  I plan to purchase season 2 (available 9/22/09) and season 3 as available.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Not too far into it. But so far it's good.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Well I saw this game on my  sister's kindle and had to have resembles frogger a LOOOOT!!!!! But very awesome
B007FG9LIE|4|A little confusing at first, then the story got into full swing.  I like how the sheriff brought the towns people to their senses and told them what they wanted to know so desperately.  The villain here is the creator of the town.
B00AFCEIB0|5|Another amazing Google product!
B00AEBB8BA|5|Love this movie.......it's a classic.  In Blu-Ray it is even better.  Tennessee, the patron state of shooting stuff. :)
B00063MBU8|5|This CD is awesome! THe songs are amazing and a great step up for Simple Plan. Songs like \\"Welcome to my Life\\", \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Everytime\\" really bring a whole different perspective to Simple Plan's music. Plus, they still stick to some of the stuff you'd expect from them like their songs \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Jump\\". This CD is their best yet! I'd totally recommend this CD to everyone! It has my heart and it is my life. haha...GET IT!
068987474X|4|This  book  is  so  hilarious!  It'll have  you  laughing. If  you're  sick  and  tired  of  making  the  same  old  excuses  for  those  silly  guys, then  I  recommend  you  read  this.  It'll  help  you'll realize,  you  don't  need  to  waste  the  pretty  and  it'll  give  you  the  closure  you  need to  move  on  to  someone  who  is  actually  into  you!
B007VUA7VO|5|you reading this right now if u have a kindle fire than get this applicatioj right now no time to think. why are you reading this far?
B0094BB4TW|3|I works fine as far as I can see.  Just started using it.
B003TSEL7S|5|This book was so exciting for so many reasons. One being that there aren't many children/pre-tween books about Greek and Roman mythology. Another being true book didn't get boring even for one second. My daughter read this book and she told me to read it too. When i finished I realized that if this were for a 10 year old it would make sense and, as I said earlier, would be exciting.
B002MQYOFW|5|U are a awesome wrighter I loved this book! It was great try to come up with something else it was great :-) !!!!
B002MQYOFW|5|My 12 year old daughter and I read it at the same time and had some great discussions on the plot and differences in the book and movie.
B00F7GMQHM|2|Not so good. It was boring!
B006XF5BTG|5|Picked this book up about 3 weeks ago and it i a great tool. It has made me a believer in less is more. Thanks a lot.
B008OW1SAC|5|Wont' get into an in-depth review of this album, as you should just listen to it, but I will say that this is one of the most coherent, beautiful albums I have heard in a long time.  The harmonies and rhythms are complex but unpretentious; Joe Newman's voice is sublime and unusual.  There is absolutely no fluff here.<br /><br />Bottom line: listen to this album.
006202406X|2|I felt like someone else wrote this book....not as great as the first 2! I do wish the ending was more hopefull.
B00EL6AAEU|5|I think everyone should see this movie.  What Sea World is hiding from the public is horrendous.  The orcas should be released and not kept in pens that are too small for them.
B00006879E|5|Before I heard about this album I only had a taste in the alternative kind of music like Savage Garden, Matchbox 20, and Train which in their own respective kingdoms are very great but this one topped them all.  Funk/R
B007SGLZP8|5|Happy with another title by Grisham...filled with twist and turn as the fiction roars along.  .Malcolm...max moved his story right along.
B009VB7P6G|5|I think the Tinkerbell movies are the BEST movies!! Great story, no mean bad guys, it is a winner!!!! !
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great movie and true to the book series.
B004U8ZH8S|4|Loads of fun and certainly worth the time.

B006GHA9QQ|5|This was given as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.
B004SJ3BCI|5|It has been such a long time since I downloaded this onto my kindle, I cannot remember if its the original or not?! Either way, its an angry birds game so you know its great!
B00DR0PDNE|2|Couldn't get it to stream itunes and the software was clunky and slow. The Apple tv box is wayyyyy better and it's 80 bucks!
B005HEPIDS|5|Love it! Well only saw Unimatrix zero Part 2 but I dare you to watch Unimatrix zero Part 2 and not watch Unimatrix Part 1 in season 6. And of course once you watch season 6 the best season that Ive seen your going to want to watch Season 7 and Unimatrix Part 2 Again!
1419705849|4|Funny book. It kept my child's reading on focus. He can not wait for the next book to come out.
B000W91RUG|5|Gifted to someone else

B005K0HDGE|4|I am really impressed with the research it took to write a book of this sort. Being a history major, the assassination of JFK fascinates me, and I think King covers it pretty well. Not a horror book, but a great book all the same.  I recommend it to all fans of history and fans of King 's writings.
140006922X|4|This was a good read. always nice to have some historical perspective. I doubt hard core Christians will appreciate it though.
B005LAIGNC|5|Great Historical value to own on Blue ray.Great storyline and acting. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great!  Hard hitting action, great plot. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects.  Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B008Y7N7JW|5|yep, what title says. loved the movie, it followed the book almost perfect so I can easily enjoy both. found the same with its sequel and excited to see the series once its completed all together
B0051ANPZQ|5|this is one of the best books I have ever red. I recommend this book to ages 10 and up. in this book a boy with a deformity has to face many challenges and school.

B00005JOFO|5|The Wives! The Wives...... the poor wives...  <br /> <br />This seems to be the cry of many who wanted to dislike Brokeback Mountain. It's one thing to be gay, but it's another to cheat on your wives..... an assertion that entirely misses the point the movie is trying to make.  <br /> <br />I'm actually aware of a leader of some Catholic group stating on radio, that she would think respectable gay men wouldn't like this movie because of the infidelity these gay men engaged in.  <br /> <br />Most of these people don't believe the word homophobia describes a legitimate social force. Or one that they would care about. For if it is a legitimate social force, they see it as something that only affects gay men. A term created by political activists for the \\"gay agenda.\\"  <br /> <br />And countering that idea is the message of the movie... Homophobia affects far more than gay men.  <br /> <br />If Ennis (and so many more) hadn't been raised in such a hostile environment, he could have accepted himself for who he was. He and Jack could have been honest about themselves, and lived safely together their entire lives.  <br /> <br />Because of homophobia, they couldn't. Many can't today. The familial and societal pressures for men to marry and have children are great. It is expected. So many gay men have been advised by their religious leaders to solve their homosexuality by marrying a woman. I myself was advised that by a Mormon church leader in the early 80s. He said to me, \\"Sex with a woman is so wonderful, that once you've experienced it, you'll never think of another man again.\\" Fortunately, I knew deep down that would never be true. I asked him, \\"But what woman would be willing to take a chance on me as some kind of experiment.\\" And I swear to God, he said, \\"Why tell her? It's a sure thing sex with her will change you, so why jeopardize it by telling her?\\"  <br /> <br />Well I never did marry (thankfully). I did join the Air Force, and won nearly every award open to me. That didn't work either. I left the Air Force to go through the Mormon Church's program to change me. A total, laughing joke. The idea was that by learning to play masculine sports like basketball and baseball with carefully selected straight men, we would now capture the male bondings we lacked in adolescence and \\"grow\\" out of homosexuality. I knew right then it was a farce because I'd always played masculine sports - football (quarterback), baseball (shortstop), and track, etc. I bonded fine.  <br /> <br />Of course, not one person was changed... and after a few months, most quite attending these useless meetings, and silly sports events. As time passed, it wasn't uncommon to run into other `graduates' down at one of the gay bars.  <br /> <br />In that church group, there were numerous married gay men who were now in the stages of divorce, and who were losing contact with their children. Wives forbidding them to see their kids. Many of these men were suicidal. It was pitiful. And the entire legal system of the Mormon state of Utah was against them. They had absolutely no chance to have their rights recognized or considered.  <br /> <br />It turns out, at that time, there were two large support groups for Mormon women who found themselves married to gay men. Several chapters were written about it, or were authored by members of it, in the groundbreaking book, \\"Peculiar People: Mormons and Same Sex Orientation.\\" These people described their experiences, and the education they received about putting your faith in the church leaders as opposed to facing reality.  <br /> <br />Before Peculiar People was published, a famous Mormon poet, Carol Lynn Pearson, wrote a book \\"Goodbye, I Love You,\\" about taking care of her gay husband as he died. Another woman whose life was changed because homophobia kept her husband from being able to be what he was. And so he tried to be what his church wanted, and married her..... but could not deny his nature.... and she so lovingly took him back when he was ill, and cared for him until his death.  <br /> <br />In the early 90's, before I left the `land of Zion,' a newspaper article appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune, about the alarming number of faithful Mormon women who were turning up HIV positive. Turns out their husbands were stopping off in public restrooms on their way home for a quickie with men, or steam rooms at gyms, or gay bars... or wherever. And then the virus was passed to them. But what if those men had never been pressured to marry women? What if they had the institution of marriage to anchor them into a monogamous union with one other man? It's a damn good chance neither these men or their wives would have been infected. <br /> <br />Any of these people know that the culprit in all this isn't homosexuality - which is a part of nature and always has been. Nor is it the expression of homosexual sex, as sex is a gift from God to all of us. It wasn't the gay men who didn't know better, and so they put their faith in their ignorant religious leaders, believing that marriage would change them. It was simply that ignorance coupled with fear that was at fault. And ignorance coupled with fear is the very basis of homophobia.  <br /> <br />Homophobia made victims, not only of the men, but of their wives and children. Homophobia assured those homes would be broken before the marriage vows were ever taken.  <br /> <br />Alma and Lureen were as much the victims of homophobia as Jack and Ennis. Only Jack and Ennis had their personal safety to worry about, unlike the wives. And Ennis had such internalized homophobia he couldn't even face himself.  <br /> <br />In this day, when we have politicians from the president on down, going around crying out that they have to `save' marriage by denying homosexuals equal opportunity in marriage, they are using this same homophobia for political gain. Have you ever heard George Bush explain just how his and Laura's marriage would be affected if a Jack and Ennis were given the legal rights marriage offers? Of course you haven't. And you never will because there is no threat to the institution of marriage just by extending it's benefits to gay and lesbian citizens (who also pay taxes by the way, and who were also born under a constitution that guarantees them the right to the pursuit of happiness, which would include having a family).  <br /> <br />Imagine Jack and Ennis living in Canada today, instead of Wyoming during the 60s. They could get married. They would have legal protections. There would be no wives being cheated on. All of them could have a happy life. What is so wrong with that?  <br /> <br />That is the message of this movie. Homophobia destroys. Being allowed to be what you are, openly, and with same rights as others brings on a life of happiness.  <br /> <br />So for those of you who are so concerned about the wives, and feel to criticize the movie because these guys cheated on their wives because they couldn't deny their nature.... understand what is truly responsible. Then lend your support for the Jack's and Ennis' and Alma's of the world. Support gay marriage.... Let's create a reality where people can be what nature made them to be...  <br />  <br />And for the reviewer who wrote the last two negative reviews (obviously the same individual), there was no \\"rape\\" in the tent scene.  Do you know what rape is?  It is forcing someone to have sex against their will.  Jack initiated the encounter.  It was not against his will.  <br /> <br />And to reviewer J.E Barnes, thanks for all the insights about the symbolisms.  I caught some of them, but you pointed out others that really make the film even more interesting.
0061914177|5|It's not hard to explain Gary Vaynerchuk, he's energetic, he's passionate and he believes that you should be spending your life doing something you LOVE.  This all comes through in \\"Crush It!\\" many times over.  This book is a must read for anyone who does business or is passionate about anything.  Gary will take you through the steps of creating and growing your on-line brand.<br /><br />It's a fairly quick read, but full of useful information.  It was nice to get a little bit more background of Gary and his family as well as the story of how he started in with all the social media the Internet has to offer.  I don't think many people would disagree that Gary is one of the top authorities on using the Internet as a way to grow a brand with very little cash.  In the Internet age it's all about being passionate, working harder than the next guy and caring about what you do, and \\"Crush It!\\" explains just how you translate that into today's landscape.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to an audio version of this book so I can refresh and remind myself of all the principals and ideas in this book and to keep me motivated.  Thanks Gary!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|this book was an enjoyable read..i read it and then gave it to my oldest daughter to read. she also enjoyed it.<br />this book is worth the buy..the characters bring you and and you feel a part..

B0052RE4MQ|4|The book was very good and I liked how it went a lot  but it I liked matched better.  Crossed was more about the rising and not love. It depends if your more into love or action.
6302799066|5|I saw this movie when it first came out, and I have lost no occasion to watch it again. A superb cast with a supreme director. The hallucinating atmosphere of quickly getting closer and closer to the nuclear holocaust is gripping and, at the same time, one cannot but appreciate the refined Kubrick irony in portraying the characters: Sellers, in a triple role played with his usual elegance; Scott and Hayden as two generals who only differ as to degree of paranoia; and all others. I even found in this CD the song \\"We'll Meet Again\\", in Vera Lynn's performance: it begins kind of sirupy as the original version was, but it eventually changes to the somewhat jazzed-up one heard at the end of the movie. It brought back memories of the war years and of the BBC shortwave broadcasts to Italy we used to listen to in clandestine secrecy.
B00FXMGI0G|4|Fun movie.  Such a young love for Bruce Willis is a bit of a stretch though I love her watching the old couple struggle with the toilet paper case.

B00002MZ4W|4|The Apple has finally ripen. Fiona Apple has finally settled down, left her underwear, undernourished and oversexed look back in he bedroom. It's a \\"Criminal\\" act we welcome. On this follow-up to her debut CD, Fiona voice is husky and heartfelt; she ignites torch songs with a jazzy flame --- made even more riveting by the bare-bones, yet atmospheric, orchestrations. The songwriter is (almost) as wordly and wonderous as the singer. And just as delicious.
B00BATG18K|5|And very insightful into her own life as a woman and as a writer. There is a lot of magic and if you just can't handle magic, then it's not for you. I really enjoyed the ups, downs, tragedies, realities, love and fun that is in this book.

B000AXSN5G|5|I bought this album when it was released in 2005. I listened through several times and thought it was a great album. Then I went and saw the &#34;Neil Young: Heart of Gold&#34; film in the theater (which contains almost every song on this album, recorded live). Wow. If you haven't seen this film, watch it. The live recordings from this album enhance the beauty of the music even more.<br /><br />I can say that 9 years later, this album is still one of my absolute favorites, and I never tire of hearing it. This is Neil Young at his best: surrounded by his friends and family, creating music straight from his heart and his soul.
0399226907|5|I love the story and the illustrations.  I used to buy this book for my children and now am buying it as a first book for our new grandchildren.  I would get the real book, not the board book for the toddlers.  Then it can be saved and won't be chewed.  Wonderful award winning book.

B009CVRQLY|1|What a snore fest. She does not have the greatness of say a Streisand to stay away so long and expect anyone to care. Celine seems so over. There is also a hoarseness and rasp that has come way too soon for a young singer. Back to Vegas Celine. Sorry

B00192KCQ0|2|Sounded like they were trying to re-find the sound from Justice, but it falls short. The songs lack a cohesiveness, the choruses don't catch and the solo's sound like old Hammett, but that's the thing it sounds old. Metal has moved on and they're trying to pick up at 1990 again. This'll album will thrill you if you still have your jean jacket with patches.
B0000027I6|4|Considering the fantastic reviews this album has already received, I needn't have to go far to convince you that this is really a good album. <br /> <br />But more than just being good, this is the Waters solo album that sounds, by far, the most like Pink Floyd. With fantastic guitar work, a return to Waters' characteristic biting political and war themes, and some tracks that are dark and really make you think. Accompanied by music that drives the point home. <br /> <br />I have a hard time deciding whether this album or Radio K.A.O.S. are Water's best, but both are absolutely worth having for their unique elements. If you want that \\"lost\\" Pink Floyd album...though, this is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that \\"lost album.\\" <br /> <br />Water's genius makes itself apparent here, starting from the very first track. A long instrumental piece with gorgeous...absolutely gorgeous...David Gilmour-esque guitar work. While in the background a war veteran speaks of the time he had to leave a fellow soldier, Bill Hubbard...to die in \\"no man's land\\". Powerful, gripping, almost tearful. <br /> <br />The second song, What God Wants, Pt. 1, feels like something that came straight off of The Wall, as much of this album does feel. You have the same effect of the voices in the background chanting the chorus as we heard on Run Like Hell or Waiting for the Worms... <br /> <br />Now, if you are quite religious... What God Wants is sure to offend you. But if you can get past the lyrics and see the song as a powerful musical piece, as it is, then you will enjoy it.  <br /> <br />Perfect Sense, Pt. 1 will take a bit to get into, but it will eventually grow on you, however it is Part 2 that is the real highlight, with powerful arena-style vocals and powerful backing. Still, not quite as powerful as \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" from Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, but great nonetheless. <br /> <br />The Bravery of Being out of Range is absolutely fantastic. One of the three highlights of the album, this song grabs you from the start, and the chorus line \\"hey old man what the hell you gonna kill next?\\" is typical of Waters, refreshingly bitter. Drumming, guitar, vocals, all work well here to make a great song. <br /> <br />And with that we now arrive at the weaker part of the album. Late Home Tonight parts 1 and 2 are, forgive me, entirely disposable tracks. Too Much Rope is a little better, but not by far...it just doesn't work as a song.  <br /> <br />Thankfully this weak portion doesn't last long and with Track 9, What God Wants, Part 2, we are thrust back into what is, without a doubt, the most mind-blowingly f-ing AMAZING song on the entire album. It's entirely too short, its so good you want it to last for several minutes! <br /> <br />What God Wants, Part 2, picks up where Part 1 left off, and then elevates the song into fantastic shouted Waters vocals, even more fantastic lyrics, strong guitar work, excellent bass, I'm not kidding you folks this song will give you shivers up your spine, and give you tingles from how powerful it is. This is THE song on the album to play in your car at full volume for the rest of the world to hear. This song alone makes the album worth purchasing. I cannot express it enough, one of Waters' best tracks since going solo! <br /> <br />Part 3 of that song, however, is disposable...doesnt sound like Parts 1 or 2 at all, completely skip-able. <br /> <br />Watching TV will grow on you, its about the killing at Tiannamen Square in China...its disturbing, so be prepared for that. <br /> <br />Three Wishes is spooky, the lyrics of the Genie are sung with warped effect, a delightfully dark song.  <br /> <br />It's A Miracle takes the darkness even further, a song about Capitalism.  <br /> <br />Amused to Death reminds me of the Floyd album Final Cut...it has its great moments, its weak moments, but overall a nice closer for the album. <br /> <br /> <br />I would have given this 5 stars if not for that set of three impossibly weak tracks in themiddle. But both sides of the album are powerful, and money spent on buying this would not be wasted. <br /> <br />Once again, this IS the lost Pink Floyd album. It IS The Wall reminisced. It IS Pink Floyd's lost element. You'll be happy with this purchase.
B0000027RL|5|this was undoubdtedly their best album which was also their debut.this cd contains some of my favourite songs like evenflow,jeremy and alive.highly recommended.an alternative rock classic

B000002B7M|4|Many Ozzfans think that &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; is the ultimate album,  the best he ever made and so on... I can't share that opinion somehow. It  includes some of the best songs he ever wrote but as an album it fails. Yes  it has it's lowpoints. &quot;No Bone Movies&quot; sucks merciless in  comperison with songs like &quot;Revelation&quot;, &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;  or &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot;. Also, if you want Rhandy Roads to leave  it's mark on the album with an instrumental song, has it to be this short  and meaningless (Dee)? On the other Hand, it has &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;,  &quot;I don't know&quot; and &quot;Crazy Train&quot;. It is rather a mixed  bag than a full-time quality effort. The greatness of some songs makes  others look below average. I like &quot;Blizzard&quot; too, but if you want  the best he ever made get &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;, where you  will find absolutely no filler songs.
B00457X7XQ|5|Great page turner, glad I picked it up, or um, downloaded it.  Looking forward to reading the next Russinovich novel.
0553260111|5|I know, this book deserves a review all on its own merits - but let me speak first to the fact that the movie released last year with Matt Damon just simply did not do this book justice. What they did was take a compelling character, extract him from the plotline which makes him so compelling, and build a movie around him. If you thought Jason Bourne was a bad-ass character in this movie, and you enjoyed the pace and action of the movie - well, you have only begun to tap into the true excitement of Jason Bourne as he is in Ludlum's novel. I think the movie took Jason out of context to make him more current - as the book was originally published in 1987 and some of its politics and settings are dated. But I would argue that rather than dating the story, these facts lend a strong sense of time and place to the story that actually helps recommend it - and aid its mystery. <br /> <br />The initial plot of the movie - a man waking up amnesiac after being shot and left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea - is the same. And it is true, that man must seek knowledge of himself to explain his extraordinary abilities - in hand-to-hand combat, weapons assembly, language, and espionage. But what is not communicated so well in the movie is the true anguish and self-examination that must be undertaken by the Bourne character - what drives him unstoppably to determine who he is. Bourne is not a fierce killer - and yet can kill fiercely. There is a strong mystery and a burning need in him to find the truth - as a reader, you feel strongly attached and sympathetic to Bourne - mostly through the device of Marie, a much stronger character than in the movie - who is his partner in determining his identity. <br /> <br />Not only is he being pursued by his own intelligence agency - which subplot contains infinitely more subtlety than in the movie - but he is being tracked by the world's deadliest assassin as well - Carlos the Jackal - who is, all evidence seems to show, his fierce rival. Ashe circles in on Carlos, Carlos is circling in on him - and so is worldwide intelligence. Jason must determine who he is and what his past is - and has only so much time to do it - this sets the driving pace of the book. <br /> <br />Ultimately, what we have is a three-part cat and mouse game, with Jason always just one step ahead of everyone else. Is he an assassin? Is he an undercover agent whose cover is so deep he can't differentiate himself from it anymore? There is no time or luxury to decide - the novel moves along at a breakneck speed until we ultimately find out - almost too late - what the Bourne Identity truly is. <br /> <br />This book far exceeds the movie based on it because of its tightly drawn characters, far superior plot, and the truly deft way that Ludlum has woven his story into world politics and great international locations. Ludlum is a great writer of thrillers - as his decades of book sales attest - I would urge you to pick up this book and give it a weekend - it will reward you far beyond the 2 hours you got out of the movie.
B007SGLZP8|4|Vintage Grisham style - did not see the plot twist coming.  Always keeps you engaged and wanting to read the next chapter.  I know that some readers found it ho-hum, but I enjoyed it.
055380684X|5|I purchased the Talent Code about 2 years ago and have been using the methodology in my coaching/teaching. I also have had a few parents of students that I have suggested read the book so they have a better understanding of exactly what it is we are about to do and embark on. This is a great book for anyone that believes that hard work is the only limiting factor in producing success at elite levels.
B0071XO8RA|5|Could not put this down! Had to immediately go to the sequel/prequel Shift, which was just as compelling. Fantastic story!
B000LC55F2|5|I heard of \\"The Prestige\\" when it came out on DVD, but I didn't know too much about it.  Saw some commercials for it here and there, but I wasn't sure if it was something that I had to see right away.  It wasn't until I went to a store and saw that this was directed by none other than the brilliant Christopher Nolan (who directed my all-time favorite movie, \\"Memento\\").  That's all it took for me to buy the DVD without even really knowing what the movie was about.  I didn't care.  It had Nolan's name on it, and that's all I needed.  I watched it the next day and couldn't believe how great this movie was.  Not only that, but I ended up watching it again only a few hours after my first viewing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are so many twists and turns in this wild ride that I'll have to be brief in describing what it's about so I don't end up giving away something crucial (yeah, it's one of those where you give away one little thing, and it could possibly ruin the movie for the other person).  As simplistic as I can put it the film concerns two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  The two were quite the team and worked together splendidly until one night one of their well known tricks goes wrong and ends up costing Angier a loved one.  He blames Borden for his loss and becomes obsessed with finding any means to out-show him, learn his secrets and destroy him.<br /><br />I know, this sounds like a typical \\"thriller,\\" but that's really only a small outline of the movie.  I had to keep it short and simple to avoid giving away too much.  \\"The Prestige\\" works more as a drama/thriller/mystery.  The entire theme of the movie is to \\"watch closely,\\" and there's reason for that.  You're not entirely sure what is going on until the very end, and even then you feel like you have to watch it again right away to verify what you've just witnessed.  Nolan's great at playing head-games with you, and it's nice to see him dive intos that area of film again.  Even though you're always trying to piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.  The look and feel of the film is very dark, but it looks so gorgeous.<br /><br />The performances from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are perfect.  Bale never ceases to amaze me in the roles he takes, as he commits himself a hundred percent every time.  David Bowie even makes a small appearance in the film, and trust me when I say this, you do not see him as David Bowie on the screen.  You buy into his character completely.<br /><br />It must be said, even though this is a PG-13 movie, it gets pretty disturbing and the overall tone of the movie is dark and cold.  I wouldn't recommend it for children.  The DVD doesn't offer a whole lot of features, which is a shame because I have the suspicion that they will re-release it in a \\"fully-loaded\\" edition later on (which I will have to go and buy).<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is a total success, and then some.  It's one of those movies that you have to watch more than once, and each time you see it (just like with \\"Memento\\"), chances are you're going to pick up on something that you didn't see the first time around.  If you're looking for something different and unique, I strongly suggest giving this a try.  It ranks up there as one of my top favorites of 2006.  Nice to see that Christopher Nolan has made another fantastic movie and has proven that he's not just a one-trick pony.  The movie may have a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested, but they never take away from the great story and characters.<br /><br />Are you watching closely?  -Michael Craneo piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.

1451636016|4|I've liked it; I'm portuguese but i've found this book easy to read; it's very interesting, but short: it goes over a lot of subjects without going very deep.<br />Also I've expected more on the techics of meditation
B003YHSE7W|5|As far as product, the disc is error free and looks wonderful. Content, is fun and well written. Great action with burst of humor at the right places. The acting is wonderful by all, well worth the price of adminssion. Downside is not enough content after the movie. But that's how they make more money with a Director's Cut with all the extras. Well recommended for Action fans and those who loved the comic books.

B00BF11STU|4|Good portrayal of the UBL raid, with a bit too much profanity and torture in the first part of the movie.
0486284735|2|Not for me. Put it down. I don't like the characters, don't like what they do, don't like the way they talk. While I was reading I was wishing for Jackie Chan to burst into one of their dinner parties and kick the china tea cup out of Darcy's hand.
0375842209|5|Reading The Book Thief was terrific. It was written so uniquely. I have nothing negative to say. It was a tale I'm really grateful to have read.<br />~*~*~Quotes of Note~*~*~<br /><br />It's a small story really, about, among other things:<br />* A girl<br />* Some words<br />* An accordionist<br />* Some fanatical Germans<br />* A Jewish fist fighter<br />* And quite a lot of thievery<br /><br />Of course, I'm being rude. I'm spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It's the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me. There are many things to think of. There is much story.<br /><br />It kills me sometimes, how people die.<br /><br />For some reason, dying men always ask questions they know the answer to. Perhaps it's so they can die being right.<br /><br />They say that war is death's best friend, but I must offer you a different point of view on that one. To me, war is like the new boss who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder repeating one thing, incessantly: 'Get it done, get it done.' So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however does not thank you. He asks for more.<br /><br />Five hundred souls.<br />I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms.

B008J34466|3|I typically don't mind off-color language but she uses more curse words that felt comfortable.  It was almost as if that was the point of the song.  It didn't emphasize or give emotional color so much as just distracted and jarred.  Analogy: if f's were bombs, she'd be a B-52.
B005DD7TI0|4|It almost jumped the shark, but manages to redeem itself with the underlying point that cheating is how the 1% achieve success. I didn't like the falsely represented statistics about brain utilization that was critical to the story, but it is widely misrepresented in many movies lately. It's not as badly misrepresented as in the movie &#34;Lucy&#34;, but it was bothersome. Otherwise and okay movie.

B000002KD9|4|I`m embarressed to say that although I am a huge Neil Young fan,ever since I started writing reviews here its not until now that I am finally writing a review of a studio album (my review of Live Rust doesn`t count because its live) and it`s one of my absolute favorites.Danny Whitten was gone and Crazy Horse was no more.When not playing solo,Neil was playing with Nils Lofgren,Ralph Molina,Billy Talbot,Ben Keith and Greg Reeves and gathered from different sessions and a couple of years, it gives us several glimpses as to what direction he was heading....everywhere.  Not all the songs are homeruns but there is no downtime - the gems are scattered all around and that is why this is so good.  Tell Me Why,Birds,When You Dance,Don`t Let It Bring You Down and the title track are just a few of the outstanding tracks here.  At a time when most performers were reaching their peaks or unraveling completely,Neil,as usual,was just playing and recording with no agenda.Different moods and feelings move the album to its conclusion.Not really a must have but worth the trouble for the price...a signpost of the things to come and a lament about loss and leaving things behind and moving ahead for one reason or another.  A great Sunday morning album.
B00N4FXZNW|4|Like many people I have seen Mark Owen interviewed on the long running CBS news program &#34;60 Minutes&#34;.  His interview with Scott Pelley as well as his vivid description of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden is what drove me to read &#34;No Easy Day&#34;.  While I do have my criticisms of the book, I found that I liked it more than I expected.<br /><br />&#34;No Easy Day&#34; does get off to a slow start.  The first chapters of the book are Owen's biography.  He mainly talks about life in his native Alaska and what drove him to become a SEAL.  While this part of the book is well done I did not find it particularly engrossing.  Maybe because it is not something that was new to me since I already know how difficult SEAL training is and how very few people who start the training become SEALs.  I have also heard many times how SEAL training builds camaraderie among those who train together.  While I am sure that is true, it is nothing I have not heard before.<br /><br />After Mark Owen finishes with that story he then goes on to describe several missions he went on in Iraq and Afghanistan.  As is the case with his biography I was not very compelled by what he described.  When I say this I do not mean to demean or make light of Owen in any way.  Mark Owen, as well as everybody who served in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, certainly deserves to be respected for their service.  That goes without saying as we all know.  What I am saying is I found this part of the book good, but not particularly fascinating.  However, my opinion soon changed when I got to the part of the story which compelled me to read the book in the first place.<br /><br />Owen's description of the Bin Laden raid (Named Operation:  Neptune Spear.) is by far the best part of &#34;No Easy Day&#34;.  He does an excellent job of describing every step of the operation.  From the preparations to the execution to the aftermath, I found myself drawn into the story.  Owen's description is in fact sogood that I felt I was along side him every step of the way.  That alone makes this book worth your time.  There is also a very well done photographic timeline of the events during the execution of the raid.  Every minute of the raid is described very well in the pictures.  You will have a crystal clear understanding of the operation as well as great respect for all of those involved.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me the most about Mark Owen was his humility.  In a total contrast to fellow Navy SEAL Marcus Lutrell (Author of &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; which was the basis of the movie of the same title starring Mark Wahlburg,) Owen leaves his ego at the door and just tells the story.  Yes, towards the end of the book his voices his dislike of President Obama, but he does so respectfully.  More than we can say for Lutrell who in his book repeatedly patted himself on the back and over and over again insulted those who disagree with his political views and views on war itself which was a major turnoff for me when I read his book.  I respect Marcus Lutrell's feeling and his political opinions, but I don't need to hear them on every page of his book.  Just tell the story and that's exactly what Mark Owen does and he does so surprisingly well.<br /><br />&#34;No Easy Day&#34; is not perfect but it is still worth reading for the excellent description of probably the most significant military operation in the history of the United States.  Take some time to read the book as soon as you can.  You will not find a better or more accurate account of Operation:  Neptune Spear.

B00DPM7RJW|5|I can't say too much without giving away major points of the story and those major points are what makes reading Maybe Someday the first time around so enjoyable! Because you know, I probably won't read this just once.<br /><br />Sydney, poor girl that gets her heart broken and loses her best friend all on what's supposed to be the best day of each year never stood a chance when she met Ridge in person for the first time. Their connection is unavoidable and the way they maneuver the path that life has laid out before them is hard, emotional and just plain tragic to the heart sometimes.<br /><br />I love when a book makes me feel every emotion and I also love it when I'm not crying too much. Maybe Someday had just enough of everything, and a lot of music. I mean, Colleen was able to work closely with Griffin Peterson on this book/album that simultaneously makes everything flow so wonderfully together.<br /><br />I've read a lot of books with an epic song, a special song moment, or even several songs mentioned or alluded to but this was the first book I've read where the songs were just as much a part of the story as the setting or the characters. Personally, I didn't listen to the songs while I was reading, I just read the words like poetry as I would in most books that include lyrics but then I was able to go and listen to the songs that were in the book which was such an amazing experience! You can download the CD on Amazon to listen to while you're reading and then again and again forever!<br /><br />Thanks to Colleen and her musically gifted ally Griffin for such an unforgettable reading experience!

B00006J3WH|5|When the episode of 'Once More, With Feeling' first came on, I taped it because I thought it would be good, and I wasn't wrong! I really liked how Joss Whedon put in some comedy along with the actual singing. I loved everyone's voices, especailly Amber Bensons'. She is amazing! I always listen to \\"I'm Under Your Spell\\" first because it is my favourite! Whenever I listen to this CD (which is always!), I get chills up my spine. The only bad thing about it, is that I can't listen to this Cd while I read, because I always sing along and get out of my book! <BR>And just so you know, 'Mustard', is about people with clothes stains. Just in case you haven't actually watched the episode, which you should because they show repeats on SPACE (thank God)!

B008Y6RYDS|5|This may not appeal as much to people of the current era - it's sometimes slow and wanders a bit in the way that a picture about stoned people, made by stoned people, naturally would.  Still, the appeal is the authenticity of certain aspects of the era - the attempt at communal living, the derision of straight people toward the hip culture and the reality of the &#34;hip-entrepreneur,&#34; meaning those of us who thought doing illegal stuff was okay so long as it in some way was counter to &#34;the man&#34; and all those remnants of 50s conservatism.  For cinephiles, there's the rather radical use of sudden flash-forwards throughout the film--a technique that worked truly well and certainly showed a lot of us who were used to Hollywood linear film-think that you could play with time and space, exactly as our experiments with consciousness told us we could.  And beyond all that is the amazing music--great, original THRILLING music from the absolute golden era of rock and roll.  So, yeah, if you can dig it, then dig it.  If you can't, then just walk on by.
0385720920|2|Reading through \\"Choke\\", it did not take me until the end to realize that there really was no point to the whole novel. The endless episodes of Victor choking in restaurants, having strange sexual encounters, visiting his mother in the hospital leads us to the conclusion that...what? I agree that this novel offers a sarcastic and often grim outlook on American life as we know it, but that does not seem to be enough to keep this fractured plot moving. <br />I like the way that Palahniuk writes, it is choppy yet fast moving. His use of repetition works for the most part, although he manages to go overboard on this as well. So many of the elements of this book seem to be taken directly from \\"Fight Club\\", such as the way Victor hangs around meetings for sexual addicts, the same way that the Edward Norton character always went to meetings just to make himself feel better. The cynical nature of the author is good, and he puts this across well, but alas, with no payoff, no point in sight. <br />Overall, this is a decent read, but expect nothing great from it.

B0041KKYEM|5|A-<br /><br />A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's \\"Black Swan\\" is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us.<br /><br />Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime - that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of \\"Swan Lake.\\" Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film - reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, \\"Black Swan\\" borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of \\"All About Eve\\" in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of \\"Carrie\\" in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film \\"Repulsion\\" from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her?<br /><br />The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina?<br /><br />To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time.<br /><br />Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide - whether consciously or unconsciously - the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence.<br /><br />Freud would have had a field day with this movie.to be waning over time.     Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide - whether consciously or unconsciously - the Black Swan side from public view.

B004XANKVO|3|I'm torn with this backpack.  It's not a bad pack but I don't see it as being worth $129.  The materials are ok but I do hate the 'crinkly' sound of the interior lining.  It looks and feels very stiff (one of the downfalls of polyester VS. nylon).  This doesn't compare in quality and storage to another bag I have from Slappa.  It sits high on the back and the lower part of the shoulder straps (that attach to the lower part of the backpack) dig into my sides.  I really want to like this bag but it doesn't look or feel like a backpack that should cost $129 and I think I'm going to return this

B0071XO8RA|5|I cannot believe how hooked I got with this book and the whole Silo Saga.  Howey is an amazing writer, very graphic in images as you read along.  It really sucks you in with a possible senario of the world in which this could happen.  Great reading.
B006ID6NDQ|5|This takes you into what it was like during World War Two in Europe. Often heartbreaking, the choices are incomprehensible by today's standards. Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it, so thanks to the authors for this stirring reminder.
B0089LOG02|5|A quick, thoroughly intriguing read with a glimpse into past attempts to deal with poverty and other social problems in our cities. Celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. Even though the characters went through terrible trials, there was enough kindness along the way to help them overcome.
B000X1Z0BU|5|Great songs and a fun story that has romance, but isn't overly so.  It isn't a \\"chick flick\\".  It's also funny at times too.  It's part drama, part comedy, part romance, part inspiration about pursuing your dreams.    Get the movie and and the album!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|It was a very short snipet but if the season is like the last too am sure i will love it. It is hard to judge something that short.
B006WAIV6M|4|I read this in right time. I have been planning to give up some of my old habits.. Time to practice.
B000XUBFE2|4|Took me a long time to get through it but I ultimately enjoyed the book even if it was depressing.  I did not like the introductory mechanism the author used for chapter outlining but the use of the grim reaper as the narrator was very effective.  I was a bit let down at the end but still worth reading.
B00BCV3HGU|4|Will.I.Am had me hooked at &#34;Scream and Shout&#34; and I looked forward to getting a whole disc of fun tunes to jam to.  #Willpower delivers exactly that.  Fantastic beats to rock to, drive to, work out to.  Sure, folks have indicated he's sampled other artists, but he also gives a nod to the artists he sampled, I'm good with that.  Will.I.Am delivers talent in a dance/hip hop fashion that works for me, I'd recommend this CD to others seeking the same.

1416955070|4|As a TWILIGHT fan I needed something to captivate me again. I was skeptic at first thinking there isn't anything else that would give me the \\"i don't want to put this down\\" feeling. THIS was it.  Stephanie Meyer recommended it and I can see why. You can't help but fall in love with JACE. But this has everything, love story? check, unexpected events? check! action? check! I read all three of the Mortal Instruments and it kept getting better and better! must read!

B008HK3XOU|5|I love this Marware cover!  It is thin and lightweight yet seems sturdy, covers nicely. Would recommend this to anyone!
B00001PE4D|5|Cruel Intentions is a good movie! That's why I gave it 5 stars... If you want to watch a movie filled with deceit and twisted plots, this is the one for you. Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Kathryn, Sebastian's stepsister and love interest.  Sebastian derives pleasure out of others' misery.  Every girl that he comes in contact with is a conquest for him. He tries to get them in bed with him and will feed these girls any line needed to achieve his goal.<br />Kathryn is a &quot;psycho-bulimic-head case&quot; as described by her ex boyfriend.  Kathryn has a hard time dealing w/ rejection and wants to get back at anyone who does anything to her, nice or otherwise.  <br />Kathryn and Sebastian have their fun with flirting and foreplay until Sebastian wants a real challenge and finds out about Annette (played by Reese Witherspoon), a virgin from Kansas. Annette has recently written a manifesto on why she plans to wait..Sebastian doesn't like that and plans to prove her manifesto wrong.  <br />I'm not going to give away anything else about Katryn, Sebastain, Annette, or the others, such as Cecille and Ronald.  This movie is my favorite. Watch it, and you will find out why.
B006ZAZ31U|5|Would recommend this life story to anyone.  It is truly inspirational and tells the story of a true American son,husband,father,brother and humble servant.  It's sad and inspiring.
B009OJ01HA|5|Good movie
B003L45JLW|5|I love this album.  I think it is one of their best.  I bought the BluRay just so I could get the FLAC 24/48 download.  These files are not as compressed as the CD and they sound fantastic.  I will probably never use the BluRay.  In the future, I wish they would sell just the hi res FLAC 24/48 files, or even offer 24/96.
B00E0MCYPS|4|It is very fun and exciting
B000ICKPOQ|5|Oh myyy! Where to begin.....Oh yeah, This is my favorite SciFi tv show of all time. When I thought nothing could ever top Star Trek The Next Generation. Sorry my fellow Trekies, but my alligance is to Atlantis now. I will forever be a Star Trek fan, but this series is just soooo good. Everything about it is done to perfection. The sounds, story lines, everything! I started to watch the series well after its cancelation. I did not know about it. I was on the fence if I should really watch it. Only because so many other SciFi shows have really been boring for me. Well things changed right after the first episode. Thats all it took. I would highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys really good action without the Rated R stuff. This show is very family friendly. No sex stuff, nothing that you could not watch with kids around. Its very good like that. I could write forever about how good this series is, I think its time for you to watch it and post a another 5 star review. Enjoy!
B00F87ZUYG|5|Wow, this is a unique show, tense and often surprising.  I am anxious to see what happens, as my friends are saying things like, &#34;devastating.&#34;
B00555X8OA|5|A fascinating and insightful book, written for a lay audience by a very accomplished researcher. Well written and readable. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand human behavior - particularly its less rational, flawed (in other words, human) manifestations.
B005FITIGO|4|This movie was far from perfect, as it missed some critical opportunities to educate the viewer, nonetheless is worth watching fro several reasons:<br />The characters are well crafted from both the business perspective and the technical perspective. many of characters were just forced in into a set of actions that quickly became out of their control as the true magnitude of the mess became apparent.<br /><br />2 of the technical people ( Quinto and Tucci's roles) were shown in their native form, they way they viewed their world in an engineering mind set. Quinto's character is particularly naive that felt real.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Iron's characters as veterans really exposed a seamy side of the whole meltdown business, in that they had no real idea how any of the trading worked in Mortgage backed securities worked in terns of the risks. It was classic as they then had to figure out how to unwind their mess and what i meant for all of banking.<br /><br />Demi Moore's character was way too weak, but maybe that just reflected reality.<br /><br />The way all of the traders and salesmen found a way to justify their terrible actions was a great short view into how easy it is engage in self-delusion in order to feel better about your self. The last scene of Jeremy Irons filling in a cross word puzzle in the executive dining room is classic.<br /><br />The downside of the film fell in two areas, at the key executive meeting, many acronyms were used that assumed the viewer would know, they should have found a way to fill the audience in, especially when all they had to do was associate MBS with Mortgage Backed Securities. way too much implied understanding, especially when they threw around the definition of SWAPs as something no to do. When Quinto's character was explaining the model's failures to his colleague and later with Spacey doing this for Irons, it would have helped to show he graphs they were referring to. Especially since not many people would equate \\"volatility\\" to a concept relating to market \\"trouble\\".<br /><br />when you think about the fact that Both of Dan Brown's Novels/ movies had all of the action take place in 24 hours, and this movie also had all action take place in 24 hours, it represents an interesting contrast in styles. In the case of this movie, the effects are still being felt and it would have been worthwhile making the dilemma a little clearer.uble\\".  when you think about the fact that Both of Dan Brown's Novels/ movies had all of the action take place in 24 hours, and this movie also had all action take place in 24 hours, it represents an interesting contrast in styles.

B00HZ4ASEC|5|Laughed from beginning to end and enjoyed every moment.The plot line gave us a chance to laugh at how real life is as we mature.
B00VFTCGES|5|Awesome movie<br />Great acting<br />Great story<br />One of the years best
B007K3JFUQ|5|If Sherlock Holmes movies were ever fabulous NOT this movie is!!  Robert Downy is the best actor out these days and he's coming on strong!!
B00005OMTT|4|Possibly a misnomer - it is hard to recall many of these tracks ever being hits -this greatest hits set never the less contains everything you expect from Enigma: catchy repetetive rhythms, breathy whispered vocals and a clutch of well chosen samples, even if these are often the best bits. <br />Like Enya, Enigma main man Michael Cretu has never seen fit to tinker with a winning formula and and as such this compilation comes across as an original album, a feeling enhanced by the fact the songs segue seamlessly into one another.<br />Standouts include 'Gravity of Love' with its pounding John Bonham rhythm and clever use of 'O Fortuna'; 'Return To Innocence' with its joyous tribal chant and the late night moodiness of 'I Love You... I'll Kill You'. The ubiquitous monks pop up throughout and 'O Fortuna' reappears on the shouty 'Modern Crusaders'.<br />There are occassional lapses into background mood music ('Shadows in Silence', 'Smell the Desire') and the lyrics rarely rise above empty new-age guff, but for those that enjoyed the singles but find trawling through the original releases too much to bear, this is an ideal package.
B00JKGYSAI|2|The album is ok. I wasn't super impressed. The best songs don't sound like any of his previous stuff, and the ones that do are terrible.
B008Y720JU|5|Great movie!
B007W8S2MG|5|I honestly did not think I would enjoy this game from initial impressions.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!  A fantastic JRPG battle system that is COMPLETELY customizable, a set of excellent characters with wonderful depth, and a beautiful world to explore and play.  So much to do- so little time!  Its what you want a virtual life to be when youre playing a game (FUN).<br /><br />What a great experience and only possible on the beautiful vita's screen and excellent control scheme.
B00AESN8XY|5|awspme my friend had it and I took his tablet from him really edifying I can't even kill out the whole world on easy.other than that best game ever
B00H87RLJQ|4|Smart and amazing!
B008JGSM6G|5|Entertaining keeps your mind thinking for solutions and creates a challenge. Only wish there was a mode for Color blind the orange and red can be hard to distinguish
076781326X|5|Very good indeed. Just why it didn't get many oscars is a mystery!
B00N1W3O1G|5|AWESOME
B00EY7MFKS|4|Was initially interested following all previous connected videos from Marvel.  Good enough characters.  Developed slowly.  I stopped watching after first 4 episodes and wasn't drawn back.  But, I've purchased the complete first series and am watching it as I get the inclination.  Hopefully it will get a bit more interesting.  Had adequate action but I just didn't take a liking to it.  I hope it comes back for second season with a bit more interest.  Thus, I like it but that's closer to the bottom of that rating versus close to loving it.
6302862949|5|As a Gregory Hines fan, I was not disappointed in this movie. Though not a big ballet fan, Baryshnikov was excellent and a suprisingly good actor. Just the right amount of action and suspense make it worthwhile owning/seeing.
B00G32QIEG|4|It had a lot of action and had some funny parts as well. Good overall entertainment with a great group of actors.
B0089EHWQE|3|good somewhat predictable
0992251656|2|way way to complex
B007J4T2G8|4|Everyone at work has me thinking it was page after page of dirty sex.  Well there was sex.  But there was also a story line.  I've already read all three books.  Rereading now and catching so much I've missed the first time.  Yes I would recommend, but don't read to fast, you can miss so much. Just little things other charters say.
B008JFUO72|3|Iron Man 3 was good, but hardly great. As the next movie to come out after Avengers, expectations were high and this movie failed to meet them in the same way that Thor The Dark World did. Stark acts as if the rest of the Marvel U doesn't exist, even as he constantly references the NY battle. Where is SHIELD when a global terror network is terrorizing major American cities? Why doesn't he call Black Widow or Hawkeye or Cap for help? If this is soon after the battle, then why isn't Banner with him during the movie?<br /><br />Then there is the whole unnecessary destroying of his armors at the end of the movie, which serves no purpose seeing as how he will be suited up again in Avengers 2.<br /><br />Overall, a very disappointing movie. If you're on the fence, skip this one.
B000P0J09W|5|Come on, it's the goonies! Love this movie. Makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Everyone should watch it atleast once.
0062209493|5|I have a long commute and love books on tape for the 2 hrs a day I drive. This book was great ( finished already ) and will seek to purchase more.
B0030ZOYHC|5|For the Evangelion Collectors, they want to now this BR comes in Digipak and de box it's illustrated with images of Shinji and Rei, it's not the tipically BR box that you can replace and nobody cares, the booklet has really cool art.
0894803123|5|I bought this for my teenage son along with the Cuisinart ice cream maker and my son made a batch of vanilla all on his own, so it is easy to understand. I couldn't believe how delicious it was! The recipes are simple and it is written in such a humorous tone with plenty of illustrations. It includes some recipes for B&J flavors that are not available outside of their VT store as they have had trouble mass-producing them, such as cantaloupe. Highly recommend this book!
B002UNMWAG|4|Just short of the first one, but still good.
B003OFVIXG|5|The album has a cool feel all the way through. You will move your head around from time to time, enjoying the tempos.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4|This is another solid album from these guys.  It is truly amazing how these guys can consistently produce high quality albums.  I am horrible at giving in depth album reviews, but if you like Helloween at all, you should enjoy this album.  It prompted me to load up the 6 disc changer exclusively with their most recent works, minus the remix album.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Absolutely stunning! The combination of just the right amount of detail and amazing character writing in this unique world are sure to keep me coming back for more and more work by Sanderson. The type of book that you read and it stays with you for a life time! Ill be buyingthis and The Way of Kings in hardcover, and they are sure to be counted as some of my most prized posessions!
B0014BY72Q|4|Pretty good movie, no death race, but I liked it anyway!
B00BPDR3F6|3|The Signature of All Things is an interesting read. It is a saga, the story of a woman's life.  The story is a good one but it is at times  a tedious read.  Alma is a complex character, a scientist whose studies are rather meticulously detailed.  It was worth the reading time but could have been less detailed.
B005LAJ212|5|Perfect gift
B000002I8D|5|Never mind what he did later, and what image he has, this is a daring and truly heartfelt work. Daring because Collins did away with the dry Genesis approach for a variety of snappy R&B songs, heartfelt because he releases his frustrations of a broken marriage in moving lyrics. <br />  <br />The haunting \\"Droned\\" ending in the drum-orgia \\"Hand in Hand\\" really does it for me. The ballads \\"If leaving me is easy\\" and \\"You know what I mean\\" are both outcries of heartache perfectly backed by a silenced atmosphere, while \\"Behind the lines\\" is a crispy re-working of a Genesis classic: what a difference Phil makes here!
B00ELIF0WK|3|There was something a little creepy about this novel. The man who fell in love with a 15 year-old girl is bad enough but that he continues to hold a torch for her for 33 years is not normal. And to make him the center of the plot of the story is interesting but uncomfortable. Even while this behavior seems to be asking for suspension of disbelief, it is also virtually begging for moral condemnation. To find he is a fraud at the end of the story is almost a relief. The one thing that could have saved the novel from being somewhat sordid is the hero, but since he embraced success and abandoned his friend cum mentor his behavior is also problematic. I felt I needed a sympathetic character to make the plot more palatable.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1475067011 An Advanced Academic Reader: Book 2: The Complete Guide to Learning Reading Comprehension & Strategies (Volume 2)]]
B00GMV8LIO|4|Liked !!
B006LSZECO|4|Thought I knew where the story was headed and then wham--surprise twist! Not my favorite ending though. Maybe the author is planning a sequel?
B0098VYKSA|5|Hubby and I watched this on our Couch Date night and I was really impressed and it was good.  Would watch it again.
B003L77G06|5|Love it.  Amazing, funny show for the whole family.  Highly recommend. Waiting for the other seasons to hit DVD! Watch this show.
B00FJTYDKK|4|Worth watching.
B00003CXA6|5|From the begining to the end. Great Movie! I would recomend it to any Civil War buff. Very Entertaining. A must see!
B004Q7CIFI|5|Though I disagree with Mr. Kings insistence that Oswald was a lone shooter, this is in excellent journey into the past of hazy politics and a decidedly divided south. The book has a great &#34;feel&#34; for the times, even though, there is little mention of &#34;separate&#34; but equal past of the US. The conversations, the observations were realistic and helped me to &#34;see&#34; a time in which I never lived.
B000OQF6N6|4|Who would think we'd have a new Pumpkins album in 2007, seven years after the band had, well, disbanded.  Of course, the world knew Corgan would be reforming the band when he took out the full page adverstisement in the Chicago Tribune back in 2005, the same day his solo album TheFutureEmbrace, came out.  That was the first time the public was aware of Corgan's intention to reform the band.    Apparently, it was also the first time the actual band members themselves had heard of it.  According to James Iha, he hadn't spoken to Corgan in years, and D'arcy likewise was MIA.  When it came to actually record the album, only Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin, the Pumpkins drug-addict drummer (at least he was a druggy back in the 1990s), were on board.    So what does this all mean to the band's image and the public'c perception of the album?  Note, I'm not talking about the actual music on ZIETGIEST, which is actually quite good.    Cynics felt Corgan was trying to cash in on the Pumpkins' name, since no one has really paid that much attention to his solo efforts, either with his one-off band Zwan, or his record FUTUREEMBRACE.  People tend to dismiss ZIETGIEST out of hand, simply because it only features half the original band.  Both cases (though there may be some truth to the first charge), are not really valid, or if they are valid, don't really effect one way or the other how the music actually sounds, or diminishes the Pumpkins' legacy in the least.    Now, some bands can survive personnel changes.  Some can't.  The Doors couldn't survive Jim Morrison's death, even though they they have toured in recent years under the moniker Doors of the 21st Century, till Densmore sued Manzarek and Krieger, an so changed the name to \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" still a Doors derivative.  I'm a huge Doors fan, but didn't even bother with this distraction.  Then we have Led Zeppelin, who, after John Bonham died in 1980 after choking on his own vomit due to drunkenness, wisely called it quits.  R.E.M., perhaps unwisely, decided to remain an active recording unit after the departure of drummer Bill Berry in 1997.  Then we have The Who, who not only recorded two albums after Kieth Moon's death in 1978 (they would not record a studio album for well over twenty years following these two panned records), but continued to tour and even record a new album after John Entwhistle's death in 2002, leaving only half the band.    What does all this mean to The Smashing Pumpkins?  Well, a lot actually.  It proves when it comes to personnel changes, you must look at each band individually.  To take one aforementioned example, Zeppelin quit because the band's success relied totally on all four members.  You could probably argue the same with R.E.M.  With the Pumpkins, however, that's never really been the case.  Sure, D'arcy and James helped contribute, but they are also there to service as much a part of the image of the band as for what they brought to the sound.  And here's why.     The Pumpkins have always been about Corgan, almost to the point where you could argue that of all the major rock bands to emerge in the 1980s and 1990s, the Pumpkins sound the most like a backing vehicle for Corgan's music.  Most of the Pumpkin's songwriting is credited to Corgan.  There's been allegations that SIAMASE DREAM was almost entirely recorded by Corgan himself, as he was not happy with the band's playing.  As it's always been about Billy anyway, though I do miss Iha and D'arcy, their absence doesn't mean this isn't a Pumpkins record.  That allegation would have a lot more weight of D'arcy, James, and Jimmy all recorded an album without Corgan.    As far as Corgan trying to cash in on the Pumpkin's name, I have more respect for him than that.  While I do think it's true he is trying to get back into the forefront of rock audiences, I think it's more about trying to get back into the mainstream than to do with pure money.  He should be set for life anyway, but who the hell knows with celebrity finances.    All that said, what about the actual music itself?  Well, thematically, it's something of a departure from the band's previous subject matter.  Corgan said the album was largely about \\"love, loss, and the government\\", and largely in that order.      The music itself is largely in the vein of their previous album MACHINA, only without the confusing-as-hell storyline (if it even does have a real plot to it, which I doubt).  The music is hard driving, with plenty of guitar solos, etc, and phenomenal drumming by Chamberlin.  For those looking for the next MELLON COLLIE, don't bother.  ZIETGEIST doesn't have the eclectic songwriting that made MC so fun to listen too, nor does the band branch out in so many different territories as they did on MC.      Chamberlin has said that was intentional - they wanted to keep the sound of the album more basic, and not really get far out into the whole artsey-fartsey scene.  \\"The mindset of the record was to put our best foot forward and not get too artsy. We wanted to try to create a body of work that was concentrated enough to bring back a fan base and invigorate a new fan base. We kept it pretty close to the chest, and we didn't branch out too deep into art zone while we were writing the record.\\"  It's sad, really, because it was fun seeing how far out the Pumpkins could really get out back in the mid 1990s under Corgan's leadership.    The band has never been really overtly political, and this is the first really political record Corgan's ever made.  Actually, this political awareness gives critics a lot better ammunition against Corgan than the whole idea he's trying to \\"cash in\\".  It's clear from the whole affair that Corgan is using ZIETGIEST as a bid to become culturally relevant again in an era where the media and the public really haven't been following him for the last several years.      As there's been a lot of political commentary in rock and roll, from Greenday's rock opera AMERICAN IDIOTto the soon-to-be very dated Neil Young effort LIVING WITH WAR, you could make the argument Corgan was using politics to make himself a voice that people listen too again.  Even the coverart, which reminds one of the famous ending of the 1969 film PLANET OF THE APES, feels rather reactionary.  To Corgan's effort, the politics doesn't sound forced, and he does incorporate his political ideoligies pretty well into the Pumpkin's image, but it still feels rather odd, given how unpolitical the band has been for the majority of its lifespan.    Overall, a good record, and sounds, minus the politics, a natural progression from ADORE, MACHINA, and the never commercially released (but widely distributed) MACHINA II.  Some good rock songs too.    CHART POSITION:  Album: US #2, UK#1  \\"Tarantula: #2  \\"Doomsday Clock\\": 81  \\"That's the Way (My Love Is): #23    The following B-sides have been released: Death from Above (4:06), Steller (6:22), Zeitgeist (2:49), and Ma Belle (4:08).

B0060D3BWK|5|I watch this every year got Halloween. Sometimes even when it is not in season. Great cast and stillstill funny after so long.
B000051VWW|5|I NEVER get sick of this album.  Few albums are timeless...This is one that I expect to be listening to in 25 years.
B00HDMMISA|5|Amazing!
B0089LOG02|4|I thought this book was very good. It shows us that an elderly person also had many hardships in her life.
B00M4ADWTK|4|My only complaint is that Maleficent is such a stellar Disney villain that I hated to see her given a softer side.  Having said that, it was a thoroughly well imagined retelling.  I liked the moving almost from the very beginning.
B00HWWUR1Q|5|Loved this when I watched it at the theater. Can't wait for the third movie. If you loved The Lord of The Rings movies, you'll like this movie.
B00G5G7EXY|5|Cute, cute, cute. I love this movie. I have always been a fan of Disney movies but this is one of my recent favorites.
B009EE6WXC|5|Excellent
B00BD99JMW|5|I bawled my eyes out because become so attatched to character Tris, but I like the the auther provided an epolige showing that Tobias was doing ok after the loss. The divergent series was awsome and was a nice thriller!!! I can't wait to read more books by Veronica Roth!! I reccomened this book to all people who love a good romantic/thriller books!!!!!
B005HP2JAM|3|It was filmed beautifully but should be a shorter film. Less interviews may have possibly made the subject more interesting.
B00G9JW4GO|5|Its an amazing game. My kid loves spend hours playing it. Is the best investment so far,  yes! recommend 100%
030758836X|1|I read the book on my Kindle and was captured right away.  The story line was interesting from the beginning, although I questioned whether I liked any of the characters at all.  I heard there was a big twist at the end, but who knew the twist was that the story just stopped.  There wasn't an ending, there was no wrap up, there was no plot twist (at the end anyway)...nothing.  It just STOPPED. I gave this one star because the beginning of the story was interesting enough to make me read through to what I expected to be a very good ending.  Oh well.  Save your money.  *By the way, one of the reviewers stated that the author admitted she had no ending and that her editor had to help her finish the book.  Really?  I thought when writing a story one knows of the ending and works through the story toward that ending.  Can't imagine how the book was published in the first place.
B007IXWKUK|5|If you like drama, suspense, love, laughter and life lessons!!! This is the book for you and it will leave you wanting more!!!!!
B009VB97EY|1|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I'm quite surprised that this was wildly popular and garnered a sequel, yet Showgirls is considered the worst movie ever made.  Don't get me wrong, Showgirls was horrible, but this wasn't too far off.
B000EGDC14|5|Good joyous goodness they've created another excellent album.  Alison and Will, just keep pumping out these babies and we can be distracted from all the tripe out there.  And in an odd way, I'm actually glad there's that idiotic mp3 revolution.  As an audiophile who considers Alexis Park during CES to be heaven (with different degrees, of course), I recognize that it's forced labels to put a lot more effort into releases.  Hopefully the same thing eventually happens with the film industry and they get off their butts and adopt Maxivision 48, but I digress.  This is one such release that makes itself well worth the purchase.  Even the 16/48 LPCM stereo studio mix is a big deal compared to the Red Book disk.  There are also no transmission restrictions on it, so you can send it to an external DAC/Receiver with zero problems.  The downside is only that the original mix was a bit heavy on the infrasonic end compared to the CD master, but Red Book simply lacks the refinement of what they had in the studio.  On extended-range speakers the studio LPCM sounds better.  I would imagine the Koss electrostatic and my ER-4S would also work well.  The CD (and the singles) are good matches for warmer \\"dynamic\\" headphones where the LPCM DVD mix's extreme low-low end can be excessive.  And Mikey Stent, YOU STILL THE MAN.  Nice to also see Dave Bascombe contributing on Number 1.<br /><br />The tracks that hit me hard right now:<br /><br />Ride A White Horse<br />Fly Me Away<br />Time Out From The World<br />Number 1<br /><br />I'll review the rest later.<br /><br />Update: The DVD video extras are beyond generous.  The music videos are reference quality anamorphic transfers that showcase the art form better than anything else I've seen.  They look perfect to me.  I did notice some pops at the end of some of these.  I'm not sure if it was my workstation or the disc, but I hope my imported & driver-matched headphones weren't damaged.  I went through multiple pairs of the same model before finding the one I liked the best and I only use this one for recreational listening.  Scary.<br /><br />The live performance has the best lighting I've seen since the Beautiful Garbage tour.  Think I'll have to get their performance DVD now.<br /><br />I still can't believe how candid they were in the behind the scenes footage.  That's fantastic to see her without makeup in the studio.  But boy, does she clean up well.  Number 1 had me giggling like a weirdo.nly use this one for recreational listening.  Scary.

B00IK590UI|4|great movie !
0316228532|1|Because the book arrived dirty, and I'm just disgusted.  It seems like somebody with dirty hands who was eating potato chips must have handled it.  NOT what I expect in a new book!  It makes me wonder if Amazon is just going down the tubes. I do want to read it, maybe after I've gotten around to washing it.  But I'm busy resenting the condition of it right now.  Yuck!
B001BR5F4C|5|I think a lot of reviewers are forgetting the fact that Kill Bill vol 1 and 2 are great movies. $40 for two great movies in high def isn't a bad deal.    Back when this was released on DVD years ago people kept howling not to buy it because you should wait until The Whole Bloody Affair comes out. Well guess what, years later it still hasn't come out on any format. Stop holding your breath for it. Its supposed to be what, 5 hours long?    Also, these are the theatrical versions and i'm fine with that. I own the japanese versions and theres not much difference. Definitely not enough to miss out on owning such a great movie.
B0064X7FVE|5|helpful when planning days off
B00H3X54FI|4|Lorde is a very talented group.  I have really enjoyed listening to the music
B00DR0PDNE|5|Product easy to install and easy to configure. Works as advertised on the manufacturer's website. The You Tube and Netflix funcinaram perfectly!!
B0066W1AZK|5|this is just chess. easy to adjust skill level gradually and nice to be able to undo moves and learn from mistakes. great for sick days when you're alone and bored
0525953094|3|I thought this was the worst of the three. The first book was outstanding. The second less so. This one not at all. Perhaps it is because of my familiarity with WW II and the aftermath, but I thought the author highlighted too few of the significant events, and some which were not all that significant. He also showed a definite bias toward the effect of what he highlighted, which I thought was unwarranted.
B00I8H6X58|1|What happened to Hollywood? I figured since this movie won acting academy awards that it should be a good story. Not the case! The story line was flat. It does not delve deeply into any issues which the story is based upon. There is no sense of drama or suspense. Once you find out the lead character's mission (which is very early in the film) the story stops moving forward other than the character's change of attitude toward other's who are different than him. A little research by the writers of this true story would have gone a long way.
B000002N2Z|5|If I could give an album more than five stars this definitely would be it. The singing is nothing short of magnificant. Chino Moreno is the BEST vocalist in the world. He can sing, rap, scream and do everything a singer  should be able to do.  Adrenaline also has some of the best guitarring  ever. Stephen Carpenter and Chi Cheng make the perfect guitarring pair.  their guitars show much originality and quality. Every riff is different  from the other. They can be fast and pulsating or slow and melodious. The  drumming, it can be said , works closely with the guitarring. Abe is an  excellent drummer but it is clear that his role is to emulate the guitars.  Deftones take a bow, Adrenaline is one of the best albums out there. Best  tracks:bored Engine No. 9, Root, 7 Words and Minus Blindfold
B006R6ZP6U|4|What a twist. I enjoyed the whole movie; for a fantasy it was amazing. It's not hard to figure out the fairytale characters but each one takes on another  meaning.
B005S9ELVC|3|This should have been a great movie! Josh Brolin was perfect as the honest cop wanting to stymie the Mafi King.A bit naive...Ryan Gosling was at his usual best as the suave,well dressed , not naive policeman! I t  wasn't believable that Sean Penn did'nt seem to have an inkling that his woman was carrying on with the cop....isn't that why thugs are all around with their guns....keeping an eye on everybody?? Exactly  when does he find out and  why the mistaken idenity! Brolin's wife was a great character!<br />All in all, for such a supposedly big Mafia East coast operation, you weren't shown much of what went on.Just the cops talking about it.The movie sort of left you up in the air...wondering if there should be a sequel!
B0001HLVS2|5|All major and minor actors are perfect representations of the harsh life aboard a sailing war ship of British/French war. In spite of the difficult daily life portrayed in the movie the contrast of the vast ocean and 'small' ships that depended on wind for propulsion is awe inspiring. I Watch it several times and never tire of the realistic portrayal of life and death.<br /> Great blend of dialogues, main plot, sub plots and music score all keep it interesting without a boring second.
B00T40UK20|5|This is worth every penny, which cost fewer of them than others I've had. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of some of the more expensive ones, but it has everything I want, i.e. one touch answer, redial, etc. and it was simple to set up, easy to use.
B006L9B6TI|5|I read this book and followed the daily devotional.  It was like magic.  My attitude about life and other people changed dramatically...even people I have real problems with.  I changed people around me with my new thankful attitude.  It was life changing.
B007TUAHVQ|5|My 12 yr old grandson loves this lego toy.  I ordered for him for Christmas because I'm an online shopper.  I hate fighting crowds in the malls!  I received in a very reasonable time and will order again next year.
B0015DYIH2|5|I chose the ratting because it couldn't be better. It is truly a fantasy life where everyone selflessly thinks of the other family members and is loyal and devoted with nothing else being more important.
B00T3DNKIE|5|I loved it.  I am so glad I purchased it....
B002E01MI8|5|FANTASTIC
B0019N8P2W|5|Daria is by far one of my favorite tv shows of all time. It was probably one of the most loved and influential shows of my teenage/adulthood and I check all the time for word of MTV finally releasing it. Please, for the love of all that is holy, release this in a set on DVD. I would pay out the nose for the collection.
B00JCW0BCY|5|This book will encourage a discussion that all families should have.  Priorities for life should be thought about and shared.
1401937519|5|Beautifully written, informative and with a message we all want to hear. I had heard of NDE before, and Anita's experience went straight to my heart.
B006GLLREU|5|This is the 2nd time I have watched the series. I love the morbidity and the craziness of the family.
B004LROMQG|5|Have complete set to this point.  Different spin on Merlin as a young Merlin.<br />Good acting, interesting story line and good entertainment.<br />Can't wait for season four to be released.
1780674880|4|Love the pictures but I find my Sharpie fine points bleed through to the next page. The paper is quite thick but it still goes through which is disappointing. Beautiful illustrations though!
B006JSXYPA|4|Like all transformer movies, this is a jumble of shapes and forms and noise. But also like the others (maybe a little less so with Trans-2), the movie is a lot of fun. With a good sound system (and I really do mean GOOD), the sound is ear-shattering and hugely enjoyable. On a small screen, (I found the same at my suburban cinema when I first saw this movie), there is so much going on and so much hardware moving so fast that it sometimes gets hard to distinguish the goodies from the baddies. I loved the steals from so many other movies, including (SPOILER ALERT), the Star Trek/Spock references, the various Alien and Predator looks of some of the Decepticons.<br /><br />I am glad I always/usually watch the specials after the main movie because seeing and hearing how Michael Bay directs and how some of the actors prepare for a scene, I would have been a little put-off in some places. But the specials did show the extraordinary access they were given to areas of Detroit, Chicago and the NASA facilities. The behind-the-scenes stuff on the Blu-ray edition is comprehensive, extensive and impressive.<br /><br />In general, a fun movie, good use of 3D and loads of BIG sound with quite a few very low bass that rumbles through the floor..
B00127RAJY|5|I am terrible at working out. I am not very good in making time to work out, but this workout makes it a lot easier! I like the mix of strength, cardio and abs. By the time I feel like i am about to die you go to the next move. If you are a working mom, I would highly recommend this DVD.
B00AIQP9DE|5|it is fun trying to find all the object need to get them it was blast intertaining you will enjoy this game
0634049011|5|I have been using this book with my students since Barrett started putting together the opening chapters. I first used it with my advanced students, those who already had some experience with the 5 patterns of major scales. Immediately they returned saying that it helped them understand the scales and visualize the fretboard more easily.<br />Having my students walk in with diagrams of scales and intervals for me to check has been an incredible reversal of roles. Normally I would draw diagrams for them to study and play. Going over a chapter and sending them home to complete and play the exercises gets the student involved in a way that the normal draw, demonstrate, &quot;see ya' next week&quot; cycle never really reaches. It gives the student an opportunity to take home and digest the information that was normally only available during the lesson.<br />Teaching people to operate a guitar and teaching music on a guitar are almost completely different tasks. I found the first six chapters to be very helpful when initiating beginner and intermediate students into the world beyond the 3rd fret and power chords. There is something in this book for nearly anyone interested in knowing how to play the guitar.<br />If you are an instructor you will find the comprehensive, organized approach very thorough and focused. If you are self-studying the instrument or a student seeking more than just another tabbed-out solo this is a book you can keep coming back to throughout your journey. I highly recommend it.<br />Billy Burke
B00AKKGX4W|4|With over 750 reviews I don't need to add much more than I really enjoyed the story.  The Duke was so different in that he was such a sensitive soul and really wanted to do some good in the world.  The heroine was a bit different as well.  She had a weird childhood and a bit of scandal attached to her name so she really tried to fly under the radar.<br /><br />This was a very interesting story for a period piece.  I enjoyed it and I would recommend it.
0788816454|4|I love the movies this guy makes! The entire movie was like Saturday Night Live during the good years. I can't do anything if I don't say 'You can do it!' at least once. I laughed my (edited) off. Buy it.
B008QE9XD2|5|Great Product Fast Shipping
B000FVQYYK|5|This really is a great band and a great CD.  Reminds me a little of both Coldplay and Radiohead.  The songs have depth.  You'll find yourself swaying to the beats as well as considering the lyrics.  Not to mention the lead singer has a beautiful falsetto voice at times, which is rare.  Especially in the song \\"Starlight\\", my favorite.  I also liked the astronomy-esque themes.  Hope you enjoy it!
B00005N5S5|5|Item as described.
B00AGJ4HC2|5|Excellent card game. We have played this a lot since I received it. Easy game to learn. Great gaming mechanism.
0312360266|1|marked,i thought was going to be a fun,cool vampire story but it turned out to be the other way around. theres no need to explain whats it about since there are million of reviews saying the plot.Zoey,the main character is a shallow,selfish girl and not at all likable.the book seems to be written by a teenage girl with anti-christian issues.thats my biggest concern it the book.every few chapters,they criticice chrisitian and calls us hypocrites. DO NOT LET UR CHILDREN BUY THIS BOOK and IF U R A CHRISTIAN DONT BUY THIS BOOK! i made a mistake buying it.  I never give books a bad review buy this is just plain bad! Theres this horrible scene where they r making a ritual to their goddess and they pain a 5 pointed star on their forehead and start doing a sermon and drinking wine like if making fun of the church or something,this books sucks,its horrible.
B00DEG4Z1W|1|Don't bother downloading this app.  It only has two heads that you don't have to pay for.  The controls are hard to use and some of them just plain didn't work.  There is not much play ability in this app.  They toca yoga hair salon, your kids will probably like it better.
0525457585|4|Micheal Ende wrote a fantastic book. (Taking place in the land of &quot;Fantastica&quot; no less.) It's no wonder this book was made into THREE (poorly done) movies. It's not only great for children, but I reread recently, and it's still great. The story is richly told, with plenty of detail for the imaginative and the &quot;believers&quot; in miracles. Great book!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good hidden object game! Better than most I have played!
B000002JR8|5|Far Beyond Driven is by far my favorite CD of all time by any artist.  It is really heavy with great vocals and the songs are just great.
0374214913|4|This book is a quick read with a great plot, I really enjoyed the concept of the novel.  Very well written.
B000028U0Y|5|I bought this CD, and the Live at San Quentin CD, after seeing the movie Walk the Line. I have some other studio Johnny Cash CDS but they pale in comparison to Live at Folsum Prison. This is pure entertainment, raw in some places as the vocals aren't always perfect, but you expect that in a live recording. I flat out love this CD and it hasn't been out of my player since I got it.  <br /> <br />Johnny is edgy here, a man who will do what he pleases to entertain the cons. The background sounds of the prison make it all real...this wasn't some nice arena, this was a prison full of bad guys. Johnny even has to ask several times for  a simple glass of water. How many of today's stars would do something in a place like Folsum Prison. <br /> <br />Luther Perkins guitar sounds incredible, and by not having a large ensemble to play with the guitars really stand out and make the music so much fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Others have commented on Cash's singing \\"Greystone Chapel\\" written by inmate Glen Sherley. This is an amazing song. Only Johnny Cash can cuss and sing prison songs like \\"Cocaine Blues\\" then deliver songs that are like religious-like hymms with a country flavor such as \\"Greystone Chapel\\". <br /> <br />This is the best live album I have ever heard and probably the best country music album too.
B004ODLUGM|5|The Gruffalo tells the whimsical story of a little mouse who goes on a stroll in the woods.  He comes across several other creatures - predators who all think the little mouse looks quite tasty!  The witty mouse must do his best to keep from being eaten!  He invents a story about a terrible monster, The Gruffalo, who will of course devour all the predators.  Our little hero is pretty pleased with himself when his enemies run away - but what will become of him when the creature of his imagination turns out to be not quite so imaginary after all?<br /><br />I highly recommend it!  Featuring voice talents such as Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane, the tale has a lyrical feel that takes you along on the little mouse's journey.  The animation is beautiful, the story is sweet and overall it may become a family favorite.  Hubby and I enjoyed watching the behind-the-scenes feature - it was fascinating to see how the animation team brought everything together.
0553378384|5|One of the most insightful books in my collection. It is so eye opening, and amazingly accurate. Definitely if you want to grow as a human being, buy this book. If you doubt the validity of astrology, figure out where your nodes are and then dive into this book. I guarantee you will strongly  question your skepticism and feel empowered in your vision of the course your life is taking.
0312330871|5|This story by Agatha Christie is very, very suspenseful.  It is also creepy.  It does not have a detective, which seemed strange at first, because I am used to following Poirot and Miss Marple as they solve the crimes.  I did not really like any of the characters but I was still surprised when each one was killed.  When one of the murders took place, pretty much any one of the survivors could have been the killer.  Also, you get to read what each of the characters are thinking; the story is not just from one character's viewpoint.  Is the killer one of the ten guests on the island, or is there a hidden person?  The ending really got me.  Of course, you finally end up with only two characters and one of them turns out to be the killer, but he doesn't stop there!  You'll have to read the story yourself to find out what happens at the very end.  (this review is by M.Charette)
B00VRYCGLO|5|It so far is awesome and I get hooked on playing it and can't wait to finish the next level. I like that you can pause it and resume the game.
141694737X|5|This is one of our all time favorites.  We've got 4 girls -- twin 5 year olds, a 3 year old and now a 8 month old.  They all have loved this book very much.  Would recommend to start using this book with babies early on.  At around 10-12 months, it ended up becoming a &#34;must read every day&#34; staple.  It's great for those who want to do sign language with their kids too, as you can use sign for elephant, lion, etc. The kids love opening the flaps.  Would definitely highly recommend this book!!
B004LOMB2Q|5|Love EVERNOTE!! Best tool to keep all your little thoughts together and in place..It is great! I use it everyday for everything from work to personal thoughts and notes.
B00AZMFK3K|5|This version of this great movie comes with 2 discs; one Blu-Ray, the other a regular DVD.  There are some extra's like an interview with J.J. Abrams, the Director and the actors, plus info on how the movie was made.  No spoilers here, but it was surprising to learn that the Enterprise Engineering Room is not a movie set.<br />Plus, you get a coupon, good until Sept 2015, to download a digital copy of the movie...which I did to my iPad Air.  I had a problem trying to access the download website, but a email to Paramount got me a very quick response with a quick fix.  So, bing, bang, downloaded.  Very cool.

B00C061I1M|4|I went from Uchida's version of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 17 to this full album. And I truly believe Mozart would have tapped his foot. If you have Mozart idealized and the Black Key's tapping their feet to your music you are there. Go Valerie. Someone tell Oprah about this girl so she can work her worldwide poisonous magic and spread the word. Blues, gospel, soul fusion, whatever this is, I am with you Valerie. Let's go.

B000UCEJEQ|5|It is certainly heartening to know that any day Annie Lennox decides to step into the recording studio, she'll be able to delight her fans and the world with her words and melody.<br /><br />Dark Road opens with its sunken melancholy before breaking into a rapturous  bridge then closing with the quiet calm it began with. Such is a display of the multitudes of emotion Lennox is capable of packing in. On songs like Womankind and the archetypical anti-HIV/AIDS tribute, Lennox attempts to sing about female empowerment and knowledge, resulting in two gorgeous anthems. The latter, ambitiously includes the backing vocals of 23 female artists and a resounding sign-off that features a short African interlude. On other tracks (Big Sky, Lost), Lennox touches on love, loss, and hurt like no one else ever knew.<br /><br />At her most experimental, Lennox shows her mastery. Through the Glass Darkly (probably inspired by Jostein Gaarder)begins like a piece of Zero 7 while Coloured Bedspread is a damn fine electronic synth track destined for the clubs.<br /><br />Of course, Lennox's deep haunting voice is never compromised throughout the album.<br /><br />If there's one album (along with Feist's The Reminder and Radiohead's In Rainbow) you have to listen to in 2007, Songs of Mass Destruction is the one that serves to add some soul into music. (A)
B00846F1YW|1|I thought I would try out this game since it was free. The first part went just fine and then I got some award or something and it wouldn't let me go forward untill I posted my award on facebook or tweeted about it. There was no going forward without posting about it so I uninstalled it. The end.
0689835604|5|I can't say much about this except that it was a gift for a great granddaughter.  My granddaughter tells me that she reads this to her eighteen month old daughter, and they both enjoy it enough to share it over and over again.  I read it too and found it a fun story.

B000006OAM|5|This is an album im not afraid to say i listen wayyyyyyyy to much...hihiihi......An album that makes my entire collection.  These songs are moving and natalie has a great and powerul voice.  If yu wanna buy an album of hers this is the one.  Its actually perfect. 10/10 and i would give it higher!!!!!
B000I0QL82|5|Delivered early; love this movie; dancing;singing all upbeat.
B0000028RR|5|Most good bands (even some of my favorites) kinda [stink] at first; their first album is usually pretty weak but shows potential. Now granted, I have not heard a Rage album that I didn't like; but this debut doesn't have potential, it is already there. <br />If you've even heard of Rage Against the Machine, then you probably already know about their unique sound that mixes metal, hip hop, and even a bit of punk. You probably already know how their guitarist is easily the best  around today, and how Zach de la Rocha rolls poetic yet anger-filled words off his tongue in a mix of rap and actual singing. If you don't own any other Rage albums, this is certainly a great one to start with. If you own some other ones then you will definately love the sound on this CD. This CD is an absolute must have for any fan of any genre of rock. The guitars are incredible, the lyrics are great, and this is instrumentally one of the best CDs ever made.
B0097GVJWQ|5|Great graphics, fun puzzles and it is a long game. I feel I got my moneys worth. Great time waster.
B008MG1E4A|4|When you've finished a book one test of how good it was is if you wanted more. This book passes that test at the conclusion of most chapters.
B001OQCV6A|2|The movie played most of the way through but there were several spots that it skipped.  Kind of disappointed since it said that the DVD was in good shape.
B00003CX8Y|5|This movie is fantastic and it came in a timely manner, in great condition and was a great price.  I was very happy with the purchase and the seller.
B000148KK2|4|I'm a jazz fan.  I like Evans, Jarrett, Mehldau, Van Halen, and especially Petrucci.  I also like long legs and girls hiding from Bessie in the other room.  Hence, this album was a natural for the Hopperoo.  I bought this Krall cd on a lark (curly blonde, long, stringy, hair, and a piano make a good impulse buy) and wasn't disappointed.  The songs are moody and this is real jazz, not jazzpop (Norah Lips for example).  I think the influence of Elvis MacManus most helpful here.  Oh, and the long, curly hair.  Delightful!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Well done app. Great fun. I played this game for 18 months and never had to spend a dime. Then I turned the Wi-Fi on and the game tried to update. It totally wiped out all my game and data. The NEW version doesn't work on the older Kindles. Hopefully the new game is as pleasant as the old and G5 didn't get greedy!! Will try again in the future when I upgrade.
B00L7PJE4A|5|Very happy with our purchase and delivery.

B00000DCHI|5|Billy Joel is one of the greatest icons NYC has ever produced. <BR>This compilation is so massive that I need to divide my review for Volume 1 and for Volume 2. <br />My #1 favorite from Vol.1 is Scene From an Italian Restaurant.<BR>I like this song not only because of this song's dramatic development from calm to uptempo but because of his excellent pitch of storytelling. Moving Out is another of my top favorites this is a nice driving rock music with impressive stacattos and pianos. The Stranger was a major hit in Japan starting from impressive whistling. Just The Way You Are is one of my favorite Karaoke repertoires. Say Goodbye To Hollywood(live version) became huge hit in 1981 but it was originally from Turnstiles in 1976. Those who hasn't turned out to be huge hits are gems in its own rights. Captain Jack grows on me after repeated listens. The Entertainer is nice uptempo pop gem showing what he is. New York State Of Mind is nice night music fitting New York mood.<BR>Oops! Piano Man is standard piano flavored pop tune. <br />Part 2 of my review on Volume 2 will follow soon.
B0088W8QSU|4|Good Show

1476712042|5|I fell in love with Abby and Travis! Once you start reading you can't stop.
B000OCZ7RA|5|((This review is based off the US CD album.))<br /><br />Thank you for not taking so damn long to put out another album since you last one. And thank you for a \\"return to form\\" (clich&eacute;d perhaps, but true in my estimation) albeit in a new direction. Not since The Downward Spiral have I enjoyed one of your albums so much. I have to admit that though I like With Teeth, I don't love it, and it has not gotten a lot of play in my CD player. Well baby, that has change with Year Zero. Political and Social issues aside, it is a great concept for an album and a great sound. I actually like Capital G, contrary to another reviewers take, and it is the most \\"poppy\\" of the songs on this expansive album. I really love the sound textures that are explored, and the music itself really engages me. I would rank it up there with Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine, my two favorite NIN albums, though it has a more \\"Broken\\" feel to it in places. It edges out The Fragile for my 3rd favorite, and it well ahead of With Teeth (sorry Trent).<br /><br />All in all, I like this new direction stylistically and musically. The lyrics are an improvement over With Teeth as well. Keep experimenting, you seem to find your muse that way. Superbly engineered, excellent audio quality. Bring on the sound collages and I look forward to hearing what follows. But for now, my ears are feasting...<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars ...I'm hoping the best is yet to come.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, I've been listening to YZ for over a week now and it is still a rewarding experience. Some may say it does not have the depth of former albums but to you I say, keep listening. I am finding new things to hear on every spin, and the songs are growing on me even more -- getting under my skin. Truly a complete work, I journey through it then want to hit repeat to take the journey again. YZ also got me to throw With Teeth back in my CD player and I have to say that I am appreciating it more than I used to.<br /><br />While I found Year Zero almost immediately accessible, that by no means makes it simple and I am do discover new things with every listen. Don't compare it to previous works and enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />UPDATE (013108):  I've had this album for a while now and it just keeps getting better with repeat listens.  I discover something new in each song, some subtle variations that are revealed only after many spins.  A good sound system helps too.  This is far from being just noise -- it is an expertly crafted sonic landscape.  I am really looking forward to YZ Pt.2.  Until then, if you like this, then check out [[ASIN:B000X9PNOQ Y34RZ3R0R3MIX3D / [CD/DVD Combo]]]that by no means makes it simple and I am do discover new things with every listen.

B000FA57US|5|A good, worthy sequel in the series.<br /><br />The film starts with a flashback of the ending to Halloween 4. After that, it's shown here that Michael just barely gets out of the way of the bomb or whatever it was that the cops dropped down the shaft. But he's injured from all the gunshots. A hermit takes care of him. A year later, he kills him. No gratitude from Myers. But what do you expect from someone like Myers, knowing him? He then gets his mask and on he goes for his next collection of victims. He gets a different version of the mask for his film. Jamie, Rachael and her friend (I think her name is Tina) return from the 4th film as does Loomis. In this film, it's revealed that by touching Michael at the end of the previous film, Jamie develops a telepathic link to Myers. She can sense where he is and when he's near. She doesn't speak till later on. While I understand why Loomis kept telling her for help, I felt bad for her. But after Tina's death, she agrees to help. One of, if not the best dialogues is when Myers waits by a tree and Loomis tells him to go home if he wants to stop the evil that will destroy him too and that she'll be there waiting for him. I'm guessing by she, he means Jamie since she is his target.<br /><br />A scary scene is when Myers stalks Jamie, who sees Rachel's dead body and hides. A very, very sick sequence is when when she opens up and falls down a laundry chute, but tries to get back up when he repeatedly stabs it trying to get her. It shows just how sick, relentless, and determined Michael is.<br /><br />One of the best moments and an emotional one is when Jamie says, \\"Uncle.\\" And he stops. She says, \\"Let me see.\\" He removes his mask and you see a tear on his face. Many say it symbolizes that he feels guilty or sad for his actions. You can draw your own conclusion after the revelation of the next film. This only lasts for a second as Michael snaps back into rage mode when Jamie touches him. Had that moment lasted longer, maybe....just maybe that would have been the time for him to say something as he was human and showing emotion for the first time. Another sad scene is Rachel's death. As well as Tina's, who sacrificed herself to save Jamie as both were being stalked by Michael after the Halloween party at the barn Tina went to was finished.<br /><br />Myers is finally stopped when he's trapped and hit by Loomis with a tranquilizer and beats pn him Michael with a wooden object while saying \\"Die.\\" repeatedly. Not the best way to stop him. But it proved effective for the time being. Michael is taken to prison, but is freed by a mysterious Man In Black. More on him will be revealed in the next film.<br /><br />By the way, this is the first and only time I've ever seen Michael kissed. This happens when he wears a different mask and drives Tina to the Halloween party. She kisses him thinking it's her boyfriend. But she gets angry when he doesn't respond to her. After she gets out of the car, he talks off the mask and puts on his Myers mask.just maybe that would have been the time for him to say something as he was human and showing emotion for the first time. Another sad scene is Rachel's death. As well as Tina's, who sacrificed herself to save Jamie as both were being stalked by Michael after the Halloween party at the barn Tina went to was finished.<br /><br />Myers is finally stopped when he's trapped and hit by Loomis with a tranquilizer and beats pn him Michael with a wooden object while saying \\"Die.\\" repeatedly. Not the best way to stop him. But it proved effective for the time being. Michael is taken to prison, but is freed by a mysterious Man In Black. More on him will be revealed in the next film.<br /><br />By the way, this is the first and only time I've ever seen Michael kissed. This happens when he wears a different mask and drives Tina to the Halloween party. She kisses him thinking it's her boyfriend. But she gets angry when he doesn't respond to her. After she gets out of the car, he talks off the mask and puts on his Myers mask.
B000089RVX|5|I surprised myself by buying this album--I am a die-hard classic rock fan who rarely listens to anything made after the 1970s (even though I wasn't born then). Evanescence is not the sort of band I normally listen to, but I have to tell you that I couldn't be without this CD. Amy Lee's vocal talent is obviously the first thing to mention--Lee's incredibly captivating, powerful voice is at once a contrast and an accompaniment to the surprisingly polished, heavy guitar riffs of Ben Moody and the instrumental work of the rest of the band. The lyrics are dark but addicting, and I often find myself unable to get any number of the album's tracks out of my head. I love every song on this album, but &quot;Going Under&quot; &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; &quot;Haunted&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; are my favorites. Even if you're not a fan of this genre, give this album a shot--it'll surprise you and leave you eager for more from this band from Arkansas.

0374290024|3|This is a contribution to the body of writings addressing the question of why the \\"West\\" rose and came to dominate the \\"rest\\". This is a question that has interested scholars - especially Western scholars - for at least a hundred years. Different answers have been produced. Some early scholars looked to biological superiority although there are few takers for this line of thinking these days - expect in far right fringe groups. Others look to cultural attributes such as the Protestant work ethic (Weber and RH Tawney) but also more general attributes of Western Christendom going back to the Middle Ages (David Landes).  Karl Marx emphasised the importance of the development of industrial capitalism in the West in making it a leader. Another school looks at material factors such as the easy availability of coal in places like England (Pomeranz) or the discovery of the Americas and the \\"free kick\\" provided to the West in the harnessing its resources (Pomeranz and Frank).    For Morris, the answer is geography. This does not mean a crude geographic determinism that permanently locks in advantage. Rather, while the West has led in social development, that is the sum competencies of a society for at least 14 millennia according to Morris, the \\"East\\" not the West led between 550CE and about 1775CE. It was \\"brute material forces\\" determined by geography and their intersection with social factors that explains the waxing and waning of the respective leads of \\"East\\" and \\"West\\".      The authors methodology is to assess and rate on a numeric scale the respective capabilities of West and East over a long period by means of a number of measures. These are energy capture (manifested for example in the ability to produce goods and deploy force), urbanisation (as a proxy for organisational ability), the ability to process information and the ability to deploy military force. He uses this to construct a kind of historical human development index to measure the capability of societiesover millennia. This of itself is an ambitious task and resembles Angus Maddison's work to construct a measure of the size of economies in the past including the distant past.       The author commences his argument by looking at what he says were the natural advantages of the \\"hilly flanks\\" area in the Middle East, namely the wider variety of crops and animals available for domestication compared with other parts of the world and more favourable climate. The argument is that these circumstances gave the Western descendants of the Hilly Flanks an early advantage. He goes on to survey the subsequent rise of the two \\"Western cores\\", namely Mesopotamia and Egypt to show an early lead for the West in the achievements of these two societies.  The East then plays catch up and by the time of the Han Dynasty had just about caught up.      The advantage given to the West by access to the resources of the Americas which were easier to get to from Western Europe than the Middle East or China is the key turning point giving the West its later advantage. It goes on to develop this advantage and eventually crowns it in the nineteenth century with the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution allows the West (led by England) to accumulate huge amounts of wealth and power and use this to dominate the East and the rest of the world.     That advantage however is short lived. The East is quick to absorb and assimilate the technological and organisational capabilities of the West and begin rolling back the tide - even without the advantage of American resources or an equivalent. Japan leads the way with its crash programme of modernisation commencing in the 1870s. China begins modernising in the 1950s and India in the 1990s. He sees India's lag as a product of the fact that it was directly colonised by the West so holding it back. China and Japan avoided this fate and could begin to modernise earlier. He sees the West's lead rapidly coming to an end. Some scholars refer to this process as the \\"Great Convergence\\" as a mirror to what is called the \\"Great Divergence\\" when the West after the 1770s took the lead.      The attempt made by Morris to answer the question he poses is interesting. He covers vast ground and collects together a huge amount of information. This of itself makes his book worth reading although for anyone with some basic knowledge of world history, there might be too much basic information that is not really necessary to make the points that Morris wishes to make. There is also nothing really new in his ideas (other than perhaps use of a historic HDI) but his work is an easy to read synthesis of other writings. Morris however makes a good case to convince the reader that in the end it is not matters of culture and race that matter but the \\"brute material\\" elements, consideration of which he skilfully weaves into the narrative to explain why some develop faster than others and achieve dominance. In this regard, Morris may be closer in his broad approach to that of Frank, Pomeranz and Jack Blaut than the cultural determinism of David Landes and Max Weber, particularly his emphasis on the key advantages gained by Europe in first getting to the Americas and harnessing its resources to get one over the \\"East\\".     The main weakness of the book is the focus on Europe and North America on the one hand and China on the other as the basis for his argument. If the task is to explain who led and why, the limits that the author places on his enquiry - which he himself admits - becomes problematic, in particular, the omission of any serious consideration of India and Islam. For parts of the period in question, there is a strong case that India was the leader not China or the West. India not China contained the world's largest economy for much of the period after 200BCE and held that position until the early modern times according to data complied by the economist Angus Maddison. That economic power was also mirrored by the cultural pull of India - \\"soft power\\" we would say these days - from the time of the Mauryas. Indian culture and influence spread far afield - into South East Asia, Central Asia and even China. Chinese or Western influence at the time did not have so wide a reach - as Morris acknowledges. Indian science was also widely admired and studied for example at the House of Wisdom in Abbasid Baghdad and in China. There is little evidence of a reverse movement of knowledge and ideas until much later strongly suggesting that the \\"centre\\" at the time arguably lay in India at least until the Tang era in China and the Abbasid in the Middle East. India therefore was at least as much a leader if not more so during the earlier period in question.     The omission of Islam also is a deficiency even if there is greater coverage of Islam than of India. Under the Ummayads and Abbasids, a case for Islam as the leader can also be made in all fields using measures of economic power, political power and cultural reach. During the High Middle Ages, it was Westerners who studied Arabic and learnt from Islamic science rather than the converse. It was also the case that the Islam by the end of the period had established dominance in India and parts of Europe and was banging at the gates of China. Even in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans arguably were the dominant political power in Europe not Spain or the Austrian Hapsburgs.     A narrative based on the Euro-American and Chinese world may not therefore be   well suited to addressing the basic question posed. \\"Who lead and why?\\" Morris' narrative is  the \\"G-2\\" version. A \\"G-20\\" version might do better in dealing with the subject. The work of world history by the father and son McNeill team \\"The Human Web\\" might better answer the question at hand using a much broader canvass even if this work of history does not expressly set out to answer the question posed by Morris.    There is also a question of what Morris means by the \\"West\\". He makes the statement that for all but two of the last 14 millenia, the West has led the way. This statement requires inclusion of the Fertile Crescent area of the Middle East as belonging to the \\"West\\". This no doubt accurately reflects the canonical view where the story of the West is said to begin in Mesopotamia. However, the problem is that what is today the Islamic world of the Middle East also traces its beginnings to the same roots and arguably has a better claim to these roots as theirs rather than belonging to the \\"West\\". Mesopotamia was also linked to the beginnings of Indian culture in the cities of the Indus with a direct and more immediate connection than that of Europeans to Mesopotamian culture. Indeed, it is not uncommon to understand the entire area of the Fertile Crescent and the areas of Iran and the Indus Valley as a common hearth where agriculture and urbanisation underwent a common process of development. Mesopotamia in this sense belongs more to the Middle Eastern \\"core\\" (Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Anatolia and the Levant) and to a lesser extent India, than it does to Euro-America. Morris seems to deal with this problem at times by implying a broader concept of what is the \\"West\\" by including in it Europe as well as the Middle East. This is an idea that deserves further exploration going against the usual definition of what is the \\"West\\".     What though do Asians and Africans make of the whole debate? Intriguingly, the best known writings on the question \\"why did the West lead\\" come from Western sources. There appears to be a lacuna in scholarship on the problem by the \\"rest\\". The answer as to what the rest thought however may be found most easily not in the work of scholars but in the writings of early Asian and African nationalists and nation builders. They did in fact address the question in detail and come up with some answers. The question for them was \\"How did the West do it?\\" and the complementary question of \\"what do we need to do to catch up?\\" For the Chinesereformers during the late Qing era, the Meiji era Japanese and nineteenth and twentieth century Indian reformers, it was a matter of mastering and applying Western technology and institutions in a selective way without the need to assume Western culture as such. No large non-Western society saw the solution to the problem of \\"catching up\\" in a wholesale absorption of Western culture such as through conversion to Christianity. They gave a more narrowly focused attention to  technology and selective adoption of Western institutions. Indeed, it cannot be said that those who have adopted Western religion and culture in a more wholesale manner such as in Christian Africa or the Philippines have as a result acquired advantages over those who have not done so - such as Japanese, Indians (and even Chinese despite their adoption of Marxist-Leninism for a while).      The proof of the pudding lies in the eating in that the simple formula used first by the Japanese has proved effective including China and India of today.  These societies have narrowed the gap or caught up without taking to heart the message of Max Weber, David Landes or RH Tawney. Non-Western nation builders have narrowed or closed the gap not by reading Calvin's institutes but by paying attention to and reading engineering and science manuals - and also adopting some of the instruments of social mobilisation first used in the West, importantly the nation state and all its trappings. Morris' emphasis on brute material forces therefore adds up when tested against the actual record is asking why do societies rise and fall. Indeed, Morris at the end of his book  poses the complementary question \\"How did the rest start catching up\\"?  The simple formula pioneered by the Japanese and followed by others comes close to the answer - and this becomes apparent to anyone in the world of business who has some first hand knowledge of the rapid industrialisation of China and India - even just in witnessing what was one day afield worked by farmers becoming an efficient modern factory virtually overnight. This happens against a context of largely continuity and evolution of the local culture. The same forces that allowed the West to rise went on to allow the rest to catch up or start catching up - without the wealth of the Americas.    Finally, there is another question. Why did the West at the point of its dominance have to let go of its empires in Asia and Africa? As the leader by such a margin employing the four point index suggested by Morris, should the West have not been able to easily hold on using its huge advantages? However, it did not. This may suggest that Morris' indexes of capability need to be tested further to explain how a less capable society through mobilisation of its own (on Morris' argument) lesser resources can get rid of the more capable society's political dominance? The answers may involve more than just an aggregation of quantifiable material capabilities as a survey of the history of colonial nationalist movements and their eventual success against powerful Western empires suggests. How the weaker can overcome the stronger is not easily understood using Morris' index. If history could indeed be reduced to the ability to understanding its processes through a capability index, this would make the historian's task so much easier - but less satisfying. If there is a master key to history, it may not be reducible to a capability index of the kind devised by Morris (and he does not make that claim) - and that master key is yet to be found.

B00288KNLS|4|Coraline is a visually stunning claymation type of film that is very reminicent of Tim Burton.  It revolves around a mom and dad and their daughter Coraline moving into a huge and sorta creepy looking victorian manor which is also occupied by other weird tenants. It is based on a children's book, but the look and feel of the film is certainly on the creepy side. Personally, I think younger kids would get frightenend after watching certain parts and there is this high wire act by these 2 old lady tenants that creeped ME out.     The plot is actually a tad on the confusing side, especially towards the end, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The fantastical elements were wonderfully executed and the grim, washed-out feel to the film really created the mood. There are a few great but weird characters and it seems like everyone has some mystery to hide.     It's a shame it didn't really get much recognition when it came out into theaters, but I predict it will do nicely on DVD.
0671015206|5|A great read for anyone who wants to be independent in thought, attitude, and finances. It is book that teaches action and self awareness as well making you define your idea of \\"wealthy\\".  This book shows hows so many Americans are hell bent in keeping up with the \\"Jones'\\" only to find out the \\"Jones'\\" are fools and you've just wasted your life in the pursuit of trivial possessions.
B001DJLCRC|5|My husband and I recently watched &#34;Breaking Bad, Season 1&#34; and LOVED it--couldn't wait to get to the next episode and I've already ordered season 2. It has dark, comedic, even warped elements to a pretty darned interesting story line. I would say if you like unusual drama and humor, give season 1 a try and see what you think.
0679720200|3|Okay, so I know it's a \\"masterpiece,\\" but I didn't take to this book like I thought I would (more importantly, should).  It's probably just me, but in the end, I needed there to be more to it... to some, therein lies the beauty.    In The Stranger, Meursault is a man of dull-character who lives a life that we can all relate to.  He holds a job, has a girlfriend, has an apartment and has a friend or two.  But what he lacks is the importance of it all.  Had he not been so devoid of any complexity his life would have taken another direction... and in the end, his existential way of life was ultimately his demise.    It's an easy read with a linear path... you'll gobble it up in a day or two as I did.  I'll read it again in about a year with the hopes that I'll get something more meaningful out of it.    Have fun,    David Tobias  Redondo Beach, CA

We'll soon be getting her more books by the same author.
0670024856|5|From the opening pages, the reader is immediately transported to the 18th century. This sprawling story begins with Henry Whittaker, a lad who, beginning at a young age, values wealth above all else. He thieves his way from native England and across ocean voyages to far away lands, where he pockets rare botanical specimens. After becoming wealthy in the quinine trade, he settles in Philadelphia with his Dutch-born wife, Beatrix. He amasses an even greater fortune there and builds a grand home with extensive grounds, naming it White Acre (a play on his name) along the lines of a Biltmore or Hearst Castle.<br /><br />Beatrix is a sturdy, unsentimental woman who keeps their business holdings' books and records. In 1800, their daughter, Alma, comes into the world needing for nothing, but wanting to know everything. With unfortunate looks, “her face was far better suited to a grown man than to a little girl,” she is an awkward only child. Henry and Beatrix expect Alma to pursue knowledge with a vengeance. She is as comfortable questioning adults at dinner parties as she is in her own company.<br /><br />Often left on her own to study and read, Alma delights in finding trunks full of books: botanical, historical, scientific, religious and, of course, sexual. Though she has thus far kept no secrets from her parents, she recognizes as dangerous her developing fascination with one explicit book in particular and the sensual obsession it has aroused in her.<br /><br />In an effort to fill her dinner table with interesting guests, Alma meets an artist who is a master at painting orchids. Though also highly intelligent, their similarities end there. His focus is on the spiritual, supernatural and magical. For all her interest in facts and hard knowledge, Alma is unable to avoid his pull. But she misunderstands his intentions completely and is left staggeringly unsatisfied and bereft.<br /><br />I found this to be one of the most compelling novels I’ve read--ever. Even at499 pages, the narrative is fluid and engaging. Exquisitely written, the characters and settings come alive. Highly recommend.

B00003CY0V|5|The Swordfidh DVD arrived within the projected time in fine shape.  This was a trip down memory lane for me, and it was as good the second time as the first. An early casting of Travolta as the antagonist and Haley Berry as his \\"partner in crime\\" was good :-)!!  The rest of the cast was in fine form also.  While this will not rate as one of my all time favorite movies, it will certainly remain in my DVD collection for \\"when I am in the mood for\\"......

B00EHMFC78|3|I was a little disappointed in this one.  It was a decent book but there was an additional plot that i felt did not need to be part of this book.  I think the Nazi plot could have been one whole book all by itself.  Without giving away too much, i also felt certain aspects were rushed.  General Pak, a rescue operation in Korea.  It all just seemed rushed.  Lastly, Jessica Reel is becoming a lot like Michelle King.  They could be the same person almost.

B000001G16|5|I bought this record several years ago after coming across it accidentally in a record store. I was looking for Bon Jovi records I didn't have and this one stood out. I didn't know Richie had even done a solo record so I took a chance.  It's one of the best records I own - It's that good!!!  All Bon Jovi fans know Richie is a brilliant songwriter and guitarist but on this record, he also showcases his amazing voice. He really puts a lot of soul and emotion into his singing and it really is something special. When I saw Jovi perform in 2007, Richie sang 'I'll be there for you' and he sounded incredible.  Don't let the fact that Richie is a member of Bon Jovi put you off getting this record if you're not a fan. It's completely different to anything Jovi have put out. It is very much a blues album which showcases some of Richie's best guitar work. If you like Eric Clapton or Eric Johnson you must get this. It's just a shame Richie didn't make a true follow-up to this as 'Undiscovered Soul' was in another direction. Come on Rich, make just one last solo record, PLEASE!!!!!
B008CJ0KI8|1|After all the hype about this cd, I was looking forward to hearing it. Was I ever disappointed. In fact, I threw it away.
0525421580|5|As soon as I got Will Grayson, Will Grayson in the post I had to start reading it straight away! So (as we were going on holiday) I read it in the car, 1h30. Then read it when we arrived for a further 1h30. Then later that night (after we got back from the day out) I read for 1h and finished the book. I struggled to put it down when my family told me we were going out! The book its self is amazing!  I wasn't waiting as long as I thought I would be for the book, I thought i'd be waiting 2 weeks. It arrived after 8 days, so I was really happy with the speed. No complaints here!

B00QJH5O9K|5|Any King Crimson fan would love this latest line up doing new exciting versions of their classic songs. For those who had not seen their last tour would enjoy the edition of three fine drummers lower and forefront of the rest of the band, a ground breaking idea from band leader Robert Fripp. Sadly only half of the songs from the tour are here, and a second useless loss less non video Blu Ray disc with the same songs as disc one. With todays digital sound I feel no need for the Loss Less disc two. I don't like having something I wouldn't use. I really don't think that many people are set up for it anyway. I smell cheap padding just to sweetin' the deal. Lastly, I miss those nice artistic covers, but there are some very nice pictures of the band inside. All and all, this is a must have CD. And I can't wait for more, padding and all.
B001AEF6IQ|5|Just What I Wanted
078322608X|5|Yet another film that views the future of humanity as a grunge pit, about as darkly as Gilliam's own &quot;Brazil&quot;, but houses a fiendishly perfect underlying message.<br />The film has all the workings of a modern thriller. The time travel intrigue is very credibly done and the plot is riveting. The decor looks cobbled together from the debris of the 20th century. Cities are either scabby Skid Rows or towering skyscrapers. Scientists still work in laboratories that look like old postcards of Thomas Edison inventing. Bizarre killers and villains are hurled at our protagonist (Cole, played by Willis), and there are many bloody fights.<br />Bruce Willis is superb in his rendition of a man from the future, especially his impish reverie on listening to simple music. Brad Pitt does more than he typically does in movies, which is perhaps why he overdoes it. He almost makes the manman he plays a laughable caricature.<br />But all of this is just the plumbing for what the movie is really about -- its vision. With a little pondering, forced or naturally invoked, one can actually identify with all the craziness of this movie. Beneath its slick sci-fi veneer, it actually couches a rather gloomy message of how we are letting our supposed technological advancement govern our fate.<br />Brilliiant script, excellent visuals, and some delectable but pithy insanity. Highly recommended, to purchase, not just rent.

0394178009|5|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is a sheer joy to read.  The protagonist is one of the greatest comic creations of the twentieth century.  In John Kennedy Toole we find yet another example of a staggering talent of whom we can only now say &quot;what if...&quot;  However, I think we are extremely lucky to at least have this gracious gift of his left behind.  &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; will be providing laughing fits for centuries to come.
B002JXK5VU|4|Great imagination
B007HACDLK|4|Mitch Rapp again kicks a** and takes names, this time in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Well written cloak and dagger thriller from Vince Flynn.
076115678X|5|Very helpful - I am finally a curly girl all the way and loving it!
B002XED5TY|4|I'd give it 3 stars but the wife and nephew said 4... watched it for the first time in 15 years and it has lost a bit of luster for me. Not Tim Burton's finest but worth watching for Nicholson's Joker. Michael Keaton does a pretty good job as Batman. Video quality was good but not the best I've seen.
B005K17RU0|5|:) this app is.great, works well and is.just all around great. lets me know the weather wherever ism, and Irs free
B008EKOIN8|4|A fascinating book. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because you have to be pretty devoted to food and how it happens to really enjoy it. The connections he makes between food and all aspects of life are truly creative and make good sense.
038533348X|5|Cat's Cradle absolutely demonstrates the power of imagination, the only thing we earthlings possess which is technically limitless. This book releases your mind and takes it out for a spin, at the same time feeding it a few juicy morsels of food for thought. Starting from the beginning disclaimer---'Nothing in this book is true.'---Vonnegut's precise and elegant prose will take your breath away. Way recommended!
B00008PX8P|5|When I first heard about this item to be released, I almost lost my mind, but was still just a little skeptical.  How many of us have purchased at a record show or through the internet a \\"European recording\\" or what most of us know as bootlegs of a Zep concert.  Show of hands please.  You in the back, don't be shy.  Usually grainy with horrible sound at best.  But it was still the band preserved on tape.  Anyway, I thought that the old shows would suffer from age and just the recording technology available back then. Then I opened up the great package and placed it in the dvd player.  Seeing \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" performed live is worth the price of admission alone but don't forget the classic Zeppelin catalog.  The greats from Physical Graffitti, \\"Kashmir\\" has to be seen and heard to be believed!  I live in Pittsburgh and missed my chance to see Zep live twice due to Family death or Bonzo leaving this world.  I had tickets for both and years later this is just an unbelievable package.  The video that Page worked on is just great and the sound, well, even better.  This deserves 101% if such a thing exists but I can only give it the 5 stars that are possible.  If you are a Zep fan, you already own this, don't you?  If not, run, don't walk to the nearest store because you don't want to wait days for the mail.
B0096DZKZC|3|good game but its not a great mobile game
B000QRIGLC|5|I love true stories. As a Veteran I found this book to be accurate and void of exaggeration.  A real page turner. These Men are true Hero's.
B0036EH3U2|5|I'd heard it was good, but never really read any reviews. Didn't know what to expect but once I started watching I was totally captivated and couldn't stop watching. Exellent series, great story and characters.
0345803485|1|I wanted the original not the movie version. ..but its ok...
B000ZHBB0Q|5|Remember watching this when I was younger and now sharing with my children... this is going to be a family classic for our family!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Buy Frozen now - you won't regret it! It has great songs and lots of laughs! Definitely one of my favorite movies.
0060512806|5|I really loved SNOW CRASH, but was a little daunted by the length of this book.  I bought it when it first came out, but my son borrowed it and never gave it back.  Finally, I gave up waiting and bought it again.<br />I'm glad I did because this book is probably the most enjoyable read of my adult life.  I'm for once GLAD I'm a really slow reader because it's over 1100 pages and because the pleasure is just that much longer.  I'm nearly finished now, the fun's nearly over, but I'm comforted by Stephenson's having published the first two books of his Quicksilver trilogy...
B000AP04OM|5|We are a Julie Andrews fan. Of course this movie is by far her best! You will love the story and the wonderful singing by all!  Enjoy!!!
B007EE4XKI|5|Really enjoyed this book. Looking forward to reading the second and third one. Really makes you feel like your part of the return.

0439023483|5|The Hunger Games is a book that seized me by the throat and didn't even let me go, even when I read the last word on the page.  It is the kind of book that I had to force myself to put down so that I could go to sleep, and that I immediately picked up again upon waking.  It is the kind of book that demanded that I sit down and read and read and read until I finally discovered what had become of the characters.  It is vividly and masterfully written, the kind of book that is guaranteed to stick with me for quite some time, the kind of book I am sure to read again and again.    Though I had been aware of the book's popularity before I read it, I didn't really know anything about the premise--and I'm actually glad that I didn't.  The brutality of it shocked me in a very visceral way.  I was horrified by its depiction of such a grim future, and by the very thought of a society that would pit children against one another in a fight to the death.  Needless to say, this is a very intense book and one that is very violent as well.  I don't think that it's a reason to prevent a mature child from reading it, but I do think it's a reason for a parent to read it as well.  This is a book that needs to be discussed, whose themes need to be explored.    Yes, The Hunger Games is a work of fiction, but it does contain many elements of truth that are relevant to our world today.  The brutal regime that controls Panem is not that different from the brutal regimes that control many parts of the globe even as I type these words.  I think it is only natural to want to shelter our children from this kind of violence, but I feel the book provides a very good jumping off point for such discussions.  If the plight of those who are oppressed and whose human rights are violated by their own government isn't an issue important for children are aware of, I'm not sure what is.    The book also has a lot of important themes about compassion and complicity.  In a world like Panem, compassion mightseem like a very dangerous emotion, as it may distract a person from their fight for survival at any cost.  But is the moments of compassion and grace in the book that underscore our capacity as human beings.  Even in the face of a world gone mad, compassion is the one emotion that guarantees there will be some light, some hope in that world.  As the book shows, the act of complying is far more dangerous because it removes something essentially human from us, leading us down the path toward indifference to the suffering of others.  As children enter their difficult teen years, these are extremely important themes.  It is at this age that children are first beginning to learn that, while it may be easier to comply, the only way in which to be able to live with one's actions is to live with compassion.    As powerful as the novel's themes are the novel's main characters.  Though Katniss is the embodiment of the survivalist and Peeta is the embodiment of compassion, they are both more than that.  Katniss especially is extremely complex.  She is neither a hero nor a villain, but a very human character trying to cope in a brutal, heartless world.  Her actions are sometimes selfless and sometimes selfish, but she is always someone with whom the reader can identify.  How could anyone possibly know what is truly in their heart when dealing with the sort of reality with which Katniss has been forced to deal?    I was simply blown away by this novel.  It deals with so many important issues without being at all preachy.  Instead, by making the world in which Katniss and Peeta live so violently, disturbingly real, the reader can do little else than think deeply about the issues central to the book's themes.  By allowing the reader to live vicariously through Katniss and Peeta, it enables us to form a deeper, more profound understanding of what it means to be a human being, and what it means to be truly courageous.

B0025VLELQ|4|This is a classic film that was only meant to be like a summer drive-in filler but there are solid performances by actors with solid resumes. It is a straight forward story with out the pretentiousness of Lucas. That the film makers were able to sign up Robert Preston makes this a must see film. What makes this an historic landmark was that the film's budget drove the film makers to using of CG.  The CG stands up even today despite the leaps in CG technology since.
B003VANOFY|1|I am not someone who is super serious audio quality, that said this headset sounds pretty good, when it actually works. This headset is one of the few things I have ever bought that I actually completely regret. This headset will lose signal multiple times per hour when the receiver is less than 2 foot away. A few times a day, for no reason it just starts to emit a static hiss, to get it to stop I have to turn it off, unplug the receiver, plug it in, turn it on SEVERAL times. The battery life is very unpredictable, I can leave it charging over night, unplug it put it on, game for and hour and it die. The software freezes up alot, will say the battery is about to die, the headset will chirp the low battery warning. Ive ran the headset over 8 hours while it chirped low battery just to see how &#34;close&#34; the estimates were,<br /><br />If this headset was a reasonable price, say 50 bucks, I wouldnt complain one bit but I paid 100 dollars for its such a disappointment. Do not buy this headset, I know the thought of having a wireless headset is nice, but this is not the headset for you.<br /><br />Logitech, I have forgiven you for a substandard webcam, keyboard and several mice, at least those lasted a year before they disappointed me. This headset didnt even make the 2 month mark, no wonder you just have a 30 day warranty.<br /><br />Do not look at how many good reviews this headset has. Talk to people you know who own it, they will tell you how much of a waste of money it is.
B0015DYIH2|5|you guys are out of your minds this book is the BEST book known to man. i have read it exactly six times and each one i have not failed to have a shiver run up and down my spin. i love nessie and bella and edward. [ edward is HOT] i am twelve and i read at a high school grads. reading level.
B00HDMMISA|4|Perfect book to take to the beach this summer.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Loved the ending.
B00005JLRT|5|I'm very surprised by the customer reviews that I've just read.  I just watched the movie last night and feel that this is the best Trek since Wrath of Khan.  I do like First Contact but felt that this one had an even deeper plot and wider storyline.  The action and effects were fantastic.  I've always thought that STTNG was lacking in the number of battle scenes, though I loved the series and have begun acquiring the series on DVD.
B00EHMFC78|5|One of Baldacci's best.  I've read all of his books and enjoy all the characters (Robie/Reel, Maxwell/partner, Camel Club).  Keep them coming!
0689865384|5|I enjoyed this book. While I was hesitant to give it five stars, (I'd say it's a four-and-a-half star book), the entire book left me excited to read more. I bought this book after remembering that a few of my classmates had read it back in the day, and immediately after finishing it, I ordered Pretties. The concept is incredibly intriguing. The characters can get muddled and confusing, such as all the people besides Tally, Peris, Shay, David, and maybe Croy. A lot of the Smokies did not seem like whole individuals to me. Other than that, I think Tally, while unlikable at many points in the story, is realistic because of her flaws. The pressures of her society cause her to put being pretty above all else. If she were entirely perfect and always made the right choices, her character would seem much more fake. The romance was surprising and exciting, like it should be. All in all, this book was one of the best reads I've picked up all summer.
B00KQYNGVA|4|Picked this up on more or less of a whim, and am I glad I did! Been listening to it in the car player for 3 days straight! And I can't remember the last time I've done that. Some really great guitar workouts throughout and especially on track 6. I'm a drummer and the drums on this are superb and mixed right where they should be. Like other reviewers this is not Blackwater Park.  But it is some fantastic music played by some very good musicians. Very, very good prog rock with an air of jazz fusion wafting through the proceedings.
B0091X2K0A|5|this movie has always been a favorite of mine, gets into the irony of all the loss that we suffered as a country.
B005HEVBGG|5|When I first heard of this show and its premise, I was thinking, &#34;O boy! Another goofy show like 'Lost in Space.'&#34; I was so wrong! This is a wonderful show!! I love Janeway and all the other strong women (even Seska) and how everyone works so hard together to get home. It's nice to see a female captain for a change. If the future is as bright as Roddenberry painted, then being Captain would not depend on gender or race. I would recommend this show to any non-Trekker. It's got great messages and wonderful action.
B00HBQWGXK|4|A good Reacher novel, with some good twists.
B0000042MY|5|Perhaps my favorite musical score.  Preparing to be abandoned on a deserted island, this CD would definitely be included in my suitcase.
B0009UC7QQ|5|I used to remember to watch this movie on teveliosn, and I bought it, love it... it is really funny and good too. Good movie!
B008UCJ7KO|2|Wow, a whole lotta nothing.  This was such a disappointment.  I can't believe I was anxious for this.  Too many starts to other stories and other characters thrown in and not enough development of the main story.  You could skip this, go to the fourth book when it comes out and not miss a thing.<br /><br />Gideon is disappointing.  I love the way his character loves Eva completely but he doesn't appear to be making much progress with his own character.  He is stagnant.  Eva seems to be trying to maintain her independence but, at the same time, appears dependent on a Gideon that's gained more control over her emotionally while continuing to be incapable of emotional development himself.  I find them both maddening.  He continuously says \\"Trust me\\" while everything looks so suspicious.  He wouldn't settle for that why is Eva's character settling for this?  She just seems foolish not questioning or pushing for more or better answers.  The story has gone from intriguing to disappointing.  It's always been fantasy but at least it was interesting.  Not so for this book.<br /><br />Speaking of not interesting, the ending was ridiculous.  Talk about anticlimactic.  Abrupt!  I had to go back and check to make sure I hadn't missed something, accidentally skipped pages.  The book just suddenly ended.  Very strange.  Did the author decide she wanted to go out for coffee instead of write that day?
B00DW3GDQW|5|Excellent depiction of how the Japanese amassed a powerful navy to attack Pearl Harbor
1567184855|5|This book, written by an educated man is a series of accounts by people who have had many lifes experences and have learned not to accept the blind faith that almost all religions demand. This book will open your mind to other possibilities to explain our existence as continually evolving and learning souls. It just makes sense and if you are as lucky as I have been, to find someone other than Michael Newton to show me who I have been in past lives, you will strengthen your belief in God. You don't have to abandon your religion to accept the knowledge Michael Newton has found, but it may put todays religions in thier proper place -- man made - not God. I have lived many lives and each of them for a reason, but I know and understand one thing: I am one of Gods Warriors and when the battle between good and evil comes, I shall be a part of those many, many souls that prevail over evil and what's going on today within the Muslim world - is not on the side of what God wishes. What you will gain from this book will open your mind to additional learning and maybe change your outlook on your entire life.
B00070Q7VO|2|No, I didn't like the new CD at all. <br />He is going off 'the mark' of what works for him. Someone needs to tell Michael that he can't take ANYTHING and make it work for him. He has a niche in a certin type of music (big band, Sinatra, Darin,  etc.). THAT is his niche where he thrives not a remake of the Beetles and pop music! AGHHHH!
B005IA9JZO|5|Great!  Thanks!

B000001ES9|5|Rush started out as a hard hitting, no frills band and it is great to hear them again in their original line-up.  The exit of drummer John Rutsey and his replacement with Neil Peart ruined the band; they started to take themselves too seriously..
B004FPE4DK|4|Listening to the Irish band Villagers supporting the wonderful Elbow in their huge hometown Manchester concert the other evening I was reminded of the fine talent that continues to stream out of Ireland and in particular the ability of artists from the Emerald Isle to produce debut albums of such assuredness and maturity that they really must make others green with envy. If you have yet to hear \\"The year of the Jackal\\" you should beat a path on to Amazon post haste where you will also find \\"Early in the morning\\" from the new Dublin troubadour James Vincent McMorrow awaiting to press your aural delight buttons. A slight pause however at this point since before going into detail there is a need to address the Bon Iver issue. This is a recent phenomenon which sees mostly male artists employing a propensity to beat a retreat into some desolate rural hinterland in a hastily constructed log cabin and pour out deep melancholy in their wretchedness. McMorrow has partially done this by recording this album near the sea in a cottage somewhere off the Irish coast, that said the smell of the seaweed and the stiff Irish breeze has combined to produce songs of very sombre delight but also an underpinning soulfulness on a number of tracks which keeps the wrist slitting elements down to bare minimum. In addition to prove that he has a real sense of humour McMorrow has recently produced a truly unique cover of that highly irritating pop imp Willow Smith's ode to luxurious locks, \\"Whip My Hair\\" which can be found all over the music blogs and is undeniably great.<br /><br />\\"Early in the morning\\" has been released in the UK for well over a year but on the basis of \\"if at first you dont succeed\\" McMorrows label is giving it another shot which is commendable since this music deserves to be noticed. The album mixes a range of West Coast influenced songs like the beautiful \\"This old dark machine\\" which skips along at a fine pace and shows that McMorrow has chart ambitions. Opener \\"If I had a boat\\" does owe some debt to Justin Vernon at least in the first 30 seconds but McMorrow produces a shimmering vocal and a spare background and turns it into a special song with echoes of that old curmudgeon Van Morrison. A particular highlight is the intense \\"Down the burning ropes\\" with its almost Jeff Buckley intonations while the excellent \\"Sparrow and the wolf\\" edges into that territory currently occupied by Johnny Flynn. Possibly the best song on this album is the slowly building \\"From the woods\\" which builds to a stirring climax and shows that McMorrow is very much his own man in key compositions. A couple of tracks on here such as the title track are perhaps a bit to close to the Bon Iver ghostly register aesthetic for comfort but lets cut James Vincent McMorrow some slack since in the majority of songs on this album his muse leads him to produce some genuinely tender songs with vivid acoustic textures which makes for a fine debut.t\\" does owe some debt to Justin Vernon at least in the first 30 seconds but McMorrow produces a shimmering vocal and a spare background and turns it into a special song with echoes of that old curmudgeon Van Morrison.

B0036EH3UC|5|This review is specifically for the new packaging of the series on DVD, not the show itself. (That's already reviewed enough.)<br /><br />I had been watching the complete series prices because it was too expensive for me, so was figuring I'd need to wait another year or two to buy the set. I happened to check one day when it was on sale for only slightly more than a hundred bucks, so decided to go for it. But I was a bit hesitant because of all the complaints about the cardboard disc holders. (I've experienced scratching problems with other shows in cardboard slots.)<br /><br />I was delighted to find that they are now packaging the series in plastic cases! So here's how the set is presented and what's included:<br /><br />A very sturdy cardboard case holds the entire set. Each of the four seasons are separated into their own lighter cardboard slip cases. Each season case holds plastic slim cases in which each disc is stored.<br /><br />Season One:<br />* 5 discs<br />* Includes the original mini-series on the first disc<br /><br />Season Two (Includes season 2.0 and 2.5):<br />* 6 discs<br />* Includes both the aired and extended versions of the Pegasus episode. (Note that the extended version is on the first disc of season 2.5.)<br /><br />Season Three:<br />* 6 discs<br />* Includes aired and extended versions of Unfinished Business episode<br /><br />Season Four (includes 4.0 and 4.5):<br />* 8 discs<br />* The Razor TV movie is on disc one<br />* The case for 4.0 disc 4 also includes a disc for the TV movie The Plan. (You can decide to watch it then or save it for after you're done with the regular series episodes.)<br />* Includes aired and extended versions for A Disquiet Follows My Soul and Islanded in the Stream of Stars<br />* The last disc has the aired versions of the three part finale (Daybreak) and also includes an extended version of the three as a single episode you can watch like a movie.<br /><br />There are bonus features scattered throughout the discs, so check that menu item on each disc (or the back of the slim case) to see what is available. Even if you're normally not into DVD extras, you gotta watch What the Frak is Going on With Battlestar Galactica on season 4.5 disc 1. It's the most hilarious series recap I've ever seen.<br /><br />The set does not include a separate episode list, you just get the info listed on the back of each slim case.<br /><br />If you're like me and choose each episode individually to watch as you go along, pay close attention to which discs contain the extended episodes if you want to watch those versions. On some case listings they're included in the main episode list on the back, in some they're only listed down in the bonus features section. I didn't notice that change in the season four discs so missed seeing there were extended eps so only watched the aired versions.<br /><br />This new packaging of the complete series gets a big thumbs up from me. Though I'd rate it as 4.5 stars, the half star taken off for not including a complete episode and TV movie list booklet.you're normally not into DVD extras, you gotta watch What the Frak is Going on With Battlestar Galactica on season 4.5 disc 1.

B0040I09RM|5|What can I say? I first watched SOA when season 1 first aired and could not make it past the second episode. I had played out what the show was going to be in my own head and I regret it every day. SOA becomes one of the best shows I've ever seen and it all starts here. Make it to the end of the season and you won't be able to stop yourself from saying &#34;ok, just one more, then I'll go to bed!&#34; Every season of SOA is important to the mythology of the whole series and if your into that type of thing, SOA doesn't disappoint. My only wish is that the music was better! If you are a KROQ fan you'll love it, KCRW fan, you'll hate (most of) it, but luckily it doesn't take away from the brilliant story.

His chapter on the relationship of all life with humans is usually ignored by the faithful believers: They feed the same, breed the same, bleed the same.

0525950079|3|Read the Doomesday Book by Connie Willis instead.  In this book, Follett populated a world with 20th century inhabitants and labled it 14th century.  This book won´t take you back in time, you´ll recognize everyone.   Freud and Carl Rogers were around there somewhere. The characters say they feel the terror of the plague, but you won´t feel it.
B0070Y46UY|5|I usually read a book before watching the movie. The book did not disappoint. The story is riveting.
B00006RCNW|5|Without a doubt this is the best show on television.  I felt like I was watching a blockbuster movie rather then a basic cable television show.  Everything about The Shield is excellent from the Michael Chiklis potrayal of good guy, bad cop Vic Mackey to the top notch camera work and script.  This show will have you guessing from one moment to the next and have you glued to the set for the next ten hours.

B006PTL1QM|4|... ultimately not as profound an investigation into the characters of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung as it ought to have been, and indeed as it seemed it would be for 90% of the film. It's scarcely a film about Freud at all; Jung is the central character throughout. It's the ethical, emotional and intellectual turmoil of his life that shapes the drama; his divergence from Freud is presented as largely the result of sexual and professional jealousy on both sides, with just the merest hint of the impending catastrophe of anti-semitism and an even slimmer hint of the substantial incompatibility of Freud's and Jung's psychological models. Nevertheless, the very capable acting of Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Michael Fassbender as Jung keeps the film engrossing.<br /><br />The insurmountable problem is the acting of Keira Knightley in the role of the historical person Sabina Spielrein, first shown on screen as a flailing hysteric, then as a challenging patient significantly \\"helped\\" by Jung's psychoanalysis, then as the masochistic lover and manipulator of Jung, thus becoming the \\"wedge\\" between Jung and Freud. The characterological triangle is not entirely implausible. In fact, it might approach \\"fact\\" or at least insight. But Knightley so freakishly overacts throughout that the triangle loses its hypotenuse. Knightley's grimaces and writhings are hard enough to watch, but her spoken dialogue is horrible. She seems to be attempting a \\"Russian\\" accent in this English-language script that rightly should be in German. Alas, her Russo-English slips often - sometimes in mid sentence - into a twangy LA Valley Girl accent. And how's that for weird, since she is actually British by birth? Even if her accent were better managed, her speaking technique is amateurish; \\"stars\\" who are paid celestial salaries surely can be expected to have basic skills of dramatic elocution.<br /><br />I'm stymied about a proper rating for this film. As I said, I found it engrossing; ergo four stars, though Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three. There's also, to my mind, a failure of resolve in the abrupt ending of the film. Bang, it's over, and we are informed by crawling script that Jung survived his WW1 breakdown and lived until 1961! Sabina Spielrein and her two children were killed by a Nazi German SS Death Squad, Einsatzgruppe D in August 1942 in Zmievskaya Balka, together with 27,000 other victims.hough Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three.

B00C8S9W0G|5|If you are an Outlander fan, this is a must read. The Fraser clan is as entertaining as ever and Gabaldon does not disappoint. Great historical tidbits are interspersed with the fictional characters of this series. You will be left anxiously anticipating the next book.
B000062YAZ|5|Brand new, never opened, and great condition overall. Would recommend to others.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I love this game!
B001CXW8CW|5|This movie blew the top off of comic adaptations. The action is up there with the best, as are the effects. All of the lead actors make their roles utterly convincing, and that take a lot when so many people push the edge all at once.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's \\"Joker\\" character convinced me. I've known smart people, and lost people, and some who were both. Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" projected vicious insanity outward. Ledger's projected it inward. Even his flaking facepaint worked to convey what lay within, the way that ivy, lichens, and crumbling mortar convey what lies inside a ruin.<br /><br />Bale's \\"Batman\\" goes out on Ledger's limb with him. Batman retains enough sanity left to know that people need sanity; Ledger's \\"Joker\\" has spiralled in on himself, so that nothing remains for human contact. Somehow the Joker recruits cronies, despite their remarkably short working lives.<br /><br />In the end, they sit around discussing what all other the citizens of the city ought to be allowed to know - the six (or so) deciding for the six million (or so). If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, these guys have a fleet of trucks standing by to pave it for you.<br /><br />It's not for young kids. If you take your tweener or young teen, have a long talk after. Back in the day, good guys won, bad guys lost, and we all went home knowing who was who. That day is gone, and good riddance. Today, people need to think, even after a superhero/action flick. Is that so bad?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B000050XEI|5|I had been looking for this CD for a couple of years.  I owned this one previously and I used to use it all the time in my relaxation work with children.  After time the CD simply became worn out and I had to get rid of it.  I became very upset when I couldn't find a store to replace the CD but Amazon came to the rescue and I am happy to have this in my collection for work again.
B0001BKAEY|5|Unusually on the Hollywood standards these trilogy could be the most critized of all time. Let me tell you I don't know why. This movie was the perfect conclusion to a trilogy that has set up new standards on movie making. Since its very beggining to this awsome conclusion. You only need to watch carefully some outstanding scenes like Zion battle and you will see why John Gaeta and the people behind ESC has moved the gates on SFX to the next level. The SuperBrawl was one of its kind. Spider Man 2 and Superman and any other upcoming super heroe film: You better watch you because this fight was a standard. You will be judge by this one.<br />Do I love the movie? Hell yeah. This is not about a hardcore matrix fan giving an opinion -I AM- this is about the greatest Sci Fi Fantasy of our time.<br />April. . .come soon. . .I demand it!
B005C8ENI0|4|It was different type of movie!  It was not predictable movie about lawyers and crimes. Great Actors.  Worth the money
B006OOHYIC|4|Played the first game and thought it was great.  So far this is a good sequel with new strategies and levels.
B007ZKY7XO|2|There are no videos on this CD. The tracks:<br />17. Only The Horses [video]<br />18. Only The Horses [Behind The Scenes]<br />are nowhere to be found.<br />CD looks like it was made in someone's basement in a hurry: the text on the CD and sleeve is even misspelled!<br />Do yourself a favor and get it from iTunes!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game!
0805066349|5|Very well written on what happened to the Indians.  Very emotional.  The movie is great too.
B00A285OOW|4|Love all her books
B0051ANPZQ|3|This was billed as a youth novel but I missed that.  As a more mature reader, I thought it a bit simplistic, but still interesting and touching.  A feel good book in the end.
B00177YA1K|5|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great pair.  The play well off each other.  The aliens are well done. Love this movie!!  It's funny as hell!!
B009IEXKXI|5|Found myself laughing out loud and relating well to the main character as he struggled with the challenges of being left behind on Mars. All the frustration of great ideas going south because of a small misstep or omission. Thoroughly enjoyed the technical explanations of his schemes for survival, as they allowed the reader to see the failure simultaneously with the author, which made the book funnier and more enjoyable.
B00L23SE52|5|Ordered this for the kid, he loved it and I enjoyed it also.  The &#34;everything is awsome&#34; song is catchy and will drive your crazy.
B004EPYZQC|4|Loved the first one (The Fast and the Furious), skipped 2 and 3 because, well Vin Diesel wasn't in them........... got #4 (Fast and Furious) so I couldn't pass this one up!! The gangs all here, well most of them anyway (with a little teaser at the end) and Dwayne Johnson is added to the mix. This is just a fun, action adventure move. Don't expect anything to much but it's the same caliber as the first and 4th title. Crazy ridiculous, impossible car stunts, chases, fights, hot guys, hot girls and cool cars!! Enjoy!! Oh, and I don't recommend getting behind the wheel of a car for at least an hour after watching this movie, for some reason, people tend to drive faster after watching. ;)
B0010T0OCY|5|Lots of action and suspense, a great sci fi that<br />provokes unrest.  What happens when we<br />push too hard for the 'ultimate' answer?<br />Can we take the realities that appear?<br />Very good move.
B003Y5H5EW|2|This movie, while well produced, feels like a rehash of all the other Underworld movies. You could almost interchange some of the scenes with the last two Underworld movies and it wouldn't show. Perhaps the director for the next installment can just piece together moments from all the movies and call it \\"Underworld Recollections.\\"
B00CW6DAKC|5|I really enjoy playing this game! It's fun for all ages! I love that your farm can keep growing as you complete tasks. Please add me to your neighbor list.  FAQJYQX.
B005IQZB14|5|As I finish this book, my hope that it be before I am at the gate of the movie theater ( and it is), I find that while she searched for her real self, I didn't want to go back to civilization, even though I couldn't imagine being without crayons and knitting needles for all that time.  I loved this book.
B008JFUUIA|5|I laugh constantly through this whole movie. Glad I bought this, cause i constantly watch it. Def one of my favorites
B000FVQLQQ|4|This is a very emotional and moving movie. I thought Russell Crowe did a fantastic job of portraying John Nash and he was very believable, especially during the institution scenes. Watching him struggle with his own demons throughout the movie was pretty amazing. This movie I wouldn't recommend for the highly adventuresome movie goer. A lot of the film is very quiet and there is a lot of dialogue. While the dialogue is interesting for those who appreciate very psychology-based plots, if you are looking for mile a minute action, this isn't it.<br /><br />I did notice that they left out a lot of important and rather commonly known elements of the real John Nash's life. I suppose this was to make the movie fit the script, but there were some things I would have liked to have seen in the film. Perhaps if the movie had gone on to describe his later years those gaps would have been filled.<br /><br />Either way, if you are interested in mathematics, mental illness or just appreciate a good movie, I think this fits the bill.
0789420708|5|The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled.  It suits the purpose for which it was ordered.  Definitely would order again.
B005XE33FM|5|It was a gift, he loved it!!!
B0000636NQ|5|In 1968 I had no interest in this album, but always admired TYA. I discovered this album through Pandora Radio. I bought it on iTunes and enjoyed it for several months before a hard drive crash (I had moved and not recently backed up my music), so I bought it from Amazon, but lo and behold it was the 2002 version, which had more songs and it was polished as well. What a gem this turned out to be. Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons, Ric Lee and Chick Churchill never sounded better.
B004U8ZH8S|5|I can't believe how much I loved this movie.  One of the perks of being a grandmother is that you get to see &#34;children's&#34; movies with them.  Many I wish I didn't have to watch, but it loved this one ...lots of clever changes on the real story , beautiful drawings and color.  I would even watch it again ... With my grandchild, of course !
B00N6PD3GE|5|Awesome book if you like history.
B00D3XAA4M|1|I expected more information. It was not worth the download. I deleted it almost immediately after putting it on my kindle.
B000FBFN1U|5|The tv she got me started but these books truly are fantastic and he show pales in comparison. Looking forward to the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book was awesome I never would have thought that it would be this good I mean that was amazing
B00HB62MC0|5|Colleen Hoover hits another home run! What a great story of love and loss! Miles is a beautiful character! A must read!

0470450266|5|I am a student at The Art Institutes of Las Vegas studying 3d Animation and Character Modeling.  We primarily use Maya for our Character Modeling class and used ZBrush in that class to refine our polyMeshes(Add additional detail such as the Musculature and skeletal details) and to add other accesories (such as clothing and weapons).  This book was not the required text for our class, but my instructor recommended that we should purchase this book as it has a clear and precise step by step process that walks you through how to model that character on the cover exactly as it is shown on the cover.  I also had an Anatomy class that same quarter and my Anatomy instructor was amazed at this book as it is also a must have book as an Anatomy reference.  The author is Scott Spencer and his other Zbrush book (listed below) has long been a fixture as the best Zbrush book out there period.  A must have for your 3d Modeling library.  Check out the Zbrush forum and I'm sure you'll see the same enthusiasm and love for this book.  Keep up the great work Scott!

B000FVQM2Y|4|Some say great dialog, others say crappy dialog disguised as great dialog...  I say that although the words occasionally felt transparent or forced, overall it worked.  The dialog made sense within the world of the film because that world is, as everyone has said, high school layered with Casablanca.  This movie is an excellent effort in an unusual direction.  The acting is surprisingly good, the characters are intelligent, and for the most part they're unusually mature for teenage characters in an American movie. The plot is dense and twisted enough to hold my interest.  Not a perfect movie, but a great one.
0062293036|5|Such a fun book and as a student at culinary school I can verify that all the culinary terms are perfect! Great job Hannah!!
B00T3DNKIE|4|An elusive narrative. You don't really know what the book is about until the end. Certainly one of the marks of a gifted writer.  A must read for young adults.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|This app is for my daughter to use and she likes it. I personally think it is a little on the slow side ...but still fun!!!
0312944098|5|I've read a lot of Jeffrey Archer books and having just finished A Prisoner of Birth, I think it's his best. There is a fascinating main plot along with many secondary ones to keep you guessing and surprised to the final page. Archer has to be among the very best fiction writers. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed. Be parepared to lose sleep because once you've started it, you won't be able to put it down.
B00FGFVMGA|5|Very cool graphics !  A good challenge !  We seek quality games that require investigation, hints and good nonviolent fun!  The lost city was another great one they made.
B00A77II0U|3|This game was ok, but unless you really like hidden object searches, try the sequel instead. That is a much better game, in my opinion. It got to the point in this one where I was getting annoyed because it seemed like every other scene was a HOS. As I already said if you like HO games, give this a try; for a better all around gaming experience, try the sequel, Stolen Memories.
B0051UP5NQ|5|I have been using the free version foe five months and it worked very well.  I converted to Pro and I am very satisfied with the additional features.  The fonts are working great. I recommend the purchase.  I am a Prime member and I saved a bunch, thanks Amazon.
B00000AFGM|5|Instead of making another ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR, it's obvious early on in &quot;Great Big White World&quot; that Manson isn't afraid to take chances by drastically changing his sound, or his image.  These songs are powerful  and contain familiar themes of living in a fake and hateful society, but  this time Manson also focuses greatly on the subject of increasing drug  dependency by so many people in this world.  Unlike ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR,  everything here seems a bit overproduced and arena-ready, but almost every  track sounds amazing.  The most impressive might be &quot;Rock Is  Dead&quot; with its hurried pace and explosive chorus similar to the one in  &quot;The Beautiful People.&quot;  Other notable songs include the somewhat  overplayed &quot;The Dope Show,&quot; the eerie ballad &quot;The Speed Of  Pain,&quot; the humorous &quot;I Don't Like The Drugs, But The Drugs Like  Me,&quot; the sweetly ominous &quot;The Last Day On Earth,&quot; and the  impressive closer &quot;Coma White.&quot;  Some people dislike Manson all  together and others hated his drastic change of image, but actually it's  refreshing to see at least one artist who understands that making the same  song over and over again can get really boring even though it may increase  chances of staying on the sales charts longer.
B00GUO3C3W|4|Good movie.Worth watching. Matthew M, gives a great performance.
B009JZSC9S|5|Always entertaining, intelligent, and with great performances by a diverse cast.  Well done!
B00GH4RKYM|4|I thought this was a nice angle on a story we already know.  The difference here, aside from the flashbacks to Superman's childhood, is the more in-depth character development of General Zod.  Sure he is evil, however, from the standpoint of wanting to preserve his race, you could at least see where he is coming from.  He is not just evil for evil's sake - he thinks he is right - even if it means obliterating another race (ours) to save his own.<br />Of course, lots of action and Henry Cavill makes a superb Superman!<br />Worth a watch, in my opinion.
B009CPES4I|5|Superb movie!,<br />We enjoyed the originality and the brilliant colors too!<br />Highly recommend this one!
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I love this game. I had a little problem with the first one but this is great.I cant wait to play it on long road trips
0062183613|5|perfect
B00FN2KR2G|4|Easy read.  Couldn't help but laugh at the situations people get themselves into.  Good twists and turns.  Oh what a web we weave when first we practice to deceive!!!
B00EKR61FM|5|I definitely wanted this in Blu-ray since I bought the other DVDs in regular format. Sorry I have yet to see the extras dvds but I feel the Blu-rays give the movies a better appeal. But you need to have a big screen to appreciate some of the scenery in the movies.
0307454541|4|Loved it!  I was promptly encouraged to get the other two books in the series (got 'em for Christmas ... but WOULD'VE bought them) and to see the movie.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Entertaining, use with or without internet connections
B00004RJ71|5|My husband and I absolutely loved this movie. I gave it to him on Valentines Day, at a Sushi restaurant over yrs ago(VHS), and we went home to watch it! And we watch it all the time.. We sometimes see who can do more quotes randomly! TOTAL MUST Have to any Latinos collection! Or wanna be Latinos! i dont you but IM read to see there Three Actors on screen again!We've even gone to see &quot;El Pino&quot; in East Los!! and Los 5 PUNTOS Store
B00J8CG6KE|2|I rated this movie only 2 stars.  One star because the attempt appeared honest and one star for the actors.  Other than that, the movie was terrible.  Watch the trailer and you've seen probably the most interesting scenes in the whole movie.  The vulgarity was just too much and the plot-line vague.  I question how any stockbroker could get away with as much as this guy supposedly did and for that length of time without getting nabbed.  Ridiculous.
B00908DDZM|5|i am a college student on a tight budget. I bought this CD in respects of the artist and what he stands for. If you are an individual that is interested in intellectual music that is going to make you think than this is right for you. I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in hip-hop/rap. Great quality music at a affordable price.
B00I8Q77Y0|3|i prefer flappy birds but this app is better than nothing. i like this app mostly because flappy birds was never in this app store to begin with. but now its too late. considering flappy bird was taken off the market.
0811876373|5|I love this book!!! The pictures are very detailed as are the descriptions in the book. They did not miss anything. I need Step-by-Step instructions when it comes to cooking/baking and this book provided that. My first attempt at baking cakepops was a huge success, thanks to the details in this book. I feel the author went above and beyond by providing suggestions for what types of cake batters would go best with certain types of icing and then goes on to describe how to make frostings. If a author wanted to skip any details in their book, I would think this information would have been left out - but I am so glad this author kept it in. It gives great suggestions and hints all throughout the book. The creative ideas (which all have pictures) also help when at the store picking out colors of melts. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to bake cakepops and do not know the first thing about how to do that. I can't see how we couldn't all become masters at baking cakepops with the guidance of this book. 5 Stars!
B00FKF0F3C|5|A bit slower read than the rest , but nice reminder of the times I lived in , and was not paying enough attention . I did enjoy the book .
B00UHQ73NO|5|Just an awesome album. Muse never disappoints.
B000002J09|5|After listening to this album many times, I still want to keep on  listening to it. Songs like black dog and rock and roll help to show jimmy  page's guitar abilities while when the levee breaks helps to showcase john  bonhaim's drumming skills. Of course, stairway to heaven is on this album,  although not my favorite led zepplin song, it not heard to figure out why  this became a classic.
B000K7VHQ4|5|Not at all what i expected, it's better. The whole ambiance is great throughout the movie. Just thinking about it has made me decide to go watch it again.  Hope you enjoy it.
0780626494|5|This movie is the best romantic comedy ever made by far. The script is excellent and that is elevated by it's all star cast including Brenden Fraser, Alica Silverstone, all time veterens Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacak. For most of you Guys out there who think it's a &quot;Chick Flik&quot; it's NOT, let me give you an example I was with a group of friends one night, both guys &amp; girls, and we all watched it and it was a hit i don't one person who didn't like it which just go to show you this movie is truly a great flick.
B00NWLIW0E|2|The damn thing ate through it's chain and ate my phone.
B009HUB40Y|3|The game is okay but I have several similar games and this one just doesn't do anything for me. Thanks
B0041KBWM0|5|This is a first class production.  I've seen the movie, but I like the TV series better because they have time to get into the details.  The characters have more depth, not just the main ones.  The sets and costumes are fantastic.  The acting is excellent.  I highly recommend it, especially if you are a Jane Austen fan!
B004J4WLB4|5|One of the best books i have ever read. Brought me to tears.... So happy i read it and now so sad its over
B0001V6ZJ8|5|This is one of the most interesting biographies I've ever seen on film. <br />Until I acquired the DVD, I never fully realized how beautiful this film looked, either. I was stunned to see how spectacular the colors were and how much it helped capture the flavor of the dance hall and the cobblestone streets of France 100 years ago.....and, of course, Tolouse-Lautrec's great artwork. This movie is a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br />The DVD also offers an opportunity to do something I suggest other fans of this movie try: use the English subtitles. This way, you don't have to strain to understand the French accents, notably Colette Marchand's, and it makes this intriguing story even better. <br /> <br />Story-wise, it's a bit of a soap opera but one I still found fascinating, thanks mainly to Lautrec's dialog. He had some really interesting things to say, mostly in a cynical way. That cynicism, unfortunately, caught up with him in the end. Jose Ferrer captured this tortured soul about as well as any actor could expect to do. I'm sorry he didn't win an Academy Award for this performance.  <br /> <br />Viewers who only saw the more recent \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" missed the real story. That movie was a farce; this is the real thing.  <br />
B0000041TD|5|Although some of the most ardent opera buffs will still prefer Beecham, this is really the version to turn to for most people. This is quite simply Pavarotti's best role, full of vigour and poetry. If one really wished to find something to pick on, it would perhaps be that he only rarely seems willing to sing quietly, but the feeling (in particular the desperation) and warmth he brings to the role is, as far as I know, unmatched. Freni also, in my view, outperforms e.g. Callas, at least in terms of sheer beauty of sound, although a case could be made that Callas is the superior interpreter. Panerai and Harwood are excellent as well.    But if there is anything sweeping all competition aside, it is Karajan. He has simply got it all, focus on orchestral beauty as well as a taut grip on the drama and momentum. Put that together with splendid sound, and you've got a winning set. A must.
B0000DD7LB|5|THIS HAS TO BE THE BRITNEY ALBUM OF HER CARRER. SHE FINALLY LOSES HER BUBBLE GUM POP IMAGE AND RELEASES SOME REAL MUSIC. THIS ALBUM JUMPS FROM GENRE TO GENRE.

EARLY MORNIN - THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE MOST SENSUAL TRACKS ON THE SONGS. WITHIN THE FIRST 5 SECONDS OF THIS SONG YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY TELL IT IS MOBY PRODUCED. 8/10<br />6. TOXIC - THE SECOND SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM. PRODUCED BY BLOODSHY & AVANT. THIS IS A VERY UP-TEMPO SONG AND HAS A SPY THEME TO IT. ANOTHER OF ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVS 10/10<br />7. OUTRAGEOUS - A TYPCIALLY R. KELLY PRODUCED SONG. SINCE I AM A BIG FAN OF R.KELLY I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. THE R&B BEATS REALLY SUIT BRITNEY. 10/10<br />8. TOUCH OF MY HAND - PROBABLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND SENSUAL SONG ONTHE ALBUM. THIS SONG IS AN ODE TO MASTERBATION. THIS AGAIN IS VERY CLUB SAVVY AND ITS VIOLIN BEATS MAKE YOU VERY SEXY. AGAIN I GIVE THIS SONG A 10/10. I LOVE IT<br />9. THE HOOK-UP - THIS REDZONE PRODUCED SONG IS PRETTY GOOD. IT SOUNDS VERY REGAEE. ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T ONE OF MY FAVS I STILL LIKE IT 7/10<br />10. SHADOW - MY FAVOURITE BALLAD ON THE ALBUM. BRITNEY'S VOCALS REALLY STAND OUT ON THIS TRACK. IT IS VERY REMENISCANT TO AVRIL'S I'M WITH YOU. 9/10<br />11. BRAVE NEW GIRL - HAS TO BE THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM. AND PERHAPS ONE OF BRITNEY'S WORST SONGS OF ALL TIME. THIS SONG IS VERY STUPID AND CONSISTS OF BRITNEY RAPPING. I WOULD GIVE THIS SONG A 0.5/10. I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT<br />12. EVERYTIME - THE SECOND BALLAD ON THE ALBUM. I PERSONALLY REALLY LOVE THE LYRICS TO THIS SONG BUT I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE WAY IT WAS RECORDED. IT WAS RECORDED VERY LOW. I FIRSTLY HEARD THIS SONG ON SNL WHEN SHE SANG IT LIVE AND THOUGHT IT SOUNDED MUCH BETTER THERE. ALTHOUGH I STILL LIKE THIS SONG BUT NOT ONE OF MY FAVS CAUSE IM NOT A REALLY BIG FAN OF BALLADS. 7/10<br />13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (REMIX) - I REALLY LIKE THE REMIX TO THIS TRACK. IT HAS AN INDIAN BEAT AND IS REMIXED INTO THE SONG VERY WELL. ONE OF BRITNEY'S BEST REMIXES. 10/10<br />14. THE ANSWER (BONUS TRACK) - I THINK THIS SONG ISN'T BAD. ALTHOUGH I EXPECTED MORE FROM A SONG PRODUCED BY P.DIDDY AND BRITNEY. THIS SONG IS MID-TEMPO AND BRITNEY'S VOICE IS VERY LOW REGISTER. 7/10<br />15. DON'T HANG UP - THE SECOND BONUS TRACK ON THE ALBUM. THIS SONG IS ABOUT PHONE-SEX. I DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE WORST SONGS ON THE ALBUM. AGAIN IT IS PRODUCED BY BRIAN & JOSH THE SAME PEOPLE WHO PRODUCED BRAVE NEW GIRL. .5/10<br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND I THINK IT IS THE BEST ALBUM OF 2003 AND SO FAR 2004. ALL IN ALL I CONGRATULATE BRITNEY FOR RELEASING THIS STUNNING ALBUM.
B004LWZWGK|5|great movie
0743455967|3|You have to commend Stephen King for getting right to the point. As one of the best-selling (and most-read) writers in history, everyone wants to know: How do you DO it, Steve? How do you write so many books that so many people love?<br />Unfortunately, the advice he offers is the kind you can get just about anywhere. He doesn't tap into the special way HE writes. Instead, he tells you to &quot;show don't tell,&quot; keep it simple and clear, and don't over-write. I'd much rather find out how he comes up with ideas, how the strings his plots together, and what goes on in his head as he's working out the events of the story. (Why does this character die and not that one? How do you reveal a good villain to maintain suspense?) He touches on these topics,  but he doesn't get into them in depth.<br />The final section of the book stands apart from the rest. All of a sudden, he's writing about being hit by a car while walking down the road. He writes about drug abuse and trying to get back on his feet, physically and emotionally. This section is very good. King dives into autobiography with both feet, using his considerable skill at pacing and description to keep you on the edge of your seat about deeply personal matters.<br />If you want to try writing novels and short stories, this book will help you get it right. If you're a King fan, you'll get this book done in a day. For the rest of you, just flip to the final section and you'll be pleased.
0743297334|4|Hemingway's simplistic  style is surprizingly hypnotic. It's subtle ride, gives way for the reader to use their own imagination into the heart and soul of the story.
0670024783|5|Another well written novel explaining the evils of slavery
B00IMYZOBQ|3|Started out great. But then fizzled out. Don't get me wrong the effects were great but the story over all was predictable and drawn out. I would get it a solid C+/B-
B0002TKFGI|2|I have heard much about these RCA SACD releases and this is my first purchase and might also be my last. Both the performance and sound quality are at best mediocre, quite the opposite of this disc's reputation.<br /><br />Recording balance is odd: percussions are loud, dry, in your face; winds are next; strings are further back; in other words, it's the opposite of a natural concert hall perspective. It's so unnatural, the performers don't seem to be in the same space.<br /><br />The sound is coarse, perhaps from frequent tape drop outs, or old tapes that were stored improperly.<br /><br />Ensemble playing is untidy, i.e. not together.<br /><br />The above comment relates to the Saint Saens played on CD, not SACD. The Debussy is even worse, sounds like a cassette tape!
B008M721MS|1|At the moment unable to use as have to re enter friends call signs, but I'm sure it will be ok soon
B001UTW7QU|5|A nice blend of sci -fi , supernatural , suspense , and humor .
B00005V9HH|5|I fell in love with this movie years ago, and realized what a brilliant actor Kevin Spacey is.  I have watched it many, many times, and see something each time that I hadn't noticed before.
B004J4WN0I|5|I had not wanted to buy this book in the beginning and ended up breaking down and getting it as a little gift for myself. I have to say that I made a great choice.<br /><br />I love everything from the storyline and the characters to the humour and everything in between I highly recommend it
B00CS65JS2|5|Bought it for my son and he kept insisting that the album was good. Actually, only one song is good. What a waste of my money. After a few days, I took the entire album on my iPhone and I started to like the song. I guess I just had to listen to all of them.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love horses and used to show a lot. I'm unable to have horses right now, this app is an easy escape back to my glory days.
B00FWLDHSY|4|First off, the movie Pacific Rim is amazing! Odds are, though, if you're reading this, you probably know that already. This novelization is interesting in that it sheds light on things I've wondered about in my many, MANY times watching the movie. Now, the book is not considered canon exactly, but many of the things it expounds are logical explanations for the movie. I liked it!
B00000JY1X|5|For the past nine months (with the reissue of &quot;Holiday&quot;), the Magnetic Fields have become my all-time favorite band. Beware of the craving for every Stephin Merritt release that will accompany the purchase  of &quot;69 Love Songs.&quot;<br />This boxed set is the crowning achievement  of the Magnetic Fields' already stellar career. The diversity of the music  is incredible and Stephin Merritt is one of the few artists whose lyrics  are as enjoyable as the music. <br />For the seasoned Magnetic Fields fan,  &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; is significantly less techno-sounding than their  previous work. Guitar, ukelele and piano dominate while the synth pop takes  the back seat.<br />There are too many great songs to list here but my  absolute favorites are &quot;Fido, Your Leash is Too Long&quot;,  &quot;Epitaph for my Heart&quot;, and &quot;The Death of Ferdinand De  Saussure&quot;.<br />Please ignore the review posted by Darren from Chicago.  These albums are not &quot;overindulgent&quot; or &quot;plain old  annoying&quot;: they are creative, humorous, witty and endlessly  listenable. There are so many other bands who package their musical talent  with a pretentious attitude (i.e.  have you ever tried to read the liner  notes to &quot;If Your Feeling Sinister&quot;?). Stephin might  occassionally be bitter and sarcastic, but he is certainly not &quot;cooler  than thou&quot;. <br />The Magnetic Fields have single-handedly restored my  faith in &quot;indie&quot; rock. &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; is a  great work  of pop exuberance for the new millenium.
B007SGM084|5|I loved these books. I wasnt expecting a relationship to bloom the way it did. I hate everyone saying oh its demeaning to women but it isnt. She helped him free himself from his past.  And actually form a relationship. I love it all! Erotic stuff and all.
B007THA4FI|2|I read 25% of this.  I just couldn't get into it.  This might be the only book that I have ever read and not finished.  Her next one (the detective one) was a lot better in my opinion.
B000002GC2|5|I first encountered this work at 17, and I was enamoured with it since.  I misplaced my last copy to which I was deeply disheartened.  I was estatic to find it through amazon.com, as I plan on transfering furture purchases of music from the company to computer files so I won't ever be without my music.  Thank you once again for your service.
B00003CXP1|5|I watched this movie with some of my friends....  At the end of this movie we were completly, and utterly shocked.  This is one of the finest films i have ever seen.  This should be required viewing for any and all highschool students.  A complete masterpiece in realism.  It just goes to show you what drug use does to your body, and more importantly, to your mind.  I recommend this title to everyone, and i rate it 5 stars.  Excellent.
B00L9B7IKE|4|HARD TO FOLLOW AT FIRST!
B000089RVX|5|Nearly every song is a hit in it's own right. Bring me to life is an infectious blend of rock and powerful vocals where as hello is a emotional song. Fallen is a truly steller album which totally deserves it's No.1 spot in the charts. Fallen is a must have...BUY!!!
B001EN71DG|5|The good<br />-has the new updated versions as well as...<br />-has THE ORIGINAL MOVIES on the bonus disc just like they were first seen in theatres (the first movie just says \\"Star Wars\\" in the beginning without \\"A New Hope\\", Han shoots first, no skinny cgi jaba, no \\"NOOOO\\" yell at the end, etc.)<br />-original movies are still good quality. It is better than your old VCR tapes but not quite new DVD release<br />-I loved showing my gf these movies like they were meant to be seen<br /><br />The bad<br />-the original movies are not anamorphic ...but I honestly don't really care. They still look very good even on my 60\\" widescreen.<br />-the discs are not held in well inside the individual disc boxes. The plastic grippers don't hold the discs in and they slide around.<br /><br />This is a Star Wars fan's dream. This is the only set with the actual original theatre release movies. People are complaining about how they aren't anamorphic or w/e, but they still look better than any VCR tape. Buy it used, but make SURE you get this exact set. It's a blue box with Darth and Luke fighting on the front and made in 2008.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is the best game that I have so far, and let me tell you, I have some pretty good games.
0810989956|5|Another christmas gift for my daughter. She loves the wimpy kid series and was happy to get this book as well. A great price on this book and the Boo book.
B00BHU2A7I|5|dont miss it - hopkins and mirren on their A-game, a film about filmmaking and filmmakers worth watching, insightful to hitchcock's legacy, but more so into the influences of his personal life and the industry on his films.  bet you never knew how important his wife was to the succes and longevity of his career, right down to subtle details in some of his classic movies.  this is slightly fictionalized biography at its best
B004SIP7PS|5|This is one of the best, hands down. It is a touching family story that will keep you watching and waiting for the next &#34;happening&#34;. I highly recommend it for those who like movies such as &#34;Ladder 49&#34; or &#34;Life As a House&#34;, for example. One of Johnny Depp's best! You will enjoy it.
B004ZJZQ7O|5|\\"American Gangster\\" is brilliant! Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington (as Frank Lucas) and Russell Crowe (as Richie Roberts) give Oscar-worthy performances and led an excellent cast. The directing by Ridley Scott (who is filmed Crowe in \\"Body Of Lies\\" (2008), has also worked with Crowe in \\"Gladiator\\" (2000) & \\"A Good Year\\" (2006), he also directed \\"Hannibal\\" (2001), \\"Black Hawk Down\\" (2001), \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" (2005), & \\"G.I. Jane\\" (1997) is brilliant! The story and screenplay by Steven Zaillian (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"Hannibal\\", he also wrote the screenplay to \\"Gangs Of New York\\" (2002) & \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993), based on the article \\"The Return Of Superfly\\" by Mark Jacobson, is brilliant! The music by Marc Streitenfeld (who also did the music to \\"A Good Year\\") is excellent! The cinematography by Harris Savides (who also did the cinematography to \\"Zodiac\\" (2007) & \\"Margot At The Wedding\\" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Pietro Scalia (who also editing \\"Body Of Lies\\", he also did the film editing to \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Hannibal\\", \\"Gladiator\\", & \\"G.I. Jane\\") is excellent! The casting by Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting to \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" (2007), \\"Lions For Lambs\\" (2007), & \\"Body Of Lies\\") is excellent! The production design by Arthur Max (who also did the production design to \\"Body Of Lies\\", \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\", & \\"G.I. Jane\\") is excellent! The art direction by Nicholas Lundy (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Revolutionary Road\\" (2008) is excellent! The set decoration by Sonja Klaus (who also did the set decoration to \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" & \\"Body Of Lies\\"), Leslie E. Rollins (who also did the set decoration to \\"The Departed\\" (2006), Beth A. Rubino (who also did the set decoration to \\"World Trade Center\\" (2006) is excellent! The costume design by Janty Yates (who also did the costume design to \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Hannibal\\", & \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\") is excellent! This is an brilliant crime drama that is in the same company as \\"The Departed\\". This is one of the best films of the year. Washington, Crowe, Scott, and Zaillian should be remembered come Oscar night for their work in this stunning movie.
B00005RHGK|1|It not very often you try and watch a movie that is so lame and stupid, that you tell yourself,it can't any more stupid or asinine.and sure enough, it does.    As far as I can tell,the demographic target audience seems to be aimed at tweeners that manage to sneak in from another theater in a megaplex,so that they can brag to their friends they saw an R rated movie.    Unless you have an IQ of under 50 or are into sniffing paint fumes,this is not a movie that you want to waste you time on.    The only other movie that I have seen that was worse ,was Prophecy: The Monster Movie (1979 release).    Please do not confuse it with the Christopher Walken movie  of nearly the same name,which is a decent watch.
B009EEOQIU|3|ENJOYED THE MOVIE, HAD A NEW TWIST ON IT WITH GREAT ACTORS ALSO..........GOOD FOR CHILDREN TOO....AND ADULTS TOO. .....DREW BARRYMORE WAS GREAT
B007A4SDCG|5|A &#34;keeper&#34; and a motivating book for any artist. I have recommended this book to many of my friends and it's one I will read over and over - especially as I face the battle of 'resistance' every morning when I sit down to write.
B00B5HQL50|5|Excellent movie. Great writing and special effects
B00AREIAI8|2|Not very friendly to use for a young child, that would likely play. And steps take to long.
0425166805|5|This book is a brain awakener.  Plus his video on TV and the &#34;industry&#34; he has started with the publication of THIS BOOK has revealed many, many more sites on this planet that have no homo sapiens explanation.  Stimulates the thinking mind into questioning the whole of Creation vs Evolution and the foundations for the &#34;superior&#34; human.  So very much, all over planet earth pre-dates the Pyramids and the few other ancient sites we knew of vs those we now know of.  It just boggles the mind.  About 55 years ago I read &#34;First Man, Then Adam&#34; and it got me to thinking.  Then comes Mr. Daniken's book.  WOW!  Read it.
B00IFOOPM2|5|LOVE IT!!!  So fun to see everyone back in Neptune!!  Would love to see a sequel, everything about Veronica Mars is great!
B003EYVXUU|5|I initially watched the movie because Chloe Grace Moretz stars in it and I have never seen anything she has played in that was a letdown. As expected, Moretz turned out a phenomenal performance, but the other acting talent did as well, including Kodi Smit-McPhee, whom I had never heard of before watching this film.  There were some slight changes from the traditional vampire myths, but nothing like that garbage that was in the waste of time and energy that is the Twilight books and movies. The story is very captivating but ends with some questions unanswered.
B005HSL626|3|My grand children play it.  They seem to enjoy it.  I don't play it.  Keep it for the grand children.
B00K0X1PYM|5|Have always been a fan of Clapton and Cale.  Great cd. Good mix of artist.  Clapton is as usual the best. I know rock made him famous but he is best when doing blues.
B00GLX0Z8C|2|Wish I could tell you that this was funny.  Wish I could tell you this was fantastic.  Wish I could tell you this was fabulous.  I can only tell you it was a fail.
B007SGLZP8|4|I think every one has family issues in our past we have to deal with that may not be pleasant. The story has change of character and a happy ending I loved it.
B00755MHXG|4|Inspirational page turner from a good humanist viewpoint. Felt real, made you think about issues. Not sure how many of these stories have this Hollywood endings- but it read well. I recommend it to anybody.
0307719227|4|One of the best, most comprehensive books I've read on this subject. A very clear and comprehensive review of historical and political factors that lead to the divide between rich and poor nations that we have today. A must read for everyone who is curious about the underlying reasons behind the origins of wealth and poverty.
B00M7D824O|4|People either loved or hated this movie. I loved this movie but took off one star because I only give 5 stars to movies I love and want to see over and over again. To movies I love, but care not to see again, like Shindler's List, The Color Purple, I give 4 stars. This movie was horrifyingly and emotionally draining. Great story, awesome acting and so despairingly engaging, that I was blown away. The ending was fitting. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I was expecting birds, but the Polar Bear was better--a previously soon to be extinct animal that will now be thriving for many years to come with the thaw.
B00EDY5KTA|5|My daughter loves this soundtrack. Just to warn you though most of the songs are the musical parts with no words. But she loves listening to them all.
B000SCHBGQ|5|This book was incredible! I really enjoyed it and will definitely be continuing the series!<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys fantasy books. I will definitely be getting the rest in the series soon!<br /><br />I couldn't figure out a succinct way to summarize this book so I recommend checking it out on Goodreads.
B0026P3G12|4|Although I don't have the album, I have listened to some of her songs. I am SO glad Susan Boyle came into the music world the way she is. This should let ever \\"average\\" or \\"ugly looking\\" person know that talent can and will override your looks anyday. For example, these days, there are VERY FEW people out there that are good looking AND can sing (ex: Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey). There are some \\"average looking\\" people that can sing (ex: Clay Aiken), and then there is Susan Boyle, a woman that received weird looks because of the way she looks...until she opened her mouth and nothing but beautiful vocals exited her throat. No, I am not saying she is ugly. This woman has been told things like she will never make it simply because of her looks, she will not fit into Hollywood, etc. I really hope she has enough supporters to prove people wrong. I really hope this was an eye opener for a lot of young people today. As some older ones already know, looks only get you so far. We all get old and will die, so instead of trying to poke botox in your butts, enjoy life and focus on your talents.
B0094M4Q3M|5|fun and great!!
B006LSZECO|5|I usually steer away from 'trendy' and 'hyped-up' books as they never live up to the expectation.  Well, this book is the exception.  Great writing and great twists and turns throughout.
B000MR9D5E|5|INCREDIBLE! Good quality
B00846TRHY|5|This was an inspiring and motivating movie on sacrificial missionary work for The Lord. It is selfless and compassionate, somethng this world is lacking today. May you offer many more stories like this.
B000JMKTLO|3|I thought it was darker and covered more dark areas than it needed to....I had read Gone Girl and liked it much better
B00005V1Y0|5|This is a real magical experience movie. A one of a kind experience! It is not just about dancing, but about personal growth and transformation through love. It is a love story most of all. In this high-energy movie, a young woman who looks rather homely helps the lead actor dance his own steps at the Grand Nationals. He wants to dance his own way and not follow the very tight rules of Ballroom dancing. Everyone thought he was crazy to dance his own steps, except this woman. When she approached him to offer her help at first he thought she was joking because he was a professional and she was merely a beginner. She told him he is afraid and that caught his attention. Her moto, and the moto of this film is: \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived.\\" It is a true metaphor for life and in breaking out of the mold setup for us by society and everyone else. With risk taking and following our hearts, we find something deeper and more beautiful then we ever imagined. She shows him some Latin movies he really likes and slowly they learned to dance their own way that was truly beautiful and much different then traditional Ballroom dancing. <br />As they danced together, little by little, the woman transformed into a true beauty. Her believing in him and herself caused her to become more then what she was. There was so much pressure on this young man to succeed and follow the rules that he almost gave in, but her love changed everything. The walls came down at the Grand Nationals and they danced their way- a beautiful elegant, simple Latin dance that had the audience jumping out of their seats in awe. In the end everyone joined in and it was an amazing thing to see! I find this movie to be a very good psychological lesson of following your heart, to stop living in fear even though everyone and everything seems to be against what you know in your heart to be right for you. And by breaking the rules, amazing things can happen for not just you, but the whole society as well. Atruly amazing movie with a beautiful message. A one of a kind rare film that will always be my personal favorite.
B00GYQYL7W|5|I am so drawn to this movie. I have not read the book yet,but I know that it will be a book that i will read over and over. This is one of those stories that u keep on learning more about the people and who they are.
B000IKQK7E|5|great
B00LU0P9L4|4|See the above title
B00005O3VC|5|You know, I would've loved to have been in the audience when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was first shown. I'm picturing a fair amount of laughter, but also quite a bit of confusion and critics saying, \\"What the hell did I just see?\\" That was certainly the case when Roger Ebert reviewed the first Monty Python movie, And Now For Something Completely Different. He seemed very interested in the audience reaction during his review, and I imagine the audience reaction during the first screenings for this film would've been similar.<br /><br />Of course, by the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1976, the original series had been airing on PBS for a couple years, so people were more familiar with the show. But still. Just imagine what reactions must've been like for those poor souls who went into this movie never having seen the TV program.<br /><br />I don't need to tell most of you about the plot to this film. King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table go off to find the Holy Grail. Most of the major knights from the stories are here, though Guinevere and Merlin are strangely absent (though there is an enchanter named Tim). The film also adds the rather cowardly Sir Robin and the aptly-named Sir Not Appearing in this Film.<br /><br />The movie itself is a fascinating hodge-podge of hilarity. You get to see several film genres, including swashbucklers, fantasy, epics and musicals, all get joyfully skewered. One cost-saving move, using coconuts banged together to simulate the sound of horses, since they couldn't actually afford horses, is an inspired notion. Despite that, much of the film shows the time period in a more realistic fashion than most other movies. There's lots of dirt and lots of mud and people know the king is the king because \\"He hasn't got [...] all over him.\\"<br /><br />Everyone who has seen the movie has their favorite moments. For me it's probably a toss up between the \\"Spamalot\\" song, the Holy Hand Grenade, and the \\"Help, help! I'm being repressed!\\" scene. The events at Castle Anthrax is a close follow-up, but really the whole movie works and works well. There's not a bad moment in the film, not a joke that falls flat.<br /><br />This movie, like all great films, has left behind a huge legacy, though not in the way some might think. Often times it's a legacy that filmmakers try to avoid. For example, in the the commentary on The Lord of the Rings films you will frequently hear Peter Jackson somewhat humoursly lament how hard they tried to avoid giving their movies a Holy Grail feeling. Of course the movie also lead to the hit Broadway musical, Spamalot, which I've never seen, but heard great things about.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone, of course. There's always a few humourless louts out there who won't enjoy it. Us normal folk know better, however, and we can enjoy it for the wonderful, creative, hilarious film it is!
B003AO1SVS|5|I can't understand some of these negative reviews.  I've been a Black Keys fan since Rubber Factory, and I really believe this is one of their best albums.  The only weak album of theirs to me was Magic Potion, but that was because many of the songs on the album sounded the same.  This album, for me personally, is nearly flawless.  Next Girl has one of the catchiest lines I've heard in years with \\"My Next Girl, She'll be nothing like my ex-girl\\",  Howlin' For You makes you want to turn the speakers up way too loud, and Sinister Kid, which has  already firmly established itself as one of my absolute favorite songs from any band, is one of the grooviest, coolest, funkiest songs I've ever heard, from the opening grunt to the ending guitar solos, it represents what The Black Keys are all about now.      If some of these people with negative reviews of the album had listened to or read any of the interviews leading to the album's release, they'd realize the whole point of this album was groove and soul.  Mission accomplished.  Big Time!  As far as them selling out, I think they're trying to break more into the mainstream, and I have no problem with that as long as they keep producing records like this.
B00FE5N09Y|2|I love this series, but do not have television, so I haven't seen the final season. I figured that it would be very awesome to get the full box set. I was so wrong. Each season is in its own little cardboard sleeves. These sleeves are tightly packed, and mine had been bent in the box, which makes it very difficult to take them in and put them out. Almost every single disc also slipped down in their respective sleeves. The issue with this is there is sticky glue-like substance that holds these sleeves together. This substance got on every single disc that slipped. It is incredibly difficult to get off the discs, and the discs refuse to play unless all it is off. It was a noble idea, and is neat to look at, but it is just not a smart buy. I give it a 2 start because, despite the issues, the discs that did play are good quality and the bonus content is nice
B00IKZX1ZI|5|I love this game you don't have to play it every day. It is just a really fun game to play.
B002NOH7G6|4|great
B000058983|5|There are some CDs you hear about as being masterworks, but overlooked during their time. Love's 1967 masterpiece &quot;Forever Changes&quot; is one of those albums. It is impossibly wonderful, but its gorgeous orchestral folk was overlooked at its release and the band duly disbanded. The liner notes state that had the band not been so lethargic and toured its music, they would have been much bigger and this album wouldn't be so overlooked. However, it truly is an acid test for people: an overlooked, but hugely hyped album can be a risky pick, but once you buy it, it all makes sense. I put buying this album off for far too long, and others must not follow my example.
B004Q0SQ24|5|Kids love them.  Body is made of wood, Rest is plastic.  They have been thrown around and stepped on and they still look great.  Works on wooden tracks.
B001KWN6ZS|5|In a move that would surprise many upon it's release in 1992, including his fans and          admirers alike, this live acoustic album Unplugged would feature Eric Clapton playing a          wireless acoustic guitar in front of a live audience as the live album became his biggest          selling album.  This `Unplugged' session would also be responsible for making acoustic          based music, and those unplugged CD's in particular, a hot trend in the early-1990's as          Clapton caught up with this `unplugged' trend at the right time when the public became          hungry for to hear how well those rock stars and their material can hold up of elaborate          production values.  By alternating between pop tunes and traditional blues songs alike,          the results was one of the most heartfelt and highly approved achievements The Guitar          God ever committed to the recording studio where it feature a set of tracks that include          the deeply moving soft-rock ballad award-winning Tears Of Heaven (it also brought me          to tears)--his heart rendering elegy to his son Connor who had fell out of his New York          apartment window because it had no window-safety bars. Eric Clapton even appeared          on a TV commercial pleading for apartment buildings to have window safety bars. Also          featured on the CD is an acoustic take on Layla, Running On Faith and fine versions of          acoustic blues classics like Rollin' And Tumblin', Alberta, San Francisco Bay Blues and          Malted Milk.  What you also get from the album's legacy is a Deluxe CD- Concert DVD          edition titled Unplugged: Expanded And Remastered, as the DVD contain over an hour          of unseen footage from the rehearsal and it includes early acoustic versions of later My          Father's Eyes and Circus Left Town. A Winner of Six Grammy Awards including Album          Of The Year, Record Of The Year (Tears Of Heaven), Song Of The Year and Best Pop          Male Vocal Performance for 1992, I may want to strongly recommend Unplugged from          Eric Clapton, and with a good time-honoured reason.
0141439807|3|Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen (whose death at an early age was a tragedy for literature), was an intriguing window into the life of English families in the late 1700s and early 1800s.  The arrogance and pomposity of the land holding families, the invisibility of servants, the status of women, class consciousness, and the self-centeredness of those who didn't have to work for a living all come out in this novel.<br /><br />The story focuses on Fanny, the daughter of a sister who didn't marry as well as another sister.  In a fit of compassion (loosely defined), the wealthier sister takes on Fanny as a companion to use and a project to make.  Over the next decade, Fanny evolves from a homesick and chronically shy girl into a most balanced character.  Surrounding this story are the highs and lows of the other characters, her aunts, uncle, and her cousins and their friends.<br /><br />As a story, Mansfield Park is rather tedious and sleep-inducing.  The detail is almost overwhelming.  The insight into this period, however, is fascinating.  Jane Austin clearly was a very astute observer of the life and times of people around her.

B005K17RU0|5|It works well for kindle fire....I use it every day and never a issue. Very happy with how fast it is.
B001AVCFJM|4|For a relaunch they did a fantastic job. So much so it caused me to go back and watch the originals. They chose the plot, and actors so carefully and did a fantastic job in making this film, from the script to the editing. My favorite is the humor though, to find the humor in every situation is the sign of good acting and these guys did that.
B00000273M|5|I agree with the poster from Kansas.  Most of the Bangles' greatest hits are among my least favorite songs.  Still, you get a pretty decent sampler selection on this CD.
0066620996|5|a must read for all the managers and particularly for the MBAs. Could be read with &#34;des managers des vrais pas des MBA&#34; de Mintzberg
B00005JLEU|3|Spirited away is a very cute fanatical film.  I did not like tho how spoiled Chihiro is in the beginning, but i guess that is what this movie is kinda based around...changing her from a weak crybaby into a stronger more independant one...which does happen...the beginning just annoys me.  I also did not like how slow the beginning is....i remember how i was sitting there watching it and going...\\"would you please hurry it up?!?\\"  All this movie had going for it really is it's comedy...when it's funny...it's funny...end of story.  I believ this film to be more suited to children around the age of 12 and under i suppose. It is very cute, but i dont think people who are older and a bit more suphisticated will like it too much....the story is just plain weird.  So..it will make a nice gift for your kids..but not for yourself.
B00QR7ZN16|5|I'm sure you get it now. Yes it is THAT good.
B003YFIUW8|5|Never have I seen such a small setting described with such care, such reverence. By contrast, when we are introduced to the outside world, see it through his eyes, it seems too vast and frightening to comprehend. Masterfully written.

B00D6BN9NK|2|My husband and I love the Die Hard series but were very disappointed with &#34;A Good Day to Die Hard.&#34; It lacked the substance of the others.
B00BAXFCPO|5|As an adjunct to other books, like Wheat Belly Total Health, I enjoyed the information in this Brain Grain book VERY MUCH!  It reinforces your path to lowering blood sugar, triglicerides, and as a side benefit .. weight loss.  YESSS!  Now if we can teach our own doctors to open their eyes to the low carb, higher fat, way ... we'll all be better off!  Current medical practices are still encouraging the opposite.  tsk tsk.  I am looking forward to my next routine doctor's appointment ... LOL.
B007J4T2G8|5|I choose this rating because I love this book! I like everything about this book and I'd recommend it to everyone!!! :D

B005K0HDGE|5|I stopped reading Stephen King after Pet Semetary. As others have said, he stopped ending his books and simply stopped them when he got tired of writing, and I got tired of waiting for an ending that never came. But the premise of this book was too good to pass up. First, I'm a sucker for time-travel stories. Second, the JFK assassination was one of the seminal events of my life, though I was very young when it happened. Third, while I had become totally disenchanted with King's work, I had been told by others whose opinions I trust that his more recent work was getting back to his original promise. So, I picked it up.  I am so glad I did. The book is excellent, beginning to end. Even King's heavy-handed attempts at foreshadowing didn't get in the way of my enjoyment. King creates wonderful characters and makes you care what happens to them, and this book is no exception. Jake and Sadie and Miz Ellie and Deke are like old friends now. The plot's twists and turns were like being on the best kind of roller coaster. And the ending - and there is an ending to this one - was perfect.   Another review called this book \\"mature.\\" I would have to agree. The closest to supernatural this book comes is in the basic trope of time-travel, but the book is about so much more. If you love Stephen King, read this book. If you used to love Stephen King but became disenchanted, read this book. If you have never read Stephen King or think you hate his writing, read this book. You'll be glad you did.

B001ANSS5K|3|It was well written just didn't hold my attention..... I sort of just wanted it be over so it was over not because I wanted to find out what happened.
B00E8KLWB4|4|The puzzles are fun and very attractive. The additional puzzle levels are a nice change from straight hidden object. Many levels to unlock.
B0017SWPXY|4|I really enjoyed this book, I had never read a book from a dogs perspective but I really was touched by this. I know a lot of the locations in the book being from the Pacific NW which made it very engaging. I got a little tired of the racing jargon but I suppose that's part of the metaphor. Overall, I enjoyed this very much.
6303418287|1|WHY OH WHY IS EVERY SINGLE THING SO EXAGGERATED? DOES BRANAGH BELIEVE THAT SHELLEY'S WRITING IS OF POOREST QUALITY? I WAS SICKENED TO SEE EXCELLENT ACTORS MAKING TOTAL ARSES OF THEM SELVES.
B0064MPXFA|5|I never doubt that I am going to enjoy each and every episode that I watch.  I do like courtroom drama and interesting characters and consistently good acting and this series has all of that.  Margolis is absolutely beautiful and watching her visably process information, never getting flustered, dealing with marriage, children, feelings she shouldn't have and all the while looking so well groomed and elegant is just a perfect fantansy for women. Unlike watching and resenting  most &#34;perfect&#34; women,  I believe we all fantasize on being beautiful, extremely intelligent, quickwitted and courageous so watching our fantasy materialize on screen is a lot of fun.<br /><br />peach melba

B0083Z6AH6|4|I’ve long been a Jane Austen fan and this is my favorites. The slow rekindling of Anna and Wentworth’s love is beautifully told and you can’t help by be drawn in. It starts out a bit slow, but picks up as you get deeper into the story.
B0094K38KQ|5|Awesome movie! Truly enjoyed it! Watched with nephews.
B00JV5POOM|5|Great album
B00HGJ18C2|4|My favorite method of passing time.  When I am not reading, I'm playing this. It meets all my requirements!  All.
B00FFWMI8U|5|I was lucky enough to stumble upon these guys after reading another review.  From start to finish what a great album Curse and Chapter ended up being.  If you put Judas Priest, King Diamond, Lizzy Borden, and Hammerfall in a blender and turn it up to high this is what you end up getting.  Lead singer has nice clean vocals with screams and wails when he needs to, good accompanying background Manowar type chants, kick ass guitars, and pounding drums.  I hope Hell makes it big.  I know that if they ever come to the NYC area I will definitely be in attendance.  Go and buy it....you truly will not be disappointed.  This band stands amongst themselves with obvious influences from past metal band legends.
B003NX75B8|5|this should be required reading in all high schools!  I laughed, I cried and hated for it to end.  I'm handing my I-pad over to my husband because I can't wait to share this experience with him.  I know he will enjoy it as much as I did.  When he's done, I'm going to download your other books!  kudos all around!
B009NY43NY|3|I was disappointed in this novel. I love this series, but the ending seemed a little to rushed to tie up loose ends. The resolutions seemed too simplistic compared to the prior predicaments faced by our beloved characters in previous installments.
B003JYOFIW|5|Not a bad song on this album! Whereas some bands try to do this and you can tell they've \\"deteriorated,\\" DEVO pumps out a rejuvenated, upgraded sound that's still true to their essence. Mark, the lead singer sounds as crisp as he was in '82! Having followed DEVO since back in the day ;), I must say that this is their BEST album. It's hard to tell if there will be another \\"Whip It\\" from this collage, but as I stated before...there is not a bad song on this album! I love it, My kids love it...end of story!
B0051ANPZQ|4|I think kids aged 10 and up, teachers, and parents will enjoy this book. I love that it's simply told from the point of view of a fifth grader; yet it tackles big serious issues and leaves the reader reflecting upon their own humanKINDness.
B008EKMB82|5|Such a magic tale of interwoven lives! Ozeki  blends two beautiful stories of courage and compassion. This novel encompasses magic realism and honest history--of events and the human condition.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Setup was easy-- if you have a complex network (multiple WiFi Routers, etc.) you will need to know your network well.<br />Limited offering at the moment; we'd like to see more streaming options,  but we're hopeful that more will be available over time.
B00J5LXTUI|5|This is the one of the best action movie. Non stop action. My wife who normally falls asleep on movies she feels are not interesting was caught up in the movie & was impressed. Now I'm going to buy the first sequel as that is just as good.

B000URWYTS|1|Not worth the paper it's written on. Could have been written about anyone. Frank's name sells the title but it's a story about disrespected love and vows.
B000QCTNIW|5|This is an older book by  Norman Doidge and is followed by The Brains Way of Healing that came out in January 2015.  Both books are well worth reading if you are in a medical field or just interested.  Both books have good points for teachers or parent on how to help others.This is a most important pair of books.
0743298020|5|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The writing is art.  The story unique.  I could not put it down, nor could my daughter.  We anxiously await Setterfield's next book!
B00FAX6XQC|4|A really good simulation for deer hunting and other game. It's only downside was the fact that animals could fall through trees.
B00BBW16HW|5|My spouse & I really enjoyed this film. It's a good story about how the best in a person can shine through when there is trust and goodness and love. And how a friendship can develop when you least expect it.
B00C69EP1S|4|Great insight into the workings of the state department and balancing diplomacy with politics.  Hillary is brilliant and honest and I enjoyed reading her take on working in the public.
B0027MJU00|4|Gillian Flynn has this incredible way of making you start out disliking the character, but by the end of the book, you are rooting for them.  Libby Day is that character!  This book is a must read for Ms Flynn fans!
055380684X|5|Really good reading if you are really interested on management and if you want to improve your ideas and knowledge on how to train people and get the best from them. Recommended for students as well.
B000J4OYTK|5|This is not a review on the album Tommy as far as the songs go because we all know how brilliant this album is from start to finish. But I must say that Classic Records did a masterful job at repressing this vinyl at 140 grams in weight. The packaging is fantastic and it sounds better than ever. I usually never hear any loud cracks and pops when purchasing the 140, 150, 180 and 200 gram vinyl. If the companies like Classic records keep on pressing them, I will keep on buying them. They are keeping vinyl alive and fresh by doing this and the response has been phenomenal. Even the packaging is pretty much a replica of the original pressing which makes you feel like you are buying an album just like you did in the 70's and 80's. Way to go Classic Records on this incredible Tommy pressing.

B000002OG5|5|I love all of the  Godfather series.  My favorite is Godfather 1, from the beginning! Marlon Brando was outstanding in the role.
B00000IQW3|5|Whereas some are simply content to save the world, \\"The Last Starfighter\\" aspires to saving the universe; the way this comes about is the theme of this movie.<br /><br />The future hero is presented as a young man on the road to nowhere; frustrated by his circumstances he has developed phenomenal skills with a particular video game. Unknown to him, the video game he has excelled in is connected to a universal search for those few with the natural skills to pilot a starfighter.<br /><br />His amazing ability results in a visit from an alien, ably played by Robert Preston, who invites him to join the forces of good to help in defeating the forces of evil. He has a beautiful girlfriend, played by Catherine Mary Stewart, whose presence complicates his decision as to what he should do.<br /><br />The adventures which follow include light-speed trips to space stations, meetings with many alien races and the challenge they all face in confronting a determined enemy.<br /><br />The movie is fun to watch and has a very satisfying ending; I don't think I'll spoil the ending by saying the forces of good triumph over the forces of evil, thanks in no small part to our young hero.<br /><br />Regardless of which version you buy, this one is a worthy addition to the library of any sci-fi enthusiast.
B000LTAY1U|1|Maybe it's just the battery from sitting on the shelf for too long, but this watch lost 15 minutes a day. I used to wear nothing but Seiko's but have found their quality lacking in the last couple I've bought. This is a pretty small watch. It's more suited for a woman or small man as opposed to a full sized guy. Make sure you check the face size against a watch you currently own.
B000Q7B8FS|2|Not at all happy at the moment with this purchase only because 3/4 of the way through watching it on my laptop the sound suddenly disappeared. That is the only reason I have given it a 2 star rating at the moment. I love the movie itself which is why I bought it but currently not a happy camper.
0756405890|4|I HAVE READ SOME OTHER REVIEWS ON THIS SITE SAYING HOW BAD THIS BOOK IS.  I DONT AGREE BUT MAYBE I AM NOT AS SMART AS THE REST. I LOVED THIS BOOK AND HAVE READ IT SEVERAL TIMES.  I HAVE NOTICED IN THE BOOK SOME SLOW PARTS AND I HAVE NOTICED SOME BAD DIALOG.  WHEN I READ I DONT THINK ABOUT OTHER BOOKS AND I TRY NOT TO ANALYZE TOO MUCH.  IF YOU OVER THINK ANY BOOK YOU CAN FIND FAULTS AND BAD WRITING. JUST PICTURE THE STORY IN YOUR HEAD AND GO WITH IT.  IS IT ORIGINAL...SOMEWHAT BUT WHAT IS NOWADAYS.  LOOK AT AVATAR IF YOU START THINKING YOU WILL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST 5 MIN.  I READ ABOUT 2 BOOKS A WEEK AND I LIKE THIS BOOK. IS IT A GREAT BOOK NO BUT IT IS A GOOD BOOK THAT I THOUGHT READS WELL.  READ A FEW TOLKIEN BOOKS AND TELL ME AS GOOD AS THEY ARE THEY ARE NOT HARD TO READ.  JUST DONT THINK ABOUT WHATS NOT IN THE BOOK OR WHAT IS LIKE OTHER BOOKS JUST READ IT. SORRY FOR ANY SPELLING ERRORS BUT SINCE I LIKE THE BOOK I PROVE I CANT BE THAT SMART. LOL

B000FC2L1E|5|This is the best series I have ever read. The author weaves a web and draws you in until you can't put the book down. I started with the first book Outlander and was amazed at such a well thought out story. I can't wait to finish Voyager and see where the author takes us next!
B000S0DDG0|4|Good movie!!!! Jennifer Hudson is awesome!!!!
1905492073|5|Fantastic book.  Written in a non-technical style with TONS of information for the recreational diver through Trimix diver.  One of my 3 must read scuba books.  The other 2 being Steve Lewis's &#34;Six Skills&#34; and &#34;Staying Alive&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5|A awesome game and real cool gives you boosters and you can play with friends on Facebook. you should play it too.
B003YL4LYI|3|I'm locked into the series and will continue reading, but these books need some editing.  The detail paints a very clear picture of the situation as it happens, but we have a huge amount of background going on that doesn't move the story along.  I don't need the type and color of every horse in an army.  Eagerly awaiting the next book!

B00D29CBIU|3|I've used EFT in the past and am always looking for more/new information on its application. A few chapters into the book it is well written. Each chapter ends with a suggested video (URL is provided). Going to that URL one must provide an email address which, of course, means offers for over-priced products, seminars, and &#34;live&#34; (they're always pre-recorded) phone events. When I saw the &#34;value&#34; of $997 I shook my head -- this seems to be the favored product price of hucksters like Joe Vitale, et al. I will finish reading the book, but will now do it with a wary eye....
B00TEAVEY8|5|Awesome !!I  It's a little different than the one on my big computer but I love it !! Thank you !!!
0385352107|5|Quite typical of Murakami's writing, but more easy to read comparing with his previous works. Marvelous.
0618680004|3|Two goldilocksfish swimming around in a bowl.. One says to the other:    `If there is no God, how come: 1) The temperature in here is just right; 2) Food arrives regularly; 3) The water gets cleaned?     The second goldilocksfish (who happens to be a Professor for the Goldilocksfish Understanding Of Science) replies:    ` It is probable that we live in a multiverse that contains an astronomically large number of fish-bowls. Most of those bowls will be completely lifeless. The fact that we are here able to discuss the matter means that we are fortunate to live in one of the tiny number of bowls capable of sustaining evolved life. In the words of the old song: We' re here because we' re here, because we're here! `     {NB If you don't see the relevance, of the story above, to Dawkins' book, then I suggest you re-read pages 169-180 of The God Delusion.}
B00004I9PJ|3|S3 is a real curiosity. The three megastars would probably rather omit this from their screen credits. The viewer will either be mesmerized by the incredibly bad acting or hang in there thinking it will eventually get better. Let's examine why this doesn't work first.  The first problem that becomes evident is Harvey Keitel's voice... it's not his! HK obiously didn't stick around long after completion. The dubbing at least matches but Harvey's voice is so recognizable and integral to his acting style it's nearly impossible to comment on his performance.  Problem two is Farrah. I think it's been established that FF could turn out a convincing emotionally charged performance. She surprised her critics during the mid eighties showing a gift for playing vulnerable abused women pushed to their limit in Burning Bed and later in Extremities. She also revealed another level of her ability with the complex characterization in Small Sacrifices. Farrah quickly gained a new level of respect and became much more than eye candy... which is why S3 will be a step down for anyone acquainted with that aspect of her career. Here she's still on a level with her acting in Charlies Angels. It would be another couple of years before she would show what she was capable of.   Which brings us to problem three - Kirk Douglas. This is neither an underplayed or emotionally wrought Douglas. This is Douglas in limbo. It's hard to find words for his performance and it seems Douglas was having trouble as well. He spends the entire film trying to decide how to approach the character. Perhaps on the surface this looked liked perfect casting. Douglas' Adam is a sensitive yet virile older man who suddenly feels threatened by the arrival of another (younger) male to his environment and love interest. Unfortunately a situation ripe for emotional Douglas never sparks him to the occasion.  S3 does have several interesting concepts and themes underlying its glossy facade. The situation for one. You have a &#34;Knife in the Water&#34; type  scenario with abundant possibilities. As stated by another reviewer, you have several visuals that seem to inspire and undeniably make S3 an important rung on the ladder to modern action science fiction cinema but these engaging elements are mostly overshadowed by the strange (and at times embarrassingly bad) acting throughout.
B007XKEY6Q|5|I love to guess and draw!!!
030758836X|5|I have never read Gillian Flynn, and don't have a lot of interest in the mystery or psychological thriller genre, so when I first heard about this book, I didn't think it was for me. But after 3 different people mentioned it to me in a week - each with very different reading tastes - I decided I should give it a try, and I was glad. It was hard to put down, and kept me guessing throughout. I did anticipate some of the plot developments, but never was positive before they occurred, so it was far from predictable. I found myself wondering what was going to happen next each time I couldn't read for a few hours, so that's the sure sign of an engaging read. I don't want to say too much re: the plot because this is definitely a book you will best enjoy knowing little going in, but thematically it really plays with themes of marriage, whether you can really ever know someone, and the relationship between the media and reality in our modern lives. It's not heady though - this is a page-turner as I said - so these themes are covered through the story, not navel-gazing.<br /><br />As for complaints in negative reviews, it's true the main characters - Nick and Amy, a married couple - each have many unlikable traits, but they are also very intriguing (boring would be the worst quality in a main character I think, not dislikability.) And I think complaints about the ending are overly cranky - I read several 1-star reviews where the reviewer says he/she loved the book until the end. Why rate it a 1 -star if you liked 90% of it? Reading a book is a journey, and if you like most of the journey, you like most of the book!! There were only a handful of ways this could have ended, and in many ways, this was the most surprising, so I think it was a fine choice (although I also wondered how else I might have ended it, but I consider that kind of wondering the sign of an engaging book, not a failure.)<br /><br />So I think it's worthy of the hype. Give it a try!
B004GJDQT8|2|items did not show up on guaranteed delivery date.
B0052RDHTM|5|I could not lay this book down. I'm ready to start volume 2 of the trilogy. Very well written historical novel.
B0043ZDU1E|5|This collection bears the stamp of Loreena McKennit, that's for sure.  The feeling I get is one of gratitude, and of appreciation for one's roots.  Beautifully Celtic!  She does a fine job of promoting and exhibiting the culture without sounding as though it was all a lecture on history.  I especially admire the way she manages to bring old songs to life and make them sound like new.  No doubt the original composers would have bought this CD, too, had they had them at the time.
B00GINENG0|5|This game is so cute and adorable. Tom repeats every thing you say. But u can't leave him by himself to long because then he becomes hungry,sleepy, and has to use the bathroom. It is so fun how you get to see him grow if I could I would give it 5 1/2 stars
B0062YADWI|5|It is smaller than I thought but also lighter. Great for a key chain. Now where do i find a bottle to open?
B008JGSM6G|3|Nice quick puzzles.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|Great experience. On time
B00742GBDM|2|First the good:  cinematography and acting.  However, the story line is so deliriously off course and infused with modern overtones of homosexual attraction, a sex scene and graphic images of violence it was quite disturbing when one considers this is an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Fantastically off the mark.  If you like her books, I would not recommend it.
B006UUK612|5|this is a family favorite .  Its a good fun movie . Kids and adults like it in my family
B002UXRGM0|5|As usual in nearly every BBC-HD blu-ray, the documentary is excellent, we think that with the same quality of \\"Planet earth\\" (or even better). It is worthy to spent money in this product if you have an HDTV and, of course, you feel some attraction by nature documentaries. The narrator is an important aspect to be taken into consideration in the purchase.
B0007GAEW6|5|Well how to start..........ill just say this  cd is amazing ill give you guys a quick rating on each song.... <br /> <br />Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus: 5/5 This song is a great opener <br /> <br />The Widow: 5/5 This song just defines The Mars Volta <br /> <br />L'via L'viaquez: 4/5 a little quirky and its half spanish half english still good though <br /> <br />Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore: 3.5/5 this song is just a wired music synthesizer jam not very good but when the lyrics come its an ok song <br /> <br />Cassandra Geminni: 5/5 this song is a little over 30 minutes long, its a very good song if you have a lot of time to listen to it its got great guitar and synthesizer beats i loved it and it has a good ending <br /> <br />My favorite is Cygnus just becuase of the way its performed and everything i would definatley advise buying this if you are into emo/ prog rock
B00HCMG6LG|5|great way to keep your brain active and also a good way to pass the time. not too hard not too difficult. just an all around fun game
B0000026VZ|3|I don't know if you are aware, but there is a better compilation of Toto (Toto's greatest hits) that is much more complete as this one, since it's on a double CD. You will lose the songs from Jean Michel Byron (bonus  tracks from past to present), but is that so important ? (I don't like him,  he imitates Michael Jackson); and what you win is &quot;Stranger in town,  If you belong to me, Holyanna, Don't chain my heart, gypsy train, straight  for the heart...&quot; , isn't it much better ?
