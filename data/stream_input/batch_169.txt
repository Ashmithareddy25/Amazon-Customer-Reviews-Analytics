B00I8H6O2U|5|Love Burton clothing & this is no exception. flattering to wear around before you throw on the rest of your gear :)
B007QC3D9K|5|Right part, perfect fit and now the blinkers work. The price was right. I would if needed buy it again.
B002U6WX0M|5|Very high quality piece.
B000E7WLJW|5|It works, just what I was looking for!
B0002KKIXC|5|It's great. :)
B001A0J2JO|5|Freakin best thing I've ever gotten for any of my cars. Loved it so much<br />in the Forester that I put one in the Insight and the Festiva as well. It's<br />curved at the ends so you get a little bit extra vision along your sides<br />and usually you can see out of the window you're sitting next to at the<br />same time.
B000J3ZPF8|4|Tight fit and works well.
B003IS3HV0|5|this is **amazing** stuff!<br />I had a pair of boots with some crazy powdery bloom on it -- never worn, so it couldn't have been any road salts, etc.  Most possibly badly tanned leather.  HOURS of previous efforts included saddle soap, some bs aerosol leather cleaner, rubbing alcohol--nothing worked as the powdery stuff always came back worse than before--but this stuff and the cleaner pulled off a miracle.  THis was my hail mary and it totally saved them!<br />A little goes a loooong way--and definitely use a square of lint free cloth.  I latex gloved up (sticky and a bit hard to wash off) and used one of my many eyeglass cleaning cloths to apply it.
B00I14W7YY|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B006N979D8|5|Fit perfectly on my '98 Nissan Frontier and put the front end back in full working condition. I have to question one thing, however, and that is that I only received one link, not two as the pictures would indicate. That didn't matter to me since I only needed one, but I wonder if I got shorted or if something has changed. Whatever. My truck is fixed and it was pretty cheap.
B0002SRD0U|5|This is a must for anyone who handles a lot of deep cycle batteries.
B00VS0FK4M|5|This is an EXCELLENT growler. I use it for drinking water throughout the day and am very impressed.
B00BMTZRWY|4|Worked as expected...very simple to use
B00F0MCUPQ|2|installed this and kept it but the bars have a flat spot where you step.  the flat spot however is angled outward, not level with the ground but angling outward, which makes slipping much more likely.  i would not recommend ordering this item for that reason.  it is off by maybe 10 degrees.
B0075KXV7C|5|Excellent cover. Easy to install
B002EIJLII|5|Great performance and great for!
B00VAVT5U4|4|Everything went well. All the parts fit my truck.
B000E8T80Q|5|Da best...
B00065L2D8|5|When a storm knocks my power off I have one of these clamped to some trickle charged car batts, boat batts ans a 12 volt to ac converter so i can keep some stuff going
B0078PHHEM|5|Good price and fast shipment. look forward to doing bussing with them again.

B00OSB2CUS|5|Very happy with this product, great fit on my 2015  F-150 and very easy to install. Great cover at a great price.
B00IHRZ9F4|2|These only stay on in the summer for about 2 months before the glue melts and they slide off.
B001CEG90I|4|Good product.
B00KUL73DG|5|Perfect fit.

B00D8LA0SK|5|Looks good and fits perfect. With a Carbon Fiber License frame -  Awesome combination .
B00LIUFF1A|5|Fit perfect
B006B29U6Q|2|I bought it for my r6. 09. I'm a professional mechanic and I tried to install it. I had to make major modifications to my stock current exhaust system to get it to fit on properly. Sounds good but wasn't easy to install
B00EIIP9EM|4|Great quality!
B00SIBI8IO|5|Very good deal . Not super dark so you can still see plates which might help avoid problems with the poe poe .
B008E7QZ5K|1|Had a mechanic to install assembly and it worked for 6 days before going out. Mechanic pulled this one out and tested it and found out that the &#34;pump&#34; itself had gone BAD (in 6 days) ----- we needed the complete &#34;assembly&#34; and searched everywhere that we knew to search but the only &#34;assembly&#34; that we could find for this particular vehicle was Airtex brand. The mechanic told us that he never uses Airtex brand fuel pumps as he has had problems with the &#34;pumps&#34; from Airtex. We decided to purchase a different &#34;pump&#34; and use the rest of the Airtex assembly and so far, so good. We threw the Airtex &#34;pump&#34; in the garbage.
B004YWPELA|5|Great product
B00TG8ZP0W|5|Very nice license plate holders.  Heavier than I expected and really pretty
B008HSLTGQ|5|Works great!
B00X5GEWCS|5|These are a perfect fit for my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium. They install in seconds with the 3M tape and look beautiful.
B00BKXE1GU|5|now my dash board is lit up again!  great service great product
B0043063JU|5|The 9x12 reversible mat is perfect for RV's. It is lightweight, will not absorb moisture (perfect for NW rainforest camping), covers a large area, has loops in the corners so it can be staked in place, and the colors are neutral enough to go w/ any RV (colors are true to pictures). Other than the fact it was lost during shipment & prime 2 day delivery turned into a week, I give this item the highest rating. Hopefully it is durable enough to sustain such high marks.
B006JRJA0Y|5|Just what was on my tank
B001URQU7E|5|well made, vented leather. Gel pads keep my hands from going to sleep. Will purchase again
B00V30J86I|1|His would've been great, if it had fit in my car.....

B000AS1XYO|5|This will give heft to your 2W20 oil in the winter and prevent too much thinning when it's 100 degrees and your in traffic with the A/C on full blast...protects well.
B005SUU2HS|2|the flat tip on the end came off , broke off??????
B00HRZVC6W|5|The mats fit perfect,  great quality,  great price. Would look for more stuff from this seller.
B001NYNPIQ|1|Had to return them very lightweight they bent when I walked on them
B00N21GMRO|2|No Complaints from vendor. However, I received my headlights, excited to install them. Checked all fittings and installed headlights (first time doing a full install and start to finish it only took 1.5 hours, taking my time) they looked sweet. Stock bulbs that come with it are good.<br /><br />2 days in, headlights had condensation inside them. Called Recon, was closed. Was swapping resistors in my taillights too (Anzo), called Anzo and told them te situation they overnight mailed my parts for free. E-mailed recon once I had my truck back together since I couldn't troubleshoot that night. Got a response from Chris in the Florida Division. He wanted me to dismantle my truck, get my heat gun and soften the bonding between the housing and lens, then dry it and re-epoxy it together. Then hope I don't mess it up, and hope for the best. YEAH RIGHT! They were 2 days old, Customer Service 101 is &#34;Shoot us back that headlight after we send you one and it should work fine, sorry about that.&#34; I even told him I wanted to just switch it, he said no shot.<br /><br />Took the headlight off, checked all seals, dried it out and put it in. Looked great...for about 5 days until it got condensation again. I advise you to buy the Anzo headlights. Look just as good, same construction, much better customer service and my friends truck looks just as good for half the price.<br /><br />Want to support small business (recon that is) right next door in CT but they have no customer service!
B000GZSZH4|1|Wasted money on this product!!
B0002Q80RW|4|Works

B001D8TGJE|5|Good brush!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works very well, paired with Bluetooth and works great with Torque app.
B00NIDOIKE|4|I bought these seat covers for my 2015 Toyota RAV4 and the fit were almost near perfect. The only big issue I had with these covers was that they didn't arrive with no Instructions to install them. But other than that, these make your interior look 10x better!
B00TQ4IJX6|5|The spoiler arrived very quickly in about a week in a well packaged Styrofoam container for protection.<br />The carbon finish was perfect and installation was easy.  Very satisfied with this purchase for my Tesla!

B002RZUMW2|5|Fits on my motorcycle tank beautifully. Great!
B00D5ZKZAC|5|As expected. Genuine hyundai parts for less than local dealer prices.
B0050Z4J8O|2|The install was relatively easy, however these were advertised on amazon as 55W and both the ballast you need and these Xenon bulbs are 35W, in addition I purchased the 20,000K bulbs which came labeled as such and should be blue, but are not blue in the slightest, they're merely white and nothing else.
B0040D2QVE|1|Simply were too wide for the clip holes in the doors of my 99 Jepp Grand Cherokee Laredo
B00AEH4PP0|5|Nice fit.
B003VZXY4K|1|DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I ODER THIS KILL SWITCH NEVER REVICED NOTHING!!
B007P14NPU|3|does not connect with the mk5 jetta tdi
B00GG9FCW0|5|WORKS Great.
B0031I207O|5|covers my scooter nicely which is 74.4 inches long 27.5 inches wide
B0051MYLS4|4|Pretty much worthless for cleaning my 2006 Dodge Caravan wheels, but around the house it's a terrific cleaner - kitchen floors, cabinets, walls, counter tops, windows..everything. Red microfiber towel cover is easy to remove and launder.  Best wheel cleaner I've ever used and will cont' to use - [[ASIN:B001RMMHHE Carrand 40102 Giant 8.75&#34;x4.75&#34;x3&#34; Bone Sponge]]
B00NBN1C78|4|Having a jack on your boat, horse trailer or other light trailer is a great idea. It means you don't have to carry something extra in your truck and means you will have it with you when you need it. They did a good job at including everything you will need, though the jack's size means lighter trailers and RVs/campers only. The box has a latch for a lock, but would not keep a motivated thief out. It is also open on the end, meaning weather, road salt and the like is going to get into and on the tools. So it is not just a mount and forget, you will need to take them tools out to clean them every so often. Or otherwise weather proof the items. I've considered a weatherproofed bag along with a light coating of oil, but we will see if that works. My experience has been that horse and motorcycle trailer tires are magnets for nails, so this is worth it to me. But at the $100 price tag everyone will have to consider the cost for piece of mind and usefulness. It is cheaper and easier than getting a flat in the middle of nowhere though.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Very happy with them
B003GCSJAC|5|Nice lil key chain and nohhh stick so to speak cause you never know when your out late walking home or to the car people are out there to get you so this come in handy and fast service thanks

B00I15ATQQ|1|Bad I don't  won't  buy again  in here part's  for cars
B00274XAGS|5|Installed in a 1998 Acura Integera LS.  Made in Japan and looks identical to the original pump removed.
B0078IFMRI|2|Fleur de ls decal much smaller and skinnier than shows on the internet.  Was a bit surprised actually, but it was for my mailbox so not a big deal.
B0046C9126|5|My car is back on the road thanks to the affordability
B00TKO0J6C|5|Love the light fixture !!!!!
B000BZ95E6|5|worked perfect
B000VUATNC|5|The bed mat is a perfect fit. Better price than the parts stores in my area, and faster shipping as well. I'm very pleased!
B004RCX770|3|Did not need it
B000HM6UO6|3|Be advised, this &#34;stabilizer&#34; does NOT come with the installation brackets. I did not see that piece of information when I ordered the stabilizer shock.<br />I assumed it was a stabilizer assembly since the photo shoes the mounts installed; not just a component of the stabilizer.
B003LS768M|1|Not what I was looking for after it arrived.  Would like to return.
B00D9C2CDO|5|We were worried everything inside will get get .. We were under rain for hours!! And nothing got wet ! And can I say it fits more than expected! 2 full inflatable beds with frame ... 2 comforters ... 4 pillows ... 2 adult size folding chairs ... 2 kids folding chair ... a beach bag with towels inside ... plus a hiking backpack!
B006URX6K8|4|worked fine
B010EGPAE0|5|This vent is made super well. O ring should be replaceable when it gets old. Works perfectly. I followed the directions. I only had a 1/2 wood hole bit, but the vent snapped into the plastic great. I don't want to epoxy because this vent will outlast the can & Ill use it again.
B00GBVHPNW|5|Product came as advertised
B00NFEH7PY|5|Nice Air caps cover
B00IC6LE54|2|Worked great for 3-4 trips. Got it down yesterday and found one of the seams torn open. No weather on the trip just highway driving. Really surprised it came apart.
B008XB9BJY|5|Good so far. Product has performed as advertised.
B00V5FTME4|4|Everything looks great, all the hardware to mount the brackets and individually packaged thus taking out the quest work on what goes with what, only issue was with missed delivery time, paid for 2 day shipping and placed order on 26th, received the package on the 30th, though amazon did refund the shipping costs and the item was not needed immediately so satisfied overall
B0031I4HNE|5|I purchased two of these to replace the stock discs on my 06 Denali. The retaining bolts were a pain to remove so I suggest you use your trusty breaker bar for the job like I did.
B0050EITTK|3|Does the job for which it was made and lasts a long time between recharging.  That's the good news.  The bad news is, backflushing and recharging are a bit more difficult than with smaller units.  My Watts RV Pro-1000 did not come with a back-flush adapter (needed to hook up a hose to the OUTPUT valve).  To get that job done, I had to borrow my adapter from the guy I gave my old On-the-Go water softener.  The directions are also vague and incomplete.  They tell you how to back-flush, but no clue for how long.  I hope 10 mins is about right.  When regenerating they tell you to drain a few cups of water out of the unit before adding the 2 lbs of table salt, by gently tilting the unit.  However, you can lay the thing parallel on the ground and it barely dribbles out.  If you've followed the previous directions, all the valves are closed at this point, and nothing is going to drain out.  I opened the outlet valve and it still may take you hours to get a few cups out.  Another way to do it, is to remove the tank head fill port and pouring out some water that way... however, they warn you may also be pouring out the ion exchange resin which will cause a decrease in system capacity.  I think I've already poured out half that Ion stuff in two recharges.  If the directions were complete and they provided the female to female adapter needed to back-flush, I might have given it 5 stars.  As it is, and for the high price, not sure I would recommend it.
B00TPZOQSI|3|It fell apart rather quick.
B004W5SGBO|5|Holds my battery great.
B00Z8TGYR6|5|Always amazing products. Highly recommended over the top name expensive brands. I've had a recon Tailgate bar. This is equally as good. Side by side. You would not know the difference. But at a high fraction of the price. Amazing customer service. Fast responses. Fast shipping. Broken? Give them a shout and boom, it's in the mail.
B00BQE5YUK|3|Shine super bright but some of the blues between strips aren't exactly the same shade of blue. They still work great though.
B00B9ESFF8|5|Great service!! Great product!!
B00W3S363U|3|Dissapointed the metal bands were silver and not black
B003JLJLVQ|5|These bags look to be well made and pretty roomy.  Installed on 1999 Buell M2 Cyclone.  Because I want to leave them on all the time, I ran the hang strap under the seat for a better look.  The strap is heavy duty and thick so it raises the seat a bit and makes it harder to catch the seat bolt, but it works.  Good overall fit and look for universal fit bags, but could use some sort of framework to keep them from curling in at the bottom.  With so many different sport bikes and their lack of framework, I expected this condition, and knew it'd be up to me to figure out a modification to remedy it.  Overall I feel these bags are a great value.
B00027GXDE|3|These do NOT include the gasket.  You need to order the gasket separately or find one locally.
B0049MX8N6|5|Fit was perfect on 2010 Equinox (although I did have to work a little to get the rust out of the self threaded nuts in the frame) For me this was the  least expensive option (out of the several identical models with different brands) made by Cequent Group
B00931JTAO|5|works
B008BMNIIU|5|Just as described
B000C44D20|4|Product was as described and I  received it  quickly.  Price was better than any other I could find
B00IBOLYFC|5|Outstanding fit and finish!<br />The product surface was much more attractive than the Weather tech products that I have seen in the past.<br />These mats are worth their price!
B00YBFTC90|5|Great sealant product for campers.  Easy application, and self-levels well.
B000OCFIAQ|5|Put an impact socket on this and use an air or battery wrench and this will press just about anything  you can throw at it.  The frame is very meaty and didn't flex at all using my Milwaukee fuel impact on u-joints .
B0007Y6MCO|5|Perfect replacement for my 2005 StarCraft camper lighting.
B000BV9MA2|5|Kept me from getting stuck. Easy to store. Takes just minutes to fill or dump.
B000AA4RWM|5|Seems to work well.  Will need a few camping trip levelings to know for sure.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Looks nice
B001F1VZ8O|5|Worked out great on my motorcycle
B00WXBYYR4|5|A/C nice and cold again! Better price than in stores.
B00X54TANG|5|perfect color nice size.. very satisfied
B00EQD8GCG|3|Having problems with the auto up feature on the front windows. They sense an obstruction and drop down. Very annoying!
B00JJX1T5Y|1|UPDATE - 2/15/2016.<br />This was installed in August 2015 and strictly used the vehicle on the weekend. After 6 months and maybe 30 weekends of usage, one side is broken. It looks embarrassing and proof that this product's quality was poorly manufactured. I contacted the company and was told that there is only a 90 day warranty, however, no where in the product description does it state that. This is an LED light - not a product that is  put in daily use subject to daily wear and tear. It's a light bulb which should stand the test of time for thousands of hours. You can buy an LED bulb at home depot for $2 and it guarantees to last for 10,0000 hours. This LED light which cost $140 didn't even last 6 months.<br /><br />Buyer beware, if you want something that is manufactured properly, stay away. Or take risk at your own expense.<br /><br />8/2015<br />I am somewhat satisfied with the product bc it updated the look of my 2005 350z. The lens seem well built and shine very bright at night.<br /><br />I took away one star because of the direction is so confusing. Because this only fits in a 350z, you must hook up the the red wire to the headlight (low beam) fuse. The low beam headlight is located in the fuse behind the battery. Note that  There are two fuse boxes - each in front and behind the battery. You can search a video of how to locate this. I wish the direction said this.<br /><br />Furthermore, the red wire is too short to reach the fuse. As a result, I had to extend the wire myself.<br /><br />There is also a white wire which I didn't touch bc the light works. Honestly, I don't even know what to do w the white wire, but the light works.
B00EDFM6R8|5|These lights are exactly what you're looking for: An almost exact replacement for incandescent bulbs for your RV or camper. I replaced both 912 and 921 socket bulbs with these. The color is a warm white, even whiter that the original bulbs (which were slightly yellow), They do not have the annoying bluish tint. I'm very happy and you will be too if you order them!!!
B0049MZBY0|5|Ordered this hitch to put on our 2009 Honda Odyssey.  Install was pretty simple (other than the tough threads in the Odyssey frame) but I think I only had to pull off 2 exhaust hangers to slip this hitch in then bolt it up.
B00CCOBOI4|5|IT REALLY DEFENDS YOUR CAR..AMAZING PRODUCT
B007USCMJM|5|Exactly as described
B00NSLTWIY|5|SOLID! These are large, heavy and bomber.
B0023VITP2|5|just what I ordered fits perfect
B001LRHHPC|2|Stopped working after 4 months.
B0041S1OUM|5|Works great for my Kitchen Aid repair.
B0057ZQJ12|5|Works as advertised, arrived swiftly and I will recommend it to anyone
B0002SRDUU|5|great value for a nice kit
B004RE5B7C|5|Great tank ring. Fit perfectly and allowed me to use a tank bag I already owned. Takes a little time to learn how to line it up when putting it on after filling up with gas but one you get the hang of it it's no problem. I like it better than I thought I wood.
B00MVKY3UK|2|This cover is claimed to be rain proof.  It is not!  I put it on the car and the first night it rained (not heavily) and the water went right through the fabric and wet the car.  Also, this car cover is claimed to be  four layer.  it is not!  Did the vendor send me the wrong product?
B0009ZEVLU|5|Comparable to OEM
B003R2U3LE|5|Perfectly fits my Honda Fit.  It is a bit bulky, and at times difficult to roll up.  Honestly though it keeps my car relatively cool in 95-105 degree weather.
B0080DT0JQ|5|They fit my 2013 hyundai elantra and were much cheaper than my local auto parts store
B00HBNTEA6|3|Haven't put it on the car yet...but the item is as described.
B00B3UV4GA|5|It matched the gold on my 2001 Saturn LW200. Once I put a clearcoat over it, it blended right in with the old paint, even on this old plastic bodied car.<br /><br />Fyi: I used [[ASIN:B006ZLPX3W Rust-Oleum Automotive 257884 11-Ounce Enamel Spray, Gloss Clear]] for my clear coat.
B0024NWWFC|2|I have had these installed for roughly a year and one of them looks like it is peeling. LIke it was painted with clear coat and now it is wearing off.  It looks terrible, I can only assume a quality defect.
B00SZK1G2I|5|At first I was like. Okay sweet. Brite ass bulbs. For a decent price. Good brand. Then one of them broke and bent. So I contacted opt7 and requested 1 new bulb. Not only was the customer service above and beyond. But the package got here within 3 days and I got 2 bulbs when I only requested one. Thanks opt7. Would recommend to anybody!
B009G7HC7M|5|Good
B0089D5SA2|5|It fits well. It is a genuine Ford products. It was very easy yo install following instructions. The instructions were great and it took about 30 minutes to install. There was no need to remove the wheels. All parts were included.
B0089W5Q0K|5|Exact fit and function as original. Not installed so no accurate report on end use but keeping it in glove-box as backup after my OEM acted up one day.
B00GBB1RMC|4|Model SDD-13 (the newest model, replacing the E-DC-5B), made by Yaesu, nice unit, has ferrite core to kill engine whine (if you have a poor ground system) and RF pickup from the six foot long power line, 4mm barrel plug, is a straight-through DC power plug, is fused, has a red LED power indicator, even has a 4-digit serial number (apparently mine is a little more than 3,600 units into the model run). Comes in a half-clam shell, half cardboard package. I purchased this for one of my 7 HT's (Yaesu VX-8DR) in collecting accessories. If you purchase the straight wire connector, you will still need to incorporate a current limiting board as you are charging a Li-Ion battery. The radio itself (at least the VX-8DR) deals with the voltage adjustment it needs from the VDC output (my radio showed 11 VDC in charging).<br /><br />It MUST get between 11 and 16 VDC at the socket (never more, never less), with a minimum of 2.1 amps available. The unit will limit the output to 2 amps, and pass whatever DC voltage was input (which should be between 12 and 13.8 VDC).<br /><br />It is actually meant to be used with the CD-41 rapid charger in a 12 VDC vehicle, but can be simply plugged into the radio directly.<br /><br />H-I-G-H-L-Y OVER-PRICED!  But... if your accessories must match (all OEM), you have no choice.<br /><br />This unit should really sell for about $13, half of what is charged, ergo, I gave it 4 stars and not 5.<br /><br />KK4VRE/ WQST332/ KRED333/ KNJ2MB
B00Q2QGB0Y|4|Kids love it.  They get a kick out of it when they burn it on.  Will buy again.
B00DX8A30I|4|No dimples in bars. Had to modify for my Harley.<br />They work.  Looks good.
B004GCDV9K|4|ok
B000EQB6NU|5|good product-gas saver
B0038N1VD6|5|Fits and with the proper positive and negative alignment for a Miata.
B004L08GC4|5|I ordered these to place on a curve in front of my house where drivers keep knocking the brick edging down. We just fixed the edge and put the reflectors up 2 days ago. So far it's good.
B0009MYHGM|5|just what i was expecting
B000JFHMUC|5|worked
B00DTX4YY8|2|Disappointed as I expected a vinyl decal that was more sturdy.  This is just a window sticker
B004KEKAY8|5|very pleased
B004RZU3Q0|5|Good bright lights- not dim like some on the market. Very easy to see, even in daylight. Side LED marker is bright as well.  Easy to wire & install.
B007K8AA7I|5|Easy installation and looks great, add a trim ring and save big over the Harley option.
B0058OPUSK|5|I love this steering wheel cover, I was concerned if it would fit but my worries are over because it's perfect for my chevy sonic
B00WAK0QXE|5|I put some in my Kubota diesel tractor. I'm not sure if it was my imagination or not, but it seemed to run smoother and quieter immediately (by several degrees), very noticeable.  Haven't been able to use it however as it's been in the shop for a week with a broken rear axle. Anxious to get it back with new blades and try out the ArchOil AR9100 additive.  I also added some of this oil additive to my Chevrolet Tahoe 5.3L V-8 gasoline engine oil and some of the fuel additive (AR6200) to the gas tank.  I haven't yet run through enough fuel to get an accurate read on my mileage, but I will update this review in a month or so when I have. I occasionally pull a 5000# capacity trailer with it, I'm hoping it will improve my mileage when doing so.
B00008RW9U|5|Works like a champ...
B00XOUD1PE|1|The low quality RCA connector pin broke before I even left the garage. I was leaving on my trip in a day so I soldered a new one on it. Then plastic (apparently non-flexible) tube broke in half when I pulled on it to put a flag on it.
B002EBYNWY|4|Good price for a known good product. Got what I needed and it arrived in good shape and on time.
B00A6AS6LY|4|Worked out great except that it does not have one adapter for JDM radiators. What I ended up doing was using 2 rubber washers, one on the bottom and one on the top against the type B knob- worked great
B00R1P9Z80|1|Decal was poor quality adhesive and came right off in the car wash. I followed all there instructions and I have put on hundreds of decals before. So I'm guessing there just using poor quality adhesive or they had a bad batch
B00EF3P63O|2|Opened the box to scraped up item. Instructions were lousy. Assembled and reassembled three times. I had to reprint it after assembly. It's cheap. But it works.
B0014E3MSS|5|works great
B000J3ZPUI|5|Coverking products are great -<br />Use it on my Camaro and it fit perfectly !<br />Great Product and keeps the car nice & cool now !<br />Highly Recommend.
B00DJ7OT62|1|The title claims &#34;Heavy Duty&#34;.  The hook gave-way once I had pressure applied.  Straight to the trash with this!
B00Q1RS83M|5|Very Bright. Great product for the price. Does exactly what we wanted it to do.
B000GUWVD8|4|Before you order this product you need to know that Kuryakyn technical services advised me that this part has been redesigned (&#34;for ease of installation&#34;).  The part that attaches to the crash guard more closely resembles the trailer hitch attachment for the 2012+ GL1800.  When I received the product I thought that they had sent me the wrong part.  It is installed now and I am happy with it but Amazon needs to update the photograph.  If you order this part for the 2001-2010 GL1800, you will receive part #7642.  You should know that the box still said 7647 but the instructions said 7642.  Fits my 2007 GL1800.  The installation was fairly simple but I installed it to make sure everything fit, then I took it apart and used blue loctite on all of the threads and reinstalled it.  I have not towed with it yet, yikes it 100 degrees outside every day.  When it cools off a little I will update.  I had no problems with clearances on the 3 places they tell you to check for clearances.
B0024ECBCA|5|So far so good.
B000CQTKVC|5|So far, have had no issues and happy with them.
B004UQQMYI|5|Great
B0059HJSA2|5|I saw the reviews claiming this product leaks, I did not have any such problems (also, those reviews seem to be quite old, maybe the product was fixed).  I liked this product because it has a wide top for catching the oil, a strainer to catch the oil pan bolt if you drop it (so you're not digging around in the oil looking for it), and a convenient small spout for pouring the used oil back into the oil cans for easy recycling.
B003R3JBFC|3|It match all, BUT its states ONE year warranty, so we'll see, labour was expensive to replace in one year. It should last years.....<br />That's why I give it 3 ***
B0051PJWQW|4|Works well with a headlight lens polish.  But the fogginess comes back after couple months and needs retreatment.
B00067BWW2|5|Very easy to install and it's a great product
B00FDBQZCS|5|Good product.. Just had to change the wires around but o would buy from them again..
B001AJH1HK|5|I used two of these mirrors in a 600 mile move with the largest U haul trailer they rent.  I put them on a 2010 Xterra and they worked great.  I could see what I was pulling and no adjustments were required during the trip.  It took about 10 minutes per side to get them out of the box, install them and adjust them.  You can take them off and put them back on in about two minutes per side after you have them adjusted.  They do a great job.  Money well spent.
B00RIV7C4Q|5|Good fit
B00KTHYAUU|5|Works great, looks slightly different than OEM, but I never really cared for the sombrero emblem anyways
B005MZXATG|5|great product.
B006N933VU|5|Good quality item
B00CG5RYEW|5|i love it.put it on the day jobs truck but my fat like really fat and gross boss had it scrubbed it off.so i filed a greviance and cost that fat bitch thousands.
B002ZTK946|5|Easy install of OE part. Just have to drill the odd rivet out that holds the old unit in and replace it with a bolt.
B000TK8NN2|5|Abig help to installing the horn
B005XQ9S40|1|Says it fits a Yamaha XJ700X, but it doesn't.  The float seat on a XJ700X is a press fit held in with a retainer and screw.  It is not screwed in which is what is in this kit.  I'll be returning it.
B000GU5IH4|3|Thin ... Tore very easily. I've had it almost a year now, and it is still covering my bike, even though there are tears around the base.
B00FYO8UL8|1|This product doesn't work, don't waste your time.
B001NFVZA0|5|This sponge works like a charm.  It really soaks up the water in a hurry.  I can dry out my kayak in a very short time.
B000JFHNG0|4|Used this in tandem with a vacuum pump to vacuum out and recharge my Impreza's AC system. Worked great!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the middle (yellow) line does not have a release valve towards where the gauges sit.  The reason you want this, is because once you get done vacuuming out your AC system, and then you hook up the yellow line to a can of R134a to begin recharging the system, you want to fill the line with R134a first, then press a release valve on the end (towards the gauges) to let out any air in the line before you open the low side to let it go into your system... You don't want to let moist air into a system you just got done vacuuming... So I would absolutely call that a design flaw.  Now the only saving grace I would say is that I'm sure you can buy a release valve of some sort separately and hook it up to the middle line.  Other than that, for the price the gauges worked great, the quick connect is awesome and worked great, no leaks, gauges are pretty solid/sturdy and are easy to read.
B00E5UD95O|5|To small had to return it.
B007XXA5HA|1|The switches were not 12v dc, they were 125c ac switches. No wiring diagram... therefore unusable for my project.
B003UZ7SCU|4|fits and looks good
B000OCBO1S|5|Works well it wiggles a bit I put rubber washers on it to stop the the rattle noise problem solved .
B0025272PW|4|can anybody tell me would this filter work for a 2014 Passat TDI SE everytime i search this filter comes up but i want to get the right one seems to be the best one out there
B001UOZ190|5|great
B008VMJK6Y|4|Seems to take off the accumulated grease/food particles. May have to use it a few times to get all the gunk off.
B00JVW78WQ|5|It is exactly as expected and fit perfectly.
B00GD8OL62|1|Does not fit my 07 zx10r the notches are not the same going to modify it cuz I'm not waiting for a return then wait for right one
B000KQ4J1U|3|Have always loved WeatherTech products.  This one does fit the front windows as tightly as they should.  I tried to contact WeatherTech but they haven't replied EVER.  I recommend that you add doublesided tape to the front deflectors or they might fly off when the windows are open at driving speed.
B0068G2AA8|5|perfect
B0000AY9W6|5|Good product.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Lightweight.  An essential part of your camping supplies.
B00NWQA7HA|5|Great afro-pride item. The only people who think this symbol is racist are the racists themselves.
B00K889FCI|5|I was skeptical about this product since it's a fraction of the cost of getting your headlights restored at an auto repair shop. I was pleasantly surprised with the results, though! My headlights were so cloudy, I could barely drive at night. It took 10 minutes to do this and I would say my headlights are about 90% clearer. They aren't perfect, but for $10, the results were way more than I expected. Highly recommend this!
B00S3153ZU|5|Nice and handy tool! It also fits window hinges and hood hinges
B000UKHHQ0|3|Lever works great, but is constantly in need of tightening. That was the problem with my stock lever. I have tried loctite to no avail. Maybe a longer bolt with a nylon lock nut? I do like the bend of the lever but shifting is precise when lever is tight, much less so when the lever loosens after a short time...
B00BOFETFC|5|Easy install. Work and look great
B004AQZUX2|4|Work great on my Saab 93.  Can't beat the price.
B00EJYAWS8|5|I love these! Very well made.
B00V4049K2|5|Excellent
B000688VNE|5|Haven't had to use it yet but the quality is great and has come recommend by all of my off road friends
B00RBKREB0|5|Awesome! Heavy duty and the easy to apply.
B006LO118O|5|Fine.
B005FKSRAK|5|I am very pleased with the product! What a great deal for doing your own complete brake job on all four. The pads, rotors, and metal clips were perfect fits for my 2004 Monte Carlo LS. The rubber boots that the caliper bolts go through only fit for the front set, but I was able to reuse the ones in the rear. No noise after install and the car stops nice and smooth after breaking in.  A few things to note: - The rear pads were shipped with the front rotors and vice versa. I found this a little confusing. (Amazon's fault) - The metal hardware for the front pads were inside the box with the rear pads and vice versa. (Power Stop's fault). I'm curious if this would still happen if you only ordered pads and rotors for one axle. Either way if you order the whole set you'll have everything  *****10,000 Mile Update (Pictures attached)****** Pad material hasn't gone down much at all and I checked rotors on both sides for any signs of cracks forming. So far so good, still stops very smooth. They have been through a few good hard slam stops too. Pictures attached are from the 10K check I performed.
B0002Z9KH2|1|Will not work without additional parts.  It looks like the design was changed so you will be required to purchase an adapter.  The opening is in fact two inches high but will not fit the two inch hitch bar that our own because the opening is only about 1  1/2 inches wide.  The advertizement specifies that there must be 1 1/2 inch clearance to attach the mount to the 2 inch hitch bar that hold the ball mount, therefore it has to clamp to the hitch bare to work.  It will not.  I was very disappointed and returned the bike rack.  I do not appreciate bait and switch tactics
B00O74SZG6|5|fits great on my friend toyota levin.
B007ED9JFS|5|very fun!
B001DLTL6O|5|This is a great piece I purchased for my husband and he was very pleased.
B003YJJHI0|4|Tried a cheaper model that leaked everywhere. This one is easy to tighten and doesn't leak.
B004OFNJZ0|5|These really help to keep my car cooler
B00JIIZCM6|5|Works very nicely.
B000PL0E7S|5|What's to say, they're spark plugs and after replacing the worn well over due plugs with these, the difference was very noticeable.
B008GVE1G4|5|Nice. Great for my van.
B0027M3A1U|3|somehow effective. thetford is much better.
B001MUSRVG|2|after 20-30 uses its sticking making them hard to use
B004AQUCK8|5|as advertised
B002VOQ0JI|3|We have only used this once and it worked as advertised. I am disappointed at the false &#34;picture&#34; though. This clearly shows a metal clip, while the actual clip is plastic. It seems as though it is durable enough but when I buy something, I consider all the features. The clip opening wasn't large enough to accommodate the front  &#34;receptacle&#34; and we had to anchor the jet ski's from the rear. They are less stable when anchored that way and moved more than I would have preferred. I now have attached large carabineers to the clip and it seems to be a great solution. So, for the money, these work great. I would have given it four stars if the product was the same as pictured.
B00K56K1W6|5|love it
B00DFT2HI6|1|Finally got my key cut after it being in a drawer for a couple weeks. I was trying to open the rear seat and had some issues with the key sticking in there (which is a bad cut not a bad key I know). When I was pulling the key out I ended up pulling the plastic piece off the metal part.<br /><br />Let me explain this a little better. This key is made with the plastic piece and metal piece seperately and then they place the metal part into a groove which gets &#34;capped&#34; by another plastic piece.<br /><br />I don't need a key that I need to be gentle with when I have 11 year old lock cylinders on a bike.
B001GJ3FIS|1|I have purchased six of these in total.  After less than six months, I am down to one that works.  Two from the outset leaked more from the side than out of the pattern of spray I chose.  The others were leaking in less than one month's time.  Even at such a low price, what a waste of time and money.
B005WKJEZ0|5|The entire wiring was done in under 60 seconds. Awesome.
B0010XP880|1|The bottled version of this product is great, but the wipes leave lint all over my windows. Kind of a deal breaker.
B00DQJB7EK|5|Arrived in a timely manor. Went right on my boyfriends truck and has worked perfectly ever since. He wanted the Discrete and hidden look and this antenna is doing just that.
B00S9OM0GQ|5|Love it
B008GMR4ZI|5|Just what I expected! Thank you.
B00OTFR7PI|5|Fit to my fiesta exelent great produc totaly recomented
B003YLH9P6|5|Cool Air! My Caravan now blows ice cold air and I didn't have to pay a million dollars for someone else to fix it. Took my husband about two hours from start to finish to install. The problem we had was the fan would only blow at one speed and then finally stopped working at all. This and the fan were all it took.
B00IS7B0XI|5|AAAAAAA +++++
B00IWO4K8O|5|Works perfectly. More than enough room added to seat belt.
B000AME4VE|5|Good trash bag.
B00X09K0A8|1|Sorry to say, but these lights advertised as CK compatible, simply do not work in my 2012 Nissan Frontier. Once installed correctly polarity wise, the entire assembly lights up EITHER with the parking lights on OR with the brake peddle depressed. With the lights on, pressing the brake peddle makes no change in the brightness.
B001O7PNW8|5|Doesn't exactly remove scratches, but any swirls will be gone in minutes. Works great with a power tool to apply.
B000BZEIC0|5|Excellent price and premium 02 sensor..
B000C1SK4K|5|ok
B00G9ARJMC|5|Perfect fit my CR-V
B000C3DDKO|5|Worked very well except that I needed another section of hose for my 2008 Toyota Highlander.
B0072L6WQ6|5|The item was delivered in 2 days and it was as I expected as a complete kit. It fits perfectly well in my 2010 RAV 4 with no other parts needed.
B0057CD6AM|1|Not as Brite as I though they would be and took them a month before they were delivered
B00DETNG3M|4|very stiff then stock. work well. but little hard to put in. need press
B00IRJ0FMO|5|We have a high tractor and got this for the back of our pickup truck.  We tied it down and used it to fill our tractor.  It worked as they said it would, was easy to worked and I love it.
B001LTZ860|4|What a great product! Fast shipping is always a plus thank you. Will continue to buy more as needed.
B008YMTCNC|5|Mount goes on in about 2 minutes. Works great with my 14' kayak and also for ladder, etc. Will probably drill an extra hole to enable it to become narrower, but other than that, works great.
B000C2QLZY|4|a lot of o ring. more than enough for the job. but the thickness seem to smaller then my factory. I still change it to this green on. still holding pressure. for 2 mouth now.
B00BQVF1ZG|5|Great product, as advertised
B00D9C2CDO|5|Drove from SC to VA... pouring rain and luggage still stayed dry...excellent product!
B005FI51EM|1|Brings fell out so fast!  Don't recommend because its not made well.
B00SK6CK4U|5|Awesome product easy installation will do buisness again
B00FMOJZCI|5|AS ADVERTISED AND FAST SHIPPING
B0049GI418|5|Restored my 2004 RAV4's headlights to clear from yellow with very little effort. Lasts a good amount of time before needing a reapplication too.
B00029XFHY|5|FIT AWESOME AND NOW I CAN GO THROUGH THOSE FANCY NEW CAR WASHES
B0094FYV6G|1|These were black when I put them on and but within three months the black coloring came off and these are now a brass looking metal color.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This bag is large, easy to zip, and holds plenty. It fits perfectly on our roof rack and was secure. The fabric appears to be thick and durable. We use it for camping trips to store our bags and bedding when the SUV is too full. I cant think of anything wrong with it.
B003UT3S6Q|5|I bought a bottle of this after reading reviews. I was looking for something that would remove the caked on brake dust from my rims and this thing cut through it like butter! I picked up a second bottle to add to my car wash supply!
B00QRQHTUK|5|Useful Utility for Long distance Travellers
B000E4KIVS|5|I got the proper item within a few days and was able to install it same day!
B000BQR100|4|Fits my Vw beetle front window. The panels overlap but they are easy to adjust and make significant difference in Texas summer heat
B0079GPYA4|5|It was great the tool work find. And shipping was right on time
B000CO9QBI|2|Do not buy this unless you buy it together with the Strut Mount from KyB. It will not with the OEM mount, I had to modify the bump stop to make it work. After the modification it did work but it was a hassle and took me more time than it shouldve.
B0009OR8V6|5|great tool
B002QGVW3K|3|way smaller than I thought but worked perfect.
B00W2XEFU4|4|Standard economy type quality.<br />You get what you pay for.<br />Not bad, by no means a high highest quality. Worth the price.
B007NK2L66|3|It would be great if in fact they did actually fit our car as they reassured us it would.
B00MRCK23E|1|burn out fast and flicker
B0002MABGE|4|Not bad, our dog figured out a way to shift it and squees via the side. I had to fortify it with electric insulation tape to prevent that.<br />Installation and removal is a bit hassly, but still good for the price.<br />Finally, we decided to allow our dogs to be in the sitting area - we bought vinyl covers and removed the barrier. Now it is taking place in the garage.
B003MZY5VA|5|The original oem foe my helmet<br />So happy
B0031I20JC|3|Somewhat tight on my 2000 ZX9-R and doesn't quite wrap around the entire back tire, but it serves its purpose.
B00Y75QZD0|5|love how it has 3 hookups one for my phone charger and 1 for dvd player
B00RK6I81A|5|Fits perfect in my Benz 2014 c250
B008032Q42|5|Great product. Fit my 2011 Yaris Hatchback RS model perfect. Easy installation, exact fit like original
B00CSZSFZC|5|Sounds GREAT.
B000IOJKFE|3|Relatively easy to install and worked fine. However after a few weeks the butterflies and vacuum system started to have an issues and would stick open when accelerating and the hose began to split where it connection to the nipple on the hypercharer
B007KOT8WU|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B000LOLWZW|5|Great quality hook. I returned as it was not right for my application.
B00AZPP0Y6|5|Easy to install and to adjust the beam. I install them on my stock bumper. Just make sure your bumper is big enough mine was tight fit. I ran it to a toggle switch, inside the cab, and back out to the battery with a in line amp. There bright as well Recommend.
B003XVCT4I|5|Fit my '14 2500 perfectly, harness plugs into the taillight bulb socket. You use the factory reverse socket and bulb.
B00E3IE5U6|3|No wiring diagram no product info
B006E0A7YO|5|The Most difficult part of this fix in my Buick Lesabre, was getting the locking ring off to remove the old pump.  Once that was done, then it was just follow the instructions to replace the old square connector with the included connector, and slide the new pump back into the tank and get that darn locking ring back into place.<br /><br />Pump is working well so far, if there are any issues with longevity with the pump I will update this post accordingly.
B00TYZL0VU|5|Fits as expected
B003CEJXGI|5|Fit great. looks just like to original
B004HCOE8Q|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B00KTJ5K3O|3|It's ok.  Had to use the old guts from my original FOB. Contact points are too small and do no make contact with all points on the motherboard. Swapped out rubber buttons and works great.
B00CWXN6V8|5|Kcco perfect
B004EK94P4|5|Great stickers for car. Good delivery time.good price.
B00CHSXE38|5|When the dealer wanted an insane amount of cash to install these, I looked at other options and found these on Amazon. Here are my thoughts:<br />INSTALL:<br />- The hardest aspect was removing the seal on the back windows. I was not able to do this with my bare hands;<br />- Clips are easy to install;<br />- 3M tape takes a little bit of work to get lined up just right; and<br />- Overall, install took about 30 mins for me and looks great.<br />STYLING:<br />- These look really sharp; and<br />- The color matches the color of the sunroof deflector. Together they look even better.<br />PRACTICALITY:<br />- First, you can crack your windows and leave your car without fear of the outside elements getting in. This leaves your car fresher and cooler in the summer heat;<br />- Second, it reduces the air noise when you have your windows down. I noticed that I could hear the radio and have a decent conversation even with the windows down; and<br />- Third; it provides some nice shade/tinting in the summer heat.
B007ED84XG|5|This is so adorable! Excellent quality, love how it comes with snaps and a strap to hold it together.
B002ES52X6|5|Very functional. Big savings compared to buying a new fob. It does wear out eventually.
B00C4TT2ZY|5|They fit perfectly and they don't make your hands sweaty.....love it
B00G8WLT7C|5|Well made and heavy duty. I run my GPS and phone charger with this splitter in my van. I had one before of a different brand but it was flimsy next to this one.
B00Y5G5XEI|5|koool
B000CPAELI|4|Nice chinese made 8&#34; drop ball mount, this Reese mount is a much better fit for my 2X2 receiver than the Curt ball mount I had before which was a very sloppy fit.
B00B79XIQ6|5|cute
B000CHIK8U|5|Exact fit!
B004GAWMCY|5|Already in my jeep
B00IZNHLNI|5|Very pleased with product and installation was easy with a &#34;rent-a-tool&#34; from the local parts store. FOLLOW THE INCLUDED DIRECTIONS AND USE THE CORRECT TORSION KEY UNLOADING TOOL. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY!!!
B00651CLCS|5|Buy It.  If you off-road and still have your sock antenna.  You are WRONG!
B00EYNF0WW|2|It was smaller than expected.
B007JSGR9Y|5|I bought this one after I bought the MS300, it reads a lot more codes on my 2014 Ram 3500. Wish I would of bought this one first instead of wasting money on the MS300
B007VUXP1S|5|Works perfectly with our master built rack to transport our bikes on our Dodge Durango. Super easy installation and quality product!
B000CPA8B4|5|We used it to paint my husbands entire extended cab 93 Chevy k2500 pickup we used 2 gallons and had enough to do the entire outside of the truck and about half the inside of the bed. Probably need one more can to do a good full two coats and have a bit extra for touch ups.  Overall very easy to roll on and sponge on. Took about a day to do and only sanded down the rust spots.
B008D8X6XO|5|great tool and service
B00Q3480R2|4|I like...but still smell...like rubber
B005VG6CGO|1|I got these for Christmas from someone who bought these off of amazon and they are awful. The spokes that are suppose to be threaded for bolts are junky and plastic and not threaded. I received them with broken clips that hold that lights in place. I just got done stopping on the side of the highway due to them falling out while driving. Do not buy these they are terrible
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sunshade worksw very well and is easy to put in place.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CFALFXY|5|Great microfiber cleaning cloths, especially for windows. Thank you.
B00PVEUHU8|5|Like this set
B00K9BD4IK|2|The stickers looked good at first but they cracked and flaked off during the winter.<br /><br />I would only recommend these if you live in a warm temperate climate.
B00U0J3COW|5|Works great, put them on all my off road vehicles
B004JHBKLS|5|Fits perfectly for a 2012 Prius II. Bought it with prime shipping and fits perfectly. Replace it every 15k miles, even though the guide recommends 30k intervals.
B00IO8J5BA|2|It lasted a whole 16 months.  It worked very well for that length of time, but after a very hot day the DOUBLE STICK TAPE that holds the shade on the rod gave way!!!!  Duh!!!!!!  I have 2 perfectly good pieces that I can't repair.  Disappointed.
B001DRHMMS|5|If fits and works at a good price savings.
B001IH8Q0K|5|as expected
B006OQ35GU|5|Very nice hose attachment,<br />works as described, make for east mounting on the RV.<br /><br />Would buy again.
B007P4V7A6|5|These are nice. I would buy in future and also recommend to friends and families if required.
B00029WYVW|5|Works great with my K&N filters.  K&N filters are worth the investment.
B007RVNLME|5|I have no clue why they give you a small phillips screw driver... completely unnecessary, there isn't a screw involved anywhere in your key fob.<br />I only bought this for the rubber insert. I wanted to keep my OEM shell with all the necessary identifying #s on the back.<br /><br />Works great.<br /><br />On a side note, if you're at the point where you need to replace the shell of your key fob, you should do yourself a favor and remove the black rubber build up that's on the circuit board under the buttons. I was having an annoying issue with having to hit the buttons multiple times to get it to lock/unlock, once I removed all the build up with some hand sanitizer, everything works great again.
B006HYKTU4|5|Excellent service. I received different model's LED bulbs and I informed them and they sent me the correct LED bulbs, they are good in service and new LED bulbs working fine!!! I will recommend to friends.
B00NQ198LC|5|the locks worked great, easy to install and a reasonable price.
B00U6QFQAM|5|Works well for the back bolts, but you still need the regular bolts on the front top of the jeep top
B006Z907TY|5|Was able to use on commercial flights fine - American with no issues, Carrying bag is nice to have it easy place away for later use.
B00WH1ZC80|5|I tried different hooks before, they worked but were hard to get the items off. These are FANTASTIC, very heavy duty, items are easily removed, I hung a qt. of milk from one, worked great.  My husband thought I was nuts for buying different hooks, he said the ones we have are OK, until he tried these, He said I DID REAL GOOD. Thanks
B0009OMY9M|5|Works as described. I wish the cup was bigger So i didnt have to empty it out every other corner
B0007N5758|5|Nice. Bristles are not to soft or hard, just right.
B00471UF80|5|Great, very secure, it cannot be easily steele.
B000JZUUME|5|Perfect!  I ordered 2 of these for my 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer, extended.  They fit great.  They are a bit hard to get installed if you are doing it yourself, but definitely possible by holding the door open with your head (I'm 6'6&#34; so it worked), and then installing the arms.  They are working great so far, will update if they give out early.
B007US9V64|5|Very happy with everything. This fit perfectly on my 1999 Silverado new body style truck. Now my mirrors work like they should. This part goes to the 1999 Silverado C1500  new body style. That part finder thing on this site needs worked on. If you need a mirror switch and you drive  this model of the silverado then this is the part to buy. This should fit all that has this style switch.
B004IV58AY|4|You need to look up the codes on the internet.  Works fine though.
B000786JRI|5|Great investment..... My husband loves this for traveling and when he works outside on hot days.  Perfect size to fit in the floor board or in the middle of the back seat
B009E9K70Q|5|Simple and easy and the remote start WORKSSSS
B000221H08|5|Pretty great stuff. I've been using it to re-treat a custom couch cover made of Sunbrella fabric.<br /><br />My kitty likes to relieve herself on the couch, you see. Not a pleasant topic, but I needed a practical solution for her &#34;accidents,&#34; and plastic covers or tarps are a decorating faux pas. Waterproof fabric is much easier on the eyes and the tush.<br /><br />Some words of caution, though, especially for those thinking about using this for animal messes....<br /><br />1) It takes a lot of the fabric guard to saturate fabric, especially thicker Sunbrella fabrics. For my couch cover, I use at least the 32 oz spray bottle per treatment.<br />2) This is not 100% waterproof. Liquids will bead up on the fabric, but they may eventually soak in if left too long.<br />3) This will block water, but it will not block smell. The strong cat urine odor still gets through to the couch, requiring deodorization after kitty's &#34;accidents.&#34;<br />4) Only the top of the fabric is waterproof. Damage to the fabric could expose untreated threads, which can wick in liquids. For example, kitty also likes to sharpen her claws on the couch cover, making less-than-waterproof holes.<br />5) This fabric guard is pretty expensive, as is Sunbrella fabric.  And kitty has a lot of &#34;accidents.&#34; It may be a better investment to get treatment for her than get more treatment for the couch cover.
B0051D3MP6|4|seems to work okay
B00SUS1RN8|1|Only one switch came in the mail. One switch for $10 isnt too great...
B00DYSDHFA|5|These are probably the best wiper blades that I have ever used. These don't have the issues with drag/friction that all the Bosch wipers seem to have, and these have lasted me longer than any other wiper blade I have ever used! I only have to change these once a year or so, which makes them a great value too.
B0033YLXUQ|4|This is a cute, silly little gift item for a Mercedes owner.
B00NIRQ0CO|5|Fit my truck exactly.<br />Love the design and fit....<br />Highly recommend
B00O0LWRVK|1|Both larger rings not working
B00I0T0WJ2|5|This stuff looks great. They give you just enough material, so you need to be careful putting it on. There is a couple youtube videos, I suggest you watch them. It takes awhile and is tough to do but the end result is really nice.
B002HXU2HY|4|Nice, but no installation directions.
B00EK5DOPO|1|Warning not DOT approved!  Will not pass state inspection !!!
B000X1YUZC|5|Great quality at a great price!
B00OVL957I|5|article in pefect condition
B008CE070E|5|as described
B000JZY4KI|2|Missing dust shield.  Make sure yours is reusable before ordering.
B00LT41ZR8|5|Great! Love this! Sounds like a real turbo with whines and stuff like that! Came earlier than expected!
B00CG5RYEW|5|Cool
B003CJW9QE|3|Nice Hugger, but does not really look like Carbon Fiber.
B000AO7GPS|4|I really like my bike seat cover...it has enabled me NOT to have to wear the bike shorts with the gel in the &#34;seat&#34; area! LOL! I would have given it five stars, but it wasn't quite as thick as I thought it would be. It IS really comfortable and fits really well on my bike seat!
B00LG07MZE|5|I had a similar product that came as a 2-piece set. Bought 2 of these for our cars and so far so good. It is a little hard to install/take down because of its size, but it is a lot easier to store and doesn't fall down like the 2-piece version. My wife for some reason has a hard time folding it up, but once you do a few times it basically folds itself. Bought 2 of the same size- 1 for a 2011 Sonata and 1 for a 2015 Tucson— both fit perfectly.
B0009JKI86|5|works great !
B0038AWD2W|5|I've had this lights for about six years and they still look the same as when I bought them. They used to fog up after a summer rain but i drilled a small hole in the bottom on the back and that allowed condensation to drip out of the hole.
B004QM7OTI|5|Needed a helmet for AutoX, and didn't want to spend a fortune since I'm still a beginner.  Wasn't sure what to expect for the price, but was pleasantly surprised.  Fits very well on my medium sized head (I would recommend ordering a size up from what you think your head size is, or you could measure and compare to the sizing charts).<br />Very comfortable and relatively light for its price range.<br />My one gripe is that it blocks too much sound, so it is hard to hear with it on.<br />While it may not be for pro racers, it is a great starter helmet for newbs, and meets the Snell 2010 requirements for SCCA.
B000P72HG8|5|this stuff is great i used in my new trunk and it worked great,
B0028QVNGO|5|Very good fit
B00GOW6VAQ|5|So far so good
B0041DXCAC|3|noisy
B002SSKFGG|5|Too easy.  Replaced a suburban dsi (gas only) wh in my 2004 truck camper.  Hooking up the electric option was easy.  Unit has a switch on outside so no need to rewire a new &#34;gas and electric&#34; switch.  Took 3 hrs to pull old unit and put this in.  Required $30 worth of wire and connectors from local hwrdware store which made install a snap.  At first i hooked up the ac power to the dc fusebox, so I had to go back and rewire.  Wired direct to 110ac outlet under sink on a 20 amp fuse.  Used yellow gas tape on propane and water connections with no leaks first time.  Had to figure the wiring with unit halfway installed as no room was available to connect wires once unit was in place.  Filled w water and fired the wlectric right up.  No problem.  Gas fired up 1st time on 2 or third click.  If you are halfway handy, dont hesitate this diy project.  Local rv shop wanted 938 bucks and 2 weeks to do what I did in 1 week (fairbanks alaska) for $320.  Bought an open box on amazon prime.  Awesome deal.  Too easy!!!
B003LF30HQ|5|Beautiful !!
B012X49ENY|5|This is one of the best car accessories I own. It keeps things within reach without me having to reach behind my seat in the seat back pockets, or for items I may have put in my purse on the passenger seat. I spend a lot of time in my car driving from place to place, so this is a huge convenience. I can easily store my tablet, sunglasses, extra money, phone charger, pens, tissues, and other stuff I like to keep in my car.<br /><br />I used to keep things in the center console, but it became a disorganized mess. This helps me to stay organized without having to rifle through my center console or glove box.<br /><br />This goes in the gap between the driver and passenger seat, which is really unique. It's not in anyone's way no matter how many people I have in the car! It doesn't impede on space like having extra bags on the floor might, and it makes it easy for other to see where things are, in case someone in my family needs to grab the phone charger or power bank. You can even fit a medium size handbag, which is great for when I have someone in the passenger seat.
B004AIYO0U|5|Personally installed these on my 05 Sentra. I am by no means a mechanic and these were not hard to install. Just look up some youtube videos and you should be fine! Great product!
B000CAZ5ZI|5|In order to replace the old PCV-Valve, I had to let the car cool down, before taking the PCV off the hose. Hopefully the car will use up less motor oil now. Be careful not to burn your finger.
B00N4IDPZM|5|I've been moving logs on my property with an old Jeep.  The strap worked quite well.  I even moved a thirty square foot concrete slab.  A must have strap for the farm or your vehicle.
B00AW17SNO|5|I used these to repair a broken battery cable on a Waverunner and they worked fine.
B000COWA8E|1|Piece of junk worked 20 minutes and quit had to put original back in
B00H4RMUP0|5|oem great buy
B00IO8IP3Y|5|Item was delivered earlier than expected and is just what I needed for my 2010 Honda CRV
B000WEOQD6|4|So far, I'm liking it. It's not the best quality. And since it's really hot out, the plastic part does seem super bendy and I'm hoping it doesn't actually melt. I did however notice the stitching on the plastic part seems to be loose. Some of them are poking up. I don't know if it was like that when I got it, or if it's due to me having to break like 8 nails trying to get the thing on, but it's there. Did I mention... IT'S REALLY ANNOYING TO GET ON? It's supposed to be that way, people. You don't want a slippery steering wheel. But yeah it is annoying to get on. Read the directions on the paper, you kind of have to slide it on from the top down towards the bottom. It's like anal sex, start slow and let it stretch, but it'll get there. ;) Plus side, it does look nice. It's a nice reddish woodgrain color (as opposed to the orangey woodgrain, which I hate). My steering wheel is leather and I actually prefer the feel of my leather steering wheel, but the black part on this isn't too bad.
B00QE5AQLI|2|I cannot recommend this product.  When it arrived, it was nearly fully charged.  I immediately tested it on my car and it did start the car twice.  I then connected it to the included AC charger overnight to ensure a complete charge.  Within a week, I needed to use this to jump my car.  Unfortunately, it did not start my car (6cyl 2.7L so well within the specified 3.0L limitations) and I was left stranded until I was able to find someone to give me a conventional jump start.<br /><br />I have since recharged the battery overnight and attempted to jump start my car (in the safety of my own driveway).  Unfortunately, I have never again gotten the car started with this battery pack.<br /><br />I am returning this to Amazon and will be purchasing a different brand.
B00AETUVM4|5|These jumper cables are great, I drive a stick shift so I personally have no need for them but when someone else is stopped on the side of the road I'm able to help them out with my questionable jumper cables skills. (Atleast I do know not to connect negative to negative... right?)<br /><br />In-fact these jumper cables actually got me a date... a horrible date... but a date none the less. Let me explain.<br />We were having a storm down here in California, and this young lady had went into the store and left her headlights on. I came out of the store and I was driving away when I saw her crying because she can't get her car started. I had her turn the key and I heard a ticking noise. So I had her pop the hood, and I pulled these bad boys out and she said &#34;Woah that's huge&#34; and my natural response was &#34;Yeah, I always carry around the big stuff&#34; not realizing how bad it sounded. She laughed, and I continued jumping her car. Couple seconds later and boom, her car is started! She thanked me and we talked a little bit and she tried to give me $5 for my time, and I said &#34;How about you give me your number instead?&#34; she agreed, gave me her number. I started talking to her and we agreed on a date. I went to her place to pick her up, and surprise, she gave me a fake number.... but I already paid for the movie tickets...
B00RW1MEWW|4|Fabric appears to be strong enough to last a while. Larger than expected. Covers my V-Strom 650 with room to spare, even over my large windscreen and rear luggage. Wish they would have included a nylon bag to store it back into. The bag it came is useless, hence knocking off one star.
B00KW4KJK0|5|Took a while to get on hand, but it was being mailed from Asia. Material is nice feeling and if sticks strong. Colors aren't super sharp, but they are crisp enough and very attractive.
B00D1Z6IAW|5|Great product, perfect for our needs, exactly as shown in images.
B00VMS0TH8|5|makes wiring your a breeze!  Literally a 15min job or less.
B000BXKYYI|5|Everything I expected
B00R5XFKH8|5|This is a great product..perfect for our california heat. Very well made.
B00FDQPCR2|4|good work well. only wish it have a dim mode. so it can stay on. just my preference
B00KSDKWZ2|5|Great product. Bought it so my dogs wouldn't scratch up the center console. Great fit. Own Dodge Ram 1500 2009. Thought it was cool that they hand wrote me a note saying thanks for your business with my name on it. Rare you get that. Highly recommend.
B00AWGK7SW|5|It's great
B009DJYV2W|5|Exelet
B0038B7GS2|5|Good
B004GCFOAE|5|Exelent
B00HS871FY|5|fit perfect, look good and are fully adjustable !!! bought to replace the oem mirrors on my galpals honda rebel....her hands are so small that when I adjusted the controls to fit her the oem mirrors would not adjust &#34;up&#34; enough to be usable. stick a set of 1 inch convex mirrors in the outside upper corners ! makes a big difference in the view......
B000CRO4IK|5|Hate having loose change in your cupholder? This is the answer. My girlfriend complained about the loose change in her car's cupholders so I picked this up for her. She absolutely loves it. Worried that it will take up a cupholder slot in your car? If you're like my girlfriend and I who never use your cupholder in your car door then that is a perfect spot for this thing. I really can't knock it for any reason.
B003BL1H0M|5|Easy hook-up. Took about 20 min. Didn't tie in the reverse light yet.<br />Only thing I must say bad is the people won't stop asking me where I got them.....
B00HNKYD0I|4|Not bad. No adhesive on product. But works well for the price. On a hot day it may come off but I'm pleased.
B00DF8C25U|5|Unbelievable quality and simplicity for such a serious problem. I could not believe that all my speedo/ odometer issues were caused by this one small gear.  It was incredibly easy to replace.  Highly recommend if you are experiencing any erratic speedometer issues or if your odometer just does not work. just make sure you apply a lubricant as well, otherwise it can be a little noisy.
B000A3DUTA|5|Love it love it love it.. this is probably one of the best steering wheel covers I've gotten so far and I will probably continue getting this steering wheel cover. It really bulks up your stock steering wheel and really gives your car a premium feel to it.
B000IZ2AVE|4|Rated four only cause of packaging, they were not hurt and work great. Good price
B00681BDXI|5|Working perfect
B0041U7IO6|5|Just like OEM. Easy to install. Saved time and money.
B00RW4JRG0|5|Great price and exactly what was advertised.  Worked extremely well.  Just follow directions that are included and they're perfect.  Highly recommend product and seller.
B003BG4PUQ|4|Nice  Acura fob. I recommend, and I hope this helps.
B00318NUUA|1|&#34;Long life lamps&#34; my ass! We've gone through three of these 2-packs in about a year. Several of these bulbs literally fell apart over time, as in the metal must have not been properly glued to the glass, and at least one bulb burned out. Good thing they are cheap. My advice: if you're buying these, buy a spare pack. Based on our experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
B00KY6WU8U|5|Very well made awesome!
B00C5CN0CG|5|Paired instantly with all the devices I use it with.  Very portable and actually exceeded specs on distance.  Has great volume and midrange response.
B008E7PP38|5|Perfect fit for 2005 Ford Explorer XLT. At the price I replaced both sides.
B004LX3AXQ|5|the charger is a lot better than the old ones I really like it
B0041PYGGO|3|everything was good but I didn't realize it was made in China.  I would have preferred American made.  I should have looked closer
B001Y91MFI|5|These fit perfectly and look very similar to the real ones except no toyota emblem. To be honest, I never even noticed the toyota emblem on the original hubcaps in the first place. They aren't heavy like the originals, but have stayed on while driving up to 80mph on the freeway. I'm happy with them and more happier that I'm not driving around with 3 hubcaps anymore!
B009YYVSZO|4|item as described  not used yet.
B001OK8NFO|4|item as described  not used yet.
B0064VJHAS|2|The smaller set doesn't fit well. The tape is too deep so it doesn't stick to the surface and keeps falling off. The adhesive should be thicker so it goes on firmly.
B00OZYHOE2|4|Love it works great.
B00PCEG7A6|1|Did not work on my 2015 F150 because of the safety function built into my one push up/down windows.  Fit to tight and windows sensor kept putting window back down.  Always had good luck with AVS products, but this time was a let down.
B00GBQ740Q|4|Fits perfect. Quick delivery.
B00G52H7YE|5|Excellent! As can be expected from Toyota.<br />[[ASIN:B00G52H7YE Genuine Toyota 19037-62010 Spark Plug Cord Set]]<br />Amazingly, the fasteners, (clips etc.) their positions they were installed at, every thing, was EXACTLY as if it were assembled for factory installation on the factory floor. Absolutely nothing needed to &#34;make it fit.&#34;<br />Rare to be able to say something was delightful to install.<br />For the money, I can't imagine even considering any aftermarket alternative?<br />Fast Shipping via Amazon-Prime-UPS.
B004MDEV38|5|I purchased this hitch for a 2001 Honda Odyssey, in preparation for a road trip where we needed to take 5 bicycles with us.  In the past, when we've taken these trips, I used a hatchback mounted bike harness to hold three of them, and put two of them in the van itself (taking out the two middle seats).  While this worked, it was extremely uncomfortable for all involved, but for ~1 hour road trips, we made it work.  This time around, we were driving further (~5 hours), we needed to do something different.  I decided to put them all in the back using a hitch and 5 bike harness (http://amzn.com/B00TRTT178), saving us the extra room in the car for people.  I installed the hitch myself in a 14 year old Honda, in my garage, without a lift, all by myself, in about 2 hours.  Some key points:  - Watch the instructions on youtube (there are many of them, but I found this one -- https://youtu.be/tzI9FeUx-e0 -- to be excellent).  - For an older car (like mine), the nuts in the car will be rusted.  A wire brush will not be enough (I tried).  A tap is the only thing that will work (I got mine from amazon - http://amzn.com/B000K1LZVM )   - It took me at least an hour, may be an hour and a half, to clean out all 4 nuts so the bolts will screw in, due to a combination of things:  -- I didn't have the right handle for the tap (by mistake, I ordered a 1/4&#34; handle rather than the 7/16 handle that's required, so I used a adjustable wrench, which made it harder). -- it was the first time I used a tap, was going slowly to make sure I did it right -- the nuts themselves being very rusty, took a while (and some serious elbow grease) to get the tap in there -- I didn't move the tail pipe out of the way, the space was tight but very workable (it's the original one, I was worried that it would fall off due to all the rust, I didn't want to put extra pressure on it) -- the first three were quite quick and easy (less than 10 minutes per), the last one didn't cooperate (of course, isn't thatalways the case!)  Once the screws fit easily into the nuts, mounting the hitch itself was very easy, something I did easily by myself.  The fish wire makes installing the 5th bolt trivial.  I hooked one side of the hitch over the tail pipe, put the screws in on the other side (lifting the hitch using my knee to hold it in place, then I screwed in the passenger side, then I tightened everything by hand.  I'll definitely get a hitch for the next car I buy -- but rather than paying a ton for the dealer to install it, I'll do it myself!
B00DBENZPO|4|Love it works great.
9099000332|3|Not as big as the stock vtec sticker. Still good quality.
B0012TNR0I|5|Like Bel-Ray products that all I use in my bikes
B000EVYGZA|5|This is better than expected. Excellent size. Has all the functionalities you need.
B00MMKE3RC|5|I love my keyless key chain.Quility!
B008UUPVBK|1|The rectifier failed after 3 months.
B00JB69438|5|This product works great! It was well made and perfect for adding a brighter light to the front of my truck. It was also easy to use to install the light
B00PDM8OSA|5|Works well in my jeep !
B0068QPCQW|5|TERRIFIC PRODUCT
B00KGID5YY|5|works better than factory at 1/4 the cost
B003VBSUT8|3|Should have bought an oem from dealership not a good fit but does stop up the hole in back of jeep
B004K2285E|5|I really like these because they are good and soft and can be used for different size wire bundles. I will use them again on future projects.
B005FKJ696|5|No problems installing, great kit and break in went well.
B00V9VC714|5|Fits Nissan Xterra 2005 and works well. Thanks.
B0002ILK2C|5|awesome service,would highly recommend.
B00L9GDMWW|4|Really good. Easy to install no problems
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Order arrived in 2 days thanks to Prime shipping.  Sunshade packed in small bag.  Pulled out, and opened.  I need this for my Chevrolet express full size van.  Ordered Jumbo size, as the windshield in this vehicle is huge.  At first, holding the shield up, and putting down the visors, I was disappointed that with the material being so thin, it just slid down to the base of windshield, and laid flat on dashboard.  After looking closer, realized that I could take that same thin material, and put into the tangs that hold the visors.  Once placed there, and visors pushed back into tangs, the shield covers about 95% of the windshield.  The reflective material really seems to work great, and after 2 hours in the hot sun, the interior is definitely much cooler.  I am very pleased, with the performance.  Was going to first purchase an accordion style shield, but realize that I would have to find something much taller than easily available.  This is the best option, and pricing was right.
B00080QHMM|1|Simply doesn't work.
B00CASDZKC|1|The strap does not fit around my front seat.
B004I1B5JC|5|A deer jumped out at us, took out windshield and the Passenger light fixture.  This was very easy to install and works great.
B00QXGM814|5|Worked great! Easy installation.
B004A6B9PK|4|Used the bracket in a 6.2 diesel -&#62; 5.7 swap.  Used existing pump from 6.2 to maintain hyrdroboost system.<br /><br />Product was packaged well and of good quality, though lacked any written direction/illustrations to assist with intended orientation for mounting.<br />Once mounted pump was sturdy and offered no vibration in use.<br /><br />Removed 1 star due to one of the fasteners having a few marred threads, and lack of any documentation.
B00540KPS8|5|Good cargo net for my 2014 Tacoma.
B003SRHNE8|1|Very cheaply made. It says it will fit a 2015 Kia Forte but it doesn't.... the covers are big for the seats, looks sloppy. Then putting it over the head rest it ripped without me even pulling hard on it. Piece of crap!
B011KHEHWS|5|Seems to clean granite counter tops very good. Hope it will wash up well.
B000E7YP7I|5|This has been great for storing stuff in my trunk and it doesn't move at all!
B0042C09OY|4|I'm not a mechanic so cant say if it is really working. My car and motorcycle are running fine, so it certainly did no harm.
B000BRF38Q|5|Prompt delivery and item is as described. Worked perfectly to install a lift system on my RV bed. This site has perfect instructions for many different types of bed lift situations http://www.hatchlift.com/bedlift-kits-installation.
B00DP5JLJS|5|Amazon you are amazing!!! Thank you!!!
B000BGM89Y|5|So far so good.  Prompt delivery and the quality seems good.  The plastic is heavy gauge and seems sturdy.
B00AKXCXXO|5|I tinted my side-view mirror signals with this and it has held up remarkably well. I also tinted my fog-lights, but due to the heat put out by those the tint has burned a bit, which is to be expected and is no fault of the product.<br /><br />Using a heat gun I was able to get a great fit with the tint. Note that there is a protective layer you peel to stick, and also a protective film over the top once you have it applied.
B001F212OK|4|pump works fine a little slow on release valve
B001RIDVVO|5|Good quality and looks good on my boat, with plenty of decals to do both sides of 2 boats
B009PJJFEO|5|It is the perfect fit for the 2005 Dodge Magnum
B00KGGJOQE|4|The product is as described, I have not yet mounted on the car, but I bought it for spare (back-up), because locally in my country had already purchased one of bad quality and I thought that i bought here is made in China
B0045V3PXO|5|good wipers
B00CGNZBR6|5|Works as designed.
B00PZ00OTW|3|It works.  It was cheap, easy to install, but sits pretty low.  I haven't owned any other hitches, so I can't really tell you if it's the best hitch ever, or an also-ran.  What I can tell you is that CURT insists (INSISTS) that you use a cargo strap when using a non-trailerd (read: bike carrier, ski carrier..) accessory.  Why would I buy a trailer hitch that required me to still strap something to my car?  Anyway - so far so good.
B004IM4MK0|5|Just like the pictures describes. Perfect fit and very original.
B00ABZ7IDQ|1|Wobbles bad!! Sent back, bought different brand.
B0002Z9QY4|5|Great wipers.
B00537FDCK|4|Fits my 2014 WRX. Was missing a nut in the packaging though. If fitting to a WRX, you are required to cut your rear bumper a bit.
B007M5QH6C|4|very informative
B00BUH0ZUM|4|Exact replacement.
B00J4TXE8I|5|Looks great, easy to install.
B00G4ATR54|5|We had a hard time deciding what bike rack to get and decided to try this one since the price was great and seemed to be comparable to some more expensive ones.  We received this on a Wednesday and left on a Thursday for a 4 hour ride.  This rack was great.  Once configured for the different bikes we had it was easy to use.  The construction is very sturdy.  We have used this almost every day for the last month and love it!
B001449ZHK|5|Delivered as described
B0002SRE8Q|5|Great value for a nice kit
B008JHF0HO|2|Bought this for my motor scooter, and it worked great for less than two months.  Then the battery died- and wouldn't even hold a charge.  I tried recharging it multiple times with no luck- it will hold enough power to start the scooter once, but that's about it.  I would not recommend the battery to anyone.
B000P6CJ9O|5|Wonderful product
B000X23ZWU|5|5 STARS !!!
B00GS7XS9O|5|This is well worth the money....some hard covers can cost $400 .....this is perfect!
B00469FOL6|5|I was another really skeptical person, but this really does great at being able to wipe off dirt without scratching the paint. As others said, you use a lot, so unless you want to just try it out, I recommend the gallon.
B0028G93VQ|4|pretty handy item if you own multiple size trailers.
B00K889FCI|5|After trying every &#34;trick&#34; we could find to clean our headlight, we ordered Wipe New Headlight Restore Kit.  It works like magic.  Fifteen minutes of work and voila, brand new headlight.  Highly recommended!
B00SH1SN6C|5|I haven't used this yet to jump a car, but everything else about it works well. Hoping I'll never have to use it...but glad I have it.
B000RU772C|5|Good
B001FGGJI0|5|Excellent fit and quality.  Reasonable price for good name.
B00BTGSIDU|5|Wow good stuff take the product off very well
B006O4IL1G|5|Works great for my 02 mustang gt, so I recommend it
B0031I3TLK|5|great
B00KFPDLZQ|1|Not as bright as factory bulb and not as bright as they claim
B00CIZZUTG|5|These are holding up well so far. They're affordable and appear well-made. Much better alsternative than the pricey OEM struts  -we'll see how these are doing a year from now...
B007I6RBYM|4|its genuine alright. simple change. save so much $$$
B00NLN88QG|4|Received product on time. Product heavier and  better than I expected. I have yet to install. & I will repost after installation. Probably should be 5 stars, have to see what they look like on my Jeep first..
B00BITKPPW|5|Fit my 05 F150 Perfectly.
B000WEPI4M|5|Exactly as shown.
B000WJJBI6|5|EXCELENT

B00GRS2Y0I|5|No complaints
B000CITK8S|5|Nice
B00523JHOK|3|Stitching came undone after 3rd use, retaining clip came off and was lost after 5th use, other than that they do a good job. make sure your wearing boots because the clips will smack your ankles if your wearing regular shoes.
B00SZZKU02|1|Its a 50 cc. Don't waste your time or money
B00165XM8U|5|it came just the way they said it would. it is very nice fit just like I wanted. I would buy another
B00QVGGK5Q|4|VERY VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT
B002SINBRQ|5|Nice to carry a heavy set of boosters in the trunk. I started a dead vehicle with no problem at all.

B002L7A370|5|ok
B003ZE32F8|5|Excellent product!  Heavy and well made.
B007JSGR9Y|5|This product is awesome! It is very simple to use and it does what they say it does. I have a 2008 Audi A4 Quatrro. About a week ago I saw the check engine light on and so I bought this product. It read the code and did the reset simply. I don't have the check engine light on any longer.
B000KL1JU4|3|Nice but fell apart pretty quickly
B00CGTVESK|5|Very nice steering wheel cover. No odor , great gray color, feel good to the hands. Happy...
B002FSF2J4|5|I have a 2006 Lincoln Navigator with 140k miles on it.  I am told that 2006 was the last year that Lincoln put air ride on all 4 corners of the Navigator and after that only put them on the back.  Over the winter I discovered that I needed to replace the compressor after it refused to run on a particularly cold day.  That led to the discovery that my truck had a slight leak at the seals on the front air struts.  The dealership wanted a ridiculous amount of money to replace the seals and I was concerned that a new compressor might overwhelm a set of 9 year old air struts so I opted to remove the air ride and convert to conventional.  I work for a company with a very large Ford Fleet so when looking for a solution I spoke to our mechanics who recommended going with Monroe.<br /><br />I was able to buy the front and back set of Monroe's Quick Struts for less than any of the well known &#34;conversion kits&#34; which are basically the same thing.<br /><br />It has been ridiculously hot in Texas lately so I decided to punt and hire a local shop to install them for me.  I paid them $250 to install the full set, front and back.  It took a mechanic with a lift and the right tools about 2 hours to do the job, maybe a little less.<br /><br />Just like I had read in many forums, my Navigator now sites 1.5-2 inches higher than it did with air struts.  Personally, I think it looks better sitting a little bit higher.  I recently drove a new Navigator and the height is pretty much the same as what mine is now.<br /><br />I have put about 2500 miles on the truck since installing these including 1500 miles of highway going to FL and back.  I asked my wife if she could tell a difference and she could not so I take that as a sign of success.<br /><br />I can not tell any difference in how my truck handles in traffic or on the highway but people are more likely to grab a handle to pull themselves in when they get in now.<br /><br />I have not addressed the &#34;Suspension Switched Off&#34; message on the dash yet as all of the instructions that I have found from the &#34;conversion&#34; companies involve cutting wires which I am completely against.<br /><br />I honestly think that this conversion just extended my ownership of this truck 3 years.<br /><br />The pictures are :<br />left/right before<br />left/right after<br />Alert you get on the dash after turning off the air suspension<br />close up of the back after<br />close up of the front after#34; message on the dash yet as all of the instructions that I have found from the &#34;conversion&#34; companies involve cutting wires which I am completely against.<br /><br />I honestly think that this conversion just extended my ownership of this truck 3 years.<br /><br />The pictures are :<br />left/right before<br />left/right after<br />Alert you get on the dash after turning off the air suspension<br />close up of the back after<br />close up of the front after
B003YKXTSI|1|Poor quality, the pop out knife became so loose in a week and it pops out without manually pulling it. This has already put a hole in my jeans pocket. Luckily nothing more precious got damaged.
B00OW47L4S|5|I've gotten a few thumbs up and a few &#34;3 finger&#34; salutes with this on the back of my SUV.  This, along with my Magpul and NRA stickers keeps the carjackers thinking twice also.
B00LIW4SRU|3|Color didn't match, need better color code or description.
B00KPR9Q30|5|Works perfectly With 2016 Salem Cruise Lite. You will need 3/8&#34; pigtails for it though. Replaced unit in less than 15 minutes.
B00SBFMURC|1|I have to return  them doesn't fit my jeep
B004LX3AS6|5|Great
B00IO4EYMY|5|Got a good price, just what I ordered, and very fast delivery!  THX
B001C9IQGS|4|After installing this one, driving feeling is better  than that of the previous genuine part. Recommendable. regrefful to find minor scratch on the surface on delivery and box-packing is not much reliable.
B001UL4ALS|3|Handles bent after the third use...
B009OBW23O|5|I have a white<br /><br />lexus And this is the best for it.
B005HKV624|5|My son does some pretty hairy mountain biking and needed a little extension to his current armor to protect his low back. He is tall and thin so most chest armor doesnt go down far enough but this provides additional coverage. This neoprene velcro closure belt with some hard rubber on the back isn't hard like his chest and back armor but does provide some scrape and impact protection. He likes it. Its easy to put on and stays in place.
B00S74WL3K|1|Ordered by mistake. Need armrest covers
B005OZNRVK|3|ok
B001B71IOS|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Subaru Impreza.  Did the job, worked well.
B011JCD47I|5|Great deal, fast shipping.  Batteries test well, hopefully they last.
B00B0C1RWM|5|2011 Honda Odyssey EX with Nav Warped Rotors issue<br /><br />Bought these a couple of weeks ago to see about correcting the warping OEM rotors issue. Just put them on yesterday and so far so good. Make sure you bed them per the instructions. You'll also need thew following<br />Jack Stands ( Don't be wrenching on your car while the only thing holding it up is a Jack, Get some quality stands and save yourself the cost of added repairs and Hospital bills)<br />Brake Cleaner (clean everything, even the new stuff)<br />Roll of shop towels (see above)<br />Brake Grease (Don't grease the stopping side of the pad)<br />Caliper Spreader or Clamp/Channel Locks<br />14mm Socket<br />19mm Socket<br />19mm Crescent Wrench<br />Impact Screwdriver/drill (Honda likes to screw the rotors to the car to hold them on during manufacturing. They can Rust. I went out and bought a 20 dollar impact Screwdriver and it worked like a charm. You don't have to put them back. I did after hitting them with a little Anti-Seize)<br />Wire hanger (or something else to hang the Caliper to the Spring)<br />If you have an Air compressor with the equivalent tools, ever better.<br /><br />There are plenty of Videos online that can show you how to do this step by step. If you can turn a wrench, you can do this. Just check your work.
B009DK6EUI|1|This is not the right part for a 1997 BMW M3 sedan RH front fender.  I bought it and had to return it.  It is<br />14 3/4&#34;.  The correct size is 8 3/4&#34;.
B00BOWT4CS|5|Good for the price
B001UGNJ60|5|Great product and easy to install.  Much better priced than others on the market without compromising the quality.  Only took about 10 mins to install.  Going to purchase 2 more for the back scissor jacks on my trailer.  Highly recommend for people trying to minimize movement in the trailer when fully set up.  Big difference for us compared to using our trailer without them.
B00MJUA1WQ|1|One of the wires that's connected to the light was damaged only one light works.
B00EHHV2OU|5|Ready to move the monitors to my RV. I struggled with the set up for the monitor and the transmitters. When I called for service, the process expert guided me to complete getting the units ready. He was patient and competent.. on Sunday night. Now we'll see how the equipment works.
B004ZF4AC0|5|Super bright came exactly as described. Put them in a pair of Hellas and siliconed them in. They have been working for over a year now and have not had a single issue.
B00GOON9CW|5|Very nice quality. Easy install. Looks great.  Seller was easy to work with.
B00H43AGLE|5|Great
B00B4LBER2|5|great product easy installation. No issues.
B00BCQOYC6|5|Shipping speed excellent, good quality..A++++
B006O87SUC|5|2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, 5.7L V8<br /><br />Installation was straight forward. Only one small hiccup was oxygen sensor does not fix perfectly but a little gasket tape took care of the problem. I noticed improved throttle response and better engine sound right away. Would highly recommend this kit for anyone just starting to do automotive improvements/modifications.
B000B917PW|4|Good price. Plastic thickness is enough to do the job, but not that sturdy or thick -- prone to denting, not industrial quality.
B003HNUA34|5|Love em!!
B011CHB3QO|4|No instructions included. Luckily I already knew how to program the fob or I would have had to scour the Internet for the programing sequence.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to use effective
B0087Y4W4G|2|I thought I would love it and I did, but apply it is a real hassle and it didn't even go on my laptop properly at all.
B001PWA0IO|1|Product failed within 11 months of use...rather light use considering I do not utilize my truck for work, only personal use.
B00D1CQVIY|5|works grear
B004X375KI|4|Looks good
B007KFMPSS|5|So far so good!
B009C176J6|4|Arrived early, nice looking bag.<br /> It's leather, so it stretches a little over time. (Especially in the rain)<br />Easy enough to cinch up tight again though.<br /> All in all, really not bad.
B00CDBOCZS|5|Great.......exactly what I was looking for.....Didn't want anything to mar the paint on my new car when traveling to games and it looks like these will work well........Haven't had a chance to drive any distance with them installed yet, so only time will tell.......I can tell that finding a place/way to store them when not in use may be a bit of a problem thought.....
B002Z5VIS6|5|This is a good quality product, they are easily installed and stay in place even without having a bottom strap attached.
B009Z7O3SY|5|I needed spares.
B00JDQ41PC|5|Like the height and smoke color.
B00063XX5U|5|Works very good
B003FBV8ZW|5|Great fit. Love em. On time delivery no complaints
B000CHIW06|5|Good price. Fast shipping.
B001NZSFHG|5|Nice connector, just plugs in if you have factory tow package. One thing I did notice is some of the wires are not the same color as the vehicle. I did test and they went to the right places. Installed on 99 dodge. Installed this and Tekonsha P 3 brake controller in 1/2 hour.
B000OF432W|1|This DOES NOT fit a 2010 GT, sleeve that the mounting bolt goes thru to secure to UCA mount is too small in diameter (2+ mm) for the bolt to go through.  Called Lakewood, I was told it's hard for an aftermarket manufacturer to know all of the different bolt sizes and it was suggested to me I buy a smaller diameter bolt to correct my issue.  I explained the mount had the larger holes in it and putting a bolt significantly smaller in the mount would result in the bolt moving and causing issues.  I was then asked if there was anything else I needed.  I said I obviously needed to tell someone this that could do something about the fact that it is advertised to fit a 2010 GT, I was told I was talking to that person, the same person that suggested I buy a smaller diameter bolt.
B000182F22|5|installed warn 38826 hubs on 01 350 super duty dually. had to remove adapter (21mm). No problems, works great. Follow directions!
B00PJPHEBO|5|Connected right to my Galaxy S4 with Lolipop OS. No issues.<br /><br />Service/Check engine codes read quick. Takes about 30 seconds to connect.  Almost as good as my $200 OBD computer which runs a 20 stage test, basically shows all the same info just need to do a little more clicking to run a complete diagnostics. Well worth the $13.
B00MUF1APW|5|I purchased these to replace the OEM bulbs (back-up lights) on my 2012 Nissan Frontier.  The LED's are sooo much brighter, I can actually see what's behind me when I back out at night.
B006P80YGQ|2|Not as bright as expected
B000C9QEF4|4|great replacement
B00TEFM24Y|4|Worked and fit like an dealer part without the dealer price. I've used Dorman parts before and there quality is excellent.
B006FDD74W|5|good product
B001CF1A6U|5|Solid! highly recommend
B006X21B0M|5|Just as expected.  Work great.
B000NBYDWW|4|works
B0013LDM3M|5|Great for transporting our scooters. I would suggest sizing up if your handlebar length is at the edge of the size. My Yamaha Zuma has 26.5&#34; handlebar length and the 'Short&#34; (28&#34;) harness doesn't have much extra room to get them on.
B000GZIXKI|5|This kit worked great on my bike it had every thing I needed to install it.
B000C3XD90|5|Love it
B0012WW3OQ|5|A big success. Tks
B00X7VIRAY|5|Wonderful package. Easy to use.
B00XNSZTN4|5|fix the problem and was $250 chaeper
B00LDWZJ3C|5|Great looking product, hope it lasts for a long time.  Going to look great on my 2015 Triple Yellow Mustang!
B000LVXOBA|5|great
B00GAFR0Y8|3|Product came with only one bolt & nut and not two as advertised. However, this can be easily sourced and was not a major problem. Not a bad buy, would recommend.
B00VGL6XKI|4|Good Product & Reasonable Price.
B004G08K9I|5|works great ive been using it on trailers and atvs anything that needs grease and has a zerk fitting
B00N9L2LZE|5|Fits just right. The two suction cups keep it from sagging in the middle. Light weight and easy to store. The two elastic bands keep it folded up, so it doesn't spread out all over the car when not in use in the windshield.
B002ESEMXC|5|Worked Great !
B001GMXA2G|5|nice clean install. took some time but well worth the effort.
B0060L419Y|3|Looks great
B00178WH9G|5|Great job and great price
B007IVSW8Q|5|Product fit perfect!  I received the mirror five minutes before I got the email stating that it shipped. I ordered on Tuesday and received it Wednesday afternoon.  It took ten minutes to install on my 2003 Honda Accord EX. Thanks!!!!
B001EAQTRI|5|I wish I had known these existed months ago. My 2007 Mazda-3 AUX input is not particularly well grounded and if I use the AUX while my phone (iPhone 5) is being charged, a horrible electrical feedback buzz emits from the speakers. And never stops.<br /><br />Buzzzzz... humm.. buzzz....bzzzzzzz....<br /><br />ENOUGH!<br /><br />I plugged this little guy in to the AUX, and my device in to it, and it was music to my ears! Just music! No more static!<br /><br />If you have any of the irritating noise described above, try this Noise Isolator out. You won't regret it!
B007HSZILE|5|Awesome looking!  Looks real!
B000C2CNMY|5|Great replacement for my 1996 4.0.  Looked identical to the factory gasket.  Helps greatly to remove the rear crank case vent valve (only the plastic valve, not the rubber grommet) with 2 broad screw drivers or some kind of fork tool.  Be careful when prying or you will crack the plastic, it is really tough to get out, and back in.  I also didn't use any gasket sealer and it has worked out fine so far.  This is a rubber type gasket and doesn't seem probable they would want you to use any sealer.  If it was cork, then definitely.<br />  Other than the rear vent valve, it went surprising smooth.  I followed the manual I had and this guy's instructions http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f11/valve-cover-gasket-replacement-lots-pics-1121533/.<br />  Just work slow and be patient and everything will workout fine.  Thanks and good luck.
B0041TQTJW|5|what a relief to have it fixed...worked perfectly.
B009FRTSK2|2|I ordered the pads for my 2008 F350, The front ones were right...but the back ones were the wrong ones.... I went to exchange them...and it had been over 30 days...Now what?
B00NP60URE|1|It arrived today - out of the box, I put my finger on the vacuum nozzle, pumped it up to about 20 IN Hg, and watched the need drop. I had hoped to test some automotive vacuum lines, but I sure can't with this one.
B0000UUX34|5|Here is a video review to discribe the product<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjJBD5JA0t0
B002WFBA0A|4|work very well. much less than what all shops wanted
B008QDXPFK|5|Works great, I would recommend. :)
B0002X7T5Y|5|works good
B00S6PBHHG|5|Great product, matched the 'Desert Silver (Gold)' 693 that my 02 Mercedes is. The brush was of surprisingly decent quality ... fine tipped and soft. Great for chips and small scratches. Tends to get thick very fast, but relid and shake and it will be fine to use a while again. Best used in shaded space.
B00B2E19NK|4|These are great seat covers.  They work great and fit perfectly for my car.  I occasionally drive for Uber so its nice having some seat covers that are cheap but actually look and feel nice.  The steering wheel cover fits perfect, which surprised me because of the unusual size of  it.  I definitely like these and will get it again when mine where out.
B0020KAZ94|5|Great Deal!!!! Fast Shipping!!!! The headlights make the car look much nicer.
B001B7BUAU|5|Item worked perfectly for my 52 Chevy. I have a &#34;recirculating heater&#34; in my car. It was bypassed when I bought it  and had no way to control water flow through the heater. This worked great with no modification to the dash.
B00UVXDIS2|1|Product arrived early. Decal was significantly slanted compared to the picture in the website. We have similarly shaped windows and could not place it anywhere on the window where it did not look distorted.
B0024NWQZI|5|Excellent quality. Easy installation. Very highly recommended.
B00EJ53I3S|1|Received the wrong merchandise not satisfy at all
B00802GIW4|5|Everything worked great on my 2010 Prius. No modifications necessary.
B00ELJLU96|5|Excellent...!!!!
B009H63RVC|5|This is amazing love it . We put it on our side by side . Now all our friends have got one
B0006IX7UQ|4|great ice trays , the ice practically just falls out of them when ready. show no signs of breaking or cracking
B00BCRMB34|5|First of all, I have a gold ford taurus. Let me tell you these look amazing in there. The color is perfect! The material is high quality. I did not have to over stretch anything for them to fit. It even helped hold my seat cushion in place...lol I'm short. These are truly a good value for seat covers. I am please to have the honor of trying them out at such an amazing price. You will never find another 17 piece at the price the seller has them going for.
B00S9ZVNSQ|5|good work
B009OA37S4|5|This fits the Hyundai Elantra GT 2013. I'm very happy with the purchase and quick delivery.
B00X52W83M|2|These help but the whistling is still there.  I have a 50&#34; light bar with 6 on it and it helps but if anyone has another recommendation let me know.  Maybe I need to buy more?  I have the other two on the light above the winch.
B00K5RGTBC|5|M.d.b
B00HFDC8EQ|5|These plugs are exactly what I was looking for. Plugged right into my lights nice and snug just like I hoped it would. Great job guys! Thanks!
B00ZVJ35XE|5|Great material, very nice quality.
B00EMHTB5W|5|It was perfect.
B00KTI8UBE|4|the plastic cracks easy and the tabs for the battery breaks off when you goto change the battery all the same problems as the OEM ones
B0058VBDDO|3|Its is really nice but it say that it 3 inches shorter then the OEM but it was actually an inch taller so I just continued the threads  Further down then cut the extra off butworks great other then I had to do that but it only took me about an hour to thread an cut an with the install other then that works good
B000OAG2DK|5|I am very happy with this shower head.  I love the off switch; it let's you keep the water at the same temperature and allows you to stop it and start it.
B00WYO2OYK|5|Excellent for on-the-go charging for your gear while traveling. Built-in compass and bright LED flashlight are nifty features when camping. What really sets this &#34;Battery Bank&#34; apart from the others, is its ability to jump-start cars. Far more practical than bulky jumpers. Slim design with egonomics in mind makes this item very portable. My only concern for this product, is waterproofing. While I generally don't use in conditions where it could get splashed or rained on, but if.you plan tovuse.this.outdoors,.take.extra.care.with it. Otherwise, satisfied with purchase. 5-Star.
B00KUL790S|5|Factory replacement part for my cruze at a great price
B00OVVEMW6|5|2008 Audi A8L and fits well.  Buy the optional tie down Gust straps to wind proof it.
B002JBDH26|1|I ordered the handle with the idea it was to be all metal. The lever that opens it is made of plastic I was disappointed . I received the handle on Thursday , installed it on Saturday and received a call from the wife on Monday it had already broke. for the time and effort of install this was disappointing to have it break in a matter of 6-8 pulls.

B008QR1ANA|5|pleased
B00WA1U7MS|5|I got 3 of these tools. One for each family member. Great tool. Fast delivery greatest price!
B0031HEIDY|5|Had them installed  they work great and  with the price can't go wrong  both fog light working now.
B00K1C1WC2|4|Not bad, They are pretty small and just thin plastic. I would not trust them on a big hill with a heavy truck. But for 7 bucks shipped they live up to what i would expect for that price. I bought them to keep my trailer from moving on a slight hill. I would like to see them about 25% larger though. They seem to be pretty good quality plastic.
B00AQSPG1Y|5|replaced the old one.
B005F9BCB2|5|Ordered this as a back-up, it's of excellent quality and will come in good use when needed.
B00PIJT2SE|5|It's been a month and according to my newly installed Voltmeter gauge it's working fine.
B00QMKYYYK|5|WRONGED ORDERED . NOT FOR MY CAR
B006QGD996|3|Good price point, but ratchet should be in the middle of the tie down.  With it being located at one end, limits some of your options
B007X6X2IG|4|Good
B005OV60HW|5|Fit perfectly and was a breeze to install
B009AEOWEC|5|Great spacers
B005WWO7YQ|5|Just what the doctor  ordered
B004SIE2BI|5|Looks exactly like the pic.. good quality too.. not like a sticker when you peel it off you have some left on the car... you can just peel theses off no prob! I will say only the German one's are cool!<br /><br />Eve B
B000KKLLFS|4|The work fine
B00J8W5Z9C|2|Looks good but has poor reception.
B00K1C1WC2|5|What's not to love? I mean, it's a wheel chock.
B00END5U9Q|4|Shipped quick. Install was quick and painless, could reduce vibes more but they still look nice.
B008I4Q9IW|5|Solid construction.  Carried a Polaris razor like nothing up into the trailer
B00KHUQAY8|5|The arrival time was perfect. The cover fits my steering wheel and i had no problem putting it on. It looks good on it.
B000BZJ762|5|This is the upstream sensor for my Mitsubishi Eclipse 97 (non-turbo). My downstream sensor died, and I had to get it replaced. After replacing it, I though it would be a good idea to replace the downstream sensor (this product) because the catalyst test was showing as &#34;incomplete&#34;. I bought this sensor 2 days later and installed it. Reset the PCM (by disconnecting battery for 20 minutes) and started my car up. At first it was coughing up and idling inconsistently, which is normal when you replace one of these parts, after reaching normal temperature I took it for a spin and immediately noticed improved response on the throttle. The best part is that my engine idling has gotten much more consistent at 800 rpm and rarely drops below, the car feels smoother, and I can already notice improved fuel consumption. Even with my A/C turned on the engine idle is very consistent and I think it helps my A/C to perform better when driving in bumper to bumper traffic.<br /><br />Next time you perform a tune-up of your car (spark plugs, filters, etc). And you still notice a surging idling or lack of throttle response, consider replacing your O2 sensors, specially if you have not replaced them in ages (mine were the car originals). This product is definitely recommended.
B00FS3CCMI|4|Very well made and study.  Only giving 4 stars as they need to update the design as many new slides outs don't have a beam.  I cut one of the sides off so it would fit nicely under the side of my slide out without have to use a block on the top of it.
B00LNE6J5M|3|they are as advertised.
B000BZADBK|5|Fit great on my 88 F-150. Seemed better than the OEM seal. Can't beat the price of the 'used' seal from amazon warehouse.
B007VFER1U|2|This is not very waterproof, My daughter was riding during rain and it was fried.
B003UM7APS|5|Worked perfectly.  Good quality and easy to use.
B00A1W1IPI|2|Way over-priced.  Knew 2&#34; was small, but somehow expected more for $4.  Would be OK buy at $1 for this small sticker, but not at this price.  Better option:  Kayak Kayaker Paddle Canoe White Decal Sticker Die-cut
B00FSBE7MI|5|Received the item on time and immediately opened it up to try it out in the driveway. Went together really well. Took it out for the fourth of July weekend and worked great. A lot of compliments on it as well.
B000KKKDMK|4|I was looking for something to replace some metal straps on some old redwood furniture.  I had been looking for some time and finally decided this was the best product.  The strapping is stiff enough to provide support and it was easy enough to work with for a do it yourself project guy without a ton of tools
B000CJ1ZR6|5|Good
B001AZW61K|5|Really nice
B00BCH4WTA|1|These are probably the most useless spray bottles we've ever used. We use these type of spray bottles to spray MEK and these lasted about two sprays before they died.<br />If you're looking for spray bottles that actually work for harsh chemicals, try the Zep brand ones. You can get them at Home Depot.
B000WI515O|4|Arrived in fine condition.
B000C9ULFS|4|After having 2 FRAM filters fail and almost cause an engine failure, I looked at ALL of the major brands.  Bought the spin on's and cut them open to see how they're made.  WIX and Motorcraft were the 2 best, followed by AC.  So I stay with WIX since they're also the supplier to NAPA with the same quality.<br /><br />As far as this part number for our VW Passat 3.6L, it is just as cheesy as the one you would pay 4 X the price for from VW.  80,000 miles and zero problem with the WIX.
B0082365AQ|2|Constantly folding and won't support my tandem kayak. Can't unlock the secret to using this cart yet, maybe because instructions were not included. Also made our garage smell like a tire factory for weeks.
B00D3298A0|5|fits perfectly for my car and works great
B00IJHPD5I|5|A+++
B00CKXZ24E|1|Sucks. Too bulky... ugly cnc machine work
B00SGPMVLW|4|My only problem with this product is the color. Unfortunately the color is not represented well by the picture. other than that it seems to be a good product.
B007VHBGIU|5|easy to install, looks great
B004WNFQGO|1|It does NOT fit 2014 Elantra GT.  The cover will not close.
B00308BCYM|1|Inferior product for outdoor use. The seams have deteriorated in less than a year. There is no way to enforce the warranty because it was bought through Amamzon. I definitely will not buy a product from R&G again.
B000UVUAFO|1|waste product
B007V5BL96|5|Good fit
B001HKZHIW|5|What can I say.  Works as advertised.  You really need a 3/4 in hose if you are going to pump any distance. (or up hill).
B002RK9FAW|5|Apply dry, it's much easier.
B0012WHBSO|4|Pump seems to be fine.  Kicked off while airing one of my bigger truck tire.  Turns out the connection into the cigarette lighter source was not inserted completely.  Other than that, I think is pump will work fine for me.
B00J4Z7SIE|4|item as described  not used yet.
B00IYW6H3K|2|One set of the caps was bended and wouldn't go on a screw.. Even tried different screws..
B00B6QF41M|5|Instructions easy, a very well crafted piece of equipment, you just need a good human eye to make sure it's centered ((left/right) and the correct distance from the edge of the trunk before you drill the holes.  Excellent paint match.
B00SSKUHAC|5|Well worth it to organizer this massive console. I took the center divider out and it works much better for bigger items. Would definitely buy again.
B00WQBKT20|5|Great product!
B0099PC2OE|5|I used it for the first time this weekend. Well made product, and it worked exactly as it should.
B00BUS3AKS|5|It is easy to install and remove and it is just what I needed to cover my purchases.
B00332GNRQ|5|Perfect fit!  Delivered as expected. I would recommend to purchase from this company.
B0072PAMFY|5|As described... Fast Shipping... A+++
B000GZV2OC|5|its all balls what can ya say. you know their reputation when you buy it
B00609DEEO|5|Great, Fast and Good Quality
B0002UHVAA|5|works like a charm - my tank has never been cleaner - ordered an additional 2 units for my neighbors trailers.
B001SIDFXM|5|Great in my FJ CRUISER
B009XZW0CY|5|Perfect for my Terios BeGo
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Will work for the purpose we need, and it is nice it is self cling, as we are actually going to use it to keep the sun out of the truck for the dogs, since we don't have tinted windows in the truck.
B00KLKV2Y2|1|Ordered this part with high hopes it looked good in its package but i installed it and i happened to look over and it was cracked right thrue the left side. I wouldnt recommend this intake boot.
B00280CTEA|5|Great Product, very secired and look great.
B00M78820I|5|It's exactly what I needed, and works gre
B000C5G886|5|Not sure why it's orange but my aircon is back under control.
B00KIQ68WU|5|I'VE USED IT FIOR YEARS  I LOVDE THE WAY IT WORKS  THASNKS
B000X282DM|1|Liked the price and made in USA...  But the forcing screw end broke on the first use.  Had to use the bread trick to extract my pilot bearing
B001C0F1HY|5|These things work fine, be sure to lube it up good. Maybe the bozo's that complain about these, skipped the lube?
B000CPCBEQ|5|Very good worked great for synchros
B0076PKDR2|1|started leaking the next week, made cheap!
B008851V7A|4|Make sure you read the size and not look at just pictures common mistake for me seems to be good quality will be putting it on later
B00EJOE4LY|4|These aren't as plush as the ones I had purchased several years ago at a local craft show, but they do the job of protecting the skin on my neck from the seat belt irritation.
B0035YGLZG|5|This is the second Automated Switch that I've bought by this manufacturer. The first was a single circuit switch. I like it so much that I decided to buy a couple more. When I shopped to buy a second unit like the first I noticed it had gone up considerably in price (the price tends to fluctuate within $10). Then this caught my eye and I had to have it. It has the extra circuit plus it only cost a few dollars more than a single circuit. In fact, this model is a much better fit for my use. I am using this switch hooked up to run my table saw with a vacuum system on it and I still have an auxiliary outlet if I need it. Not to mention the power surge protection. It's nice when your working on a project to have the ability to hit one switch and everything shuts off. I may buy a few more for around my shop and for gifts.
B004BTOEIK|4|Car no longer makes Exxon Valdez-esque puddles of hydraulic fluid wherever it goes, you're welcome Rachel Carson
B0019BSGTQ|5|Great boot, comes uncut, pain in the ass to cut and line up perfectly but it looks awesome!
B008JORKP2|5|The fire pit starts easily, works great, and is portable and affordable. When there's a burn ban, its good to have one of these to go camping. You can use it in the backyard too, but I prefer a table/fire pit for entertaining.
B000GKXU6A|3|It does the job.
B00BCH51ZO|3|NO WORRIES
B00069CN2I|2|Installing the mirror extensions seems a bit cheesy but they held on.  They were somewhat helpful but I didn't notice a big difference so I ended up taking them off.
B00B8Z0FI8|4|so far so good - delivered in good condition - now for the install..
B009RC2HVC|5|Looks better than new. Easy to install but you do need an extra set of hands to help hold it all together while lining up bolts, etc.
B001LHVOVK|4|Works perfectly
B00WMKS7D8|5|works as required. had it installed for a few months now with good performance
B004K388WK|5|Great
B00D3R393W|5|its all balls what can ya say. you know their reputation when you buy it
B00EEG7EQO|5|I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B00UN13UJY|2|For my 2007 Ford Explorer these LEDs didn't quite fit the instrument cluster board exactly. They slid into the slots but the connectors didn't make a solid connection so several of them didn't light up. For the ones that did work, the light was far less bright than the stock bulbs and looks less impressive than what you see in the product photo.<br /><br />Between not installing well and being quite dim, I would not recommend these bulbs.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The product is very good. Ships directly from the USA. I am using it for my new SUV Scorpio S10 here in India. Fits very well with the windshield inside. Not fitting problem. Folds very well too. But you must know how to fold it. Good product. Does very well what it is supposed to do---protect your car from sunlight and UV through the windsheild.
B000CQPPWA|5|Very good
B004HMBK5G|5|After complaining to a coworker about seatbelts cutting across my neck, he gave me a spare one of these.  It's hard to believe how something so simple can make such a difference.  When the first one broke (completely my own fault) I went straight to Amazon and bought these replacements.
B00ELQ47I0|5|Fits perfectly in a 2010 Cadillac SRX!!!!!  Super fast shipping and great price.
B00DJ68I2E|1|I did a boatload of prep of the floor.  used their cleaner, dried everything, and mixed per the directions.  Let it dry while I was gone on a trip for a week.  Then came home and left the garage open each day for 3 days in 75F - 85F temperature and about 20% - 40% humidity.  In my book, it should be nice and dry.<br /><br />Scratches easy, and when I wiped up some automatic transmission fluid I spilled I mopped the floor with simple green and water at a ratio of about 7:1, water to Simple Green.  Well the floor went dull, and where the ATF was the floor paint bubbled!  Look for something else my friends...
B00IGCVYUO|2|Nowhere in the product description does it reference quantity. The picture is of 2 bushings, so I assumed there were 2 per package. There's only 1 per package. That's pretty stupid. Either specify 1 per package, or change the picture, or otherwise let folks know they're not getting 2 - if anybody else is like me, and has only the one day to do the repair, and now I need to wait another 2 days for the part to be delivered again. Aggravating.
B003ZOH5QU|5|A+++++
B004MDEV38|2|Wrong Bolts
B00J632PPK|4|Nice
B0037LG17U|5|Very nice air tank, was exactly what I hoped for
B006N9I7BG|5|It's good
B000GKS0YW|4|it works, looks and fit great.  Is very easy instalation. One problem with the bolds head are little big, and bumps the trunk door.
B004QDN518|5|Very loud. Works good
B00ABZCI1I|3|Need to a womens vest
B002PWJRWS|5|Love that it is so much lighter than my previous one.  The non skid strips are nice, but they do collect dirt that does not brush off.
B001AVOKI6|4|Works great!
B000KL3DUS|5|Love it works great.
B00DHVK7SO|4|fit well and do the job asked of them
B0046AQKH2|5|Perfect, highly recommend
B00H1DXT8O|5|Post office drop the ball, but  Mathrew reissue me another one
B00JMHI11C|5|exact substitute for the one that came on my fifth wheel
B00CH6T18C|5|I purchased this cleaner to clean two old leather chairs.  It did a good enough cleaning job that I was then able to sell both leather chairs.
B004GFS2C8|1|Very disappointed. I bought this thing, thinking sowing buttons will be a breeze from now on. Found that the noddles are really thick and poorly sharpened. They don't penetrate fabric without damaging it. Then, the fasteners can't go through the fabric because of how think the needles are. The instructions suck.<br /><br />So, could not sow one button in well over 20 attempts. It's too Much of a hassle to return in. It was a great alway to throw my money.<br /><br />My advice, don't buy it. It's much easier just to sow your buttons, which you'll end up doing in the end anyway.
B0044U1CGS|5|Works fine so far..
B001GLSL0S|5|Used this on my air impact wrench and it worked great.
B00DD2KVG0|5|If your looking for motorcycle ramp buy this one. 2006 CBR 1000 works perfect with any size truck.
B00KTJ9148|2|Easy to assemble. Back cracked within a month and finally fell apart last week. Didnt even last six months.
B00P0YBUOQ|5|Good quality!
B00JNEAPRM|5|Nice lugnuts and quick shipping.  They did the trick at a decent price.
B0009V1WSE|1|USED LESS THAN 1000 MILES. 5 DAYS SHY OF 2 MONTHS.  LARGE LOCK JAMED, OILED, 1ST KEY DAMAGED, STILL STUCK ON TRUCK.
B00BMNDQ5U|4|I assembled the hitch yesterday but ran into a problem.  The chain brackets that attach the round bar chains to the trailer won't fit my trailer.  The top of my trailer tongue is 3 inches wide and the brackets will only work on one that is 2 3/4 inches wide.  So for now I'm using the brackets that came with my U-Haul weight distribution hitch which are made for 800 pound round bars not for the 1400 pounds ones that came with my Curt hitch.  I went online to Curt Manufacturing and found no brackets to replace the ones I have.  Apparently, the company is not concerned about the different width angled steel used for tongues of heavy duty trailers.  If anyone who reads this review has a suggestion, I would appreciate it.  Right now my only option is to weld parts of the brackets to my trailer's tongue.
B006JG5BG2|1|It was a waste of money.  Would shut down at 15psi.  Could not get it to even fill a basketball to proper pressure.
B0031I4HLG|5|Perfect in every way. The local auto parts store gets about 1/3 more $ for being able to get it today. I think I'll plan ahead.
B00J1KC1Y8|5|fits well and looks good
B00527ZAMY|5|Good for the price
B007O3WAYU|4|Just what I needed for a T&C 2008.
B001QIYAQ0|4|Just arrived 3 days ago. Quality of unit seems decent. Plugged it in to all 3 of my obd2 vehicles (silverado, charger and an accord) to see if it would communicate. Linked up within 10 seconds on all 3. Unfortunately I currently do not have a fault light on in any of my rigs. Will update review when I get one... My 2005 silverado seems to pop the engine light about every 4 to 6 months for stupid crap like dirty air flow sensor or fuel cap etc... so it shouldn't be long...<br /><br />Update: I have had my 3150 now for 4 days and it already paid for itself. Diagnosed and repaired a problem with my daughter's Honda. I figured between diag, parts and labor I saved myself close to $400. What would have been an easy $600 shop bill I completed for less than $200 in parts and a couple hours labor. The code I was trouble shooting was one of those codes a &#34;not so honest&#34; shop could have upsold an unknowing patron to over $1000. But with pulling the code and a little on line research of possible causes of the code, had it figured out pretty quick and it was the lesser expensive of the possible failed parts.<br /><br />04/2017: at this point... This little gem has saved me, my neighbor, my daughters friends and a couple buddies thousands of $$ all together... Has been a great investment.
B00PV37ZEA|3|the product itself is a good durable quality, however theres no really good way to keep in stood up in the car, everyones car is different..on the bottom it has these Velcro like tags that im assuming is how you get it to stand up..i dont have carpet in my vehicle so it is kinda hard to use. i would recommend this product but only if kyou have carpet in your vehicle:)
B000BW8LQW|4|Bought this set for an 86 Jeep CJ7. The plugs work great, definitely smoothed out my idle. However, the boots did not fit correctly with my distributor cap. The boots themselves fit over the plug holes, but the ones I received are all right-angle boots. Because of this, it proved difficult to bend the plug wires around that angle inside the boot to correctly insert them into the cap's plug receptacle. I ended up throwing out those boots and just re-using the ones that were on my Jeep, which have no angle.
B00MJU8SRG|3|Looks good! Very cheap through and not very bright. Screw striped on me right off the bat.  Still I think it looks good and awesome for a budget biker
B00K4WW2DC|2|The item Fit My Jeep , But My RPM stays above one , so it kind of Working
B0027UMVXU|5|wow this was the nicest and easiest winch mount i have ever installed it took maybe 3 minutes and the paint is great it looks like a very high quality piece the bends and holes are spot on perfect<br /><br />amazon shipped this in one day with free prim shipping i ordered it sunday morning i got it monday morning<br /><br />i uploaded some pics of it on my scrambler 400 2 stroke ill take some pictures of it with the winch and add those as well after i get the winch
B00YMUD3NK|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B00GSG2526|4|Have had not problems with it
B00NY7JM64|5|Keep my drive on there so it won't get lost.
B001JT5MGI|5|I mix this in even though I rarely see bellow 0, better safe than sorry.
B00KPZECVI|5|Beats paying the $175 at the dealership and works just fine. Once I received it I took it down to the dealership where they cut and programmed for $35 much better than total of $375 for a key they provide.
B007VLFA4M|5|Bright, went in without a hitch.<br />Brighter than expected and easy to install. Everything worked.
B00CZMGXAM|5|Purchased for my 2011 STI. Was a pain in the butt to get the old ones out. These look great!
B00KTI8UBE|5|Works great and was easy to follow instructions.
B00842A7F4|5|great
B00IXW0H3W|4|great replacement
B005GYDBYM|5|They make an excellent oil filter. Designed for extended use. I only use synthetics in my car.
B00CW8ODTW|1|Very Cheaply Made. Valve stems would not stop leaking and had to be removed at my expense buy the shop. Would not recommend at all.
B00HTOB0NG|5|So far so good. It canceled my flickering lights. Let see how long it will last. But over all 5 star.
B003CSPZIE|4|Nice shocks very well made only installed for 1 month at this time no issues so far. Will update later when thorough testing can be completed.
B00318NQFY|1|Advertised wrong - does not fit a Fiat
B00D8IKIOE|5|easy to install!!
B001PYLFZY|5|Perfect in every way. Local parts store couldn't (wouldn't) order this, even though they carry Dorman products.
B00GKTZAHS|5|Great stickers! Perfect for license plate. These adhere well in your license plate and are high quality vinyl stickers
B00G09LTAK|5|Exactly what I needed and wanted to change the ball joints on my 1997 F150.
B000Q8GVPY|1|Bent with first use not very sturdy at all.
B00IIXNBFM|3|These are VERY small decals - not suer what I was expecting but not that small :)
B00BLPVYJO|5|Awesome face mask for cooler weather,  I live in south Texas.  Good fit.  Will wait for fall to wear it otherwise I will melt.  Can't wait for Dia De Los Muertos.
B00BIKGRMG|5|Nice in expensive mirrors. The black look fits in nice with the rest of my bike.
B00WXVW1V0|5|I bought this decal for my kayak and absolutely loved it! It was a bit bit smaller than what I had expected but ended up better since it fit perfectly on my kayak. Application was easy and simple. I would definitely buy this again.
B00A82A3QG|4|Great experience
B00W461T62|5|It was fast and the product is a excellent quality. thank you very much!
B000BW8W5W|5|Fine.
B00AZPI0NE|4|Very bright fit on my mower nicely - only one per box though I need to buy one more ...
B0076YE4QO|5|very good
B000I2079E|5|In a somewhat unscientific study, we put 3 scraps of sheet metal out in the weather.  One was sprayed with PB, one with WD40, and one we left uncoated.  After a few weeks outside, the WD40 metal was MORE corroded than the control piece, and the PB piece had no rust on it.<br /><br />That's all I needed to see.  We only use PB now.
B000JFJLQA|4|works great...
B00DC5TV0A|5|Perfect length/angle to load my bikes into the bed of my F150 4x4.  I would suggest these to anyone for budget ramps.
B004RCXB8A|5|as described
B0036C0PVI|5|Great
B00L4JA100|5|I was having trouble finding seat covers to go with my tan seats and interior. These work great. They are made well and the picture is bright. They fit in my escape perfect
B0082LHRRS|5|Good
B00RUDWX4G|5|Ordered these for my 2015 Harley Softail Slim, they look great, high quality mirrors, fast shipping and the best price!! Will recommend highly!
B00CZL1GNC|5|Pit Bull owner who is wife's &#34;Mama's Boy&#34;.  It now hangs proudly from her rear view mirror.  Very good quality.  I would recommend to buy.
B002H8NBNQ|5|Put this on my car before heading out to my summer job in the desert. It looks great, and withstood extream heat, storms, and glaring sun and hath not faded, wrinkled, or shown any signs of coming off. Great Product.
B00YB5GAEA|5|It is small and bright.  It attaches easily to my seat post.
B0006H8BDU|1|It didn't fit my car like it said it would.
B001JT7AU4|4|does the job
B0015PN010|5|Nice product, Too bad it was missing parts. This should have never been sent to a customer.
B009WEW14I|4|Great look and feel to these hand grips.
B001DKNB98|5|It's getting really hard to find 20/10 anymore.  So pleased to find this!  And the price is pretty reasonable.
B00BGZ00K8|3|Works well to hide the wear and tear on an old keyfob. Would love it if the pictures of the functions were a contrasting color so that you could see what each button was better.
B00KL3ALGO|5|This car window shade was bought to put up on my driver's side window to reduce the sun coming in hitting my left arm.  The product has a thick Saran wrap like backing that sticks well to the window.  The screen cuts the sunlight penetrance into the car, but not to the degree that would interfere with my seeing cars and other objects through the window.  It comes in a round cloth storage packet, but I was not able to twist the shade to put it easily in this packet.  The excellent customer follow-up offering suggestions, but I was afraid of twisting it too much for fear of putting a permanent bend in the wire frame and making it less adherent to the window.  So, I just store it in the car fully open.  The degree of customer service that I received from this company was exemplary.  Would recommend this product if anyone has a similar interest in cutting down the sun from coming through the window.
B003150IO4|5|I was a little skeptical about what kind of gains I could get from this but let me tell you that I felt an improvement in response and my car feels more of a beast. Shipping was fast. Package great and it came with a filter cleaner too. Price was much cheaper than anywhere else. Definitely happy with this product.
B001QT652Q|3|Visor doesn't stay open north of 70MPH
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|GREAT PRICE, GIVES OFF GOOD LIGHT, BETTER THAN THE RV BULBS THE UNIT CAME WITH. USES HARDLY ANY ELECTRICITY
B00V2RZLKE|5|Way better quality than I expected for the price, rivals the most expensive, works great.
B00MUF1APW|5|Fit was great and the light is bright. Worked great in my 03 Svt Lightning
B00Q8PAEIY|4|Nice add-on!
B003L2ZQGW|5|You can go 12,000 miles on a oil change when you use their oil & oil filter per royal purple technical support.<br />Buy American for the best quality and save.
B006VU37LM|5|Wonderful! Used it to clean a chrome exhaust pipe. Works like magic.
B004N5WHE0|5|This is a very high quality product, if you just want a quick wash and wax, this is exactly what you are looking for. It provides a good shine, and water does bead off. It doesn't last too long (this is natural Carnauba wax) but it does it's job.<br />One nice thing about this is that it is windshield friendly. In-fact, it even beads the water off. If you constantly wash your vehicle with this product your shine will start to fade (due to the build-up of old wax). I recommend washing with this wax when you don't have the time, and washing with dish soap (strips the wax) and applying a thin layer of carnauba wax, let it haze over & buff it out, then apply a thin layer of synthetic wax (for the protection), let it haze over & buff it out when you do have time.
B00MEJ6AA4|5|Perfect!  Just what I needed to keep things sliding across the plastic floor console of my 2008 Equinox.  I would recommend to buy.
B00KTHU9MI|1|Easy to program and worked great with my GMC Sierra for about a month until the battery worked itself out of the thin metal holder inside and damaged the circuit board. Was cheap enough compared to OEM so I ordered another one. 1-2 months later same exact thing happened except this time the battery holder broke off on one side. Next one I purchase will be OEM!
B0049Z8X4C|5|Great gift.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Works perfectly on my 15 CVO Roadglide Ultra!
B003VANVWU|5|Its a BMW factory oil filter. That and Mobil 1 in a BMW are the best there is. What else to say?
B001C6N7BU|1|Received a used sensor that was covered in oil and the wiring harness was cut with crimped joints. Apparently someone returned their old one for a refund after they replaced the one in their vehicle. It should have been inspected regardless.  There wasn't even a bracket in the box. Will have to wait 2 more days for another to arrive in the mail. I may update the review after the product arrives and is installed.
B0002TDUW4|5|Not too bad! I used this on the floor of my xj and I'm very happy with this product. I had ever ought to do three solid coats on the floor and used what was left on the headliner. I had to put it somewhere besides the garbage!
B000E2CVIS|5|amazingly easy install fit perfect for the 2015 ninja 300 i was putting in on. easy to torque properly with the nut on the. now i am getting one for my car.
B00PH5LG5Q|5|Love this car vacuum! Works perfect, actually a lot better than I expected! I have an 18 month old so having a clean car is more important to me than what it was before and this does the job!!
B009KBUR2Q|4|Nice squeeqee
B0002UEPVI|2|I purchased this to glue on a small panel for rotating the side-view mirrors on an '09 Ford Focus.* This glue did not work. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I live in Phoenix where we regularly hit and exceed 100'F.<br /><br />*Replacing the door panels caused them to fall off.
B0002M9SUO|4|Great product. The one I got seems huge. I took off a star because the original photo had two lights pictured so I was disappointed when I only received one.
B00BQAL016|5|Its JUST looks great. Will order agin.
B00THGBWHI|2|They stain very easy and bleach doesn't get clean
B0051WVPB0|5|It came in quick, went on easy, now we'll see how it holds up.

B005FKTWOK|1|Part is listed to fit a 2011 Challenger RT. It does NOT fit. This kit is designed only for the base 6 cylinder challenger and other base model dodge/chrysler vehicles. Check powerstop's website before you order a kit off here.
B000S2ZPXW|5|I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually impressed. It works great with a 2015 jeep wrangler hard top. I used to have the windshield completely smothered in bugs. I still get a few bugs here and there, but it's dramatically lower than what it used to be. Haven't had any issues yet.
B004DS5KIC|4|Very sturdy pegs and only 5 min install on a DR650.  They do seem to slant a bit and don't have that much bite with the rounded grooves (nothing a Dremel can't fix).  But for $15 dollars this was a great upgrade.
B00J4VV50K|5|great buy
B000IYT1RG|1|Doesn't fit right.
B000EZU90M|5|Perfect fit, easy to install, works great!
B00O1QUUKY|5|Received as described. Works very well. Timely. Thanks
B009SAQ28C|5|Fit perfect for my 2013 challenger.
B00T02NY7K|1|Don't even waste your time. Serious safety concerns here. The metal is so light there is a possibility of the bars folding back in a spill and trapping the foot or leg. Once installed, I could bend it by hand. I have returned the item and not received a refund as was promised. Don’t buy this junk. Don’t do business with these people!
B003ZGD33C|5|My bike look so nice<br />Good price

B000GOJW9A|5|This was a mostly easy install. The only thing that made it a little hard was having to twist around in the space under the passenger side of the dash.  But if you're a small person, it will probably be easier.  The symptom:  When the fan was on, it would make a whining noise-- one person said it sounds like Chewbacca.  Pretty close, but I'd say it sounded like a wookie combined with a busted kazoo.  The noise would happen at any speed...used to happen continuously, but eventually only when you first turned the fan on, and then again if you accelerated hard.  Turning the fan up to *4*, the highest setting usually made it go away ...for a while.  ***NOTE***  if your fan is dead at the 1 and 2 setting- but works on 3 and 4-it's probably not this motor, it's the resistor-- you can find info on the internet....  There is a helpful video on youtube--the mechanic is doing an Accord, but it is VERY similar, except in an Accord you have more room to work in. It's called &#34;How To Install Replace Heater AC Blower Motor Honda Accord Civic Acura CL EL Integra 92-06 1AAuto&#34;  posted by &#34;1A Auto Parts.&#34;  Also... if you have a generation 3 Integra, 1994-2001,  you do NOT need to take any trim off, just wiggle it out.  This is one of those jobs where it takes a little time at first...but if you did it a second time it would be 10 mins total at most...   Looking at the old fan, I'm not sure what the problem was.  It definitely doesn't turn as easily as the new one....probably the motor just burned out halfway but never totally died.  For the toosl you need- looks like a 8mm socket, but you can also use a flathead screwdriver on these screws.  I made the mistake of thinking it was a phillips/flathead, but it is actually a Torx/flathead screw. Luckily after I took the screws out with a phillips, the flathead grooves were still good-- I ended up stripping the torx grooves.  Of course your year/model might be slightly different, so check closely before you start.  I recommend the shortest medium head screwdriver you have.  1&#34; is perfect.  Also when removing the fan, start with the screw closest to the engine to make it easier.  A big head screwdriver won't fit, and the small  pocket sized one will probably slip.  If you don't have them-- you can still do the job but with a lot more effort--trust me.  When you put the new fan in, remember the rectangular tab for the screw goes in the hole closest to the center console.  The two rounded tabs go towards the engine and the door.  Installing the new fan is where the short screwdriver can be handy...you can hold the fan up in place with one finger while turning the screwdriver.  I used a 5&#34; screwdriver, a short one would have made this job MUCH easier, and much quicker.  This was easy enough that I wish I had done it sooner.  I lived with it for six years since it never gets really hot or really cold here, and rolling the windows down is usually enough to keep cool.  Definitely worth fixing since it's so cheap and not hard to do.

B008UR7J6I|1|Will not connect to the ecu on either my Chrysler t&c or my dodge ram. And I paid for the pro version of the torque app. Seems to be a huge waste of time
B000C11JJ8|5|Fit and operates perfect at a fraction of the cost!
B004AJ0AP2|3|This is definitely a good price compared to the price of the original coil ($100).  It had been 1 month and it's still working.  I would have rated it 5 stars if I did not run into this problem:<br />I have the Acura Integra 2000; when I tried to install this part, it would not fit; the part seems slightly bigger than the coil compartment.  I was getting frustrated trying to find out where the problem is.  Turned out that the metal shield (the shell that enclosed most of the coil) is out of tolerance and it would not slide into the compartment.<br />I had to removed the metal shield from the new part and replaced it with the shield from the original Acura coil then everything went smoothly
B0006JJ588|3|Works satisfactory
B007QQO3YU|4|Love it works great.
B000M6XNXI|5|Great development on my FJ CRUISER .. Great deal !

B00C6MWEEU|5|Good oem style torque mount
B00JNI6VXA|5|This is my second item from this seller.  Would definitely recommend! Their warranty is second to none!  The spoiler looks really nice and adds that sporty look.  Great product.
B000VZ9CKS|5|Great must have for off-road motorcycle
B00NB8MDCQ|5|Looked and felt just like OEM. I'm over these OEM part prices after finding such inexpensive parts on here, that get the job done and cost just a fraction of these absurd OEM prices.
B000V55NAQ|5|Works great
B00RM26FVC|5|Nice quality keychain. My son just learned how to drive a stick shift and this is a nice little gadget to remind him that he succeeded! It was also delivered in a timely manner.
B00B9XDLVC|2|Closed  container  came 1/2 gallon short
B002LGEMOQ|5|nice unit.  make sure your cables are close to the battery source so you do not loose amperage.  Works so well, I am converting my 2x12v batteries to a 2x6v (series) for additional ah
B00C9QXO38|5|If you're looking to install this system, I recommend adding to your cart some 12V hookup wire and some screw-on wire connectors.  The cable for the power might be on the short side, and the twist-on wire connectors are just the only way to go if you don't want to get solder burns all over the inside of your trunk.  Having a longer cable will help you stash your system further back in the liner of your trunk, protecting it from the elements, moisture, and physical damage.<br /><br />If you're a total novice to electrical work (like I was when I started), just follow this easy way to get the system installed: use a knife to scrape away the insulation on the wire to your reverse lights (do not break or cut the actual wire) to expose the metal, and then wrap each lead of your hookup wire around the exposed metal of the respective wire, so you make like a T-junction on each of the wires.  Gather the three pieces of insulation coming out of this junction together and just twist on the connector.  Make sure you line up black to black and red/green to red/green.  Do the same to the cable that came with the box, where you'll need another two connectors: red to red, black to black.  Your system is all hooked up to the reverse lights.<br /><br />If you want to test your system, just put the key in the charge position (like the position right before you start to crank the car), apply the handbrake and put it in reverse.  The reverse lights should come on, and so should your system.  If you haven't installed the display and system, just plug them into the box sitting in the trunk and make sure it turns on.<br /><br />I actually bought this to replace a faulty sensor from the same manufacturer (after years of service) and to have some spare parts. I'm not bent out of shape bringing the cost to $35-ish.  This is just a must have for anyone that frequently backs into spots, but doesn't want a clunky backup camera display or to pay $500 for an aftermarket stereo/display.<br /><br />This system seriously works better than some commercial systems that come with cars.  I hear problems that include some VWs that have sensors on the front that beep when you're backing out of your garage (why the sensors on the front of the car activate when you're in reverse is seriously beyond me), and also some that flip on randomly driving down the highway that shut off the stereo, making listening to the radio unlistenable.<br /><br />With this system you get none of that. If you wire it yourself, then you know it's good and it's not some clunky over-engineered system.  If your reverse lights are on, this system is on.  If the lights are off, so is the system.  There's no guesswork and it's cool to get to install a system like this yourself.  It took me probably 3 sessions of 1-2hrs because I was totally clueless and also it was like sub-zero temperature (not good timing on my part).  Now if someone asked me to install it on an average fall day it would take me 2 hours at the most.  Really worth the cost of the system and you learn a lot about wiring, bumper covers, and interior panels.  Really recommend.  Good luck!
B00067BVKK|5|Product arrived on time and very well packaged.  I have used these bulbs in the past and they have always performed well.  They are brighter than original equuipment bulbs yet are still perfectly street legal.  They are a nice balance between output, price, and longevity as the brighter and hotter a bulb burns the less of a life span it will have all things being equal. Bulb tint is quite white (no yellow incandescant look) and there may be just a touch of blue in there.  I would place the tint in the 3,500 to 4,500 range.  You MUST not touch the bulbs themselves suring installation and avoid any accidental contact with the headlamp housing or any other component during the installation process.
B008025186|5|This stuff is awesome.  It is a great touch up wax.  I don't spray it.  I shake the bottle, then place the applicator on the bottle and turn upside down once or twice.  That is enough product to do one whole panel.  It goes on easy and after letting haze, comes right off.  Perfect for after the third or fourth wash to keep the car looking great!
B003LIRKLA|4|Had to purchase wheel spacer and longer lugs so my wheels would not hit the calipers
B00ZMWBKHI|5|Great sticker.  It's a prefect fit on my laptop cover.  The seller sent it quickly. It's real cool.  Very happy with it.
B001GLOZ6M|5|This works really well. Not too thin and flimsy. Goes on easily and has great colors.
B000BQOO0U|1|I got this as a replacement for a similar but old plug-in cooler my family had.  Not sure if mine was a dud or indicative of all of the Wagan colors, but it failed to keep my refrigerated items cool for a 3-hour car ride.  Sent it back for a refund.
B005NLQAHS|5|This is a nice device. I should have had one a long time ago.
B000SBCHCA|5|well I get the product thanks and regards
B001L47RIM|4|My wife's VW runs great, starts easy and looks good with the Webber carb.  It was necessary to clearance the manifold in a couple of areas and reshape the heat tubes slightly to get everything to fit.
B008ESJFYM|5|Looks 1:1 as the factory light which we replaced. Would buy again
B001O0AMZ8|5|it was cheaper to buy replacements locks when the key to the old locks started wearing out when buy replacement bolts.  with the car now being 8 years old the rims aren't worth stealing anymore.

B003DMFDM2|3|Hardware was junk. Needed to replace many screwed with came loose easy or could not be easily tightened. With new screws and the Tacoma adaptor kit this works fine on my 2007 Tacoma pre runner.
B009DK1MF0|5|Replaced broken handle and worked perfectly.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Very easy to replace old jacks and install these. Used existing holes in metal. Used self starting screws as additional support. Much larger and much heavier/thicker metal. The threaded bolt that actually lifts the unit is 1/2&#34; in diameter. Very easy to install, looks great! I can sleep better now.
B007ZGD0J0|5|I loved this upgrade on my 2006 WRX Limited.  It fixes the wrx's horrible problem with understeer!  I started by installing the rear only.  It would not understeer at all!  The front body roll was still there, but it dug so hard I thought my rim would hit the ground.  Adding the front sway provided the balanced handling I was after.  FYI, you do have to remove the cross member support and front subframe to reach one bolt.  Don't let that turn you off, it's just a dozen bolts and it comes off.  What they don't say anywhere is that the end links, front and rear, are included!  The bushings in the endlinks were soft.  I'm not sure they were poly.  Since some of  these reviews get used on other parts, I ordered this : 7714.320.  Serious thanks to Eibach! Ownership: 1 week.  Tools: I used ramps, 12,14x2,17mm
B0021UMTZQ|5|Super glue with a filler.
B007NZOALK|5|Nice
B004A0XHRE|4|This is a very nice tool box.  When it arrived it was dented and paint was chipped doesn't look new at all. It fits my 2005 Ford Ranger well.  What I didn't like was all the dents. When you buy something new it should look new or bring the price down.
B0049CXSNQ|5|these look like great rotors so I cant give a negative review. They are painted black everywhere except the pad contact area and have a great looking machined &#34;grinded disk&#34; looking pattern but they DID NOT fit my application. Pay attention, these are for the Honda accord COUPE and not the accord V6 (CD5 1994-1998). I have no idea if they fit the 4 cylinder 4 door though. Double tripple check before ordering.
B0063CU52M|5|looks great goes on to stay
B004713BR2|5|Prompt delivery and item is as described. Worked perfectly to install a lift system on my RV bed. This site has perfect instructions for many different types of bed lift situations http://www.hatchlift.com/bedlift-kits-installation.
B00L3FNG34|4|It looks nice, but it was surprisingly thin compare to my old Progrip protector that i bee using for the last 5 years.  The old one  was twice as thick, I am not saying it's a good or bad thing, maybe the new material does not need to be this thick.  Just giving you guys a heads up it's pretty thin.
B0012RJZT2|5|Installed in Minutes, worked perfectly for my 2004 jeep wrangler X!. I would definitely recommend!
B00BYVWHN2|5|They fit my 2013 hyundai elantra perfectly and at a much better price than my local auto parts store.
B001AWE53U|5|I wear these things out pretty fast..... Can't say that these will last any longer that any others, but they seem pretty sturdy.
B00NAFL362|5|Very well made, heavy duty leather.  Well stitched.  Single panel back for patching.  Snaps all work well and heavy duty.  Heavy duty zipper in front, as well.  Definitely order 1 size larger.  I measured my chest and ordered +2 inches, which took me from Medium to Large.  It's a little longer than I would like (I'm 5'6&#34; and it comes about to the top of my jeans pockets); HOWEVER, when zipped up, it fits snug with about a fist distance between the vest and my body.  Also, even zipped and snapped, I can sit on my bike and not have the top of the vest choking me.  If you want to use to conceal a weapon, make sure you do the + 2 inches or go 1 size larger, otherwise, the fit will be too snug and show an outline, I'm guessing.  I'm glad I went 1 size larger with a Large instead of Medium (5'6&#34; and 165lbs).  If you want a really tight and snug fit, then probably order your original size but if you want some breathing room or to use the inside pockets-go at least 1 larger.  If I wear over my leather jacket, then I plan on using my snap chains so I don't have to worry about closing the vest.
B005U9JFSY|4|Love the design on the sun shade. Has suction to help keep the shade in place.

B003CMR9A2|5|tried first at Lake Mead. They float!, stay on while boating at high speeds. great deal for the price!
B00NGOMXWA|5|Very happy with this product.  I had broken my lower convex mirror on my 2007 Tundra and thought I was going to have to buy the whole towing mirror to replace it.  Toyota wanted something like $250 for the mirror and the of course pay to have it installed or do it yourself.  Found several aftermarket replacement mirrors for around $125 bucks where I could of done the installation but who knows if they would of perfectly match or not.  Happen to find this mirror as a replacement.  Package came within 2-3 days and following the easy instructions on the back of the box I was able to replace the mirror on my truck and couldn't be happier.  Very happy to have my mirror repaired.  Highly recommend.  Good job.
B00V5GYUPO|5|I got the opportunity to purchase this ash tray at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Its hard to find just a plan plastic ash tray. Most of them they make now are made of heavy materials, are not one solid color, and are hard to clean. But this ash tray is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use.  My husband smokes outside and when we have company over they always try to throw their cigarette butts in the yard and I spend a lot of time cleaning up after them. But this ash tray is a good size, it can hold quite a bit. Its not heavy or made of breakable material so if it falls there is no worrying about it breaking. And finally since it is plastic and there aren't a lot of nooks and crannies, it is super easy to clean.  Whether you are a smoker or you just need to have an ash tray around for company this is great. Its can be left outside or it can be kept indoors. Since I'm a non-smoker I really didn't want to pay a lot for an ash tray. This ash tray is a lot of quality for a small price.
B0083Z2S7M|3|There's a lot of play in the knob itself, and the clamp simply will not actually hold it in place on my F-150's wheel, it constantly wants to rotate. But it's held together without any drama, so there's that.

B00LNGSVIS|3|Cheap set,  you get what you pay for
B004ZF4MW8|5|Love these! I used these to replace my OEM fog lights and the 6000K makes it looks like factory. Also used another set from the same brand for my high beams.
B00NWT4FR0|5|Fits perfectly on my 2001 Hyundai Accent clutch pedal. Nice and rubbery so my foot doesn't slide off.
B00M78820I|5|Great quality and price. Works great!
B003ZOH63W|5|Arrived in great shape and very quickly. Worked better than expected. Thanks
B00PJPHEBO|4|Mine works adequately, meaning I've tested it with a '98 Ford Taurus and it gave me meaningful data. I've tried two different free Android apps on my phone and two different free Windows apps on my laptop and in all four cases was able to connect over Bluetooth and retrieve data from the scanner just fine. The information I retrieved was limited, but I think that just because I was testing with an older car and I tested only with free software.  With what I had, I was able to view just troubleshooting codes and a few items of basic data, such as engine RPM and temperature, but that was all I needed anyway.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|a little big, but very good lock!

B00WNGV0WG|5|Wow what a great idea and fantastic product , this is perfect for any little traveler in your car.<br />I would have given anything for one of these when my kids were young , for all our long travel adventures .<br />I got this for my granddaughter , she loves to color and play lego while we are in the car.<br />This is truly remarkable , it fits perfectly over he carseat .This gives her such a large space to play , this is also great for when she is eating in the car.<br />This also has great side pockets for her to keep things in, like extra toys or her crayons etc.<br />This is so easy to use, and it folds small making it easy to store when not in use .<br /><br />I highly recommend this great carseat table ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

B000QJMYPE|5|This cat back is awesome!  It sounds really good on the 4.6L.  The other reviews were right if it's loud in the cab you have a leak, mine was also where to old pipe meets the new.  The cheap clamp stripped, $2 for a new one and no more leak.  You can tell you also have a leak by black soot at the joint after a few days of driving it.  It seems to have improved gas milage and acceleration I have no proof but my truck is running great.  I may nevef drive a stock exhaust again.

B001TXIT0U|4|Was installing this on my 1999 DR350. Took a long time, and ended up needing to get a male to male fuel line adapter. Like somebody else mentioned, for 200+ dollars, you really should get steel petcock levers. One of my lines has a air bubble in it that I can't seem to get out, that is probably just user error though. Great tank, my only complaint is the plastic petcock levers.
B000VAZ8L0|5|I installed this EGR solenoid, EGR sensor and new rubber tubes in my 2002 Ford F150 in order to solve a longstanding and annoying vacuum problem.  The parts arrived quickly and fit perfectly.  It was pretty easy, even though I'm no mechanic.  The vacuum problem caused the AC to blow through the defrost vents, when the engine was under stress such as accelerating up hill.  The problem has stopped after I installed these parts.  I don't know whether one of the parts would have solved the problem alone; the price was right and the install was easy so I did all three of them.<br /><br />I think the vacuum issue is pretty common among these Fords.  I'd searched a long time for a solution.  I was glad to find the right parts on Amazon.  Thanks!

B000CIT3BW|5|I mean they are bullets. They sound fantastic, they have a deep pissed off tone. Ours are mated to a AMC 304V8 punched out to 310ci with a comp 260EX cam , long tube headers, H pipe, and the bullets. Sound is very muscle car, very 60 or 70s street machine. The longer 18&#34; bullets are actually pretty good for cruising. They are loud on the pipe, and not super loud at idle or cruising. I mean you can hear them for sure. But its not crazy.

B0023QHR2S|5|GOOD
B00DNOJ7NQ|5|The car cover fits like a glove on the family's CR-V. Once you figure out how to get the slot for the antenna on the back part of the roof, the cover slips right onto the side mirrors and then the front of the CR-V. I only used the cover to protect the car from falling fireworks powder during the Fourth of July and despite my concerns with the material being potentially flammable the car cover came out with flying colors. My only real gripe with the car cover is putting it away for next year, it's not exactly the smallest or easiest thing to fold up and put away. I would definitely give this car cover a buy for Honda CR-V owners.

B008U15PD8|3|This is not a bolt on repair!!!  You must desolder the old reg and resolder the new  one in. If you do not have these skills or tools, look elsewhere!!!<br />Pay attention to where the leads go and take a lot of pictures. On the plus side, it certainly took care of the charging problems on my '91 FJ1200. Also, look at all electrical plugs/connectors since the increased voltage of a bad regulator has probably melted several of these connections. For sure look at fuel pump, headlight, and starter connectors...

B00GI9UNS6|5|Matches my 2009 MDX bumper perfectly & it was easy to install.
B00480BWCI|5|Super simple leveling

B0006ZFRQG|5|awesome Amazon seller! A++++++++
B00RSM6ZLQ|5|Getting into our 5th wheel was becoming difficult.  The outer handle, was outside and once on top step, it did not really assist anymore.  Got this thing and installed it inside door to the right when ascending the steps.  Immediately, the little lady (who was skeptical) commented on how much easier it was to enter and when leaving as well.  Strong and not really in the way.  Great product!
B00Q5E4LV4|5|This earth air optimum health car air purifier that i received in exchange for my honeat review is cool. Barely even know it's there. I stopped smoking over a ago so the only smells in my car are my adventures. Sometimes wet clothing is left, or my gym shoes, or leftover food stays in my car and the heat brings the smell out. I don't know exactly how it works but after a night of it being plugged and the items removed the smell is gone. There's no sound that comes from it, just a pretty blue light. It's super simple, just plug it into the lighter outlet and done. It's not something you notice right away but there is a difference, or its just me.
B002805OCO|5|Well, they are wheel locks, not much else to say about them.  The price was right, shipping was super fast with &#34;Prime&#34; and they look great on our 80 Vette.  We purchased the matching set of lug nuts so these would not stand out so much and they really don't.  Actually, you cannot tell they are on there unless you get up close to view them.<br /><br />They look great, seem like they will last a while as they feel well made, and arrived quickly,
B0009JKI6I|5|PUT THE LAST ONE ON TRUCK YESTERDAY!! FAST SERVICE A+A+A+A+
B00ZGHT0IA|5|Great product, fits well, at first it felt kinda cheap but after I installed the grill and the vent guard in it, it felt stronger and more sturdy.
B00IICYTDG|4|fit like as old ring
B00BCRM9RM|4|I bought these for my daughter's car. Currently, she's got blankets on her seats because she has a dog that likes to travel with her. They definitely seem to collect the hair, but that just means they're protecting her seats, which is kind of the entire purpose of having them. Fortunately they're easily washed. I really like that it's an entire set. So many times you can get the front seats, or just the back seats. It's hard to find all of them without spending a fortune. I also found them to be relatively easy to put on. They fit well and they really do look great. They are made of like a thin foamy material, so you want to be careful putting them on. You don't want to rip them when you stretch them. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
B00CFOKXM4|5|good batteries, hold good charge - scooter back in service
B00R7QTQ6O|4|if you are working with paint, glue, oil, etc., these work great. If you're doing anything that requires force, tools, material handling, then get something thicker. These will rip when force is applied. Still, i use these all the time for handling fluids and I like this brand a lot for that application.
B00ZR5J66M|5|Very nice ,Perfect for what I need.
B000C9EJO2|5|Fixed the service engine light issue I had for months
B000143LHY|5|As a person who has a hard time struggle with smoking its good to know products like Ozium can help get rid of some odors. I spray the Ozium at my air purifiers and they in turn help spread the scent around. I also use it in my car as well to spray the vents and then turn up the air conditioning.
B0029XK1VO|4|Looks great but using the water made a mess of things.  The letters did not want to stick and I got so frustrated I almost threw the whole thing away.  I bought two others, Army mom and Army dad and applied those to a dry window and they worked out MUCH better!
B006EGAIII|5|These work great
B009ZIMXLW|5|Looks good in my truck. Shipped fast and easy install.
B003V9UU66|5|good buy
B001ACQR4K|4|Not a bad top overall. It is a little baggy but I put a broomstick in a pool noodle and put it between the roll bar and top above the driver and passenger seats. Works great so far.
B00LKXJ3DQ|5|Works well with my iPhone 5 and DashCommand
B008KKN6WQ|5|Fit perfectly. No problems at all
B00BI2APMW|5|Does what it says. Works well on my 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX. I bought it because I got a check engine light and wanted to clear it to see if it would come back. I was able to read the code and confirm it was what autozone said, and erase the code.  The live data is pretty cool, I'm no professional so I don't know what most of the numbers are about. User interface is easy enough and the display is backlit and easy to read.  If you're a weekend warrior looking for a cheap OBDII reader, look no further. I've been happy with this so far.  PS... The connector is a little finicky on my car. I do have to wiggle it a bit to make sure there is a good connection before the reader will load properly. Not sure if this is because of the reader or the jack on my car, but it's not a huge deal.
B00ZL3HTK0|5|do not look like after market products. Very clean design and easy installation.
B000CNKUGO|4|Nice assortment at a fair price
B001Q4QO2C|5|Good product on time delivery
B007USCM7E|1|gauge is cheap plastic held together by small screws. It could not be removed from the spent can of refrigerant.  Glad I bought this from brick and mortar store who took it back.  If you look at the better gauges, the part that screws down into the tank is not two pieces of plastic held together by two screws, it's a single, threaded, molded piece. I'll go that way next time, perhaps even the $22 gauge from A/C pro.  Refrigerant, oil, and leak stop elements were fine though.  The refrigerant (with varying additives) is pricey compared to it's competitors.<br /><br />the videos from AC pro on youtube are very helpful.  If your car is a 1994 model year or newwer it should already be equiped with and fitted for 134a.  If it's not leaking. this is an easy fix but you must compensate for ambient temperature.  I drive a Subaru, and had to replace a single o-ring that was leaking.  Still an easy fix.
B000XQ9MGE|5|Used for the first time this weekend to move a couple of parked cars that sat through winter, was able to boost both of them a couple time a piece and one has no belt so I ran it off this pack. Clamps had a hard time with small GM style battery posts but most do
B001O7PNS2|5|For a spray on wax I excepted it to be &#34;meh,&#34; but I was surprised how well it held up, especially in the rain.
B006VFEJJQ|5|Arrived quickly, installed easily, works perfectly.
B00NP9DYCY|1|Will not completely place over site post and on my russian 1942 M44. Screwa are off as well and once on the rifle the break won't come off
B00J6B2O0I|5|very nice looking hat
B00GBRG4TC|5|Fit in no problems. Would bye another at this price.
B000CIPHUI|5|Great product that works awesome. No more run down batteries.
B00ENKGQOM|5|Purchased these for my boyfriend for his truck and they are working perfect. Hi struck is definitely a head turner. They are currently on his truck and he hasn't had a problem out of them at all.
B008G3KG2U|1|Never even installed them. Was transferring hardware and had tab break off. Will be buying oem next time
B000CEE62W|5|Makes parking in the garage easy! Nice robust product that more than past the test under a Toyota 4 Runner.
B004ZF3YD6|5|Great job, items were just like the ones I ordered on line, fast shipping.
B00BAOJEMK|5|I received bulbs and covers quickly from Orange Custom Cycles. Received the correct front two prong bulbs and one prong rear bulbs. The covers snapped into place with no problems and look great on a 2002 Dyna lowrider.<br /><br />Excellent price and shipping time.
B00DTXUS9I|4|i loved the S4 series from AGV; affordable, functional helmets with some superb classic paint designs.  i owned 3 of them over the years. the S4 had two major flaws:  1.  they stopped making them 2. the chin guard was poorly designed, even an extra large helmet had my chin often resting against the guard.  there was always a thought at the back of my had about what would happen if i crashed and made contact chin first...  but speaking of crashing, i crashed several times in the S4 and my noggin was very well protected.  this new series of helmets corrects the S4's chin guard issue - ample ample space exists there now, has some even nicer designs (tho i really do miss the matte finish options) and i really like the inclusion of the internal sun visor.  the only reason i can't give this lid 5 stars is that it's pretty noisy.  there's a cavity around the ears (a plus when you wear earbuds that stick out) but it amplifies the wind noise.  also, if you move your head around during a ride, your earplugs/earbuds might even get loose augmenting the noise problem.  still, it's light, very comfortable to wear, the shield is very cleverly attached and easily removed and the build quality is fantastic.  and the new chin straps are really fantastic.
B00F7GYU3A|2|Terrible quality. Basically someone just printed these on a home inkjet printer with label stickers. The one I received was not only printed crooked, but the ink print quality was aweful.
B004KV8LNS|1|DOES NOT FIT!!!!
B002UUYOPU|5|Very well made.  Easy to remove upper part if you want to.  Opens very nicely in the two different positions.  Affects view some, but just what I was looking for
B005IZ170Y|5|Must Have Item.
B00EB3Y062|5|GOOD
B00295T65Y|2|Two stars because it does look nice, however there are many shortcomings of this product and the directions.<br /><br />1. This says it is a spatter paint - it is really a spatter covering that will cover whatever existing paint you have down. This is not stated on the label and I had to wipe a large section off and paint it then re-apply the spatter paint.<br />2. This spatter paint is not water resistant. If it gets wet - even after I coated it with clear - it will wipe off.  Again none of this is stated on the label.<br /><br />Although it does look nice I am unhappy with the lack of specific and clear directions as well as its durability.  I would not recommend this nor will I most likely be using any Dupli-Color products again.
B00HZX4OPM|4|Ive had these lights for several months now. Didn't have any problems until now. The license plate light kept flickering and looked bad, so I had to switch it out with the stock bulb. Other than that the interior lights and trunk lights work great and really brighten up the car.
B0041EBSX4|5|Prompt delivery and item is as described. Worked perfectly to install a lift system on my RV bed. This site has perfect instructions for many different types of bed lift situations http://www.hatchlift.com/bedlift-kits-installation.
B005IPR9LA|4|This is a very nice rack, but a little tight for using with a round fuel jug
B000E7BBL6|5|16AWG Ground . 18 AWG Left Turn, Right Turn,Brake,  Markings clearly stenciled every few inches.
B00GMM9AUG|5|Without the strap, they fit like a standard pair of sunglasses.  With the strap they fit perfectly and snug, which is exactly what I was looking for to keep dust out of my eyes.  They seem durable enough if taken care of as I would with any pair of sunglasses.  I like them enough to have bought a 2nd pair of a different color.
B0007RVLOU|5|AWESOME PRODUCT! Give my tires that shiny showroom finish with very little &#34;sling&#34;. It's long lasting & running through a little water puddle doesn't wash it off. Will DEFINETELY purchase again.
