B000001EIA|2.0|At first you got a good impression from this album, if youre a real KISS fan, like myself. You like the new versions, find they to be &quot;nice&quot;. THen, you sudden realize how empty this initiative was, totally imersed in commercial interests together with MTV. All of a sudden, you realize that this was not a product deigned to please the fans or the deliver goo dmusic; it was just a last breath of air to earn some more money. Advertising Criss and Frehley back, when they only fature in three songs, was also a swindle. Very disappointing...
6305609705|5.0|It is just that.The very thing that would drive a man insane.This is a good question..You have to agree with Kurtz (brando)This film will hit you right in the face,right where it hurts...whether you want it to or not.<br />&quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning...That smell,that gasoline smell....It smells like...victory.&quot;  Robert duvall
B00004Z459|5.0|This is by far one of the best cd's I have EVER LISTENED TO. It is full with catchy melodies and all of these songs are CONSISTENTLY Great. Too bad MTV doesnt play there videos too much. In a time of napster and filesharing utilities, this cd deserves to be bought. You arent jsut buying one song, you are actually buying it for the whole cd. I cant wait for there next cd to come out. I hope they dont lose their touch and become sell outs.
0790729601|5.0|this movie is tight from beginning to end. i love this movie. it has action,comedy, and drama all in one movie. rent or buy this movie.
B00000BKDS|5.0|What theses guys achieved in this album is unique, very rare. Obviously lacking a good producer ( WIll Malone did the job ), even in this way the songs shine in their own way, energetic, fast, sometimes a little bit punk, with Dianno singing like never before or after in his career. The lyrics were a little bit silly in those days, something that they improved as time passed by. Band line-up here: Dianno - vocals; Murray - guitar, Denis Stratton - guitar; HArris - bass; Clive Burr - drums
B00003CXB2|5.0|I will not write what so  may have written so i will just say that this is a true masterpiece.Great direction,great acting,great script..just a fantastic piece of art.This film is now immortal like so many others (ben-hur,Spartacus etc..) on dvd.Time will not fade this one away now.I'm 24...I assume many of us our in this age bracket...This film,like the others are here...We can see the greatest films ever made now..Films made before our time,Films that we owe it to ourselves to see.
0780622553|2.0|I had heard so many good things about this movie and the preview to this movie fascinated me so much.  I was surprised when I saw it.  This movie has incomprable visual beauty.  This may very well be the most visually amazing movie since Kubrick's 2001.  But the characters and the plot fall so short that it just fails as a movie.  At the heart of the movie is a very thought-provoking question: &quot;what is the constituent of a soul?&quot; or &quot;how is a Self created? if there is such a thing.&quot;  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really engage this question, it doesn't take it anywhere.  Blade Runner (the director's cut is great, the original is worthless) takes this question much further and really explores it, and it doesn't posit it with such obviousness.  Simply, there's a lot more to Blade Runner as a philosophical journey than Dark City.  This movie tries to be philosophical, but in the end isn't (just like Ayn Rand).<br /> Frankly, this movie's trailers really showcased the movies strengths better than the movie itself: its dark, brooding beauty and uniqueness.  But you still might want to watch the movie once just to be sure, but don't be surprised if any post-movie philosophical discussion with your friends about the movie comes up a bust.
B000023VR6|5.0|this is probably my fvorite album i have. every song on it is great. special appearances also make the album great by snoop dogg,xzibit,eminem,nate dogg,mel man,kurupt and many more. i highly recomend you buy this if you dont already have it.
B00000BKDY|4.0|THe simple truth is: everything Maiden released from &quot;IRON MAIDEN&quot; up until &quot;SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON&quot; (seven studio albuns) is classic,above average metal, the kind of stuff that put them where they belonged - rock stardom. Everything after SEVENTH SON (five albuns - with the exception of BRAVE NEW WORLD) is second-class material, clearly inferior to the time when they possessed Adrian Smith stil on board. So, this SOMEWHERE IN TIME belongs to the &quot;good time&quot; and, accordingly, is a masterpiece. Just that.
6304779607|3.0|Yes,it is dumb,the plot sucks,the acting sucks,there is no suspense despite what other reviewers say.And,quite obviously the screenplay sucked..I own this on dvd because i love fun movies and this is one of those...People,This is not ben-hur or Citizen Kane.....just a fun,stupid movie.<br />The dialogue that deals with society is pretty good...but it barely scratches the surface of things.This was a vehicle for &quot;Brigitte Neilsen&quot;  who is not a very good actress in my opinion.The love scene is absolutely horrendus(How could she fall for a guy who deliberately puts her in danger?)<br />Not bad picture on the dvd in component video,but the sound is awful even with 2 sub-woofers.<br />A laughable commentary track by George P. Cosmatos..Very slow and he seems to get real bored all of a sudden so decides to tell us that he likes pepsi and gummi bears....Now,he's a good director but this was a poor job and he knows it.<br />But for guys and girls who like fun movies...go ahead and buy it,you'll like it.<br />A.P.L
B00003CWNR|2.0|but don't be fooled. This movie is a two hour cleverly/not so cleverly disquised pro-abortion advertisement. If this bothers you avoid it. Had this film been set in current times instead of the 1930's it would be ever so obvious. I was not so much offended by it as I was troubled. This is not a family film. It explores three different excuses for abortion: woman's right to choose, if abortion is not legal women will harm themselves and  a case of pregancy as a result of rape/incest also included are the plight of orphans and the pain of a woman giving her baby up for adoption. So be forwarned and unless you are very pro-abortion and want to pass that on to your kids stay away from this film.
B000001DVD|4.0|THis is better than PYROMANIA or HYSTERIA. Leppards second album, produced by Mutt Lange, is fresh and aggressive, altough melodic. All the tunes are killers, simply put. I love this album, listen to it always, so great it is !!!
0792838068|5.0|Nicolas Cage's character, as a drunkard who is on the verge of suicide, is so sad and pathetic, it's funny. Elizabeth Shue is a cutie. I see why so many people recommend it; it is good as ...!
B000053VAF|5.0|I saw this film in the theater, then I saw it on DVD, but I waited until this special edition came out before I bought it.  I'm glad I did.<br />The Special Edition is great from the start.  The cover art is amazing, but the new design for the disks, which also happen to match with the DVD menus are hilarious!<br />Of course, with any Special Edition created by View Askew and Kevin Smith, there are lots of goodies such as deleted scenes, and outtakes.  You are also treated to some commentary by Kevin and other people involved in the film (again just as in any other Special Edition by Mr. Smith).  Most of which is praising you for your wise choice in purchasing this special edition, and scorning those who did not.<br />All in all, this DVD is well worth the few extra bucks over the regular Dogma DVD.
B000003C4K|4.0|BONDED BY BLOOD is epic. MArked by furious riffing, amazing lyrics, great singing, high energy, it's a benchmark for thrash metal of the eighties. Band line-up her: Paul Ballof - vocals; Gary Holt - guitar; Rick Hunolt - guitar; Rob McKillop - bass; Tom Hunting - drums
B00003CWL6|5.0|-This film is highly realistic, intense, sad and disturbing. Many people (parents and females) found this film very profound for it's 'family issues', 'nudity/ cursing' and 'views on suburban families'. Every family is dysfunctional in their own way. Some just hide their flaws better than others. This film proves it well. From a dad who wants his life back and a money hungry, cheating wife to teenagers who suffer from 'massive psychological damage' and closet-homosexual nutcases from the military who beat the hell out of their children; you don't know which one is more disturbing. Kevin Spacey plays as a middle-aged father who is unhappy in his marriage/ family life and he finds out the true meaning of life at the last minute; to have a good time.
B00003CXSM|4.0|This movie left me smiling and feeling all warm inside. Sure, it was kind of sappy.  But the acting talents of both Lopez and McConaughey made it a film well worth watching.  Lopez is witty and cute and the quiet, handsome romantic side of McConaughey leaves virtually any woman swooning.  This love story is one of those that makes you giggle and &quot;awwwww&quot; but leaves you with a good feeling in the end.  For once, a story that works out the way everyone wants it too!! :)
B0000549B0|5.0|I'm 19 years old and I'm not particularly interested in old movies. But this movie is great no matter how old it is! It would be a shame for anyone to pass this movie up just because it isn't highly commercialized or the most popular movie being watched right now. I can't think of anyone who could watch &quot;Harvey&quot; and not be able to walk away from the movie happier.    &quot;Harvey&quot; has a charm to it that you can't find in any other movie. It's so innocent and clean ,and it has a style of humor all it's own. Not only will this movie keep you entertained and interested ,but it will also leave you feeling good. It's something that you never get to experience with any sort of movie today.
0792844882|5.0|This is the only American T&amp;A film that is worth having in one's film library. This is powerful to me, while others think it's a waste of time. Elizabeth Berkley (Saved By The Bell) is so beautiful, and she shows 'us' what she's got in this film. I must advise people, who haven't seen this film, that the most nasty, disturbing rape scene is in this film that involves a pop singer, his bodyguards and a female fan of his. This is not a film that is just filled with nudity and 'cheap shots'. This is a drama about stripping, 'adult' entertainment and the lifestyles of the 'rich and shameless' in Las Vegas.
0380973650|4.0|This is the first work by Mr. Neil Gaiman that I have read. From this point on he will be an Author that I will read when he again publishes, further I will backtrack to read his earlier work. The concept of, \\"American Gods\\", is incredibly sweeping in both breadth and depth, and had he chose, he could have used a few hundred more pages to tell his tale. I wish that he had, as there are so many religions and mythologies that participate, the book is a bit overwhelming.<br />When an Author creates a new world from whole cloth or conjures a variant on the world we know, the reader has to be given enough reference points and background to fully get immersed into his book. This is the only issue that I had with what is otherwise a thought-provoking, literate, and intelligently crafted book. It was mentioned that one reader used a book on mythology as a guide, and when I read this again I will use the same type of assist. There are literally dozens and dozens of, \\"Gods\\", that are a part of the action. A few will be familiar and understood, a few more will be recognized with some general knowledge, and others are totally unknown unless the reader has studied the fields the Author clearly studied himself. Even when some of the characters are thought to be familiar, they turn out to be infinitely more complex than the traditional view the reader probably has.<br />If the Author gave more background on his characters the book would have substantially increased in length. He is a skillful writer so I don't see why that would have been an issue. There are other young writers creating massive works of fiction, and they have demonstrated that it can be done without losing the urgency that keeps one up most of the night flipping pages.<br />As I said earlier this Author can create and execute on the page. Maybe I am in the minority when it comes to expansive knowledge of cultural lore. I do know that if I had the understanding or was given more information in the book, I would have gotten even more pleasure from what is already a great book.e gotten even more pleasure from what is already a great book.
0783225970|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 11, and I felt like this was so cool. Actually, this is THE best gangster movie ever made, while the rest are just typical, ordinary gangland films. Al Pacino plays as a up-and-coming Hispanic drug dealer who has to make a lot of stupid decisions to get rich. His ignorance gets him and everyone else around him to ruination or death. 'Say hello to my lil friend!' Tony Montana rules!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Answering radiobjork's question, the music on the trailer is from Moby and can be found on his album Play.
6304602979|5.0|THE best action movie, ever! Forget 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Desperado'!
0345350499|3.0|This book is worth reading. Personally, I prefer Agori's view of the Grail in Defenders of the Holy Grail. Agori also honors women and has 2 heroines. However &quot;Mist&quot; is a harder read, and rquires much more time to get through. Mists is somewhat judgemental, but will make you think. Why do we have myths? Whay are we here?
6305313687|5.0|Racism still exists. I can understand people's reasons for not liking other ethnicities (people) because of the way they go about doing things, this story about a young man who turns into a bigot after his father was killed by Black thugs; this story is too true to be good. I think Edward Norton played this role as a White supremacist is his best.
014028009X|2.0|This is funny but depressing. For more promise, look elsewhere. PErhaps the heroines in Defemders of the Holy Grail. Thet are flawed but they OVERCOME
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|No Mercy, No Shame. That basically describes Scary Movie. If you have seen Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, then you already know the plot. but that's ok. It's better to have seen those movies in order to get the snappy jokes. Scary Movie goes way over the line on sick, toilet humor. But that's ok too. The film stars Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Marlon Wayons, and Carmen Electra. While shameless and over the line, I found Scary Movie completely entertaining, and extremely hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. Other films that get spoofed are The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Baywatch, Halloween, and the Wazzuuup! commercial.<br />           When Drew (Carmen Electra) is brutally murdered, four teens seem to think that the murder has something to do with the person they hit, and dumped in the river last Halloween. They also seem to think the killer is among them. Soon after, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) recieves a letter that says: I Know What You Did Last Halloween!  Later, Cindy is stalked by the killer who likes to kill, rap, and smoke pot. A truly funny movie that deserves the success that it has recieved.<br />Overall Grade: A (10++)
B00000FYPB|5.0|When Barry Lyndon was released, it was roundly panned by most of the critics, who called it slow and tedious. Yet I found it to be elegant, almost poetic in its pacing. I found my attention so riveted to the screen that I barely noticed the passage of time.<br />For any fan of Kubrick, all the qualities that characterize his best films can be found in Barry Lydon. The characters are drawn with great precision, and portrayed vividly. Each image, each scene is painted in crystal clear detail. There are no wasted scenes, no throwaway shots, not a bit of wasted dialogue. Everything there is there for a purpose.<br />If you haven't seen Barry Lyndon, rent it and form your own opinions. As for me, I think it ranks among the best of Kubrick's films, and among the best of all late 20th century films.
0380973650|5.0|This is an excellent book that really shows that talent of an artist.  I ran to the bookstore to purchase the book for myself and a bunch of my friends.  Though the size and heft is a little intimidating, the thrilling tale page by page keeps you guessing and wondering about what is going on aroung you.  Definately a book to battle the mundane.<br />I was a little disappointed in the end in regards to the usage of the symbolizim of the Christ and Father figure, not from a religious view point but because it has been used so many times.  I was really enjoying the new mythological concepts being introduced in the book.<br />This is a must 100% read and would make a great present for anyone.
0345350499|5.0|As I sense many of those who posted a review are women, I felt compelled to offer my thoughts.<br />A little preface: I read this book when I was in my early 30's. I am a college-educated professional, and a married heterosexual. I generally read non-fiction: political and military history and mountaineering literature. This book came up in a discussion with my wife, a published writer, who has read it several times and claimed it was one of her all-time favorites. As this is not slight praise from a woman who thinks Shakespeare was a lighweight compared to John Dunne, and actually argue the point!<br />So I picked up this book and read the first page. Quite a mistake. Three days later I finished this is not so small work having spent nearly every available non-working moment enthralled in this modern masterpiece. Simply put, it is very well written. It is a great story and it is well told. There is romance, fantasy, religion, war, politics, intrigue, and other elements to keep your attention. <br />I pity those who are so heavily invested in the &quot;accuracy&quot; of the Arthurian legend as to miss the beauty of this book. Doubly so for those who are too religiously dogmatic.
B000059S9M|5.0|Well here we go i thought many would slate this new feeder album for being too 'poppy' but quite frankly who cares everything is still here that made feeder so good.the quik guitars the wonderfull ballads.the best songs oin this have gotta be the power pop '7 days in the sun' the brilliant 'we can't rewind' and the moody 'under the weather' this album shows that feeder can rock with the best of them if this is pop then its like no pop i've ever heard
6304457383|5.0|This is a great thriller movie. I saw it the first time when it was first released and most of the women where screaming at the end of the movie and the men at the very least flinched several times. This movie is often unheard of by those born in the last twenty years. Even for them if they have any appreciation for older films like &quot;Psycho&quot; or &quot;Rear Window&quot; they should see this. Another to check out is &quot;Magic&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins long before his &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; fame. As so many have pointed out &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; is best viewed late at night with the lights off.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I had only heard of Travis through a Canadian music channel one day, pushing them out of my head the second i saw them. Then, after seeing them over and over while promoting their newest album, i decided to listen in on afew tracks on mtv.com and to my astonishment, i heard something VERY beautiful. It's comparisons to Radiohead are quite accurate and the Scottish singers' voice reminiscense is quite extraordinary. Listening to the simple strummings and the tite drums really keyed me in. It also seemed like most of the tracks could be used to give or possibly sing to one's partner. This album definately lived up to the hype it seemed to portray.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is probably my favorite album of all time. Every song is a classic. &quot;Perfection&quot; comes to mind in describing Moving Pictures. If you don't own this one your not a fan of RUSH. Order it now and you will be a fan for life, no doubt.
0140157352|5.0|For those individuals about to enter into a new job you need to first read this book.  I have been negotiation with my new employer for the past several monthes about higher salary and better benefits.  This book provided me with several key techniques to help my situation and I can attest the methods work.  I got the job of my dream and I would like to think the techniques I learned in this book helped me get there.
0345347951|5.0|This book is, without a doubt, the greatest book I have ever read, and possibly one of the greatest books ever written.  I picked this book out of the trashcan one day, since my high school's English department had decided not to teach this book anymore.  I absolutely could not put this book down, and finished it in one day.  Childhood's End is like a cabbage, intricately folded with one layer upon another, each unfolding layer of the story more fantastic and amazing than the last, until the final resolution, which will blow you away.       Clarke is undoubtedly a master craftsman working in his natural element.  His boundless imagination is coupled with his expert craftsmanship to create fantastic imagery and mind-boggling philosophy.  This is a life-changing book, which I recommend heartily to everyone.
B000006045|5.0|The genre that Massive Attack created is still new to me, so I'll be brief.  However, the darkness that pervades this album reminds me a lot of albums such as Joy Division's &quot;Closer&quot; and New Order's &quot;Still.&quot;  It's jarring, almost frightening, and without a doubt amazing.<br />It should also be noted that 'Angel,' which was used in the film Snatch, was the absolute perfect song to accompany the scene in which it was played.<br />I bought this on a whim, having always heard it was great and having always thought their name was really cool.  Certainly, this is the best whim-purchase I ever made.
B000002L75|5.0|This is of the better albums DM has put out. And the truth is the lesser-known songs are what truly make it great. This album actually presents a wide range of music, but keeps it all very simply. At least from a perspective of style. Also, for the TOOL fans out there, simple is not a criticism it's a compliment. When I suggest simple, maybe thoughts of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik should flow into your mind. The lyrics certainly aren't overly complex, but they can be quite poignant, meaningful and moving.  <br />\\"Something To Do\\" is a catchy upbeat song that could be played in any club in the US or Europe today and people wouldn't miss a beat dancing to it. \\"Lie To Me\\" is quite frankly one of the steamiest, most erotic songs I've ever heard. It's a slower song, with a steady throbbing. Simply makes you want to have sex with whoever is available at the moment. \\"People Are People\\", you already know that one, right? So I don't really have to go into it? It's a good song, very catchy, simple music and simply lyrics but the idea behind it is quite relevant. Just subscribes to the idea that if you are trying to make a point, the best way to do it is to keep things simple. It's a song that everyone should hear at some point in his or her life. <br />Ahhhh. The middle of the record! The BEST stuff. \\"It Doesn't Matter\\", what can I say but wow. This song is amazing. The lyrics and mood will move you. This is one of the greatest songs ever written, and for some reason everyone wants to hear \\"Somebody\\" instead. Now \\"Somebody\\" is an awesome good song, but it's just not on par with this. This is the song to turn the lights off to, and hold your lover close, and breathe in their essence. You just need to wrap your arms around someone, and enjoy the pleasure of the moment. The Mode works well at keeping things going with \\"Stories Of Old\\", it's a bit faster and is certainly a very good song. It tries to just be a very cold hearted attack on the ideas of love, and it actually does it pretty well. Next up is \\"Somebody\\". I honestly don't think this song gets the credit it deserves. It's really nothing more than a beautifully sung vocal track. What little music there is in the background could just as well not be there. This truly is one of the great love songs of all time, and it had to share space on a record with \\"It Doesn't Matter\\". Tragic, but the beauty of it all can be quite overwhelming. This string of three songs will either convince you that you must find the true love that gives life meaning, or abandon all foolish idea of love as a whim. Either way, it's a good listen.<br />\\"MASTER AND SERVANT\\". This is a great song, and audiophiles should play it louder and more often. The song is simply decadent. Something Madonna wishes she were capable of thinking of. If she had released this song, we would still be talking about it, but anything she does is so boring and trite that it's forgotten within weeks. Once you hear it you will NEVER get this song completely out of your head, and it's not the only track on the CD that does that. <br />Well, \\"If You Want To\\" is a good song. It's just the worst song on this record. Painstakingly smooth vocals over some simple synth-pop music. Nothing to write home about and the only place in the world you would hear this song today is in some retro 80s club in Berlin. It's good, but it's not a song that you'll be playing over and over. It's short, and that's a good thing.<br />Finally, \\"Blasphemous Rumors\\". Great song. I never viewed this song as challenging to religion, but one that simply makes you ask questions. And to be honest that is even more powerful. Manson and Reznor have yet to write anything as poignant as what Gore delivers here. This is another song that you'll never be able to fully escape. You'll know it and you'll hear it and you'll start to sing with it. You'll try to laugh it off and call it cheesy, and you may be right, but it will never ever leave you.<br />If you're into synth-pop at all, then you've already got this album. If you're curious about it, then you might want to start here.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|The movie Moulin Rouge was a fantastic movie starring a good-looking man, Ewan McGregor, with a voice that just made my heart melt, and Nicole Kidman, also beautiful with a great voice.  They had a chemistry that really made them seem like lovers and that showed that they are both extremely talented actors.  I highly recommend this movie for music lovers, and anyone that loves or will ever love.
B000002BPS|3.0|Ixnay on the Hombre was The Offspring's follow-up to their breakthrough album Smash, and they where most likely under a lot of pressure in trying to create a second Smash. The Offspring's first album on Columbia Records after moving from epitath, Ixnay actually turned out nothing like Smash, and it is a full 90 degree turn from Smash. This album shows alot more diversity than Smash, with punk ballads (if there is such a thing) like Amazed, Change the World, and Gone Away. There are some ska-ish songs like Don't Pick it up and I see a tad of ska (hardly any) in Way Down the Line. There are some of The Offspring better songs on this album, like The Meaning of Life, All I Way, and Gone Away, which all rank in my top 15 Offspring songs, All I want being my 3rd favorite Offspring song of all the albums. Besides those three song however, the rest of the album is good, much more than listenable, but not as good as the songs from the other albums. Ixnay is an essential Offspring fan album, but unlike other Offspring albums it is not jam packed with great punk anthems.
B00003CY5K|5.0|Legally Blonde is a great feel-good movie, and it's pretty believable. All the jerks get dumped, and all the nice, good people end up happy! The insults and comebacks are top-of-the-line, and everyone has a good time.<br />Legally Blonde is about a blonde, Elle Woods, who is very intelligent and just applies her intelligence to cosmetics, clothes, and fashion. This is a great movie that supports &quot;girl power&quot; and the intelligence of blondes.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is a virtual masterpiece in the rap/rock or alt. rock genre.  Quite possibly the best album of 2000/2001, every song is excellent.  This group offers theyre own innovative style that is evident on basically all tracks.  This album and group surpasses any other similar groups or albums (limp bizkit, etc.) An Absolute MUST have!
0425180638|4.0|At first I was dissappointed that Patricia Cornwell chose to dissect (pun intended) Kay Scarpetta this way.  I would seem that to make her ever-strong and resillient doctor-lawyer into a sniveling introspective mess to be the downfall of the whole series.  I was wrong. <br />What really happens is that we finally get through the shell.  We actually get to do to her what she does to all the victims that cross her autopsy tables and let her do the talking.  At times the revelations are blatant and at others they sneak up on the reader and reinforce the thoughts and impressions that we had about the doc all along.  We always knew there was a real person under there.  We always knew that she could feel as helpless as some of the people that she sees everyday in car wrecks and shootings.  We get to see the moody/bitchy side probably more than we'd like, but it's the real Kay Scarpetta this time.  <br />Overall, the story is out of hand with way too many plot twists and turns, but I liked the fact that we see her as a real person with all her flaws (like her cigarettes) and imperfections (her ability to never quite put 2 and 2 together fast enough).  <br />I'm starting to tire with Marino's cavalier attitude, but the faint hint of real emotion we see from him comes as a comfort.  Lucy is up to bigger and better things and is pretty much stopped being the snivelling brat she's been up to now.  <br />I'm intrigued now...just when I was about to say goodbye to the whole Scarpetta series.  I may just stick around to see what the good doc is up to in the future.<br />Keep an open mind and you may see the doc come back to life.
0440224764|3.0|Awesome book. One question:<br />Why didn't he tear out the last chapter and throw it away?<br />It had nothing to do with the book, nor was there anything in the book that would indicate an ending like this.<br />This is not a twist, its simply a stupid ending. Grisham reminds me of a salesman who can never close the deal.  I was buying through out the whole book. But at the end I walked away from the sale.<br />Runaway Jury - sappy ending Brethren - stupid ending..<br />No more Grisham for this lad!!
B00005LB50|5.0|I and a lot of other people were beginning to wonder if we'd ever see a Buffalo Springfield box set in our lifetimes. It's long overdue, but this seminal American band finally gets its due! This is what you get: an 82-page book with an historical essay (complete with footnotes), lots of photos and press clippings, a list of concert appearances, and discography; and four cds. The first three cds offer a chronological history of Buffalo Springfield's studio recordings, including a generous quantity of demos as well as album cuts, and unreleased recordings and alternate mixes. The demos alone are worth the price of the set. These aren't low-fidelity homemade demos, but excellent recordings, many of which \\"Doc\\" Siegel expertly recorded at the fabled Gold Star Recording Studios. The quality of these demos is warm and intimate(they positively shimmer!) and sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. Among the full-band cuts, there are too many highlights to enumerate here, but you will find treats such as  Stephen Stills contributing lead vocals to \\"Down to the Wire\\" and to a pre-Poco, Richie Furay-penned \\"What a Day,\\" as well as a mix of \\"On the Way Home\\" minus the horn track.<br /> I have a few quibbles; somehow this set seems incomplete without the long version of \\"Bluebird\\" and Richie's strange, moody tour-de-force, \\"The Hour of  Not Quite Rain.\\" Dewey Martin's lead vocal in &quot;Good Time Boy&quot; is almost buried in the mix. And be aware that you will find no live tracks here; supposedly no concert recordings of acceptable quality could be found.<br />Disc four contains the band's first two albums, \\"Buffalo Springfield\\" (in mono) and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" (stereo). Although this disc repeats much of what is on the first three discs, it is nice to have these two masterpieces available in 24-bit remastered form on one disc.<br />It's hard to believe that Buffalo Springfield's career was barely two years long, but its influence has been pervasive and enduring. This box set is a fitting tribute and celebration of one of the great rock &amp; roll bands of all time.during. This box set is a fitting tribute and celebration of one of the great rock &amp; roll bands of all time.
B00005JHAD|4.0|I agree that it was artificial and poorly acted, but I think that was the intention--to make a film which is a parody of &quot;hip.&quot; It has the feel of a music video throughout, but at times the editing is brilliant (like Avi's travelling to and from London, that little sequence with a shot of spirits, a passport seal, and a Concorde) adding to the piece the rhythm I've been missing since &quot;Trainspotting.&quot;<br />I think this is a far better job than &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; was, and I'm even surprised I liked it so much.
B000001G53|4.0|This is Wagner at his most sublime, most intense and beautiful. Karajan squeeze every last bit of emotion, spirituality and sublimeness out of the score.  In fact I found it too overwhelming to listen to for more then 30 minutes - it is too strong! <br />But in short doses it sends me into exctasy like no other recording of Parsifal can.  <br />For longer doses I prefer the more gripping and dramatic Boulez recording!<br />Sound is great for early digital!!!
B000001F5F|5.0|U2 Live Under A Blood Red Sky features U2's greatests hits from 1980 to 1983, their first &quot;era&quot;.  It says a lot that they could put out a greatest hits album when most of the band were still 22 or 23 years old.  You could tell this young band was headed for true greatness.<br />They did the right thing in making it a live album because U2 are simply better when playing live.  All of the versions on this album are better than their studio originals.  These songs are all but forgotten and more than half are still played live today.  This is a must have.
B00000IAU3|1.0|boring, dull and lifeless this cd is definately not worth whatever you pay for it. im ashamed to say dido is the only english singer selling big time in america and i honestly cant see why.

B000000W5L|5.0|From the opening lurch and tug of &quot;Rocks Off&quot; to the affirmation of the closer &quot;Soul Survivor,&quot; this rag-tag collection of songs is the pinnacle of accomplishment in the long history of the Rolling Stones.  Part commentary on America, part autobiography, part testament to all the myriad influences which comprise their sound, and part declaration of independence from those same musicians and the creation of a new sound distinctively defined as &quot;the Stones,&quot; this document presents the most comprehensive definition of the Rolling Stones and answers with confident finality why they are the greatest rock and roll band in the world.  Shedding the demonic midnight rambler image they'd cultivated in the sixties, the Stones were now tax exiles with the power and money to pull off a heretofore unparalleled recording experience.  In the dark musty basement of Keith's rented villa in the South of France, a heroin addicted guitarist and a jet-set upper crust wannabe put together a phenomenal piece of rock and roll.  Amidst all the chaos, the parasites, drug dealers, groupies, and everything and everyone else hanging around, Keith Richards managed to crystallize his songwriting ability utilizing a potpourri of styles (country, blues, r'n'b, gospel, and rock) and sounds (man, I wish he'd go back to using the Leslie now and again).  Mick Jagger sings tales of sexual frustration, juke joint joy, drug addiction, love, blue collar blues, faith, doubt, despair, and ultimately hope with his utterly unique combination of sarcastic drawl, lecherous bray, and pleading croon.  Mick Taylor, in his finest hour as a Stone, weaves his jazzy noodlings and stinging blues licks throughout the fabric of each composition and each song is flavored to perfection by a variety of musicians who contribute their skills (rocking horns, evocative organ, bordello keyboards, inspirational backing vocals) to this musical gumbo.  Not forgetting the rhythm section which, particularly Charlie Watts, is not only steady and reliable, but also breathtakingly impressive.  As most have affirmed, the sound is unusual with the vocals mixed well into the chugging rhythms and acoustic strumming giving the record's sound a muddy intensity.  Yet the band has never sounded as good, their message never so sincere, so convincing, so desperate. With the band's future uncertain, indeed Keith's future uncertain, they hunkered down and decided to add one more item to their legacy.  It would prove to be their masterpiece, and like many artists who suffer through such a labor of love and devotion, they were never able to reproduce the magic again.  Either way, whether its the Ramone-ish intensity of &quot;Rip This Joint,&quot; the uptempo shuffle of &quot;Casino Boogie&quot; (with the irresistable caterwauling backing vocals from Keef), the Jagger-ific &quot;Loving Cup&quot; (the template for a good bit of their next album), the out-Oakieing of Merle Haggard on &quot;Torn and Frayed,&quot; or the superb blues covers of &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot; or &quot;Stop Breaking Down,&quot; this recording has excellent songs to spare. Ironically, there are few huge radio hits on this their most celebrated effort and you'll find most classic rock radio stations are more likely to air the title cut from one of their more panned efforts (&quot;It's Only Rock and Roll&quot;) than put on the staggeringly beautiful &quot;Let It Loose&quot; or &quot;Shine A Light&quot; or the raunchy &quot;Ventilator Blues.&quot; Call your local d.j. and ask them to play &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; and see what they say.  Don't let this discourage you, however.  If you consider yourself even a slight Stones fan, you owe it to yourself to own this.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I watched this video on PBS many years ago and have been trying to get a copy for the last five years. It is so awesome, that it's difficult to believe that it is no longer produced on VHS for USA consumers while it is available in other formats in other countries. I can only imagine how good this presentation of images and sound will be on DVD!<br />Koyaanisqatsi was added to the National Film Registry in December 2000. It should be available for consumers, and soon.
B000059TPN|5.0|Well, well, well.  Another Criterion treasure!<br />The first thing that attracted me to buying this version of &quot;The Rock&quot; was a review.  I know, I know - who reads reviews anyway? -but you're reading this review, aren't you?<br />The review stated that this DVD would kill your home system.  They were absolutely right!  This DVD comes packed with a very nice DTS soundtrack which can rock the foundations at the right volume.  If you want to test your home theatre system - BUY THIS DVD.<br />The movie, right, if you don't have a five (or more) speaker setup, and just want to enjoy the film, there are other (Criterionesque) features worth watching.  Commentaries are great, and no matter how many DVDs I own, I haven't yet heard commentary where I didn't learn something new about a film.<br />Get this beast of a DVD for sound quality, but also if you're a Sean Connery, Ed Harris or Nicholas Cage fan.<br />Cheers to another great Criterion release!<br />Rob Sanders
0345350499|5.0|I saw the miniseries and lost myself in the story.  This book is so exciting and it draws you in to where you can't put it down for a second.  An interesting twist of the Arthur story.  I highly recommend it.
B000002J1C|5.0|Excellent early album from one of the genres true masters. This album, recorded before fame and self-induced megalomania overtook them, proves what prog-rock was and SHOULD have been. <br />Quite simply, prog lost the plot, but before it came to that, &quot;The Yes Album&quot; delivered some memorable moments. <br />You can't go wrong with this one.
B000058983|5.0|The best album released in 1967 without a doubt. And yes I know that's a profound statement to be making.
B000002J1F|4.0|One of the best 70s prog-rock albums by one of the best prog-rock bands.<br />Apart from the massive &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, there's little here in the way of the megalomania that later ruined the band. What we have are gentle compositions, &quot;fragile&quot; textures and the sound of a band really trying to do something different.<br />This was when Yes still saw themselves as a &quot;pop&quot; band, although with a very interesting approach. <br />Howe was never so delicate, Wakeman was never this understated and the band was never so tuned to one another as they were when this album was recorded, and the sheer love of music on display will make this required listening to anyone claiming to love music.<br />&quot;Progressive&quot; in the true sense.
B0000013G9|5.0|It will take some years for this album to be topped. This is the Greatest R&amp;B album i own hands down. And considering that FAnmail was a pile of poopoo it is always nice to know i can go back to this and TLc tip. Songs like Lets Do it again, and Diggin on You are just dopeness as soon as you hear it. Then Creep(everyone remember that video) and Kick your Game is some of the songs where t-boz sounds like she is talking and hits extremely well. Other Songs like Red Light Special and Waterfalls are some great slow grooves and the Outkast collaboration Sumthin Wicked comes this Way is a special bonus. I know i say this for a lot of stuff but this is the real deal. YOU MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A HIP HOP/R&amp;B FAN. Im not playing. go pick it up now or order it now it will be one of the greatest things you ever did.
B0000509C4|3.0|Stephen King gives us three more tales of terror:  A wooden Indian comes to life to wreak vengeance on three punks; four college students are terrorized by a mysterious slime on a lake; and an adulteress can't seem to shake a man she struck with her car.  Mindless fun that should be enjoyed by those who liked the original film.
0743216458|5.0|From the instant I began this book, I felt like one of Easy Company going through the basic training, the drilling, all the way to that fateful day of jumping into Normandy on D-Day. The men are corageous. I could never have had the courage they did and they should be remembered until time immemorial. I found Ambrose's writing fresh and smooth. He sucks you into the action and gives you the feel of how a soldier thinks. He makes you really believe that a soldier doesn't have time to mourn over his friend who just got his head shot off in the heat of battle. That in itself is an amazing trait that only comes with a soldier, something that people who have never fought in a war will never understand, but Ambrose attempts to give us that, and he succeeded with me. An important book to read, not just for the stories involved, but for the history.
0671027573|3.0|I wouldn't categorize this book as a page turner. I did finish it in like a day and a half. I guess I would call it predicatble. This is the first time I've read a book by this author. I wish she had not focused so much on the love story between Jaine and her next door neighbor. I was more interested in the killing plot. I liked it but I'm glad I waited for the paperback to come out! I would never pay more than $10.00 for this book.
6305546789|5.0|We all know that Halloween is a masterpiece of horror.  Why?  Because it doesn't use many cheap shocks to scare us.  It focuses on pure, undeniable suspense of the highest caliber to truly horrify us.  I should propably tell you, I LOVE gore!  I love seeing what clever type of death the make-up artist has in mind and how many guts can spill without getting that dreaded X rating.  But Halloween is one of the only splatter films I've seen that didn't need any gore, because there actually was suspense (I love Friday The 13th, but let's face it, that had no suspense).  Halloween is also great because of all the attention director John Carpenter pays to detail.  The killer is nearly always in the background somewhere, but instead of making that really obvious, Carpenter barely hints at that, so when you see it you say \\"Wo!\\"  Take, for example, the scene in which one teen girl, Annie (Nancy Kyes/Loomis) accidentally locks herself in the laundry room and then hears the phone ringing.  She starts screaming at the kid she's babysitting, Lindsey (Kyle Richards) to pick the phone up.  While she's doing this, Michael Myers (Nick Castle) is in the background staring at her through the window.  The sad thing is that when Halloween went to video and was put in Pan-And-Scan format, most of this scary stuff was cut off the side of the screen!<br />That brings me to my next point.  This DVD from Anchor Bay, obviously trying to make up for their past mistakes where they released a terrible version of Halloween onto DVD, with bad colors, horrible sound, it was just plain bad!  Well, it's amazing what Lucasfilm's THX Digital Mastering Services can do.  Halloween looks good as new!  It's amazingly clear and clean, free of speckles and grain, and the sound is to equal.  You've got yourself Three different sound formats to watch Halloween in, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Surround 2.0 and it's original mono version, and the 5.1 version is clearly the best.  My goodness, how much better this is from the previous release.  The voices, while a tad bit overwhelmed by the music near the beggining, are much clearer than they've ever been before, and the music is stronger and much crisper, too.  Also, a couple of things have been added into the sound-mix (courtesy of academy award winner Adam Adams), such as in the scene with Loomis and Nurse Marion driving to the mental hospital, several new sounds of lightning help add to the tension.  Great new mix!<br />Also, this version doesn't forget the extras (it does forget the commentary recoreded on the Laserdisk, but that's forgivible).  The highlight of the special features section is the 30 minute documentary called \\"Halloween Unmasked\\".  This is a very interesting behind-the-scenes documentary in which many of the cast and crew talk about fascinating memories (Christopher Lee was originally picked to play Loomis?) and there's some great stuff to learn here, as well as some funny talk with Nich Castle (The Shape). There's still other extras around, as well, though.  We've got a great still gallery that you actually want to check out.  It contains all sorts of great stuff, as well as Halloween's poster artwork.<br />Next we've got two trailers (they're both the same except one had a little part on the beggining that says \\"The one, the only, the classic, Halloween!\\") and three TV Spots, one o which is just under ten seconds long.  You can't forget the radio-spots either, and they're here.  Also, we've got some fun trivia and production notes, but that's not it!<br />If you were lucky and were able to get your hands on the Restored Limited Edition of Halloween, then you've got a second disk with a very nice surprise.  That surprise is the entire TV version of Halloween, uncut and featuring all 12 of the restored minutes shot for TV when Halloween aired.  Most of the scenes help augment the story, especially one where Loomis fights with two doctors about sending Michael to a maximum security ward.  The other scenes are Loomis talking to young Michael in his cell, Loomis finding Michael's room completely trashed and with the word \\"Sister\\" carved on the all, and one where Lynda comes over to Laurie's house to borrow a blouse.  The great thing here is that all the scenes are presented in widescreen, just like the rest of the movie, and anamorphic, too!  The sound isn't as good as the rest of the film, and a hiss is noticeable, but it's an honor to own the TV version of Halloween at all.<br />AS I have said, Halloween looks good ONLY in widescreen, but for some reason Anchor Bay decided to include both a standard and a widescreen version of the movie on disk one (disk two only has widescreen).  I don't see why they did this, since all the beautiful photography turns to mud in standard, particularly in the shot of Laurie walking on the sidewalk, waiting for Annie to pick her up, or in the opening scene with the pumpkin, or the scene with Michael integrating out of the darkness to strike at Laurie.  Nearly every scene in this movie was meant for widescreen, so I consider it a downer that Anchor Bay included the pan-and-scan version, since I'm sure that some fools will watch it that way because there aren't any black bars.  A shame.<br />Still, Halloween was and is a great scary movie.  It's a classic of horror and it lives on in an almost perfect (no commentary and you've got the ability to watch it in standard) DVD.  This is a great DVD that you must get your hands on soon.

B00003CXAR|5.0|After his 2nd feature film, young director Steven Spielberg took up the task of filming &quot;Jaws.&quot;  Though he had major headaches with ever-changing weather, an ever-changing shooting schedule and a shark that didn't work, Spielberg did finish it, and used his images and John William's 2-note &quot;warning&quot; that had everyone scared out of their seats in 1975!  After watching this film, it's no wonder it does so well.<br />  Our story takes place on the island of Amity, a small community where peace and tranquility reign, that is until the mangled corpse of a young woman is found on the beach.  Investigating the case is Amity's Chief of Police Martin Brody.  An early autopsy seems to indicate a shark attack, which Brody plans to take seriously, until the mayor (Larry Hamilton) tells Brody that he's mistaken.  This is mainly due to the fact that the peak of tourist season is about to arrive on Amity Island, and the townspeople need those dollars to pay through the winter months.  The chief tries to keep it under wraps until a young boy is killed, and then the aid of Oceanographic Institute member Matthew Hooper (Richard Reyfuss) comes to the island to confirm that a shark is indeed in the waters, and has to be killed.  The mayore is still skeptical and nothing can deter him, except when Martin and Matt enlist the aid of a fisherman named  Quint (Robert Shaw), to catch the great white terror.<br />  The movie works great because of what we don't see. Throughout the entire movie, the shark only appears for about 5 minutes.  The rest is left to our imagination, the music, and the shark fin in the water.  The character's are also played to perfection.  Roy Scheider plays Martin Brody as a man who is the Cheif of Police, yet afraid of the water, and Larry Hamilton plays the mayor as a man who seriously won't let the possibility of a shark attacking tourists keep the islanders from making a buck during the 4th of July.  Richard Dreyfuss as MAtt Hooper also playsup well with great lines, and one of his best roles to the time (his last being in American Graffiti.<br />  All in all, the DVD extras could use some more tweaking, the making of footage isn't all that great, outtakes are less than mediocre, as are a couple of cut sequences that definitely belonged on the cutting-room floor.  <br />  If you really want to see a summer movie before they turned into $100 million pieces of garbage, see this film.  I watched it 3 times a day!
0783235615|1.0|That's a really unrealistic movie, a complete political fantasy. This guy didnt have any idea about Cuba and his political situation. He doesnt understand neither the cultural background. He confuses Cuba with Mexico, because he portrays the wife of the guerrilla leader as an adelita. But, that is just ridiculous, because adelitas are part of Mexican revolution not cuban. Also, the story is absurd and silly. That is why my inteligence is offended.
0380733358|5.0|I have never had a book actually make my heart throb!  I really couldn't stop turning the pages.  I finished it in two days after I hit around Chpater 6 or so.  An abolutely wonderful ending!  This book for me, a teenager, really hit home, and I would recommend it for everyone.  I can't wait to start Follet's other novels.   The rest of my summer reading schedule is completely booked with Follett books!
B000002J23|3.0|I must respectfully disagree with other reviewers, but I do think that the bright spots make up for the weak ones. Those bright spots are the classic Tempus Fugit and Can It Really Happen. Machine Messiah has some great moments but is far too long. The others are throwaways. But get it for Fugit!
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley is one of the most influential singers of the 90's, just as the talented Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young gave us tunes that were very beautiful and dreamlike, Jeff gives songs that are so meaningful that I always have to listen just before I go to sleep so that I can here his beautiful voice.  I feel deeply moved by every song he sings, but the trip begins with Mojo Pin and when you here how he reaches such high notes as he gently sighs and screams and opens up his heart to the way it really feels to be alone, it moves me to closer to him, Jeff puts such  emotion into his songs that it sends me into a dream like state, the voice is like that of an angel, and the sensual feeling of love that he expresses are breathtakingly beautiful. Grace follows Mojo pin, and again this beautiful song moves me to want to be closer to him as he gets more lonely and I get more emotional about his voice and the way it makes me feel as he sings of loneliness but this time the lyrics express an even more deep feeling of sadness and loneliness, it makes me want him to come closer to him. 'Last goodbye' is him showing how it feels to be parted from someone that meant so much more to you then they will ever know, and I know because that is the way it feels, just the way he so delicately shows his feeling and the way it breaks you inside, makes you weak and unable to smile like you did when love was there.  'Lilac Wine' is much more easy on the emotions, and then it hits you that he is feeling really low, really emotional, could it really  feel this lonely, and how he turns to 'Lilac wine' to make it easier to cope with the loneliness and trying to recapture that moment when it was all so fine and everyday was sunny. 'So Real' is dreamlike and very very beautiful, it expresses feelings of restlessness and sadness but it also expresses deep sensual feeling of love and happiness, the way it could be.  'Hallelujah' is a spiritual song that is haunted by the past feeling of love andhappiness and then loneliness, his voice is hauntingly beautiful just as it is on 'Corpus Christi Carol' only on these two songs his voice reaches its most heights that I go beyond the dream and into the sub-conscious. 'Lover, You Should've Come Over' this song gets to me the most and makes me feel so close to him, as he sings of the love and happiness that he needs at that very moment but he just has to wait because it's cold and lonely by yourself, just need to be part of someone.  'Eternal Life' is song about his search for the love and happiness that he desires but has not found yet, but just to keep keeping on, and his voice just keeps on a high and I am feeling the feelings that he is feeling and just want him and me to feel so close. 'Dream Brother' gives you those feeling love and happiness and just as you think it is all going to end, he sings the last line to the last track.... asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over.  And I just know that he is as real as the feelings he is giving me when I listen to his sweet manly voice.
6302797535|4.0|This is yet another Murder Mystery-gone comedy. This is actually one of (if not the) earliest ones. This movie is very funny and the actors and actresses play their roles well. This murder mystery comes complete with unbelieveable surprise ending. This movie can be fun for older kids, but adults are more likely to understand the jokes. If you liked this movie you should check out these movies, or if you like one of these movies you should check out the rest: &quot;Private Eyes&quot; &quot;Clue&quot; &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot;
B000002MG1|5.0|This album was released after the huge success of their previous record Out of Time. In my opinion, and the opinion of others, it is their masterpeice. The songs are mellow as anything, unlike their next effort - the heavy(ish) Monstor. It is a very reflective album which looks at such subjects as suicide, death, euthanasia etc, though the final two songs 'Nightswimming' and 'Find the River' end the album on a more positive note.<br />The most recognisable of the songs on the album i.e. the ones that got the most radioplay are 'Drive', 'Everybody Hurts' and 'Man on the Moon' - a brilliant tribute to comedian Andy Kauffman. These songs are among the finest but there's also the beutiful 'Sweetness Follows' which focuses on a family coming together after a funeral. Other personal favourites of mine also include 'Nightswimming' and the more light hearted 'The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite' in which Stipe can actually be heard to laugh.<br />After quite a few years this record is still near the top of my record collection. One of the best and most influential rock albums - along with Nirvana's Nevermind which was released at about the same time - of the 90s.
0394720288|5.0|I got this book for my birthday on May 30th, this year. I guess that makes me new. But, I can say this, this is undoubtedly the best Jeeves book that Mr Wodehouse ever wrote!<br />The main story is about how Bertie has to steal a cowcreamer for Aunt Dahlia or else he'll never eat from her godly French chef Anatole's dishes again!<br />Along the way, he meets Sir Watkyn Bassett, who once fined him a fiver on Boat Race Night for pinching a policeman's helmet. With Sir Watkyn is his friend and soon-to-be-nephew Dictator Roderick Spode.<br />Sir Watkyn, showing Bertie's Uncle Tom lobster, upsets Uncle Tom's stomach, and takes the cowcreamer. Meanwhile, Bertie gets a message from Gussie Fink-Nottle, who is going to marry Sir Watkyn's daughter Madeline. Gussie screws up the engagement, and it's up to Bertie to fix it.<br />Then Spode says if Bertie pinches the cowcreamer, he'll beat him to a pulp, and, as I've said too much, you should go buy it! It's a great book! Pip-pip for now!

B000005JAX|5.0|I've had this album for about 7 years, and have never grown tired to listening to the beautiful sounds of MLG... I pulled out the CD today and was thinking... gee, do people UNDERSTAND what Martin does?  I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that he is an artistic god.  I even went as far as to pull off all Martin-vocal songs off all the DM albums and made my own Martin CD.  Anyways, to those who are interested in buying the album: yes, it is way too short; yes, the songs are not his own (hence, &quot;counterfeit&quot;...); but yes, Martin's voice shines as always in these beautifully recorded albums; yes, I highly recommend it -- It is an album to listen to when you are in a relaxed, mild-mannered mood, and if you're like me, will always put a smile on your face.
B000002GF8|5.0|I really love this CD.   1 Synchronicity - gives you a feeling of scientific overload and explains synchronicity. 2-3 Walking in Your Footsteps/O My God-these are both songs with messages 4-5 Mother/Miss Gradenko-these are the worst two songs on the CD, but they're not that bad.  Mother is a nightmarish oddity.  Miss Gradenko is a catchy, confusing and somewhat annoying song. 6 Synchronicity II-this one starts a chain of the four best songs on the CD, all in a row.  Synchronicity manages to be happy and grim at the same time, it has a catchy tune set to disturbing lyrics. 7 Every Breath You Take - nothing really to say, this is just the best song in the world. 8-10 King Of Pain/Wrapped Around Your Finger/Tea In The Sahara - These are three soft rock songs.  King of Pain is another one of my favorites.  Wrapped Around Your Finger has really good music.  But both Wrapped Around Your Finger and King of Pain are disturbing. 11 Murder By Numbers it's just a slightly disturbing upbeat softrock song
B0000399WI|5.0|.... I've put off watching it until today and I'm not sure why I didn't watch it sooner! I'm not a big fan of prison movies, but this is one exception.  The story is awesome and never really drags, which makes the 2.5 hour movie feel more like a 90 minute film. Tim Robbins and Morgran Freeman are excellent.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has yet to see it.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds. Rufas is extremely talented as a singer, writer, and musician. Rufas' music can put you into any mood, just with a change of note. I would reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00000099Y|5.0|I can really respect a band that cares more about their messages than their music. You can instantly hear that Tool is angry, but these four are angry for very good reasons. Just open your ears, your mind, and you heart and you'll begin to feel it. Think about the feeling and understand it. Understand it and go on with it. Do it... and there you go. Tool is all about being your own person, building upon what others have built for you but all the while looking at The World (and the non-existant) with an open, experienced, but not grudgeful mind.<br />Buy this CD (or &quot;Lateralus&quot;) if you're ready for SOME kind of change in the world, even if it is only one person being different. Join the revolution of the mind.
B000002BFZ|4.0|By the time 'No Code' came out, most of the world had jumped off the bandwagon.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  'No Code' follows in the direction 'Vitalogy' was headed, and since 'Vitalogy' is my favorite PJ album I pretty much love 'No Code' too.<br />For 'No Code', Pearl Jam decided to push the boundaries of their music a little further.  New sounds and styles appear throughout the album.  The harmonica in 'Smile' is one of my favorite touches, for example.<br />At any rate, if you liked 'Vitalogy', give this album a listen.  It may take a while to grow on you, but once it does, you'll be glad.
014100018X|4.0|Chocolat is a fairytale of a story about whether it is better to follow tradition or to pursue happiness. Vianne and her six year old daughter move to small French town and set up a chocolate shop. Since it is the beginning of lent, the townspeople are divided in their reactions towards the shop. <br />The inhabitants are a little cartoonish. There is an independant old woman with a gossipy daughter, a gruff but nice farmer and so on. However this does not make them any less interesting to read about.<br />The story is told from two viewpoints-Vianne's and the local priest's. Since the priest belives in abstinence and self-denial he ends up in becoming Vianne's 'enemy'. As well as information about what these two people see and hear, we are also told how thay feel about what is happening.<br />My favourite parts of the book were those that detailed Vianne's relationship whith her mother who died seven years ago, and how their previous lifestyle colours her life. Vianne has an irrational fear that Anouk will be taken from her, which mirrors a similar fear that her mother once had. Vianne also longs to settle in a place for a while, but feels unable to do so. The book details how she faces up to her fears and helps some townspeople to solve their problems too.<br />I was disappointed in the stereotyping of the priest, who comes across as being intolerant and nasty. I also didn't like the ending-Since Vianne's and the priest's are the only viewpoints shown, I expected a sort of reconciliation between the two.<br />However all said, I enjoyed the book very much, and read it in record time. I don't usually like books written in this particular style. It's a good book to bring on holidays-neither trashy or complicated. The descriptions of the chocolates and chocolate making are scrumptious!
6303314015|5.0|No doubt in my mind that The Lion King was the best animated movie of all-time. From the opening scene with Simba being held high to the end with Simba re-claiming his throne at pride rock. I was 12 when I first saw this movie and I loved every second of it. Its been soooo long since I've seen it that I'm about to go mad. The outstanding story, the emotion the music brings, and the great characters make this not only one of the best animated films of all-time, but one of the best of any genre. Now where's the DVD?
B000002UJQ|5.0|The best way to illustrate the greatness of this album is with &quot;Lucky.&quot;  This was never one of my favorite songs until I really listened to it on my good headphones.  There, unlike in my crappy car stereo, one can hear an absolutely killer guitar solo from the left speakers buried underneath the distortion in the refrain.  Fade a stereo to the left and it comes in loud and clear.<br />What other band would bury such guitar heroics?
B000002LOE|3.0|This is one of R.E.M's weakest albums, man.  It aint 'cause its one of their most popular (&quot;Automatic for the People&quot; is their best) but just 'cause most of the songs are totally forgetable.  Of course &quot;Losing my Religion&quot; is wicked crazy and &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; is tight, but the reat is mad whatever.
B000056K04|5.0|I have never listened to DMB, but am a lifelong fan now.  Where have I been??? This album is an easy listen, excellent musicianship, great vocals, tight band.  These guys move as one. Easy groove, the more I listen the more I'm a soldout fan.  Wonderful.
6303593135|5.0|This is a great movie,and it was one of the movies which heralded the arrival of &quot;NOUVELLE VAGUE&quot; which used &quot;jump cuts&quot;(Godard used the skill in &quot;A bout de souffle&quot;),&quot;location shooting&quot;, &quot;improvised dialogue&quot;. Moreover,he used &quot;long shots&quot;,so the movie was experimental,and it is still enjoyable now. The story of the movie is still interesting,and see the final scene. I hope DVD edition which will be released on Oct 9 by a notorious studio &quot;Fox Lorber&quot; will be a great edition.
6305127689|5.0|My Age: 15<br />It is My All-Time Number One Favorite Movie! I have that on DVD, it just like new on my television screen. If you like airplanes or other automobiles, then buy this on Video or DVD.
0679879269|5.0|Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass (the final installment in his His Dark Materials trilogy) puts the cap on a titanic achievment.   Through this series he has weaved adventure, religion, fantasy, philosophy, action and many other elements to create a truly unique storyline.  Some of the elements do not blend easily and it is in the second volume that everything comes together with the greatest ease and effect.  This final volume is a little philosophy and exposition heavy at times and it can said that the ending for some of the characters is anti-climatic as loose ends are quickly tied up.  But these are minor quibbles compared to some of the thrills in this third volume, such as the horrifying Land of the Dead and the Gallivespians.  This is a book that will upset many people with inflexible, conservative religious viewpoints but it will be a joy and a challenge to anyone with an imagination.  The journey is exciting and the lessons are profound.  This is the birth of new children's classic.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|Roger Ebert said it was like &quot;being trapped in an elevator with the circus.&quot;  One guy I know likened it to &quot;an explosion at the peacock factory.&quot;  And I agree with both.  The film is a choppy, in-your-face blur of musical numbers that should send epileptics everywhere running.  And if you take away all the hoopla of the music and the colors, you are left with a disappointingly ordinary plot.  I do admire the balls Baz Luhrmann had when he decided to use songs such as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; in such a bizarre way, but I still wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
B00003CY5H|4.0|It's a well-worn premise: Middle-aged thief, wants one last score before he retires, hooks up with a brash young newcomer who has the goods on the biggest, riskiest score of the thief's career.<br />So here's a few cliches to go with the plot: &quot;edge of your seat,&quot; &quot;pulse-pounding,&quot; &quot;outstanding cast,&quot; &quot;non-stop action.&quot;<br />The premise is old, but &quot;The Score&quot; seems fresh. Much of that is, of course, thanks to the cast. Only Angela Bassett is wasted, but let's face it: with Edward Norton, Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando, the best actors of their respective generations, you're not paying a whole lot of attention to anyone else.<br />What's more, &quot;The Score&quot; has some of the tensest scenes of any movie I've seen in a while. Yet, its action happens with very little violence and almost no gunplay. Most of it takes place in the character interaction and the audience's investment in the characters' fates, a tough job to pull off.<br />Yes, you've seen the movie before, and if you stop to think about it, you can predict most of the surprises. But thanks to a great cast and Frank Oz's well-paced direction, you've never seen it pulled off this WELL.
0790742780|5.0|...<br />One part revenge of the marginalized, one part social commentary, this is a film that wanders in and out of being the bearer of a significant and disturbing message and being just another tale about some unstable, blame everybody else for his problems headcase having a meltdown and going postal.<br />This is a movie that is much better and more though-provoking movie than [other people] let on.  Are there stereotypes?  To be sure, but not without some sound basis. It is finely acted.  And Schumacher's directing is on par with the work he did in Grisham's *A Time to Kill.* <br />A thought provoking and disturbing movie. Highly recommended.
6304493681|3.0|Read the manga by Masamune Shirow...RENT the movie... Some decent animated sequences but so loosely based on the manga it's incoherent.  The art style isn't even remniscent of Shirow's.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This Cd Rocks, if u wanna spend ur money on a Cd, get this, cuz all the tracks here r so Damn Tight!!!!!! Except &quot;No S**&quot;....
B00003CY5H|3.0|Safe, because the movie takes no risks.  In its defense, at least it never goes awry, staying true to its own tone throughout.  Quiet, a little slow, predictable, but still enjoyable.  DeNiro's &quot;Heat&quot; character minus the Shakesperean tragedy.  The trailer truly worked, the movie only functioned.  I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars, mostly for the winning star combination of DeNiro and Norton.  As for Brando, his lisp is truly distracting.  Paint-by-numbers plot as interpreted by modern Picassos.  The results are only so-so, but the film is still worth a see.
B000002BMV|5.0|It doesn't happen very often, but once in a blue moon someone will put out a record that is SO GOOD that every single track on it could be used in a Greatest Hits compilation. Some records that come to mind are: The Beatles, of course (virtually ANY album, take your pick), Boston's self-titled debut album (possibly the best first album anyone's ever done), Foreigner's 4 (which came out a few months after this one), and Asia and Genesis' self-titled albums (1982 and 1983 respectively). Must have been something about that time period that produced some truly extraordinary music because during that same period came Journey's Escape. What's most apparent to me as I listen to the REMASTERED CD is that the two Steves, Neal, Ross and Jonathan were HUNGRY! By the summer of 1981 Journey had had a few hit singles and albums, they were getting some songs on the radio, but they hadn't had a Number One Hit quite yet and so, like I said, they were definitely HUNGRY! Maybe FOAMING AT THE MOUTHS is a better term for the hard-driving, rock-solid intensity here! Indeed, every track is a standout in it own right. Of the ten tracks, I believe that I have heard NINE of them on the radio. That's why I say it's a Greatest Hits CD in itself. Steve Perry's vocals were unbelievable. I wish his replacement Steve Augeri lots of luck - you'll think so too after hearing this. If you've never bought a Journey CD before, I recommend this one first followed by their Greatest Hits. If you already have it, I still recommend you get the newly REMASTERED CD. You won't be sorry! One of the best albums of the entire 1980's and a MUST HAVE for any Journey fan, new or old.
B000001EEN|5.0|Obviously Pete Townsend was having a little fun at Clapton's expense as he introduced &quot;Eric Clapton and his Palpitation!&quot;<br />All joking aside this is a stellar performance by Clapton, not bad for only a weeks rehersal.  This set has been wonderfully remastered to include the complete show.  Featured tracks include &quot;Layla&quot;, &quot;Badge&quot;, &quot;After Midnight&quot;, &quot;Key To The Highway&quot;, &quot;Let It Rain&quot;, and Robert Johnson's &quot;Crossroads&quot;.<br />After hearing this cd it's hard to imagine that Clapton was in hiding and contemplating not performing again.  Way to go Townsend for encouraging a friend to start again!<br />Perhaps all the performances aren't earth shaking but these guys are having fun doing what they do best.  I recommend this for your collection.
B000002G8L|5.0|If you're into blues/rock you need to get this set.  A strong performance by &quot;Slow-hand&quot; and his band.  From &quot;Tulsa Time&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot;, to &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;, Robert Johnson's &quot;Rambling On My Mind&quot;, &quot;Cocaine&quot;(of course), and &quot;Further Up The Road&quot; this is a treat to listen to.  A top notch performance that shouldn't be passed up.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Before I could write this review, I had to view Gladiator a second time to be sure I was being fair to the movie.  In all honesty, this is a slick production and the DVD was excellent.  Unfortunately the story was so lame and the acting so weak that the best I could rate it was 2 stars, primarily for the quality of the picture and the extras.<br />The characters are one-dimensional (which is not a pan on any of the actors, you can only perform what's written).  The story is worse than weak, it is not believable.  At least in Ben Hur, there is an explanation as to how the character becomes a galley slave and then later wins his freedom.  In Gladiator, Rome's greatest general becomes a slave, then a gladiator who later fights in Rome and no one wonders what happened to him and why the transformation.<br />If you want to view a great &quot;Gladiator&quot; DVD, check out Spartacus, it doesn't have nearly as much action but the story has some substance and the characters are much better acted.  If you are interested in a period piece, I would suggest Ben Hur.<br />I have only bought two DVDs without seeing the movie first.  Gladiator is one of the two and I am now firmly convinced that I will never purchase another DVD without seeing it first.  What a total waste of money and time.
B000005H63|5.0|I own 10 of Petrucciani's albums and this one is my most favorite. As you can conclude from the title, Petrucciani performs his own tunes and here we discover that he is not only a versatile pianist but a gifted composer as well. The all-star rhythm-section speaks for itself - Gary Peacock and Eddie Gomez on bass, Roy Haynes and Al Foster on drums plus guitarist John Abercrombie pops up on a couple of tracks. A very vivid and flamboyant album. If you love Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans but aren't familiar with Petrucciani, this is a perfect choice to dig into Michel's artistic genius.
B00000DFMN|5.0|I first heard Moments in Love on my favorite jazz radio station.  The DJ told me it was difficult to find but I was pleased to find it here.  At first I was a bit disappointed because it is a different version than what I heard  on the radio.  After playing the whole album several times, I am very pleased with it.  The other songs on the album sort of remind me of Lion Rock.  I will definitly check out more Art of Noise in the future.
B00000I07Q|5.0|First off, I'm only 18 and there just aren't that many Jovi fans in my age group.  I was constantly ridiculed through High School because I was a fan of what the skater kids liked to call &quot;cheese rock&quot;.  Okay I don't care about trends obviously and this record is awesome!!  It was actually the first album I ever owned and I've owned it 5 times because I keep wearing the thing out!  There are some really great ballads on here such as Wild Is The Wind, Living In Sin, and a very cool love rocker called Born To Be My Baby.  My favorite Jovi song though is Blood On Blood which is just amazing and is the longest song on the CD, an epic of sorts.  Love For Sale is just the guys goofing off and it's pretty funny.  BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE EARS!!!!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|Maybe I just haven't been sharing this CD with the right guys. In any case, every woman I know (my immediate friends) loved this one - every guy, on the other hand, did not. And these aren't guys who are into hard rock or rap or punk music. They like classical music and even easy listening type music (although I DON'T classify Enya as easy-listening or Muzak). This CD has become ooe of my favorites- lush, romantic and even ethereal at times. It speaks to me. A few years back, I thought that Enya might eventually become repetitive or boring but I think hur music has grown deeper and more complex with time. Others, however, feel quite differently so be forewarned. If you're a guy, drop me a line and let me know your take on all this. I hope I&quot;m wrong about the male/female split when it comes to Enya.
B00005LB50|5.0|My only complaint is were is the long version of Bluebird this set is also strange because why are some of the same songs is studio versions repeated from the fourth disc wich is the first two albums but in mono and stereo. This is all of it and I believe it it has taken Neil Young so long to compile this set and he did a fine job. At times this set gets a little over welming but thats what we want all this set does is show just how fresh and brilliat Young and Stills were and it prooves that they were a band like no other Buffalo Springfield is one of the greatest bands of all time even if there time togather was short it's some of the most groundbreaking music of the late 60's buy it if you want more then the best of wich is still fine to own.

B000002BBY|5.0|The songs Wonderwall and Don't Look Back in Anger are not only two of the most beautiful songs of 90's rock and roll, but they are two of the most beautiful songs in rock and roll history, period.    There are some undeniably lackluster songs on the album (Roll with it, She's Electric, Some Might say), but these aren't to bad, although they wear out quickly. They are more then erased however by the other solid, quality songs on the album.  These are Hello, Hey Now!, Morning Glory...and then Champagne Supernova and Cast No Shadow, which almost rank up there with Wonderwall and Don't Look Back in Anger.        So in conclusion, you get 5 very high quality songs, 2 of the best songs in Rock history, and 3 songs that are somewhat lacking...it's more then worth it, and is my favorite album.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork has really outdone herself on this one. I own all three of her main American releases, and I think this is the second best, rivaled only by the wonderful &quot;Homogenic.&quot; Although the album works as a whole, I think I will review each song individually.<br />Army Of Me: Ahh, here it is, the Bjork anthem. This is the most aggressive song. The lyrics are pretty cool, but the song doesn't have that staying power. Then again, it was the first single of the album, so it makes sense. First singles get old.<br />Hyperballad: This is an incredible song, with some of the best lyrics I've ever heard from Bjork. The fourth single is about a girl that gets her kicks by throwing stuff off of a cliff, this song is just plain good. Worth several repeated listens.<br />The Modern Things: What a remarkable song. It is a theoretical song suggesting that the nmodern things in the world have always existed. A little monotonous, but still very good. The ending part of this song is good, but I won't spoil it.<br />It's Oh So Quiet: Yay! Third single magic! This is probably the song that has inspired you, the reader, to buy this. Featuring a sort of big-band approach, &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; combines wonderful melodies with shrill screams. A must-see and a must-listen.<br />Enjoy: I haven't heard this one too much, but I like it. There's something about hearing her saying &quot;sex without touching&quot; that sounds cool.<br />You've Been Flirting Again: Yawn. This is the most boring and shortest track. Although the melody is good, it can't save itself from being boring.<br />Isobel: This is the second single. Pretty cool. I personally don't really care for this song too much, but I can tell that it is really good. About a girl that was born in the forest.<br />Possibly Maybe: All right, I have a lot to say about this fifth single. First of all, it is great. Bjork really sings well in this one. You can feel every whisper, every scream as she plays out a relationship by singing. In fact, I guess the music channel VH1 liked it too, because they sampled it for their late-night video show called &quot;Insomniac Music Theater.&quot; Second, listen to it! It is wonderful!<br />I Miss You: This song is the token anger outlet song. The instrumental arrangement for the song is great, especially the trumpet. A little bit unexpected in the fact that it is a bit trip-hoppy, as well as the fact that it is the final and sixth single. Why would she leave us with this psycho ballad? Well, nonetheless, this song is fun to sing along to. Great fun for the whole family (not counting the video.)<br />Cover Me: This song is wonderful, especially since the main and only instrument is the harpicord. Bjork sounds great, but maybe a little muffled in this one.<br />Headphones: This song is also great. Bjork wrote this song for her friend and collaborator Graham, and it sounds really cool. Percussionless, this song is a grat listen.<br />     Well, that's it. Altogether, those eleven songs form the inticate sounds of Post! Buy it now!
0380973464|5.0|Not your average sci-fi cyber-punk fairy tale, Cryptonomicon really stands out as a gem of modern fiction.  Part &quot;Catch 22&quot;, part &quot;Sneakers&quot;, this tale is told with the wit and style of a true classic.  If Kurt Vonnegurt had written &quot;Slaughter House 5&quot; in the late 90's, this is the book it easily could have become.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Just not a good movie.  Starts off okay but once Hanks is on the island for a while it just becomes uninteresting.  And once he returns to civilization it gets even more boring.  Finally, the ending is pathetically bad.  It's okay guys, you don't have to like every movie Tom Hanks is in.  Helen Hunt is brutal in this movie.
0140135154|4.0|This is an interesting little book.  It is based on a BBC television series of the same name, which I have never seen.  I read this book for a writing class while I was a freshman in college in 1985.  I remembered liking it (but couldn't remember why), so I picked up a copy at a used bookstore this year and reread it a few times.  Now I remember why I liked it.  In Ways of Seeing, John Berger chronicles how oligarchical social structures have been perpetuated in western society via the Western European painting tradition (mostly Renaissance oil paintings of the 1500s-1600s).  He briefly tries to deconstruct oligarchical myths (perpetuated via painting) such as &quot;true art can only be appreciated by the elite few&quot; and &quot;women's selfhood/bodies must always be constructed to please the patriarchal version of men's gaze.&quot;  In addition, he attempts to show that European oil painting was often a vacuous object used by the European elite to reinforce their views of superiority over the poor, nature, and material items. He also shows how many of the oligarchial images in Western European painting are now used by capitalism/consumerism to perpetuate this &quot;power for the few&quot; structure through the creation of mass envy via advertising.  Although this book was published in 1972 and the images are definitely dated, I think it is very forward-thinking philosophically and certainly very relavant to my own perspective on our current &quot;global domination capitalism.&quot;  I definitely agree with Berger's assessment in the last essay that the imagery of publicity is built upon convincing consumers that capitalism equals freedom, but in the end this imagery often reinforces the oligarchical structure it's supposed to be against.  This is the tragedy of, in Rianne Eisler's words, &quot;domination paradigms.&quot;  A few criticisms:  I find Berger's writing style paradoxically both clear and abstruse.  I say this because I have read the book several times (most recently just before writing this review), but I often have a hard time remebering its content after I read it.  And, at 150 pages, it is by no means a comprehensive analysis of oligarchical structures in European painting.  However, overall, I find Ways of Seeing an interesting read and definitely worth going back to again and again.(most recently just before writing this review), but I often have a hard time remebering its content after I read it.  And, at 150 pages, it is by no means a comprehensive analysis of oligarchical structures in European painting.  However, overall, I find Ways of Seeing an interesting read and definitely worth going back to again and again.
0670880728|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Bridget is your best friend, your younger sister who can never really get it together, Bridget is YOU!! I read this book in less than a day and a half and loved it. Even though Bridget speaks in a slang I didn't always understand, (remember &quot;The Full Monty&quot;?) I would still highly recommend this book!
B00004WKII|4.0|The standout track in this box set, for me, is Red House Live at San Diego. This track only appeared on Hendrix in the West while all the other tracks from HITW appeared numerous times on many compilations including bootlegs. This is the first time it has officially been released that I know of. Being a blues purist, I have to  say that this version of Red House has got to be the most astounding track in blues guitar playing. I remember when I first bought HITW in '73, this track blew me away. It sounded like B.B. King on acid! But, BETTER! I love B.B., but Jimi took what he learned from him and Albert King, Buddy Guy, etc. and created a blues/sci- fi epic. Jimi was SO on that night it's scary. His other versions of Red House are good to very good. But, this version is a journey in the history of guitar. From a mellow beginning, hair-raising middle, back to mellow, Frankenstein-monster ending , and it leaves the listener exhausted. Kind of like s*x! The mix on the track is surprisingly good, too, for a live recording. I have been searching for this track for years, and I'm SO happy it's here. Thank you to the Hendrix estate for making it available. The rest of the box set is great, too!
B000059Z8J|5.0|I just wanted to set the record straight for the viewer from Krypton below.  The scenes where Clark runs right into the car, and when the villians break the crystal on Krypton are in Superman II.  The films are all shown in their complete, theatrical versions, plus Superman: The Movie has eight minutes of footage re-inserted into the film.  I definitely recommend The Complete Superman DVD Collection to any and all fans of the film!  The picture quality and widescreen are well worth your money.  This especially holds true for the first film!
0345445600|5.0|I have several editions of Hobbit.<br />This is just the perfect one, I was looking for introducing my young children to Tolkien. It is a FULLY illustrated editions, With almnost 140 pages of drawings at the style of a comic book but infinitly better done. Rich in color and detail, beautifull emotions on faces and well depicted places, perfect consistency with the book. More than that!!!. It has extracts from the book incredible well chosen, from a narrator point of view ,including dialogs  mixed in such a way that there is almost no missing point treated in the original work, so text and reading is not lacking. I have not seen this kind of book in decades, It is one of the proudest books I have in my collection.
B00005LB9O|4.0|What an album. I bought the Why Does It Always Rain on Me Single and loved Driftwood, but never got the album. I picked this up on a lark and really love it. It's rare that I like an album on the first listen, but I did this. I had heard Sing on the radio and of course was singing along, but the second song was even better. By the end of the album, I had it on continuous play.<br />This is good music to serve as the background for a good summer. You can listen to it in the car, playing cards, drinking beer, working, laying by the pool or whatever. There are one or two songs that are a little sappy, but the rest of the album is the kind where if somebody hears it, they instantly like it too, no matter what kind of stuff they like. Then you seem that much cooler for having bought it first. Do not pass this record by.
1577311760|5.0|I have read over 150 self help books over the course of my life. I feel like Tolle sums up everything in one. Profoundly changing my life. So simple yet so deep. I got the books on tape and now every commute is a trip of blissful awareness. The amazing thing too, is that every time I listen to a tape, I hear something new and mindblowing. Any negative review about this book or these tapes is coming from a person who is stuck in their ego and doesn't really want to change for the better. Don't let your ego talk you into passing on this one. The time to hit the shopping cart button is...you guessed it.
B00005LB50|4.0|Buffalo Springfield out of the dark and into the light. Its a wonderful box which gives great credit to the group who is know by the people with a few songs. But they made much, much, much more. And you get an impression of what lay ahead for some of the members. For what its worth this box is a starting point to Neil Young and the other members. But together they are great. Everyone should buy it, not only people who like this kind of muisc but every musiclover.
B00003CY5H|3.0|Edward Norton's sensational performance which has him masquerading as a mentally challenegd janitor in order to pull off a robbery makes what could have been just another &quot;heist&quot; movie into one of the coolest movies this year to date...<br />Robert De Niro, looking bored and slightly dissapated, sleepwalks his way through another role...what happened to the actor who gave us Travis Bickle, Runpert Pupkin and Jake La Motta?<br />How's Brando?<br />As big as a house but he can still act rings around the world!<br />Edward Norton is what De Niro was 20 years ago!
0440219078|5.0|There were hundreds of reviews before mine, so I won't waste trying to describe the book and I'll get to the point. I had to read The Giver as a novel study in my class and it was my first venture into science fiction. I loved it so much I even bought my own paperback copy of it. It's a novel that is at first dark, but in the ambiguous end plants a seed of hope in Jonas' brainwashed society. It is a truly amazing story that made me question the way our world is today. Is the increasingly important role of technology slowly taking over the humans that created it? What are winning and what are we losing when taking away the ability to see color? These questions will leave you wondering for years after you read The Giver. <br />Something that is very much argued about is the ambiguity of the ending. Sometimes, I do admit it was frustrating to be left with so many questions unanswered, but think about it this way; would you like a magician as much if he told the audience exactly how he did every trick? A true entertainer always leaves something to the mind of the audience. All in all, this book is either love-it-or hate-it. It all boils down to your own personal beliefs, morals, and upbringing. I think this is why the author didn't want to put in her own personal beliefs into the ending, and decided to leave it up to the reader's imagination. This book will never rust and will stand the test of time. Read it twenty-five years later and it will still be as relevant as it is today.
B00000JPHG|5.0|Bride of Chucky is actually Child's Play 4.  In Child's Play 3, Chucky went inside one of those big scary rides at a carnival and fell into a big fan and got himself hacked into pieces.  However, when Chucky was still human, he had himself a girlfriend who's been tracking Chucky ever since he transferred his soul into a Good Guy doll.  Using her manipulating skills, Tiffany convinces a corrupt cop to go into the police evidence storage room and get Chucky's remains.  Once she has what's left of Chucky, she takes him back to her trailer and, using pieces of other dolls, patches Chucky back together in a scene straight out of Frankenstein and then brings Chucky back to life.  Why has Tiffany done this?  Simple: She had real feelings for Chucky, and she was hoping that if she brought him back to life, he'd marry her.  Unfortunately, Chucky likes being a bachelor, so Tiff locks Chucky up in her trailer.  As a joke, Tiff gives Chucky a bride doll.  But Chucky gets the last laugh as he kills Tiff and transfers her soul into the bride doll.  Now stuck in the body of a doll herself, Tiff has no choice but to help Chucky.  Anyway, Chucky has good news and bad news.  The good news: Chucky and Tiffany need a medallion called the Heart of Damballa in order to transfer their souls into human bodies, and Chucky had it on him when he was killed as a human.  The bad news: Chucky's human body was buried in New Jersey, which is at least one state away from Tiffany's trailer.  So in order to get themselves human bodies, Tiff and Chucky have to trick a young man named Jessie and his girlfriend Jade into taking them to New Jersey.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it is a surprise!  This movie has something for everybody: Horror, action, comedy, and even a little romance.  I don't like two things about this movie: 1, The movie focuses mainly on Chucky and Tiffany and doesn't really develop the characters of Jade and Jessie.  2, If Chucky needed the Heart of Damballa totransfer his soul into a human body, then the first three movies were kinda pointless.  Even if Chucky got to his victim in time and managed to complete the ritual undisturbed, then he wouldn't have succeeded because he didn't have the Heart of Damballa.  Anyway, if you like the Child's Play movies, then I highly suggest seeing this movie!
B000002KCC|5.0|If the music of Neil Young is new to you....you'll not understand or appreciate what this album is all about...if you're a Neil Young fan....and haven't heard this album, then you NEED to listen.  It's his best ever.  It's raw and real and says alot about the drug culture and the music world.  I bought this as a 33 (vinyl) back in the end of July '75 for the top 40 song &quot;New Mama&quot;.  I was a Neil Young fan when I bought it...after I listened to it...I was a believer.  If you don't like it at first....keep listening and you'll understand.
B00004XOWM|2.0|...because I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot with a title like this. This album certainly has it's highs and lows, but the lows definitely outnumber the highs. And when Fred tries to rap - look out, thats when his extremely whiny vioce reaches its most irritating. There are a few good songs here, though. &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; is one of, if not the, best song Limp Bizkit has ever done. A combination of the Mission Impossible theme and Limp's own kick-@$$ attitude, the song has real depth to it, and it flat out rocks. I also like some of the more mellow songs on this album. &quot;Hold On&quot; is a good song, despite being quite far from Limp's usual style. I also kinda like &quot;It'll Be OK&quot; and &quot;Boiler&quot; is okay too. &quot;Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; is a very energetic, fun song to listen to. Unfortunately, many of the other songs on this album (&quot;My Generation,&quot; &quot;Getcha Groove On,&quot; &quot;Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle)&quot;) are downright plain, boring and/or just plain annoying. Three Dollar Bill, Y'All$ was a great CD, Significant Other was OK, hopefully Limp won't continue their downward spiral with their next album.
B0000062GK|5.0|.....Absolutely not!!! This CD is just amazing. I have all of Satch's CD's and just when you think that he can't do anything new and different, he does something new and different. The sounds that he gets out of his axe are just amazing! As long as he is playing, I am listening. There is not a cut on this CD that is not just wonderful to listen to. You can easily get lost in the entire thing.<br />BUY THIS CD!!!!!
B00004S6GL|3.0|Elliot Smith obviously has huge pop song writing talent.  When I first heard &quot;XO&quot; two years ago, I was truly floored.  But after listening to his new CD numerous times, I have to conclude that most of the songs on &quot;Figure 8&quot; just don't hold up.  Yes, the vocal harmonies, the song melodies, and the song orchestration all have Smith's typically post-1965 Beatle-esque touch.  But I can't, for the life of me, help feeling annoyed and disappointed when I listen to &quot;Figure 8.&quot;  The songs just don't deliver for me.  They are disturbingly whiny and have a meandering, incomplete quality to them.  And, the lyrics, with their indirect and confusing allusions to melancholy love and outsider status just strike me as trite.  Out of Smith's more &quot;commercial&quot; albums, I think &quot;XO&quot; is far superior to this one.
B00000JL86|5.0|&quot;Anastasia&quot; is truly an amazing and compelling film thet will leave you breathless!! The animation and artistry is incredible, the music is brilliant, the characters have wonderfully human emotions and the love story is magical and compelling with wonderful chemistry! And believe it or not, I have been watching animated films before I could walk and this film surpasses all of them! Enough said.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is as good as it gets. Best album of all time, brothers and sister. Need I say more?
0792156684|1.0|So this is the movie that garnered so much praise and worship.  Obviously this was not for the dialogue, as most of that is hackneyed phraseology suitable to be placed inside fortune cookies.  The plot is just as trite (for those of you not historically inclined, the boat DOES sink in the end).  The actors are interesting, especially Leonardo DiCaprio's uncanny and disturbing resemblance to a pre-pubescent girl.  Amidst all the clouds, there are only two moments that can possibly qualify as some silver lining.  First is when Kate Winslet is gratuitously naked.  However the brief respite brought by such hardcore nudity is lost in the rest of the miasma when one realizes that she disrobes so Leo can draw her.  A college-age male who sees a naked woman and thinks &quot;I have got to draw this&quot;?  Obviously the writers passed their childhood in a hormone-free state, for while the pencil IS a phallic symbol, there is nothing like the real thing for most young males.  The second positive scene is when a man leaps from the top of the ship as it is sinking and caroms off the propeller.  He makes a comical noise, and it is funny to watch him spin into the water.  However, such brief levity cannot counterbalance the rest of the movie, which is an overlong, overindulgent, sappy excuse for cinema.  However, all is not lost.  If you want to cleanse yourself with a great movie, check out the VHS title WELCOME TO SPRING BREAK which will set your Titanic-darkened world afire.  A hero named Skip Banacheck, a psycho killer who appears to be the ghost of a recently executed biker gang leader, mountains of hair held in place by oceans of hairspray, and the immortal pickup line &quot;You want to get naked?&quot; followed by its sole competitor &quot;You want to get sloppy.&quot;  All this takes place against the nonstop debauchery of spring break in South Florida.  This cinema gem is waiting for those numbed by such cliched collages of crud as Titanic.  Forget Leonardo, watch John Saxon!!!!!!!!!!
0790736039|3.0|I read the book \\"It\\" before I saw the movie. The book scared the .. out of me, but the movie just...didn't. There are a few scary parts when Pennywise shows his long and pointy teeth, but generally, he was too funny to frighten me all that much. Plus, the spider at the end was so stupid. I suppose maybe this movie would have been better if it hadn't been made for TV.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is the best hard science fiction novel that I ever read.  Frank Herbert's deep understanding of issues range from economics all the way to desert tundra.  The center plot of Paul of Atrides measures easily with the epic sagas of antiquity.  Majestic heroes, horrendous villains, an exotic environment, terrible wars, court backstabbing, messianic thrills, WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?<br />I read it back in College, and after countless SCFI stories this is easily the best one.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I once read a review of Bob Dylan's &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; which said &quot;every time I listen to this album, I learn something about life!&quot;  Well, that is how I feel about &quot;London Calling&quot;.  A great album.
B00004YZFR|5.0|As a fan of the early Stones, I first saw this in 1990 on video a few times, but it wasn't until I bought this Criterion edition last year and watched it many times that I realised how powerful and well put together this film really is.<br />While the film ostensibly deals with the Stone's 1969 American tour, for me it really represents a descent into some kind of hell, that is not only enivitable, but fascinating to watch at the same time. You know things are going wind up badly virtually from the beginning of the film as Jagger and Watts are replayed radio bites detailing the aftermath of the Altamont concert (deaths, births, OD's &amp; scuffles) as the camera records their reactions. This knowledge casts a deathly air over all the footage to follow, especially the concert preparations themselves, as the chaos and egocentric personalities concerned with them are all the more transparent and the results of which all the more enivitable.<br />The Stones (in my opinion) are at their peak here, sounding really cohesive as a group (even though Mick Taylor was new) and really rocking as a result. Other musicians such as Ike and Tina Turner (who apparently Mick was jealous of because her stage costume looked better under lights than his), Jefferson Airplane and The Flying Burrito Brothers also make short appearances, and provide some historical background, however for me the music takes a back seat to what is going on around it.<br />As the Stones play Madison Square Gardens and record in the studio (including a nice version of &quot;Brown Horses&quot;), preparations are underway for the Stones to do a free concert somewhere in San Fransisco as a nice gesture (and partly in response to negative feedback about high concert prices) for the people of San Fran. The amount of problems, technicalities, and greedy sensationalists you see in these scenes helps set the stage (literally) for what is to come when the big day arrives.<br />The first view of Altamont you get is an awesome helicopter view of thousands upon thousands of cars and people walking towards the site itself. The helicopter lands, Mick gets punched in the face and it's all downhill from there. All the big and little details that helped turn Altamont into the end of an era are laid to bare, and judging by what is shown it is little wonder it did turn out as bad as it did...although it is hard to say how it could have been worse. <br />As I said earlier, I liken it to a descent into hell, and by the time The Stones are on stage there is so much chaos and confusion it's a nightmare. It's the little details that stick with me : the guy in the audience trying to tell Jagger how bad things are and Mick misinterpreting him and dancing harder, the crowd surging everytime an Angel jumps in to beat someone up, the fat naked woman climbing over everybody with one of the scariest pairs of eyes I've ever seen, an alsatian dog calmly crossing the stage, one of the Angels giving Mick a prolonged condescending/nasty stare and my favourite where a psycho-Joe Cocker lookalike stands about a metre away from Mick while grimacing and grinding his teeth to the world's worst trip before being noticed by a Hell's Angel and pulled off the stage. These details are only a small snippet of the madness within the second half on the film and certainly by the end I was stunned and in awe of not only the events themselves, but the competency of the Maysles Brothers in recording and displaying them.<br />It is also of little wonder that the next Stones tour (1972) of the United States was far better organised, with better security, bigger and taller stages and seemingly slicker and more souless. Although Robert Frank's &quot;----sucker Blues&quot; shows quite a bit of interesting behind the scenes activity (which I won't go into here), certainly there is very little on stage and the both the music and the film itself cannot hold a candle to this combined effort of music, cinema and history.<br />The DVDof &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; comes with a very good array of extras. Two large galleries worth of photos taken at Altamont, A rather large booklet, The whole of the radio broadcast that is used as snippets within the film (Sam Cutler and Sonny Barger are absolute highlights!!), excerpts from another radio broadcast the Stones did during the tour and an informative commentry from one of the Maysles brothers &amp; Charlottle Zerwin.
6305807086|5.0|In today's movies we are all, all to used to seeing the same thing done over and over again.  It is such a nice break when a movie as original as this comes along.  The plot of the movie is terrific and the casting was done very well.  Athough basically all the characters are odd and strange, some how they still come off likable and beleavable.  A wonderful surprise and wonderful DVD also.  If you are an intelligent viewer and want something different, it's a must see.
B00004XPOZ|4.0|Well, mostly I was just glad they re-released the special edition because I missed out the last time it was available. The sneak peak at Episode II was cool as it gives a glimpse into the future of the prequel trilogy. However, what the heck is the big deal with not releasing the DVD of the original trilogy? Why just a vhs version? Really this is just a marketing ploy to get suckers like me to buy the trilogy who missed out the first time this was available. That's the only real reason why I don't give this 5 stars. It's story is timeless and lets face it- there is nothing cooler than the original debut \\"A New Hope\\"- it still holds it's own after more than 20 years and that is why it is still loved and embraced by millions.
B00005AFVR|1.0|How many more 'greatest' hits albums can one artist produce before his fans start crying foul? The absurdity here is almost reaching Jimi Hendrix levels. Unfortunately, now instead of getting to hear some of the songs that I enjoy from Bruce like 'Badlands' or 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out', I have to listen to literally 20 minutes of band introductions. Hey, if I want to meet the band, I will look at and then read the inside of the CD cover! I would be very surprised if anyone outside of the New Jersey area or maybe one of the nearby depressing poser towns like Allentown, PA actually enjoys this CD. Bruce is better then this and it hurts!
B0000508U6|5.0|Being a Brit myself, I take pride in seeing bands such as Coldplay, Travis and Muse take on America the way they do. This wonderful debut album by Coldplay is once again (after the likes of Travis and Stereophonics) a breeze of fresh air, that rises above the poppy rubbish that adorns the top of the charts here in America. May they continue to inspire us folk to living a better life with their music as our backdrop.
0446677450|1.0|Wow...what an incredibly bad book.  I really do not understand what it is about this book that has kept it on the best seller list.  I read it in about two hours and, upon finishing, realized that I learned absolutely nothing.  <br />Invest in real estate, the author says.  Hmm, thought I.  As soon as I pay off my student loans, get a job that pays double my current salary, and find a reasonable rate on car insurance, I'll  be in a position to THINK about doing that.<br />What this book lacks is REALISTIC advice.  Telling readers &quot;Don't work for money, make money work for you&quot; means nothing when you don't have the capital to start your own business ('cuz if I did, I wouldn't be reading this book...get it?).  I've been reading a lot of books on financial planning lately and this one has to be the least helpful of all the ones I've looked at.  <br />Perhaps someone who has an economics background might like the book, but I found it difficult to understand at times and just plain boring the others.  There's better stuff out there.  The &quot;inside secrets&quot; you're hoping to find are not in this book.
B000002J27|4.0|WARNING:  If you are a fan of the pop oriented Genesis, this record may very well not be for you.  However, if you appreciate the creative side of this Progressive Rock Band than you will be very satisfied with the music on A Trick Of The Tail.<br />This release is a transition record for Genesis as Phil Collins took over the lead vocal duties from the recently departed, Peter Gabriel.  His vocals are good, but his drumming is even better.  The varied drum rolls throughout Squonk are amazing.  The slightly off beat accents on Dance With The Volcano are creative in a way that I have never heard before.<br />The main attracction on this record is the keyboard sounds of Tony Banks.  There are times that his style is somewhat overbearing to the point where you can not even hear Steve Hackett's guitar.  However, there are more moments when his style is simply beatiful.  Just listen to the classical touches in Mad Man Moon and Ripples.  The man indeed shows a lot of depth in his repetoire.<br />Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford contribute some nice guitar toucehs here and there but most notably on Entangled and Ripples.  The soloing on the latter has quite a unique spacey touch that has rarely if ever been duplicated.  Its too bad Steve Hackett did not lobby harder to have his contributions be more centralized in the band's overall sound.  This hurts Genesis' sound somewhat when compared to other progressive music like Yes, Pink Floyd, or Asia.<br />None the less, this is a strong recording by this band.  Genesis would later go on to become a top 40 hit band which compromised their overall creativity.  But this release sticks to the talents of the band and is a good example of quality Progressive Rock.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I thought Legally Blonde was a hilarious movie about a blonde going to Harvard.  Just that concept makes me know the movie is a comedy.  I went to see this movie with my boyfriend, and even he thought it was funny.  I really liked this movie because Reese and all the other actors are great, the theme is great, and it's just a fun, kickback movie for teens to go see.
6300213498|4.0|The crew of the Enterprise visits an idyllic, pre-industrialized world inhabited by the docile hill-people and the greedy villagers.  Not incorporated into the Federation of Planets, this pre-techno world is supposed to be free of any interference by either the Federation or the Klingon empire.  Nevertheless, on a routine survey, the villagers attack the hill people with crude rifles - though that requires technology beyond them.  With Mr. Spock severely injured, Kirk stays behind looking for evidence that the Klingons are illegally supplying technology that will allow the villagers to conquer the planet and rule it for the Klingons.  Reuniting with the Hill People, among whom Kirk once lived, Kirk hooks up with their leader, Tyree and his wife, the bewitching Nona.  Sneaking into the Villagers' stronghold, Kirk finds evidence of non-indigenous technology (carbon-free metal tools are a big tip-off).  Though implicating the Klingons, Kirk now faces an even bigger quandry - allow the rapacious villagers to conquer the planet, or give the hill-people the means to fight back.  Either alternative gurantees bloodshed, with the decision coming down to ensuring either the genocide of the hill people or a ceaseless and bloody war with the villagers.  Dr. McCoy, who stayed planetside with Kirk, provides the perfect moral foil for Kirk who is defiantly pro-defense.<br />I must have seen this episode a hundred times as a kid, never knowing that it was obviously a take on the war in Vietnam which had already escalated by then.  The weird part is how this film makes as the enemies, the urbanized and technologically advanced villagers, which is more analogous to the Southern Vietnamese regime.  Like the very best sci-fi, when it must be topical, the script is dignified enough to explore both sides.  It's a weak episode of Trek, suffering because the comedy team of Bones and Spock spends much of the time apart (with Spock stuck on the Enterprise, recuperating from the attack in the beginning of the episode).  The script tries juicing things up with the wicked-hot Nona and an attack by the \\"Mugato\\", a sort of white, horned gorilla with poison fangs, that both seem to distract from the message of the show (which may have been the biggest reason for putting them there - the guys who write for Trek were brave, but to a fault).  A flawed but still important episode.beginning of the episode).

6304057709|5.0|This is a deeply satisfying movie in all regards.  The writing is superb---witty and sad.  The performances are excellent!  Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, in particular, are especially endearing and inspired.  The scenery makes you breathless.  This film made me laugh and cry.  I have not read the book, but I fail to see how it could possibly be better than the movie.  Of all the Jane Austen adaptations I have seen (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), I found this to be my favorite.  Watch it!  You won't regret it.  How did Ang Lee NOT win an oscar?
B00003CXWV|4.0|This is a great movie, based on a true story.  The performances here are top notch, starting with Johnny Depp.  Penelope Cruz does a great job as well, and Ray Liotta is brilliant.  This is based on a true story of how cocaine became mainstream, and I like the fact that they didn't glorify it too much, and showed the pitfalls of living a life on drugs.  Definitely one to buy on DVD.
6300185311|3.0|Rock Hudson stars as a hypochondriac who misinterprets a conversation his doctor is having about a dying man and believes he is the man that is on his way out.  He confides his situation to neighbour and pal Tony Randall so they can find someone for his wife, Doris Day.  Of course, there are a lot of crazy mix-ups that you would expect with this kind of film.  I honestly can't say I laughed very much.  I've never found any of the star trio to be particularly appealing, so there probably wasn't much of a chance of me really enjoying this at all.  Paul Lynde plays a cemetery plot salesman and is really funny.  The movie is a pleasant time filler, but there's not much here that's fresh or even interesting, and I suspect audiences today will think they've seen it all before.

Instantly, this book caught my attention and I've been looking for it ever since.  I love mysteries and this book made me like them even more!  It's about 10 different people, strangers really, who get stuck on this island together.  Slowly, they start disappearing and getting murdered, one by one.  But there are surprises everywhere.  If you like murder mysteries, YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK!
0393312836|1.0|Clockwork Orange is a classic, eh? Hmmm. I for one just didn't like it. After the first several pages laden with unintelligible, invented slang, the novel contains enough English to be understandable, but the writing style remains unengaging and flecked with that neologic nonsense. The English language can be precise and beautiful, as proven by authors ranging from Edgar Allan Poe to William F. Buckley Jr; however, Anthony Burgess chooses to masscre it. Alright, I'm a purist, but, diction aside, the story still does nothing to engross the reader--at least not the reader pythia. Not wanting to reveal too much to those who do want to read this (fine, try it, but don't expect the thought-provoking masterpiece this novel is often reckoned!), I will simply say that the narrator/protagonist is a kid with a penchant for gang violence and classical music. Tasteless. Oh, in case you're wondering, no, I am not the type of person who prefers warm, fuzzy, feel-good novels. Currently, my two favorite novels are Orwell's 1984 and Levin's This Perfect Day--would you believe that this drossy Clockwork Orange is sometimes catagorized with these? It doesn't belong there. It just doesn't belong. <br />Now that I'm done, I'll admit that I only read about a third of this novel and merely skimmed the remainder, so invalidate my review if that pleases you. Clockwork Orange simply was not worth reading!<br />pythia

6300184064|1.0|Hearing that Brazil is a dystopian film, I decided to watch it. Well. . . .it's, um, different. . .and confusing. . .and exceedingly stupid. . .and British, very British. Brazil is definitely of more interest to Monty Python enthusiasts than to dystopiaphiles.  Fellow devotees of this genre, you are better off to stay with the novels, but if you must watch a movie, The Truman Show, while not technically a dystopia, might be of interest. As for Brazil, it has is risible moments--indeed, the<br />entire movie is laughable, but this is exclusively due to its almost unimaginable crappiness. Mom agrees. Another reviewer, play4bux, has remarked that \\"this film shows sparks of creativity here and there, but will ultimately just deprive you of 2 1/2 hours you could have put to better use.\\" Amen!<br />pythia
0767803434|5.0|This movie was Awsome! The casting for this movie was among the best i'have ever seen. Harrison Ford along with Gary Oldman and Liesel Matthews(who by the way is a beautiful girl) made for a great movie. The action was great and the plane set was extremely detailed. Wolfgang Peterson (the director) made sure to include every detail, he and the rest of the crew did an excellent job. <br />I would recommend this movie to all audiences..Great MOVIE!!!!

B000002H33|4.0|Master of Puppets illustrates why Metallica was one of the most important metal bands ever.<br />After giving birth to thrash with Kill 'Em All, Metallica began refining their innovations with Ride the Lightning, which added a bit more maturity and compositional quality. Master of Puppets is a much larger step in the same direction, and had the band incorporating more progressive elements into their music. It'd be hard to count the metal bands doing half the pioneering things Metallica was doing.<br />The acoustic, quiet introduction to &quot;Battery&quot; explodes under an aggressive onslaught of hyperkinetic, muscular riffs and thick, heavy arrangements that characterize the entire album. That's not to say it's redundant, though. All eight songs are excellent, featuring enough variation of tempo and texture to ensure that they never get boring, which is crucial when some songs extend for eight minutes (&quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; &quot;Disposable Heroes,&quot; &quot;Orion&quot;). Cripes, you could dissect the riffery of the title track and probably create half a dozen normal metal songs. That&quot;s part of Metallica's appeal: they cram a ton of ideas into their music, but all songs are perfectly crafted without the slightest sense of disjointed songwriting.<br />Speaking of the title track, it in particular sports a dynamic composition, where its middle section diminishes into a quieter, evocative guitar solo (one of the few played by Hetfield) before taking off all over again. &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; mirrors &quot;Fade to Black&quot; in its progression of intensity. It starts with haunting melodies, turning up the crunch for the chorus, then kicks into high gear with a weighty, fast riff and a glistening lead that carries the song to its vengeful apogee. Hetfield isn't quite a master lyricist, but for the first time in Metallica's career, the lyrics were insightful with effective diction. Note the telling and vitriolic &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; or &quot;Leper Messiah.&quot; Hetfield was never a great singer, but he was a good metal vocalist. Although his ferocity was tempered by youthful pipes, he still managed to convey the viciousness required of music so heavy, so furious.<br />And even when the band eschewed words and singing, they could impress. &quot;Orion&quot; is a marvel of metal songwriting, being an eight minute instrumental with precise, articulate solos (including a short-but-sweet one from the late bassist Cliff Burton) and big, chugging riffs. Most metal bands wrote instrumentals that were three or four minutes long...never eight. But Metallica did it, and they did it well enough to make songs like &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;To Live Is To Die&quot; (from ...And Justice) among my favorite metal instrumentals.<br />Add my voice to the many, many fans who have rated this album five stars (about 362 at the time of this writing). If Master of Puppets isn't the best metal album ever, it's very very close.ot; or &quot;Leper Messiah.&quot; Hetfield was never a great singer, but he was a good metal vocalist.

B00000JQFL|5.0|I own almost every Earth, Wind &amp; Fire disc made including Maurice's solo album, which is out of print, and Philip Bailey's Chinese Wall. This is one of the best discs I own, ranking up there with Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Goin' On.&quot; This disc will keep your head noddin.'In my opinion Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is the greatest band of all time, maybe with the exception of the Isley Brothers who have been putting it down since the 50's, and gave Jimi Hendrix his start. Never mind the Beatles who copied the Isley's &quot;Shout,&quot; you want the best buy &quot; Gratitude.&quot;
B000050XEI|5.0|The great popularity of &quot;Only Time&quot; and the anticipated popularity of &quot;May It Be&quot; on the LORD OF THE RINGS soundtrack are drawing a lot of people to Enya.  I do think it fair to warn the new fans, though, not to expect a lot of music that sounds like &quot;Only Time&quot; on this album.  Enya's music is deep and soul searching, subtle in such a way that many used to the pop music on the radio aren't used to.  So sample this music and if you buy the CD, give it time.  There's much beauty here, but it's deep and not on the surface.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge completely capitvated me.  I was drawn in by the pure fantasy - the story, the scenery, the singing and the fantastic acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  And Ewan's voice, WOW!!  This movie has what so many movies lack these days, pure magic.  If you want to be charmed, entertained, and inspired, see Moulin Rouge, over and over again.  I can't say enough wonderful words to describe how moved I was by this movie.  It really is fantastic!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Hands down no other movie I have seen compared to this film. The acting was flawless, I love the camera work, and just everything!! The Novell, which I read after seeing the movie was just as good, was great to begin with!!! And the movie just brought everything to life! I dont think anyone could have played Tyler Durden the way Brad Pitt did! That is exactly how I would have imagined Brad Pitt! The first time I saw this movie I was blown away! I taped it, I bought the video, I bought the book, read it in about three days, and was not the least bit dissapointing. the movie is a great conversation starter too, because it leaves alot of doors open, but it doesant leave the audience puzzled. After seeing it, you wont say &quot; Wait, I dont get it?&quot; Youll understand whats happening but at the same time youll discuss it deeply afterwards. The movie delves into alot of deep issues, certain problems with modern society. And no matter who you are, after seeing this, you will not be able to disagree with the message in this movie. Actually there are a few messages, but they all connect to one thing. Although its a very graphic and violent movie, its not just pointless violence, it all has a part in the movie. GO see it, what can I say, greatest film ever!!
B00004U5SC|5.0|Shane is probably the definitive western plot, it has a myth built into it like know other film I have ever seen. It was I believe born of a time and a place of honor and virtue that is little seen in films of today. Shane at first is a little on edge, spent a little too long in the wild country, then his strength of character is misinterpreted by the local ranchers as cowardice, trying as he is to change his ways, but Shane standing in the rain soon dispels this opinion. When he goes back into the bar where he was rousted. There is a great scene here when the cowpuncher Chris tries to bully Shane once more. The cowpuncher next to Chris says deal me out, Chris says what's the matter? and the puncher that you never see says, let's just say I'm superstitious. I've seen dam few bloody noses in all the fights I have seen on film but Shane procures the best. What I really love about this film is that you never find out who Shane really is or just what kind of a man he really is and the kind of metal that he is made of until the end of the film, then it's too late. Just enough time for the boy to say goodbye to Shane, Shane tells him to grow up strong and straight, and to take care of his folks and in his passing everyman says goodbye to the childhood within. The boy calls out in vain the moment is forever.  It's one Great film, to all those who love the sentiment of the western and have never seen Shane I envy you that viewing.

0783114893|2.0|How Hitcher went from being a being a 1986 bomb with audiences and critics to becoming a beloved psychological classic here in Amazon's bargain bin eludes me.  C. Thomas Howell plays a young student who picks up a psychotic hitchhiker on a cross country drive. Rutger Hauer, fresh from his cryptic disturbing role in BladeRunner capitalizes on his frosty eyes, Arayan uberman looks &amp; emotionless persona to play the title role. In hindsight it seems the Hitcher develops a fondness for the young driver and decides to leave him presents at every stop on his trek to express his fondness. While some people leave flowers, our John Ryder likes to leave murders. A finger in your fries substitutes for a box of cherry chocolates.  This might have made for an interesting dynamic if there was even a hint of a connection going on between them. Instead the director plays a no hints lame game of &quot;guess what is in my hand.&quot;  Ryders motivations only begin to become slightly clearer far too late in the film. And Howell's mutual homoerotic attraction is never hinted at. And so comes completely out of left field leaving first time viewers rolling their eyes. It is recognized as a cheat reveal which seems arbitrary instead of a controlled calculation to make you rethink the film in a new light. Unlike the Sixth Sense where everything comes into focus, the conclusion doesn't make the film more interesting. It actually makes you feel sorry you invested time at all with a character who wasn't all that interesting to begin with. To quote a line from &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;There is such a fine line between clever and stupid.&quot;  It is possible those going back for a second dip, left off their heels with disturbed feelings on their first attempt, are comforted they know what is going on and now enjoy it as tale of strange attraction. But I think its audience will remain people who have strange attractions to bad movies.

B00000J2PH|5.0|In this day and age, it is rare to find someone who truly possesses enough musical talent to write original songs, sing with soul and play the piano. Carole King has all three of these talents, which she displays throughout the entirety of her album.   King has a voice that is naturally beautiful. She doesn't force herself to sound like someone she's not. She sings right from her heart.   Her songs express true emotions. Her lyrics tell stories and don't seem the least bit contrived. All the songs will have you beating to the rhythm and singing along.   If you are even considering this album, go ahead and buy it. It's one of the finest!
0140386335|3.0|Michael Ende clearly had a wonderful imagination.  His book is rich in images and imaginary beings.  This book gave me a buffet of possible characters for stories to tell my daughters. However, Ende never really does much with his characters.  Even the protagonist, a young boy who undergoes a tranformation from his journeys, seems a little one dimensional.  This may be a problem of the translation, but since I don't read German, I will never know.  I would suggest reading Ende's &quot;Momo&quot; instead.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|After seeing the movie in the theater, I knew I had to get it on DVD.  I must have watched my DVD 5 times since i bought it.  With the Academy Award winners: Angelina Jolie, Nick Cage, and Robert Duvall, this film had 5 star potential right from the start.  With Eleanor, and Jerry Bruckheimer as the producer (who has made some of the classic action movies: The Rock, Con Air, and Armageddon), this flick has the mojo to be the best Guy Movie ever, sadly it got bad reveiws and a bad rep.
055321263X|4.0|As one of the earliest mystery novels, Wilkie Collins's &quot;The Woman in White&quot; offers a whirlwind of a plot, even surpassing in complexity the epic constructions of Collins's friend and colleague Charles Dickens.  &quot;The Woman in White&quot; does not merely assemble a cast of bland characters and present a linear &quot;whodunit&quot; style of mystery; rather, it's the story of a well-planned conspiracy and criminal process in which the hero becomes unwittingly involved and must play detective to foil the villains and set things right.   <br />The protagonist is a young art instructor named Walter Hartright who is hired to be a personal tutor for the wards of a wealthy man living in a stately English country manor.  One evening before embarking on his new job, Walter encounters a mysterious young woman, dressed in white, wandering the roads outside of London.  He doesn't get her name, but he helps her to her destination before finding out that she has escaped from a mental asylum.  <br />One of the two wards Walter is to instruct is a beautiful young woman named Laura Fairlie who happens to bear a striking resemblance to the woman in white he had met accidentally.  He and Laura fall in love with each other, but she is engaged to be married to a baronet named Sir Percival Glyde, many years her senior.  Laura's half-sister, Marian Halcombe, doesn't like the guy -- or his jovial but devious Italian friend, Count Fosco, who happens to be married to Laura's aunt.  And from there, a death, an inheritance, and a falsification of identity add to the complications.  <br />Most of the narration is done by Walter, but Collins lets other characters give their points of view on certain events, as though we were hearing their testimonies at a trial.  What is most intriguing about this approach is that, during the early parts of the novel when these people are giving their narratives, we know that a crime has been committed but we are still not exactly sure of its nature.  Collins is good at throwing around red herrings to tease the reader into making false guesses and jumping to conclusions.  <br />There is no cause for complaint about the plot, which is air-tight with a minimum of contrivances.  In fact, the scheme that the villains invent is so clever and solid and runs so smoothly that they never have to resort to violence or attempts on anyone's life to ensure their success; and so, unfortunately for me, the situations never feel as suspenseful as they could.  It's a good, tense book; I just think that Collins pulled some punches with the villainy.
B000002LMM|5.0|As a frequent visitor to the real towns that the series was filmed at I can say that as David lynch captured the essence of the place in the series and later in the movie so did Angelo badalamenti in this CD. I love going to the falls or have a pie at the diner (Mar-T cafe) while listening to this CD in my car!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge in one word?  EEEP!  OK, so that's not a real word.  But whatever.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!  The music is splendiferous, the acting is great, the storyline is original, and Ewan McGregor is SUCH a good singer!  I was totally amazed!  I was also impressed by Nichole Kidman's musical ability.  Who would have thought, eh?<br />Young Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to Paris in 1899 to write.  It is the era of the Bohemian Revolution!  He soon meets up with Toulouse Latrec (John Legizumo), our token gratuitous historical character.  Toulouse, along with 3 other Bohemians, take Christian to the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where the beautiful Satine (Nichole Kidman) is the star of the show.  Christian falls in love immediately, and soon wins her love in return.  All happiness and fluffiness, right?  But there is a problem.  A man known only as The Duke (he doesn't really have a name...), played by Richard Roxburgh, wants Satine all to himself.  He signs a contract with Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge.  The contract states that the Duke with provide money for Spectacular Spectacular (a Bohemian stage production written by none other than Christian) if Zidler will insure that Satine will be bound to him and him alone (the Duke, not Zidler).  Zidler agrees, but Satine refuses to stop seeing Christian.  Madness, musical numbers, and a death insues!  I'm not saying who dies.  But it's sad.  I cried.  But it was a GREAT movie!!!  I would DEFINITELY recommend it to ANYONE!

0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman is the great conclusion in the His Dark Materials trilogy- the trilogy that began with The Golden Compass and was continued in The Subtle Knife. Lyra and Will, the heroes from earlier books, face even greater challenges in this edition. Great discoveries about Dust are made, and we see returns of favorite characters, including Mary Malone, Serefina Pekkala, Iorek Byrnison, and &quot;bad guys&quot; Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel. The witches' prophecy is fulfilled, and Lyra and Will must journey into the dankest, darkest world yet- the world of the Dead. Some friends, who had died in previous books, make a reapearance. New friends and allies are met, including Balthamos, Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia. A great story of sacrifice, adventure, love, friendship, allies, and just about everything else, The Amber Spyglass is sure to thrill all who turn these pages.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I can't believe how many people completely missed the point of this movie. In reading reviews it's very easy to tell who expected a Disney/Hollywood epic and who was ready to accept the movie for what it was. The film attempts to show the reality of America's drug problem and it does so with various techniques, primarily by using handheld cameras and rough editing, making you feel like part of the action. <br />What most people misunderstand about this movie is the very premise upon which it stands. Namely, drugs are everywhere and nobody is immune from their effects. Even upper-class white prep-school students are doing it. And I can't even believe the idiotic comments I've read that cite this portion of the movie as unbelievable because these rich kids did drugs for \\"no apparent reason.\\" Did you *watch* the film? That's its point! If people believe that these rich white kids aren't doing drugs because \\"there's no apparent reason for it\\" then what are they really saying? What *are* these \\"apparent reasons\\" they mention? Being poor? Being black? Coming from a broken home? It's amazing how transparent our culture becomes when we discuss these issues. What we really believe becomes clear.<br />This movie at least tried to dispel the myth that the only hard-drug users in America are poor blacks in the inner city. Most negative reviews come from people who just can't accept that fact and are truly part of the problem that the heroes of the movie are trying to defeat. The greatest ally of this problem is people not believing there really is one.<br />On a filmmaking level, I appreciate what the director was attempting to do. The film was raw and had a documentary feel to it. If you want the Disney version of a drug movie that makes you feel safe and sound as long as you stay away form cities and/or minorities, don't watch this. But if you want a film that makes you feel like you are actually one of its characters and that your own mother might be on something, then Traffic is your movie. <br />Any time a film that tries to depict the reality of a situation is made, we usually will see two camps of reviewers - loved it or hated it. That's because one group was able to understand the movie and what it was trying to do and the other group gets upset because they weren't \\"entertained\\" by it, the camera shakes a lot, there weren't enough special effects, the film was grainy, etc., just missing the point totally. This film was trying to wake people up from their coma and realize that America has a serious drug problem, and everyone is affected by it. Usually we don't realize this until it's too late (as in Michael Douglas' character's case). I'm amazed at how many people still seem to have their head buried in the sand after seeing it, citing the fact that rich white kids doing drugs is an \\"unbelievable\\" element of the movie. It must be nice to live in their enchanted fantasy world where rich white people don't use drugs.<br />On a final note, the DVD itself gets only 3.5 stars. For such a unique movie there are very few extra features on the DVD discussing it. There isn't even a commentary, which in my opinion is just inexcusable in this age of technology. There is no reason to not include these extra features, other than the fact they want to later release a special edition with a commentary and make us buy both versions.

1884822312|4.0|I like the solutions.  The key move is shown, but the next (obvious) move is for you to find. For a while I thought some of the solutions were wrong, but is far easier to say the typography or the book is wrong, when in actuality, it is us that made the error.<br />Chess is a visual game, so get the visual book. I mean how many chess players have those books with algebraic solutions?  Those books are okay, if you willing to spend weeks or months in that part of the tree.  No me, I need to know how now, what to look for and avoid.<br />The best thing I learned from this book, is containment.  You have to contain your opponent (like what Star Trek does to their warp core, they gotta contain the warp core, otherwise the ship blows up)<br />I like the smaller yet, 'manly' version of this book,  the larger version is 'too manly'.
0441003257|4.0|This is a fun book, with a lot of humor. I didn't think it was as good as some of Gaiman's other work, and not up ot snuff with the better Douglas Adams books. It might be that Terry Pratchett's style just doesn't work for me, or maybe the two author's styles just didn't mix very well. <br />There seemed to be a couple of places were the timing on jokes fell a little bit flat, or where the jokes just didn't hold up.<br />I still give it a thumbs up, and reccomend it.

0380789019|5.0|Great Book. If you enjoy British humor, this will make you laugh. Gaiman picks up in the footsteps of Douglas Adams, though not as rollicking and probably a with a stronger emphasis on storytelling.<br />It's good fantasy, and a quick read. If any of you out there are bankers, or know some, this book gives an interesting description of where that training will get you if you're ever tossed in the sewers with mystical rats and ancient boars.
0786915749|3.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the first, and by far the best, book detailing the world of Krynn invented by Weis and Hickman.  Some additional 80 books have been written in the setting, and only a handful - some of the other ones by the original authors - are worth reading. The characters and settings are magnificently vivid and interesting enough to spark a teenager's love of reading.  It certainly did that for me.  I practically adored this book and its characters for years.   Unfortunately, rereading this as an adult was disappointing.  There were too many inconsistencies for believability, even in a fantasy setting.

0385501560|3.0|Well... Choke provides some very interesting and funny moments; some profound others twisted. Where Chuck gets his material I dont want to know, wait maybe i do. The reason I didn't give this book higher marks is because it seems alittle less refined then Fight Club. It doesn't really break any new ground but it definitely is entertaining. Its got a bit of vonnegute's surreal weirdness mixed with Irving Welsh's brutality/ harsh reality. Maybe a little overly stylized... but its not as good/bad as people say.

It's one of those movies that you and your sweetheart can curl up with late at night and really enjoy it. Although it is a bit lenghty, in the end you will end up enjoying it.
0679720200|5.0|A veces al  caminar por la calle yo  también he  sentido esa desazón, esa falta de raíces en el mundo y pese a tener padre y madre,  hermanos  y esposa, siento que no pertenezco a este mundo, que yo también como el personaje de Camus,  soy un extranjero en este mundo, que solo estoy de paso y que no importa lo que haga para cambiarlo siempre será así y jamás será de otra forma. En esos momentos en los que tengo un ataque fuerte de abusurdismo, veo lo banal, y a veces es aún mas fuerte que la depresión, pues en las depresiones te preocupas por que la gente no te quiere, en estos momentos eso no te importa ya, nada te importa. Mucha gente lo achaca a la falta de Dios, a la falta de raices, a la falta de amor, sin saber que a veces los excesos de la vida pueden producir ese mismo efecto y quizás hasta mucho peor. Camus nos muestra en su novela a un hombre  que no tiene afectos ni pasiones, un hombre que sin querer mata, y sin querer muere y todo alrededor, vida y muerte, esta imbuido del sentido del absurdo.<br />Luis Méndez
B000001GQT|5.0|In my opinion, as well as the opinion of many critics, Herbert von Karajan was the greatest conductor of Richard Strauss. To me it seems almost as if Strauss's music was made for Karajan and Karajan was made to conduct Strauss's music. Often times Karajan is criticized(and unfairly) for his balanced, overly smooth conducting. For many composers, the Karajan sound doesn't work. For Strauss, it's perfect. In these amazing performances, Karajan paints an amazing picture of the music and its philosophical inspiration. He is perfectly in tune with Strauss's wishes, never overarticulating the individual notes(as Strauss preferred), and turning the music into a larger, deeply profound musical statement. For lovers of Strauss and Karajan, this is an amazing album that showcases the musical genius of both. For lovers of drama and philosphy, this is a performance that shows that music does a better job of conveying emotion, values, and ideas than ever could words. For lovers of movies, this is also a must have. You will recognize the opening of Also Sprach Zarathustra from Kubrick's 2001, and listening to the whole piece is definitely necessary. Get this recording. It is an integral part of any good music collection.

B00005LMBK|5.0|Ah yes, Gorillaz, the breakthrough sound of a musical decade slowly turning to crap.  Gorillaz, I must say, are an excellent collaboration of musicians from all different spectrums of the musical scene.  With blends of alternative, &quot;zombie hip-hop&quot;, dance, melodious grooves, and depressive slurs, Gorillaz have found a sound that has been absent from the charts for quite some time.  I grew up with Seattle grunge, so I am not a fan of hip-hop or rap, but when I heard the single, &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; I was immediately hooked with it's catchy chorus.  And that is by far not the best song on the album, and I would be hard pressed to even classify a best song.  Another excellent point for this group is that, right now anyway, they are not getting much airplay in the states, which makes them even more genuine and not under-appreciated for just one single.  I am currently living in Germany, and they are quite big over here, so I am grateful for being exposed to this fantastic four and their unique sound they supply.
0553106635|4.0|Martin is at times both a joy and a curse to read.  His compelling novels bring you back for more, however he has a bad habit of killing off lead characters faster than the People's Republic of China knocks off political dissidents.  This is the 3rd of 6 scheduled books, and at one insidious point, when several of my favorite (good guy) lead characters are suddenly murdered, I was disconsolate and almost disgustedly threw the book away.  It did take me several days before I got over my disappointment and remorse to pick up the book to finish it.  Martin does work hard to rebuild different characters to cheer for; however, I hope Martin refrains from such skullduggery in the future, as I doubt I will be as forgiving the next time.
0792844882|4.0|I like this movie, it has a lot of beautiful women in it, and lots of nudity. The story is good, but best of all, Elizabeth Berkley looks really, really great. This DVD is priced just right to own.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is an anthology of all The Beatles number 1 hits in England , and America . The collection highlights how amazingly quickly The Beatles evolved from a teen pop sensation into the cutting edge band that was to guide a whole generation , musically and culturally , throughout the Sixties .<BR>The Beatles had an incredible 27 number 1 singles , in a prolific eight year period , and they never took the easy option , as each single was a development upon the last . This c.d. contains some of the greatest singles ever recorded , and thankfully the remastered sound does the music justice as it is the best sounding Beatles c.d. that I've heard . The packaging is also excellent as it shows the picture covers of these singles from around the world ( it's almost a time capsule of the Sixties ) .<BR>I've deducted a star for the lightweight early singles , and Yellow Submarine .

0064409422|5.0|I read a story in the paper recently that says the publisher is considering self-censorship -- taking out the Christian symbolism and market the books to sell like hotcakes (re: Harry Potter books).<br />Children have always loved fantasy books, it seems, and Harry Potter is continuing proof of that. But I and the generation before me grew up on the Narnia books, and I will always treasure first having it read to me, and later tackling it on my own.<br />The story is a great allegory of Christ and his resurrection, but it also teaches more universal morals (non-specific to Christians) such as the virtue of honesty, sacrifice, mercy, kindness and so on. As a journalist, I am prepared to fight even the snakiest and slimiest examples of the written word. Never did I imagine that I would ever have to defend such a wonderful book like this.<br />The book is decades old, but the characters are still fresh, the conflicts are still real, and the lessons are still applicable. It will be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Many Christians and non-Christians have and will continue to enjoy this book. And if you are a non-Christian who is so utterly distrubed by messages of peace and mercy, that's fine by me. But I'm not making another version of this book for you.<br />&quot;There is more than one way to burn a book.  And the world is full of people running around with lit matches...&quot;  (from &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;)

0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning was a wonderful opening to a wonderful new series. The characters are well thought out and entertaining. Anyone who calls Lemony Snicket a J.K. wanna-be is gonna have to go through me, first! I'm both a die hard Lemony Snicket and J.K. Rowling fan, and I very little that reflects on the other. Klaus is not a wanna-be Harry Potter, he's more interested in reading his books then getting killed by Voldemort, and discovered girls quite a bit before Harry. (Isadora Quagmire has his fancy...) This book is an entertaining, lively book.
B000005IRG|1.0|I would like to point out to all potential customers that this is NOT a television. I spent ten minutes trying to get a picture on this, before realizing that it was actually a CD!! Do not be fooled!!
B000002UA9|3.0|The only reason I bought this album was for Twist and Shout, which I should have just found it on Napster and burned it. This album was too fifties-ish for my taste. The Beatles' are my all-time favorite band, but I like their later work, such as Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be. This early work wasn't all their own, but a good warm-up album for the rest.
630281474X|5.0|This is the grand-daddy of all Dracula motion pictures! Christopher Lee was born to play the Prince of Darkness! Excellent on every level.....Acting, music (which is awesome in its intensity), lighting, atmosphere, the works! This 1958 horror outing was Mr. Lee's first (of eight) times that he portrayed the undead bloodsucker....and I think the best of the lot. Although, he is good in all other seven films as well, including 6 sequels in this Hammer series.
B000002UA0|5.0|Wow!!!!  A great piece of work from one of the greatist bands of rock and roll.  This truly is my favorite Pink Floyd album.  The debut is probobly the best debut album in rock music.  Steely Dan's Can't Buy a Thrill is high on that list too.  The album is so Psycadellic and so trippy and is just an absolute masterpiece.  Pink Floyd's original founder/songwriter Syd Barrett truly was a genious.  He wrote Pink Floyd's best album and there is no other songwriter like him.  Unfortunutly this would be his only full length album with the band.  He had as everyone knows sank downward and became a real tragedy.  He got too much into drugs and they took it's toll and Syd became insaine. Having to even be in an institution in '79 during the recording of The Wall. The opening of the album Astronemy Domine is very astronomic and the the best way to start with the album.  Fortunutly unlike other early pink floyd songs the band still plays this song live.  Syd's Guitars and Nick Mason's drums flow together perfectly. Lucifer Sam is a excellent song about Syd's siamise cat.  I can crank that song everyday and it will never get old for me.  Matilda Mother a song about a mother reading a bedtime story of midevil times.  A true mellow masterpiece.  Flaming Great Great I can't explain in how many word how good that song is.  Man every single song here is phoenominal. There is no weak track on here.  Instellar Overdrive and Pow R. Toc H are two great instrumentals that if this album didn't have the album would probobly be lost without.  Take up thy stethescope and walk is the only song Roger Waters wrote on here and from what I hear he is not happy with this song which doesen't surprise me he never seems to be happy with what he does but it is truly a gem. The Gnome a funny little song about a little old gnome named Grimble Krumble. The album tells stories, has humor, and has instrumental which make it fit together perfectly.  I can't forget Chapter 24 either because that song is veryvery amazing.  Of course the main song everyone knows is Bike.  Yes Bike when I first heard that from Relics I was blown away.  I had to hear it again and again.  A monumental song that Pink Floyd should still play in there shows along with Astronomy Domine.  The album's title for those of you who don't know this (I don't know what pink floyd fan doesen't by now) comes from the great Kenneth Grahm children's novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows.  I remember being in 5th grade and opening the wind in the willows book and seeing piper at the gates of dawn as one of the chapters and i went whoa that must have been where pink floyd got there title from cool!  Maybe I am rambling to much but the album is so magical I am kind of at a lost for words.  I mean there really is not enough I can say about a band who is so great who can make albums absolutley perfect.  When Pink Floyd would make albums they would get them right.  I have been a fan of Pink Floyd ever since I was 10 and will remain one until I am dead.  My first Pink Floyd album being Dark Side of the Moon.  An album that is the greatest selling rock album for a reason.  Yes it's that good.  There are some people who really do not care for this era of Pink Floyd much.  Those people usually prefer Atom Heart Mother onwards but it kind of makes me sad that some people just can get into this treasure.  It really even erks me how some people say this album is awful or it sucks.  Either they really just don't like this album, they can't get into it or they don't care too or if it's not popular floyd it's not good floyd.  Well thats a bunch of rubbish.  Anyway here I go on and on.  my two cents here is This is the best Pink Floyd album.  It is one of the best albums ever.  Most die hard fans I know of agree with me that it is in the top 5 (number one on my list) Pink Floyd albums.  Everyone who likes great music should own this album.  If you have Pink Floyd albums but you do not have this one you are really missing out.  Click add to cart and wait for a timeless classic to arive on your doorstep.  You will thank me in the end.  Syd Barrett will be truly missed.  We truly lost a true musical genious and rock and roll genious.
B00000K19E|5.0|I didnt want to see this movie at first.  It looked dark and dull.  Then I saw a preview with some Kung fu action and then I made it a weekend thing.  I saw it 3 out of the 4 opening weekend days it was playing!  I love this movie.  The plot you can follow and the cast is great in roles which could seem somewhat silly at times.<br />The most pivotal thing for me in this film is REAL actors doing REALLY good kung-fu action/fight scenes!  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie Ann Moss all spent 4 months training with one of the best martial arts directors in cinema history.  It shows!  The fight scenes are amazing if they do suffer from a bit too much wire work for my tastes.<br />There is also the stunning visual effects utilizing a brand new method of film making.  They have to be seen being put together in the documentary on this disc.  Also a key on this dvd is the white rabbit feature which allows you to see how certain scenes were filmed and put together.<br />There is a not-so subtle use of green through out the film, aside from this is one of the best films of 1999.  A must see for just about any movie fan!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have been waiting for this release since I got my DVD player.  ....  The absolute grandeur of The Godfather makes this one of the greatest film sagas of all time and I think it would be a shame for any fan to not own this cinematic masterpiece.  Even if you're not a fan of part III, this is still a must have flick.  Enjoy it all over again!!  Show some respect to The Godfather.
B00003CWTI|4.0|I thought the performances in this film were stupendous.  Cruise was nominated for best supporting actor for it and I thought should have won it, hands down.  Melora Walters as the drug addicted daughter of a TV gameshow host is also top notch.<br />The plot, well, the plot is just a bunch of lives intertwining within a period of time.  Each goes through major life changes in the process.  This movie also can lay claim to the weirdest beginning and ending in movie history!...
0782008372|1.0|Like most of the folks writing these reviews, I enjoyed this movie immensely, especially considering the added footage that explained some of the dangling subplots. The picture quality is even better than the VHS, whose print I found to be dark and muddy. I would prefer to give the movie 5 stars, but there are some serious problems with the DVD format in this instance.<br />WHAT ABOUT THE SOUND, THOUGH? Most of the dialogue was next to impossible to hear, unless the characters were shouting. Fiddling with the volume constantly is not only distracting but downright aggravating. The special features are also in need of serious adjustment. I wanted to see stills from the production, and they went by so fast they were impossible to view. And the scene selector, wherein you are SUPPOSED to be able to skip to your favorite scene is difficult to navigate.<br />All in all, the movie itself is a delight. The DVD technology, however, needs to be handled by someone with a technical clue.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The soundtrack to the Coen Brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one of the biggest surprises in music for 2000.  The film starring George Clooney was not much of a success at the box office, but the soundtrack made up of dark bluegrass songs from the early part of the 20th century has become a major seller.  In fact the album has set a record for the most weeks at number one for a soundtrack on the Country Album charts.  This is a welcomed and warmly cheered surprise as the album celebrates an essential style of music from America's rich musical history.  Album producer T-Bone Burnett has assembled a cast of unknowns, save Emmylou Harris &amp; Allison Krauss, like The Fairfield Four, Gillian Welch and J. Carter &amp; The Prisoners who specialize in this forgotten and overlooked genre.  The songs have a stark and haunting quality that are accentuated by the sparse musical arrangements.  The singing is alternatively raw and rough to lilting and gorgeous.  Song after song provides you with an interesting, intriguing and satisfying listening experience especially &quot;Po Lazarus&quot;, &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Down To The River To Pray&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot; and &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But My Baby&quot;.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Although &quot;The Gladiator&quot; is not quite as long as either classic movie, it has taken the best elements from both. Definitely worth the money.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles &quot;1&quot; CD continues to sell remarkably well over half a year after its release when it broke global chart records. I STILL like &quot;1&quot;. In fact, this CD gets better with time. To make a long story short, this is the greatest music of the 20th century by the greatest group of the 20th century. It is as simple as that. And, oh, by the way, the greatest song of the 20th century, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, is also on this CD! The Beatles career in music is legendary. No one else ever matched it. Only Elvis can rival the Beatles run on the charts. It is the stuff of legend. Were the Beatles that great? Was the music that good? Every listener will have to decide on their own. Not every no.1 was a great song/record. Not all the best material of the Beatles is included here. &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, etc., are not on this album. Many of the greatest Beatles songs are not on it. But this just shows how great the Beatles output was. You cannot put it all on a single 80 minute CD! How many musicians can boast that? But all the Beatles classic singles are here.<br />The sound quality is excellent. The Beatles never sounded better. &quot;1&quot; is ear candy. Once you begin listening, you become hooked. The music is that GOOD, the music is that powerful.It does not take a genius to figure out why thousands of fans were screaming and going out of their minds during Beatlemania. This music grabs you by the throat and does not let go! Trust me.Once the music takes control, you are hooked. There is no escape. That is the power of the Beatles. That cannot be denied. There is so much energy and fun and musicality. &quot;Yeah!Yeah!Yeah!&quot; The material is dynamite. This is the greatest musical run of the 20th century,perhaps of all time.Now we can all see why.The Beatles just took over. And while not everything stands up to time and there are hooks and gimmicks that one can analyze now, overall, the musical effect is astounding. This is the rock and roll equivalent of the Mozart Jupiter Symphony or the Beethoven 9th symphony. This is the cream of the crop. This is the top of the pops. Buy this CD to see what all the fuss and xcreaming was about. See what a REAL boy band sounds like. See why The New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys are not even on the same planet as the Beatles. &quot;1&quot; is life-altering music. It is the music that defined and changed a generation, for better or worse.You say you want a revolution? The Beatles gave us one, a REAL revolution. &quot;1&quot; is the real deal. This is timeless music, this is REAL music, not phony, manufactured music. I would recommend this CD highly. Buy it. You will enjoy the thrill of listening to this music. It is the music that changed the world.
B00005B36H|4.0|ok, i've listened to two songs and already it sounds just like Ænima.  that's ok.  i like Ænima.<br />what i want to know is...how can the art work matter?  is this empty-v talking here?  thinking artwork will make music better is like thinking robert smith's hair and lipstick somehow had anything at all to do with the cure's music all these years.<br />ahhh...poor children, products of too much empty-v watching.  try to just *listen* to the music.  don't *look* at it.<br />anyway, this album is a bit more dreamy than Ænima and the mix seems kinda...weird.  mjk's voice isn't as prominent.  mantra is great, seeing as i'm a big fan of lustmord/köner/robert rich type music as well.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This movie's plot is far from the generic movie plot where boy meets girl, boy asks girl out, girl says no, boy stalks girl, etc...or any other plot scheme that only succeeds in pulling in millions, instead of being truly original and entertaining.  This movie is refreshing and charming.  The sense of humor is there and the story is fully satisfying.  But, I only reccommend this book to intelligent people who would be able to enjoy it.  If you are looking for a fun friday night movie, well, this may be it, but not if you are looking for just another &quot;Dude Where's My Car&quot;.
B00003CXDU|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites, it's one the whole family watches on an easy summer afternoon.  It gives you that nice feeling when you've laughed alot.  When we watch it,  the next morning we'll wake up with the phrase,&quot;NEVER GIVE UP! NEVER SURRENDER!&quot;  so, get this movie A.S.A.P!! you won't regret it.

B00005LB50|5.0|The best way (so far) to acquire the best sounding springfield, but where are the live tracks? Or the 9 min. bluebird? And the repetition of the last disc is unacceptable, given the price of the set. They should have sold it priced as a 3-CD set with a bonus disc, because disc 4 repeats most of the first 3 discs. Still outstanding music, however.
B00003CXS4|5.0|After seeing Fight Club, I gained a huge amount of respect for Brad Pitt. After hearing that he Benicio Del Toro (who I adore, see my Fear and Loathing review) were \\"starring\\" in Snatch, I was sucked into the theatre to see it. Up until that point, Fight Club had been my favorite movie, and now Guy Ritchie has bumped Fincher's work down a notch. Here's the good stuff: 1. The cinematography was spectacular through most of the movie, esp. the Cousin Avi/Concorde part, the Desert Eagle part, and of course the boxing scenes. 2. The soundtrack just plain worked. 3. Brad Pitt, proving once again that he is one of the most versatile actors on the screen. 4. The wheels-within-wheels plot style (which is becoming all the rage again with movies like Traffic, Lock Stock, and Go) 5. Wonderful acting by nearly everyone involved, even the minor characters. This is interesting considering that most of the cast had little to no acting experience. 6. The car scene 7. The intro Now, the few nit-picky complaints: 1. Too short. The first time you see the movie it seems 3 hours long. In reality, its only an hour and forty minutes. So much more could have been added in without slowing the movie down too much. 2. Some of the \\"main\\" characters don't get enough screen time, namely Doug the Head, and Frankie Four Fingers. 3. The deleted scenes on the DVD make you scratch your head wondering where Ritchie was originally going with some aspects of the plot. The Bottom Line: If you like British comedy, buy it. If you like twisted comedy, buy it. If you like Tarantino-style movies, buy it. ..., just plain buy it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Folks, they don't come any grander or any better than Ridley Scott's epic, Gladiator. This is without a doubt the best DVD I own, not only because the movie itself is outstanding, but because it's more jam-packed with fascinating extras than any other DVD I've seen-- only Disney's collectibles come close.<br />What you're getting here is a two-disc set, one containing the nearly three-hour film (in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and DTS audio tracks, plus English subtitles), and the other containing numerous Gladiator extras. You'll get some outstanding deleted scenes that, unlike some other films, add quite a bit to the Gladiator experience. You'll get a full filming journal written by one of the movie's stars throughout the course of the filming of Gladiator. You'll get a number of &quot;making-of&quot; featurettes-- one for the movie itself, one for the creation of the music, and more. You'll also get some sub-features about the continent on which Gladiator was filmed and the history of the Roman empire. In short, there's enough extra material here to bust a couple of togas, and it's of extraordinary quality.<br />And then there's the movie itself. A better film than Gladiator I have not seen since 1994, the year of Braveheart-- a movie to which Gladiator can and rightfully should be compared. Both are epic in scope, both center on one man's quest for vengeance at the dawning of a new era, both are beautifully directed.... and both films contain some of the most outstanding battle scenes ever shot. Gladiator's opening battle is perhaps the best I have ever seen. Yet I won't say that one film is better than the other; they complement each other. Suffice it to say that if you liked Braveheart, you will like Gladiator.<br />And regardless of what you like, you must have this DVD.
6300213668|1.0|This summer I had the privilege and pleasure of being part of a local production of Grease, albeit in an offstage capacity. It was amateur, though not amateurish. Sure, most of the cast won't be seen on Broadway, but I came away with a pretty good idea of what Grease the Musical should look and sound like.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you won't find out if you purchase Grease the Video.<br /><br />This version is a 50's musical in a 70's setting, or a 70's musical in a 50's setting. I haven't decided which. Moreover, I don't think the producer, Robert Stigwood, had decided either when he embarked on this project.<br /><br />Stigwood, in case the reader didn't know, also produced the movie musical Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band based on the Beatles' album (as if I had to explain this. Or do I?) That movie was featured in Golden Turkey Awards: The Worst Achievements in Hollywood History by film critics Harry and Michael Medved.  In Grease the Video, caricatures of 50's greasers sing songs that careen across two decades. The original Greased Lightning is here, but so are You're the One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You, sung by Olivia Newton-John, an immensely cloying and annoying vocalist. Sure, the added songs are good by Top 40 standards. But what are they doing here? Had Stigwood produced Fiddler On the Roof, we might have had to listen to the diaspora singing disco.<br /><br />Adding songs that weren't in the original was bad enough. Some songs were cut to make room for the 70's updates. Missing from the video is the exuberant opening number, a parody of the Rydell High School alma mater song. Also missing is the tender, plaintive It's Raining On Prom Night. Alone at the Drive-In got switched for a sappy Sandy. You're the One That I Want took the place of the snarling little darling I'm All Choked Up.<br /><br /> Grease the Video is not without some merits. Frankie Avalon is an inspired choice as the Teen Angel who sings the hilarious Beauty School Dropout. Stockard Channing also appears as the cynical yet vulnerable Rizzo. I suppose there are worse things Stigwood could do. Find out for yourself. Go rent Sergeant Pepper instead, and save the remainder to see a local production of Grease As It Should Be.Dropout.

0441172717|5.0|I'm absolutely satisfied of this book. It contains not only scince-fiction themesbut also problems of all world like the resonibility of leaders, the fanatism, political methods. It also represents what will happen if there's such melange addiction in the world. Ecologycal problems of Dune shows exactly how we can exhaust the resources of our planet. At last the stoy of persons as Lito, Paul, Jesika are told with great tallent.
6304712499|1.0|I was really disappointed with this DVD.  The visual special effects are definitely dated.  The sound effects were good, but not enough to make this movie worth the time spent watching it.<br />I can not recommend this movie.
0140868445|5.0|well, i think there could not be enough said about how good the story is.  Steinbecks classic is one that will make you feel emotions: sadness, pity, relief, and joy.  The story based on the worker migrations to california is beyond a doubt a classic novel that MUST be read... enough about the book...<br />the audio book is excellently read by david baker who reads with great clarity and pronunciation.  it is unabridged so the listener will get the whole thing as it is.  i had read the book twice already and was well on my way during my third pass through when i ran into the idea of listening to this.  i had high expectations of the book's content, but was wary about the readers interpretations being thrown upon the reader.  baker does a good job of not throwing out too much of his own interpretations/feelings into the words as he speaks them {and when he does they coincide with my interpretations/feelings}.<br />the unabridged audio book is well worth the price. only thing is that audio books cannot compare to actually reading the book for yourself.  even with the audio book, i often went back to the book to reread certain parts, and i recommend that everyone pick up the book too and read it... but the book being around 2 inches thick, and if you do not have time sometimes for reading it, the audio book is a good alternative!
B00001SIES|3.0|These guys are flat out good song writers; they just need to grow up alittle.  The songs are well writen but sometimes poorly executed.  Matt's wheezing between words is enough for some people to throw the disc out of the window of a moving car.  Minus the wheezing and gasping, he has a really good voice and an impressive range.  I find hope in the fact that these guys are young and this is a debut.  With a few more seasons under their belts, these guys could write world class music.  As far as radiohead comparisons, you must not of really listened to RH much beyond creep and iron lung if you think this band is even worhty of such a lofty comparison.  As far as Muse's songs beeing more CREATIVE then Radiohead, that's the most rediculous thing I have ever heard.
B000002OOY|5.0|This score is one of John Williams greatest accomplishments. The success of Jurassic park owed a great deal to the fantastic soundtrack that John Williams had written. This score is lively, daunting, exciting and terrifying at the same time. The main themes are also very well known and in my opinion perfectly describe the optimistic ideals of the dinosaur's creators, and the rest of the score shows what can happen when creation gets out of hand. When listening to this score, it feels like you're actually watching the movie. Two of the best tracks are High-Wire Stunts and T-Rex Rescue and finale. In these tracks John Williams captures the intensity of the fence climb and the terror of the raptor chase. This soundtrack is on a level with Star Wars and Indiana Jones.
0452282152|4.0|Normally, historical fiction does not interest me but this book gave you a close look into an artist's life.  The way the artist went about his paintings fascinated me.  I will never look at Vermeer's paintings the same.   This is also a book about a progressive 16 yr. old girl growing up.  By the end of the novel she becomes much more opinionated, outspoken, and aware of her sexuality.  I was suprised at the importance she put on her hair and what it meant. I love books that open your eyes to a different way of life and Girl with a Pearl Earring did that for me.  Chevalier webbed together an array of personalities and history beautifully.  She really did her homework.
0465068359|5.0|Iris Chang has done a great service to the cause of historical truth with this blunt, plainly written book. Despite its graphic and sickening descriptions of atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers, &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is truly riveting. The story which it tells and the lessons which it teaches can, I believe, have a life-changing effect upon those who read it.<br />Most of the criticisms of &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; previously recorded in this forum fall into two categories:<br />The first type of criticism is what might be called the defense of HISTORY. This argument boils down to griping that the book is not written in the dry, arch language of true historians, that it personalizes history and that the author shows her lack of objectivity by injecting herself into the story she is telling. All of these claims have some measure of truth, but are beside the point, nonetheless. Chang is a journalist, not a professional historian, and her writing style is understandably less formal than what might be found in a scholarly historical journal or book. Nevertheless, the narrative is rich in factual material that is copiously documented in the footnotes at the end of the book. Even Chang's ruminations on the sociopolitical and psychological forces underlying the Rape are well supported, if all too brief. Finally, it is more than a bit unfair to criticize Chang for lack of scholarly rigor when so few &quot;genuine&quot; western historical scholars have been willing to take on this disturbing and controversial subject.<br />The second type of criticism is that of denial and revisionism, most of whose proponents appear to be right wing Japanese ultranationalists. Their contentions are that, on the one hand, the Rape never occurred, and that, on the other hand, even if it did occur (just a little,) it was no worse than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or the Chinese occupation of Tibet. The denial argument is so patently false that it cannot betaken seriously by anyone with a modicum of intelligence and honesty. It is especially hard to accept supposed refutations of the numerous eyewitness accounts of Westerners and of Japanese soldiers themselves. Wisely, Chang devotes nearly an entire chapter of her book to meticulously debunking these obfuscators.<br />The contention that other atrocities and acts of oppression somehow lessen the guilt of the Japanese for their actions in China is an absurdity. One of the weakest forms of argument is to say to one's opponent &quot;You're another.&quot; All atrocities and all forms of oppression are inherently evil, regardless of who commits them. Rather than denying the undeniable and defending the indefensible, the Japanese people, as individuals and as a nation, would do well to yield to the truth of their past, regardless of how painful that may be. Living in opposition to reality is ultimately destructive to oneself.
B00005BL2A|5.0|it's just music, quit bitching and comparing this with past albums, if you don't like it, don't listen to it!
B000051VWW|5.0|It has been a few years since Sade's last Cd so as a Sade fan all my life I was more than excited. This one has lived up to all the excpectations every track is classic other than King Of Sorrow . This one is recomended to all
0887306101|5.0|Schwager's classic is fun to read. Many useful and practical hints for traders. After reading some investment books written by college professors, I know why they are only teaching. They treat trading as other academic subjects like Physics or Astronomy. They just waste all the time to prove or disprove some theories like EMH. They don't know (or they know it but just don't mention it) there are lots of techniques traders need to know in order to make money. If you want to be a successful trader, reading the two MW is certainly much more useful than going college. And it is also much more enjoyable and timesaving. I like the interviews with Ed seykota, Larry Hite and O'Neil. But the section about floor traders confused me. Since I didn't know anything about this area, I found it was quite hard to understand the first time I read it! Personally, I like the New Market Wizards more. Anyway, this one still deserves 5 stars.
B000002O7D|4.0|Would get 5 stars if there was more in the CD.  It's pretty short.  However, the Russian song Basil worte is worth the entire CD.  Great score that aided the film tremendously.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I cannot understand why this album was called a &quot;failure.&quot;  The incredible number and range of styles on the album end up coming together after you listen to it a few times.  I played this album over and over when it was released 20 years ago.  Recently having acquired it on CD, I am listening again.  At age 54 I do not agree with the political stance, but the music is timeless.  If you have a soul, it will make you happy.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This definitely a &quot;must-have&quot;.  If you liked the &quot;Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, you will like &quot;Acoustic Soul.&quot;
B000056K04|3.0|well, it's dave matthews band, so how bad can it be? It's not at all a bad album, if fact it's great. It's just all the other DMB albums are better. I fear this could be the begining of the end for DMB, but I hope they will get over this hump. Worth your money, but save it  for after you have the other 3.
B000002WUD|5.0|From the very first track on CD1 The Wonder Of You, to the last track on CD5 brings out the best in Elvis,a good mixture even the previously unreleased versions,for hours of good music I would strongly recommend this compelation as it will have you foot tapping &amp; singing for most of the tracks.
B00003CXS4|4.0|I'm an avid moviegoer, and usually, I like everything I see. I give movies the benefit of the doubt, even when they don't deserve them. When &quot;Snatch&quot; was released in the theaters, I knew I wanted to see it, but after rewatching it again on DVD, I knew why I loved it so much the first time. Although I haven't seen Ritchie's &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot;, &quot;Snatch&quot; is one of the movies that simply carves a genre all its own. The entire collection of characters, setting, and dialogue is so believeable, yet so over-the-top, that you simply laugh when thinking about it. The English crime underworld is the main focus of the story, and Ritchie pulls it off in a satisfying crime caper gone terribly awry. Benecio Del Toro's Frankie Four-Fingers is presented hysterically in snippets of Las Vegas footage that will have you crying, and the rest of the characters, from the bumbling fools Sol and Vince to the evil Brick Top, are extremely memorable. Oh, and don't forget the dog.<br />If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, then Snatch should be right up your alley. Some may call it a rip off, but the story is unique on its own. The DVD's special features are pefect, and when you turn on &quot;Pikey Subtitles&quot;, Brad Pitt's character is THAT much better. And the deleted scenes feature (&quot;Stealing Stones&quot;) while playing the movie really gives terrific insight into the director's thoughts. As does the commentary track.<br />Snatch is a gritty, nicely paced, comedic crime heist picture that should make its way into your DVD collection. Be warned, however: If you're turned off by sometimes indecipherable digalgue (yes, the Brits are hard to understand sometimes), then Snatch may not be one of your faves. Also, it's definitely a testosterone-driven flick, so you women may have some problems enjoying the ridiculous violence and gangster goings-on. <br />Still, all this aside, top to bottom, Snatch is a wonderful way to spend two hours.
0393317552|4.0|In the introduction to this Pulitzer Prize winning book, author Jared Diamond recounts a 1972 conversation with a Papau New Guinean leader who asked why Europeans came with all their technology to &quot;discover&quot; New Guinea, instead of the other way around.  This was a question Diamond had already considered, because to his mind native New Guineans were at least as intelligent as Europeans.  Twenty-five years later, Diamond had an answer for that question, and it is a good one.  According to Diamond, the domination of the world by European culture since 1500 (and the US is culturally an extension of Europe) is the result of three proximate factors: military and political developments up to and particularly since 1500; the ravages of European based disease on newly-met peoples; and the development of technology.  He summarizes these three factors in the three words of his title.  He explains how these proximate causes developed from root causes in a review of biological, climatological, geographical and other trends and events in the 13,000 or so years since the end of the last ice age.  In his review, he specifically addresses the so-called &quot;genetic advantages&quot; which have been cited by some to claim &quot;racial superiority&quot; as a root cause for &quot;white&quot; domination of world events, and gives a plausible explanation of why there is no such thing.  Unfortunately, people who would espouse that reasoning are not likely to work through this book to discover why they are wrong.  Readers will have to work to finish this book, but they will be rewarded when they do.  It is dry reading, and very repetitive.  It is, however, well worth the effort.  Diamond looks at why, if Africa is the source location of humanity as we know it, Africa has continued to be the least developed continent, and perhaps the one with the most human problems today.  He provides explanation of why the &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; was the source of western civilization, butbecame the far-from-fertile political problem area it is now; why development moved westward from the middle- and near-east into Europe; why China, with a highly developed culture thousands of years ago, stultified and only recently entered the modern age; and why European-based diseases wiped out other cultures but their diseases seldom (but not always) had little effect on Europeans.  This book does not give us any indications how cultural and economic differences can be addressed today, but perhaps if we better understand how they came to exist if the first place, then maybe we can come up with a way that they can be addressed.  This book does help us with that better understanding.
B00005LB50|5.0|The demos on this album showcase the raw talent of these artists.  Listening to these songs was like hearing an unplugged album.  The unreleased songs are better than many of those that showed up on the albums! If you are a fan of Buffalo Springfield, you will find this box set a must for your collection.  If you are not a fan of Buffalo Springfield, this box set will make you one for life.
6304884419|5.0|This is a great movie!  If you are into mob movies, this is a must-have.  It is a classic and the cast of actors is incredible.
6305252521|5.0|Upon its release, \\"The Truman Show\\" was greeted with rapturous reviews--some even hailed it as the best of the decade.  Hyperbolic, you say?  Not at all.  Peter Weir's razor-sharp masterpiece, which was inexplicably denied an Oscar nomination for best picture, may be one of the most underrated movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  That a film this intelligent and provocative could even emerge from the Hollywood system is in itself a minor miracle.<br />Much has been made of \\"The Truman Show's\\" subtext, and its timely implications about voyeurism and mass-media exploitation--all of which are entirely appropriate.  What gets lost in the discussion, however, is the fact that on a purely aesthetic level, Weir's film is a mightily impressive achievement.  If by sheer luck you don't yet know the film's much-publicized premise, you are probably in the best position to appreciate the consummate skill with which it unravels.<br />The key word here is subtlety.  Rather than loudly trumpet what his film is really about (which, unfortunately, is exactly what Paramount did when promoting it), Weir initially frames his subject as an impeccably constructed mosaic, and then proceeds to pull that mosaic apart, piece by tantalizing piece.  Along the way, he employs some ingenious visual tricks and downright hilarious sight gags, so that by the time the big revelation arrives, it's not just a shock device--it's the culmination of an hour's worth of brilliantly sustained storytelling.  That's only the first pay-off.  There are plenty more to come, including a pivotal \\"back from the dead\\" scene so beautifully acted, so tightly edited, that it gets my vote for the single most riveting sequence of the year (and that includes the first 30 minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\").<br />It's a testament to Weir's skill that \\"The Truman Show\\" is not only one of the richest and most serious-minded films in recent memory, but also one of the funniest.  The numerous in-jokes--some of which would be the high points of a formulaic comedy but merely function as throwaways here--are truly priceless, and by extracting every possible ounce of humor from the material, Weir smartly avoids turning his movie into a polemic.  Equally impressive is his touch with actors--the criminally underestimated Jim Carrey does the best work of his career as Truman Burbank, while Ed Harris turns in a performance as human as it is chilling.  As Truman's wife and best friend, respectively, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich offer excellent support.<br />If this review sounds a tad evasive, it's only because \\"The Truman Show\\" is one film that deserves an untainted viewing.  Hollywood entertainment does not get more rewarding than this.
B000003S2K|5.0|I bought this when it first came out-around 1980 I believe it was.  My first Brian Eno recording and to this day my favorite.  Every single time I put it on when having guests over they want to know the title and artist's name.  Absolutely enchanting and wonderful background music for meditation.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie has been the movie all year that has impressed me the most. Guy Ritchie, in his sophomore directorial outing (the last being 1998's fantastic and critically acclaimed &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;).<br />The movie is different than what you're advertised though, the movie takes place in England and everybody including the American actors (except 1 or 2) have heavy heavy accents, it'll be hard for you to break down some of the dialogue so the first time you watch this watch it with subtitles on, even though i watched this on VHS on a TV with no closed captioning. It'll help you get a little more about the movie.<br />The movie has several plots that cross paths including betting on illegal boxing matches, the war over a diamond and mob wars. It's really confusing but it's worth sitting through, it's better than 90% of the movies we get in America. I dont want to spoil the plots so i wont get into detail.<br />All in all this is a big step up for Guy Ritchie and it's even better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. From the looks of this DVD (Which is a two DVD set with a whole disc of extras, yay), it looks like a must buy. Anyway, which ever route you go you need to give this movie at least one viewing for yourself. It's definitely worth at least the price of rental but i'd advise you to buy this DVD that's been put together for us.<br />I'm surprised that a film with such substance and great acting/directing/writing was a big hit in America, we usually like 100 million dollars of explosives and silly teen comedies meant to capitolize on the few with substance like American Pie.<br />Odds on best of 2001, i can't wait for Guy Ritchie's next film.
B00004RF98|5.0|Once upon a time there was a place called HOLLYWOOD. It wasn't just a town or even an industry, it was a state of mind. They didn't call the studios Dream Factories for  nothing. This film is the epitome of the musical art and craft. This is a real &quot;Movie Movie,&quot; made entirely on the MGM lot. The real creme de la creme of MGM contributed to it's creation; produced by Arthur Freed, starring Gene Kelly (with a brilliant turn by the dazzling ,long-legged Cyd Charisse), contract players like Debbie Reynolds and Kathleen Freeman (still going strong, currently appearing on Broadway in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;) with costumes by my favorite designer Walter Plunkett (Gone With The Wind, 7 Brides For 7 Brothers, etc). Check out the sumptuous designs for the &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; number and the outrageous spider dress at the opening night party. The real lowdown is that Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor practically steal the show from the leads in possibly the best performances of their careers. This film is pure joy. The script by Comden and Green is not only clever but actually goofs on a real period of transition of the American film from silent to talkie.It is also a brilliant job of recycling a trunkload of old songs. This happy film has the courage to do what American musicals and comedies do best: be silly and make you forget you troubles for an hour and a half. Next time you are in bed with the flu or trying to get over a miserable love affair, take a look at Singing In The Rain. It can't help but curl up the corners of your mouth and drive the clouds away.
B000003TAW|5.0|Good start for a great band! I honestly have to say I love this CD.  It has good guitar and drum sounds and great lyrics NOT ABOUT relationships.  And yes, I do think Rivers looks like Buddy Holly, so he didn't lie!!!! Anyways, buy this CD cause it is really good, and also get Pinkerton! Thats another awesome CD!
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is by far 2pac's best album. Although  all eyez on me is  probably easier to listen to, the skills 2pac displays on the 7 day theory are nothing short of genius. Every track is westcoast gangsta rap at its finest although &quot;Krazy&quot; and &quot;White Manz World&quot; show a maturity not found on any other 2pac albums. I loved listening to him dis bad boy, but was pleased he did'nt have much to say about mobb deep who are QB's finest by a mile.If you love 2pac you must get this album as it is his finest and a true masterpiece.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I love the Ramones, they created punk along with the Clash and Sex Pistols.  Anyways, even after Joey died and after Dee Dee, Johnny, and Tommy die, they still will always live! There music is soooo contagious! I love this band! There are soooooooooo good! I love this CD! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!
B000056K04|5.0|Dave Matthews Band has produced another hit, with songs that sound familiar, but pleasing to the fan's ear.  &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a powerful ballad-type song that struck me as great the first time I heard it.  There is also some strongly-rooted jazz/rock combos.  Great album.
B00005LMBK|4.0|After seeing the video, I couldn't get &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; out of my head, so I had to buy the album. I love to drive to it. I was surprised how much variation there is in the tracks, and it's funky and fun. The &quot;Suzuki&quot; cut is a crack-up, if you've ever studied music under the Suzuki method. I was impressed by the total cartoon marketing approach, right down to the wallpaper and screensavers on the CD. It's a slick package, but for some reason it doesn't hit me as negative as, say, the Monkees. It's nice to see people having fun and experimenting. That's what music is!
0380796090|5.0|yes this book is brilliant. keyes is a superb writer. now i'm on a quest to buy and read any and all of marian keyes books!
B00005LMBK|4.0|It's a pleasure to experience something as versatile as this disc. The album is refreshing, and in my mind, one of the most innovative albums in a long time. Although I am not a big fan of Blur, or Damon for that matter, his questionable voice lends itself perfectly here. The lyrics are like the rest of the album, cartoonish, but don't let that scare you because you don't get this album for the lyrics. The music is is playful and catchy and it makes you feel like this summer won't end in a long time -- &quot;because I have sunshine in a bag&quot;. The album feels a bit scattered, like they jumbled a bunch of songs together in notime. Despite this, you can tell they are having fun and so will you if you get this one.
B000000WG4|5.0|For those who do not know, this album was produced =far= before computers would have made the layering of different musical instruments and sounds so much easier. I am still in awe of Mike's expertise every time I fire this up. The &quot;Exorcist&quot; movie soundtrack music does not do this album justice. And the CD is even better - crystal clear and very listenable. Mike played each of the instruments himself and mixed the results by hand. The effect, considering the era it was made, is beyond belief. If your only experience with &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; is from &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, you =owe= it to yourself to listen to this album - you will listen again and again.
B000002UUX|4.0|THis is sheer metal, the best the genre can deliver. But you know which are the best parts of this album ? It is when Dave Mustaine keeps his mouth shut .... God, the guy has one of the worst voice ever. He just doesnt know how to sing !!! Other than this, the songs are perfect.
B00005JIZA|5.0|this is an excelent cd!!!! do not get me wronge i love this cd, however, i prefer john's first reliece, (the title escapes me at the moment)but you should own this cd.
B00001ZTFZ|1.0|Buy this whole weak album, one of MEgadeths worst, just for the sake of a single bonus track ??? You must be kidding ....
0767840135|5.0|We could not leave the show, after we saw it we tryed to go to sleep (at 2 am), but the music kept playing in our heads, we were wxcited so much from the whole thing, so we got out from bed and went to see it for the second time! And twice more on the next day, 7 times in 3 days! I cant even explain why it got us in such a way, but we loved every minute of it until today.
B000002JNN|3.0|SOlid AC/DC album, one of the best, but .... its no even closer to the &quot;real&quot; AC/DC, the one who finished after FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, in 1981 ... Anyway, THE RAZORS EDGE was a marked improvment over the last mediocre studio albuns released by the band.
0425180638|1.0|The reader/reviewer from Acton, MA has it exactly right. This is a sloppily-written, plotless book, dripping with false-angst that makes the reader feel as if he or she had been mentally tortured to no purpose. Did Cornwell even submit this to an editor or was it sent directly to the printer? (The last is the only explanation for how it got into print in the first place.)<br />How bad is it? The writing is so bad that Cornwell apparently thinks that `prepossessed by' is somehow synonymous with `absorbed by' or `consumed by,' and that it makes sense to write of something making one's psyche hurt. There is no plot, only a tedious unravelling of Kay Scarpetta's paranoid thoughts. The suspect isn't the suspect. The original crime isn't ever resolved (or even explained). The ending is simply an arbitrary farce, lacking surprise or suspense (and introducing minor characters who are brought onstage out of sheer desperation. Of course the main bad guys escape which makes me fear that Cornwell plans a sequel. I urge her to give up her plans and spare us.<br />With the price of paperback `thrillers' edging up to ten dollars, readers deserve more from an author than typing. Don't waste your money.
B000002BYA|3.0|This is a fun little performance, but it is no where near Vaughan's best material.<br />This CD comes from a benefit concert Vaughan and Double Trouble did in 1984.  On the surface, it should be fantastic work of art,  being recorded at Carnegie Hall, with all kinds of guest musicians.  But, it turns out to be nothing special.  It was a hastily thrown together and relatively short performance.<br />The disk is only 62 minutes, and there is a lot of talking on it.  It starts out with a horrible two minute introduction.  Every time you play this CD you have to put up with talking before you can get to any music.  With 14 tracks crammed into 62 minutes, the band never really opens up on anything.<br />The first half of the CD consists of Vaughan's strumming style songs like Love Struck Baby.  It is all Vaughan strumming his guitar and his harsh vocals.  The rest of the band or all the guest musicians don't really come out until later in the CD.  Vaughan never really changed how he played his songs in concert.  One performance sounds pretty much like the next.  A bid portion of the CD isn't any different than any of his other live CD's. <br />There are a few songs on the CD were the big band sound does come out.  But the songs are short and the big band really never gets a chance to get moving.  They are fun songs, but they really aren't enough to make this CD special.<br />Vaughan has a number of superior live CD's.  The question is which one to get.  I would recommend getting the boxset SRV.  It contains live versions almost every song Vaughan has done.
0790733226|4.0|Contact is one of those movies you have to buy. The plot and story are very deep and something everyone can relate to. Religion vs. Science, Space, Love all major parts of this movie. The special effects are terrific! All star cast including former President Bill Clinton, Jodie Foster and others. Watch it and then buy it...
B00005A0N5|5.0|I first got hooked on Nightwish with their recent album &quot;Wishmaster&quot;. I was just blown away by the combination of heavy metal riffs and operatic vocals. It was nothing I had ever heard before and quite refreshing in a stale genre of music. So the only thing next to do was to check out the band's second album &quot;Oceanborn&quot;.<br />Originally I didn't know what to think of &quot;Oceanborn&quot; on the first listen. There weren't songs that got to me as &quot;She Is My Sin&quot; from &quot;Wishmaster&quot; but on as I gave the cd another listen, I totally changed my mind about &quot;Oceanborn&quot; and fell in love with the music as I had with &quot;Wishmaster&quot;. Tarja has the most amazing voice I've heard in a long time. It is refreshing to hear someone actually sing in the heavy metal genre as opposed to screaming incessantly until my ears bleed.<br />Songs like &quot;Moondance&quot; and &quot;The Pharaoh Sails to Orion&quot; transports the listener to another world. I love it how the band's songs are like little vignettes and actually has a story to tell, as if it was opera. You just don't get that with most metal bands today. Nightwish is a rarity nowadays to hear a band in the heavy metal genre that can blend both the heaviness of metal with the melodies of classical music. I can't get enough of this band.
0694515302|1.0|I was very dissappointed in the audio version.  Having never read the book and hearing lots of raves, I was expecting much more.  He gave a very breif outline, then spent the last 5 minutes in an advertisement to hire his company.<br />Very dissappointing.  Maybe the book is better.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time not even good enough for the b-movie films of yesteryear. Don't waste your time and or money on this.
B00003CY5H|2.0|...in this case, as an entertaining film & story. This project misses the mark big time. I agree with others that wrote about  the film having an unfinished feel to it. I'm a fan of DeNiro but he was definitely on lithium throughout production. Norton is the highlight, but doesn't [take]the show because there isn't one. You get the feeling you're watching the \\"dailies\\". Frank Oz should stick to light-hearted comedies.<br />Elegant Angela Basset is wasted in the three measly unimportant scenes she's in (obviously a DeNiro cast choice since everyone knows he's always preferred black women). <br />Two stars for both of Norton's characters. Basset should go back to finding her career groove, and if this is the type of character DeNiro is comfortable in playing, he is quickly joining Jack Nicholson in simply not trying anymore.<br />It's pretty much a \\"[copy]\\" of the great Michael Mann film \\"Thief\\". I dare you to watch that and see the blatant comparisons.
B00000064G|5.0|a great cd.  very relaxed and mellow, with tunes that remind me a bit of simon and garfunkle, or perhaps coldplay.  there is some wonderful acoustic guitar work, and drake's voice is very thick and smooth.  anyone who is a fan of good folksy guitar, from simon and garfunkle to dave matthews band, should definetely consider this album.
B000002H33|5.0|Unlike what other people might say, this album did NOT define metal music at the time.  While other bands were busy abusing drugs, Metallica sang about the control that they have over your body (MASTER OF PUPPETS) not only in the lyrics but the slow, methodic acoustic/ electric solos in the middle section.  Metallica shows that they can be not only as fast as Slayer and Pantera, but faster with the hard-core riffs and solos of BATTERY and DAMAGE INC.  Meanwhile, THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE is almost a prototype for HARVESTER OF SORROW, with the slow tempo that will always make you shiver as does HARVESTER with it's &quot;The Shining&quot; type lyrics.  DISPOSIBLE HEROES and LEPER MESSIAH tell editorials of things more conscious and meaningful than TALK DIRTY TO ME or any glam songs of that time period.  As if to add the perfect ending to this wonderful album, track seven, ORION, comes just before DAMAGE INC.  A feat only to be accomplished by the songwriting team of Hetfield/Ulrich with a little help from the late Cliff Burton.  ORION is my favorite song of all time, a song that lures you into a sort of trance before blasting you awake DAMAGE INC, making the perfect ending for the perfect album.
0843178388|5.0|Mr Bump, quite frankly, is a clod. He can't seem to do anything without injuring himself or others. How can he get by in life with such a predilection for mayhem? Read it and see. Great for both children and adults.
0790725657|5.0|My little girl and I watch this movie regularly, we just love it and it makes us think of all we to be grateful for.  It's something you can treasure with your own daughter time and time again.  I strongly suggest you watch this with your daughter and hold her close as you do :-)
B000021XR5|5.0|After their intriguing detour on Tiny Music, STP returned with No.4 to do what they do best: pounding out good, hard-rocking music.  The moment this CD begins with &quot;Down,&quot; you know you're in for a Core-type experience.  &quot;Heaven &amp; Hot Rods,&quot; &quot;Pruno,&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot; help usher in STP's new generation of songs with a hardness not seen since, well, Core.  Yet that's not to say STP's experimentation with other styles stopped with No.4.  &quot;Sour Girl&quot; is probably the best-known song on the CD (likely because of its crazy video involving teletubbiesm and Sarah Michelle Gellar), and it's easy to see why, as it's got a very intriguing, catchy melody to it.  &quot;Atlanta,&quot; the CD's last song, is without a doubt its best.  Sounding like Jim Morrison, Scott sings this song, which goes on for nearly five and a half minutes, with a range that no one would have thought possible when STP were &quot;mere grunge knock-offs.&quot;  This CD is a great return for STP, showing that the future definitely holds promise for them.
6305426651|5.0|&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is the most wonderful and enchanting film I have ever seen. It portrays the Holocaust in such an unusual and emotional way while also leaving the viewer with hope in life and the future. Roberto Benigni is the perfect actor for this movie and his presence contributes immensely to the movie's genuineness. It is a true magnum opus and certainly long awaited after all the &quot;artificial&quot; Hollywood movies have been thrown at us in the past. Finally something heartfelt and refined.
B000002IZ4|5.0|One of the main things STP tried to do on Purple was to differentiate themselves from critics who called them &quot;Seattle-Lite.&quot;  As a result, Purple is a very different album from Core.  Some songs like &quot;Vasoline&quot; still display a hard rock quality, but the rest of the CD is very different, and more melodic than their previous efforts.  A lot of it actually seems inspired by '70's rock.  In fact, this whole CD is terrifically wacky...from the odd picture of the birthday cake on the back to the squirrels that adorn the corners of the songbook pages, this is a really wacky, great CD, and does a lot to give STP their own unique, distinct sound.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Serious Hits Live is one great live CD.  The sound quality is incredible.  Actually, the only negative thing I can really say about it is that sometimes it just sounds TOO clean.  But that does not take away from the overall quality.  I don't understand why anyone would even bother with Phil's HITS cd when they could have this!   1) Unlike HITS, \\"Do you Remember\\" and \\"Don't Lose my number\\" are both here!  And they sound great! 2) Serious Hits Live has ALL the same songs as HITS except \\"Dance into the Light,\\" \\"Both Sides,\\" \\"True Colors\\" (no big loss so far) and \\"I Wish it Would Rain Down.\\" 3) Every song that appears on both HITS and Serious Hits Live sounds twice as good on the latter!<br />The only sound argument, in my opinion, for buying HITS instead of Serious Hits Live is that \\"I Wish it Would Rain Down\\" is only on HITS.  And that is truly one of his best songs, perhaps my overall favorite Phil song.  But all other arguments are [junk].  Every song sounds great here.  \\"In the Air Tonight\\" is truly breathtaking, gives me chills every time I hear it.  Songs like \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Don't Lose My Number,\\" \\"Sussudio,\\" and especially \\"Separate Lives\\" are seriously 5 times better than the respective originals (seriously...get it?).  <br />Just as a side-bar, Phils vocals sound much better here than on any live Genesis album (and I have them all).  I think it's because his solo stuff has always meant more to him personally than the stuff Genesis did.  Sometimes on Genesis live albums, for no apparent reason Phil will start singing with some weird Turkish-like accent which is really annoying (Genesis fans know what I'm talking about...and I don't just mean on \\"Illegal Alien\\").
B00003CXRP|4.0|The Story, Graphics, Music, and Stars (all two of them, and one of them was appearently a very emerging actor that was rumored to have been contracted to act for the movie for $14.95) in any event, the movie is a must-see and will leave anyone who has enough time (2h 20m) with a sense of contentment that is harder and harder to get from movies these days.  However, the 'Bonus' featues that load up the 2-Disc collectors set are a different story.  They seem to be there just to take up space.  Most are boring, not relevent, and way too long.  A couple of the documentaries were intresting, but mainly a bunch of fluff.  The bottom line is that unless you are a collector or something of the sort, buy just the 1-Disc edition with just the movie to save money.
B00005LB50|4.0|Perhaps the most anticipated boxed set in the last ten years (with the possible exception of the elusive _Neil Young Archives_), this box is the end result of ten years of countless archive searches, revisions, and disagreements among band members.<br />With 36 previously unreleased tracks, this box is a virtual gold mine for the serious (and not-so-serious) Buffalo Springfield fan.  Perhaps the biggest deal for this reviewer was the unearthing of a multitude of pristine Neil Young demos.  The most notable of these are the heart-wrenching &quot;There Goes My Babe&quot; from 1966, the proto-&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; track &quot;Down Down Down&quot;, &quot;The Rent is Always Due&quot; from 1967, and the practically unrecognizable 1967 demo of &quot;The Old Laughing Lady&quot; (later to resurface on Neil Young's epynomous solo debut).<br />The first three discs basically present a chronological musical history of the band from its earliest demos in 1966 to Stephen Stills' April 1968 demo of &quot;Four Days Gone&quot;.  In between are contained a slew of unreleased demos and studio recordings, several of which were recorded for the infamous unreleased second Buffalo Springfield album.<br />There are a few major flaws/problems that need to be addressed, however.  First, if you're going to spend the better part of ten years working on a collection like this, you should at least take care to get song running times correct.  For example, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; on disc 3 is listed as 2:40, which suggests that this could in fact be a significantly shorter alternate version of the song.  Oops!  Same recording, wrong running time.<br />Next comes perhaps the most controversial aspect of this collection:  The complete first two albums presented in their original running order, resulting in the repetition of 23 tracks.  Personally, I think that, on its own merits, this is a great idea.  But, if your going to have &quot;Bluebird&quot; on there twice, why not present it on disc two in its legendary 9-minute version instead of the standard version repeated on disc 4?  Yeah, I know that Neil and Stephen both hate it, but what about the fans?  Also, the first album is presented on disc 4 in its original mono mix.  This is great, but why not place the stereo mixes of these tracks on discs 1 and 2?  At least this would have reduced the pain of repetition.<br />Finally, why not include the missing three songs from _Last Time Around_ if only for completion's sake?  There was certainly enough room left on disc 3 to do this.<br />At the end of the day, is this box set really worth the hefty price tag?  Given the reduncancy of disc three, probably not.  Had this collection not been on sale for $44.99 at another retailer who shall remain nameless, I probably would not have rushed out to buy it.  The music, however, is undeniably wonderful.two in its legendary 9-minute version instead of the standard version repeated on disc 4?

B00003CXRP|5.0|Words cannot begin to describe how this movie affected me personally. Instead of churning out another predictible car chasing, bowel movement jokes, gratuitious sex, hollywood piece of junk, Robert Zemekis has created a masterpiece.  While the idea of being stranded on an island isn't a new one, the way this one was done was simply stupendous.<br />The messages delivered in this movie were profound.  The sense of loss and isolation felt by Chuck Noland is apparent and well acted by Hanks.  This is a case of a director counting on a superb actor to make the story compelling.  I don't believe any other actor could have done what Hanks did here.  It takes tremendous talent to keep the audience interested when a good portion of the movie has very little dialogue and has little music.  For those that knock this movie for lacking those things, I simply say this:  If you were to be stranded on an island you will not hear music playing in the background and chances are you will have no one to talk to.  Translation: This movie deals with real life. <br />It's completely refreshing to see a film like this that isn't preoccupied with providing the audience what I call &quot;eye candy&quot; and instead concentrated on presenting not just a film, but an experience.
B000002N2P|5.0|Insomniac by Green Day is a great album, a more hardcore, angry album than Green Day's breakthrough, &quot;Dookie&quot;. Many say this album was angry and hardcore because Green Day wanted to answer its &quot;not punk enough&quot; critics, but I think Billie Joe and the resst of the band made the album this way because they soley wanted to. Anyway, this album is much more consistent that Dookie and it is packed with great songs. How this was not a commercial sucess suprises me, even though it did sell something like 6-8 million copies. This CD has MANY of Green Days best on here.<br />Armatage Shanks- Might sound strange at first, but when you begin to get used to it it's a great song with a catchy beat.<br />Brat- A somewhat crude song about wanting your parents to die just so you can get your inheritance, but it's a good example of the sick crude lyrics this album contains.<br />86- I don't really know the meaning, but I still like it and it's a fun song to listen to.<br />Babs Uvula Who?- Nice, fast paced song. I especially like near the end when Billie is somewhat struggling to yell louder than the guitar.<br />The Panic Song- A big long intro is followed by Billie Joe saying things like &quot;The World is a sick machine breathing a mass of ****<br />Stuart and the Ave.- This has something to do with a real area in Berkley, but I don't know much more about the song that that.<br />Brain Stew- Just a bizzare song, a classic anthem that was #1 on the charts for awhile.<br />Westbound Sign- More quiet, sort of a breath of fresh air, but a really great song.<br />This is a really, really strong effort by Green Day and if you are a fan of the band but don't have this CD you really don't know what you are missing and you need to pick it up as soon as you can, it is an essential CD for all Green Day fans.
0786200553|5.0|Hello, I find the book is a very good english-written book. You can read it very simple and you understand it. It is not like a few other english books, which you can read, but you didn't understand them, because they are not written as straight forwardly.And it is a theme which can be reallity in some hundret years.I like it to read, but itis too short.When you have read it you would that it will go on,so you are longer in this great fantastic world in Jonas. In the one who is chosen to be the first in this little state. It was much fun to read it and I would read more such books like the Giver.
B000001BZT|4.0|I'm a big fan of Steve's, but I'm curious: why haven't any of the reviewers here (or elsewhere, for that matter) commented on Earle's similarities to Springsteen? The working-class characters, the jangly gi-tars, the chorus you can't shake - it's all there, but nobody ever talks about it. I think if you're a fan of one you've gotta be a fan of the other... yes? Please comment. Thanks
0451191153|4.0|This was an entertaining read. The characters were well developed and the story very engaging. I found Peter Keating the most interesting character of them all. This book does take some time to get going and the end was a letdown. I found it very predictable and preachy.<br />Whether or not you subscribe to &#8220;Objectivism&#8221;, I think you&#8217;ll find this book both engaging and at the very least thought provoking. Forget all the arguments by supporters and detractors of &#8220;Objectivism&#8221; and just read it for the pleasure of a well-written story. This is not Noble Prize material but much better than any recommendation [...] could give you.
B000002UAU|3.0|This album was spoiled to death in the studio!  The trickery and excess junk used on this album is too much!  The songs are mediocre, only &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; sticks out as notable. You would expect better from this otherwise wonderful band. Only the Beatles could have gotten away with this overindulgence.  Most of the songs seem to be the product of excessive drug use. Where did such magnificent writers get the idea for songs like &quot;Fixing A Hole&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; ?
0060976624|5.0|this funny, satirical, sharp-witted novel is something that will make you scream with laughter.  to be read by both smokers and non-smokers.  hilarious &amp; cynical, after having read this book you will never look at smoking the same way again - don't get me wrong, this is no book of the how's and about's to quit smoking (but you might consider taking a job as a spokesman for a tobacco company. Buckley's words are harsh and unforgiving, he blurts things right out, the result = 100% pure unfiltered entertainment. a great story that just'll give you a lucky strike with every page you turn!
0790738074|5.0|Wonderful musical comedy for the whole family.  I've seen this film at least 30 times and never tire of it.  The entire cast is terrific, and the production is completely top rung.  Robert Preston's performance is beyond superb.  Most highly recommended.
1573226521|4.0|A hot book, fast paced, well-written, words sharper than razor blades, powerful characters, interesting through-out! This book is absolutely fantastic, the character of Richard is described so well, so ALIVE that you just become him - in a way - while reading, even becoming a part of his menacing memories of the Vietnam war.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is, because it takes about 200 pages until something happens, you might call a trigger to later events and there on to the big showdown at the end of the book. The first 200 pages are constructed very well, just like the last, but it kind of just shuffles along, giving us the beach life, the adventure of being stranded on an unknown island. These elements are important to build up a story, but chewed on for too long when it comes to creating the right circumstances for bad things to happen. All I want to say is, that Garland although writing well, had some problems with keeping the story fluid. Put these aside and you got a very thrilling, invloving read, you will remember for a long time - and enjoy much longer, even when you are finished.
B00004Z45A|5.0|i actually bought this album about 9 months ago after i had downloaded all thier songs.this definatly is NOT a beer coaster cd.all the songs are different,and have meaning.one of the first things i noticed was the&quot;lack&quot; of potty mouth(theres no cussing on this record)which sets an example that linkin park doesnt have to follow the leader.......PS they are great live
0385484518|5.0|This book truly cuts through to the essence of life. I took some time to go over the negative reviews and must disagree with many of them. This book not only gives the altruistic notion of &quot;Stopping to smell the Roses&quot;, but much more.<br />Indeed there are many life lessons we all know, but I feel the true meaning behind this book is to not only take advantage of every moment, but to relish each moment as a once in a lifetime opportunity. Morrie shares his life trough his disease and eventual death. His life is as much a testament to living as his death was. The lessons learned within this book are not simply the words printed on the page, but more a philosophy to maximize ourselves through meaningful and loving relationships.<br />While Morrie may have had private nurses and still professed not to live life ruled by money, I think the truer measurement of his life is in the number of people his life has touched through life - and now through death.<br />A wonderful book and a must read for anyone who feels they may be letting every-day life consume their very existence.
B000056K04|3.0|Last month, I sat through a disappointing DMB concert at Detroit's Comerica Park.  The band was passionless, had no energy and played a bunch of notes in the proper sequence.  Definitely not worth $50.<br />I had high expectations for both the concert and the &quot;Everyday&quot; disc based on past experience.  I have every DMB album and their Listener Supported DVD.  I am an avid DMB fan (with great affection for the genius of Carter Beauford) but am not a great fan of &quot;Everyday.&quot;<br />The band made a mistake switching to Ballard.  His formulaic pop rock influence takes the DMB to the least common denominator, which of course, will probably maximize the band's market appeal.  One of my friends said it well: The songs are pretty good but Ballard's production values almost completely eradicate the key DMB signatures from this effort.  &quot;Everyday&quot; should have been a stellar offering from the band.  Instead, it is a high-volume seller of pulp fiction appeal.<br />Aside from the excellent musicianship of Dave, Carter and Steffan, the key differentiator of the DMB is the folk and jazz influence of Leroi and Boyd with sax and violin. These influences are glaringly absent from &quot;Everyday.&quot;<br />If you are a diehard DMB fan, you probably already have this release and have formed your opinion of it.  If you are looking to gain exposure to DMB, don't get &quot;Everyday.&quot; Instead, consider &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming,&quot; &quot;Before These Crowded Streets,&quot; &quot;Live at Red Rocks,&quot; and &quot;Listener Supported.&quot;  Then move to &quot;Everyday.&quot;<br />And on the outside chance the band reads this review, I have this to say: You are an awesomely talented band. Don't confuse Ballard's friendship with his ability to produce your albums the way they should be.  Stay friends with him but get Lillywhite back on track and stick with him.  Remember that the producer is just as much a musician as the rest of the band.  Ballardboned the production on this album.  Please don't let him do it again!
B00003CXN4|1.0|shoddy, gimmicky directing and appalling acting by zeta-jones. boring and typical.
079213690X|5.0|&quot;Scotland Forever&quot; is the translation of my title.  William Wallace is one of my personal heroes.  &quot;Braveheart&quot; tells the story of his life ... with some definite fiction thrown in for dramatic license and to move the tale along.  Even with the factual inaccuracies (e.g., Wallace was a Border scot ... he wore trousers, not a kilt), this is a brilliant, moving film.  All cast members played their roles very well.  Cinematography and soundtrack are outstanding as well.  &quot;Braveheart&quot; was highly deserving of every accolate it received.  I recommend this film to anyone with an interest in medieval history, battle tactics, and Scotland.
0345298349|5.0|I really enjoyerd Gorky Park. The character development was one of the best parts of the book. The plot was flawless. Gorky Park is such a well-reseached book that it seems Martin Cruz Smith grew up an lived behind the Iron Curtain; this book is an accurate and engaging portrait of the USSR.
630027179X|5.0|I'm a long-standing lover of the Arthurian fiction cycle.  I've read most of the books (including Malory's &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot;) available in the English language, and have developed my own fondnesses for characters.  &quot;Excalibur,&quot; for the most part, shows England as it might have been during Arthur's time ... muddy, bloody and wet (as opposed to the more frequent portrayals showing Camelot looking clean and pristine).  The best part of this film, in my opinion, is the casting of Merlin.  Nicol Williamson now defines that role for me, and is the meter by which any other portrayal is measured.  The film is also visually beautiful, with some truly marvelous special effects (particularly the transformation of Uther to look like Gorlois when he visits Igraine).  Well worth your time!
0440211727|5.0|John Grishamm is truely master. This book was sometimes hilarious, sometimes serious, sometimes sympathetic, sometimes..... whatever... I really loved this book. Very very highly recommanded. I think mr.jake doesn't act like real lawyer, nor jurors, nor judges, nobody. bBt it's a novel, so I don't care. it's worth reading.
079073463X|4.0|As a medieval reenactor and sometime historian, I am always looking for more &quot;costume drama&quot; on video or DVD.  &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; is a long-time favorite of mine.  The fantasy storyline is at times a trifle overdone, but otherwise a good film.  The costuming, fight choreography, cinematography ... all excellent.  Worth a rental if nothing else.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie is a breathe of fresh air.  In this day of cookie-cutter girl groups and boy bands, it is nice to have an alternative.  For those of you in search of a mature sound and meaningful lyrics, you have to get this CD.  There are very few CDs that I listen to and like through and through (on the first listen).  If you are a Jill Scott or Lauryn Hill, I think you will enjoy India's music.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has one of the most incredible voices I've ever heard.  I have found myself trying to describe her unusual style (combining Celtic music with other rhythms) and find myself falling short.  I purchased this album for one specific cut, &quot;Bonny Portmore,&quot; and was enchanted by the entire thing.  Each track has its own special qualities.  I cannot recommend this album highly enough.
0060977493|5.0|I was told that Arundhati Roy wrote this book as a sort of protest againt the mind-numbing influence of TV and movies today. Well she succeeds in painting such vivid images and complex thoughts, that her book kept me away from the television for several days. This book is captivating. The story pulls you into its exotic setting and customs. It is the epitome of lyrical prose, as its words flow off the page. It has something for everyone: forbidden love, family secrets, passion, spirituality, and death. I don't want to ruin the book by giving away the plot, as it has more than a few interesting twists, but you should definitely pick up this book.
0790742780|3.0|This so-called &quot;Tale of Urban Reality&quot; is too cynical to be taken seriously, but Douglas is so good it's irresistible. This story parallels Douglas, who was sacked from his previous job building missles to defend a country he once believed in, with L.A. Police Investigator Duvall (as always, a real treat). Duvall's wife (Tuesday Weld) is planning his retirement after losing their young girl to S.I.D.S. Douglas, on the other hand, is initially trying to keep a cool head, looking for work and wants to visit divorced wife (Barbara Hershey) for their little girl's birthday. Hershey in no way wants to see Douglas - a man she claims formerly verbally abused her - presumably from everyday job stress. Tension build-up from an early morning traffic jam drives innocent Douglas to walk the streets of L.A. to his girl's birthday, in which he encounters events and people that would drive even Fred Rogers insane. Dreary, and way too cyncical portrait of &quot;everyday life&quot; combined with weak transitions between two undeveloped characters will confuse most viewers of the connection that Duvall and Douglas share. Yet, Douglas's confrontations with L.A. slimb and grimb yield classic, unforgettable moments. A must-see for Douglas fans. Douglas truly carries the film to levels where even the viewers can connect with his struggle. However, the ending will turn viewers away. Judge for yourself.
0452282152|5.0|Finishing this book is like eating a gourmet meal. You didn't need it, but it sure was enjoyable. Girl With a Pearl Earring is fine storytelling; at the close, you'll wish it were a true account of Vermeer's masterpiece. Told in first person by teenage maid, Griet, this novel creates a passionate tension like in all those great Merchant Ivory films. Repressed sensuality, religious differences, conniving women, dastardly rich folks - it's all here. This book is an excellent choice for Book Clubs everywhere!
0395645662|4.0|The book is the best english-written book I've ever read. That's not because it's my first one. It's also much better than some German books because it shows a future that really could be in some hundret years. Jonas lives in this world and he only can see black and white, don't know what has been in the past and does everyday the same job. But then comes the day of his 12th birthday and everything changes It's interesting written, easy to understand and it's great fun to read this novel.
B00004TH6O|3.0|Certainly a must have for any fan of Joshua Homme.  Many tracks stand out but a few sound like horseplay.  Definately not NEARLY as excellent as the first QOTSA album.  Get that first.
B00005J73X|5.0|This CD is an awewome compilation of some of the band's greatest songs. It displays the band's raw talent and the unbelieveable energy they have on stage. It is a must for any true Bon Jovi fan.
0060254920|5.0|Unlike a lot of the junk that masquerades as &quot;children's literature&quot; these days, with goodie-two-shoes children in overly clean worlds, this is a classic example of a &quot;real&quot; child's fantasy. It inspired many of mine as a child. This, and In The Night Kitchen (slightly more scary, for me at least) are must-haves for my children's bookcases!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I own all four of Rage Against The Machine's cds, and I have to say that this is the best of them all. It combines their famous rythmic, low tempo guitars, classic thrashing solos by Tom, and Zack's inspiring yet emotional lyrics. This cd is perfect for the little revolutionist in everybody. If you ever look at getting a Rage cd, this is it. But I also push every other cd they have made, as well. Battle of Los Angeles sort of brings together the classic Rage style in their Evil Empire cd with the newer, hipper sound in Renegades, making it a must have. Whether you just like the guitars, or crave for the lashing lyrics, everyone can find a little enjoyment in this.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Definitely a good movie, great acting from Hopkins (Lecter), Oldman(Verger) and Moore(Starling). I have no clue why people are comparing it with &quot;Silence..&quot; or &quot;Manhunter&quot;, agreed Hannibal Lecter is glorified, while in the previous one's he is more of a personification of evil, but this movie was about Lecter, who else do you want to be glorified Verger.<br />As, I was reading the reviews, one writer said the concept of man-eating pigs was taken from the movie &quot;Snatch&quot;, get your facts correct, the book contains the concept, all Ridley Scott did is use it. <br />The other comment, too much gore, well again blame the book, that in fact contains more detailed gore. <br />The places that I felt were short-coming of this movie, were in the character development of the character played by Ray Liotta (Krendler), the book depicts him to be a totally sleazy and slime ball, it also details out the reason he has a grudge against and what exactly does he consider her to be?? But the movie didn't actually delve too deeply in Krendler's characterisation and resulting, a good actor like Liotta was wasted.<br />The other area, was no Margot Verger, Mason's sister, that was a colossal disappointment for me, that would have given the movie a more meaningful ending.<br />Hence, I would say its a good movie, but not a great one. You want to see Hannibal, forget the Lecter of Silence and embrace the Lecter of Hannibal

B000002IOW|5.0|I remember a friend of mine coming over to my house one cold November evening. I had been home with a horrible case of the flu, and when he told me that he had good news, I had no idea that he meant that Rush had come out with a new album. We had discussed a couple of weeks before how we had looked forward to their next release. Upon hearing my friends glowing review of &quot;Presto&quot;, the first thing that I did the next day, was buy the tape to hear for myself. To this day, it remains one of my favorite albums. By either Rush or anyone else. It seems as though the great artists are always finding ways to break new ground. This groups versatility nevers ceases to amaze me. From the opening track &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; to the closing track &quot;Available Light&quot;, Rush finds a way to keep me engrossed in the sounds and musicality within each song. I love music that is inviting musically and creatively, and since hearing Grace Under Pressure, they have been my favorite group.It is a joy to see the positive responses from most everyone. It is certainly easy to understand how one can love this album. Everything from the musicianship, songwriting and engineering is classic Rush. The utmost in quality, authenticity and creative brilliance. To have named this album &quot;Presto&quot; is most appropriate. For Rush, pulled yet again, another rabbit out of their musical hats, and another winning card from their creative sleeves. Way to go!
B000002AH7|5.0|How many times can you honestly say that an album is unique (truly unique, as in one of a kind)?  Many people feel that it isn't really jazz.  But it's definitely not classical, flamenco, or anything else, really.  Structurally, the strong, somewhat traditional (at least in Latin music) descending minor chord progressions are a refreshing change from the one-four-five progressions that form or inform most of even Miles' music.  Given the strength of this architecture, I think it allows Miles to play a little bit more of a role in the famous Gil Evans-Miles Davis combination.  It's not being totally fair to the earlier stuff, but sometimes it sounds a little like Evans is the Casio synthesizer providing the bass, rhythm, etc., and Miles is the street performer tacking on a tinny melody line.  Not so on Sketches of Spain.<br />Substantively, I always associate this album with solitude, which, as a native of the American West, I appreciate.  It is indisputably and uniformly melancholy.  It makes for great road music, which is unusual for jazz.  Enough.  Take a chance, like Miles and Evans did.  I think it works.
B00005LMBK|4.0|...but when it's bad.... Uneven with bursts of brilliance, kinda like the FLC's latest, &quot;Loco&quot;, or Van Helden's &quot;Killing Puritans&quot;. Damon and Del deliver, but I was expecting a lot more from Dan the Automator, his contributions are hardly original.
B000050XEI|5.0|&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is my favourite Enya album.  Filled with plenty tranquil classic enya pieces including the smash first single, &quot;Only Time&quot;.  Also includes the awesome instrumental title track &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;.  A must buy, you won't be disappointed. If you loved &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, this will be ten times better.
B000001FAK|5.0|My buddy Mike Cinelli and I were big Brittish Blues fans back in the late 60's.  We had seen most if not all of the greats...Fleetwood Mac (the original with Peter Green) et al. We got the tickets for Mayall's concert not knowing that he had switched gears and had revamped the Bluesbreakers.  The night of the concert arrived (July 12, 1969...the late show I believe...I usually went to the late shows at the Fillmore).  The curtain goes up and the announcer fumbled the intro but John made it right...and there before us on a naked stage (no Joshua light show...no diversion of any kind) stood this quartet. What most fans of the lp don't realize is that this night was also the debut of John's old pal, Eric Clapton's new band...Blind Faith...up at Madison Square... John invited the half-capacity crowd to come on closer and make the event more intimate as it was going to be recorded....(surprise to us...a good surprise...because now I have a 'living testament' to the night's events.  The music was astounding, breathtaking and immediate.  It remains a turning point for me both as a fan and as a musician.  John blew our minds with his superlative understated sound.  The recording quality (after all it was the Fillmore East...the same place the Allman Brothers and many other bands would choose to record...for it has excellent acoustics.)  You not only heard the blues going through its evolution but you felt it...it drew you in...and it didn't/doesn't matter who you are or where you came from.  It is powerful music.  One I rank as part of my 5 all-time favorite lps...or CD's to many of you.  Nylon string guitar, flute/sax, elec. bass and harp/vocals/slide guitar...all in a rich and textural format...no excessiveness at all.....this was one of those times when less proved to be more...so much more... I will never forget the event...the music...the message... This is truly one of the great albums of the 60's...the blues...and of music...period. Vince DeLucia 7/17/01...
B000056VIY|1.0|To Any parent: DON&quot;T LET YOUR KID GET THIS!  This is the worse album i've heard in my life, full of unwarranted explicitvies, J.Lo has ruined her carreer on this cd.  Love Don't Cost A THing is about the only thing worth buying on this album.
0393312836|5.0|What can I say?  This book is disturbing and lovely.  If you've read the American version (minus the last chapter)  you are missing the whole point!  Get the updated American version (which is the same as the British version) for the entire story.  It's not just a book, it's a social phenomenon!  The movie is wonderful as well, but Kubrick (the late genius) also excluded the last chapter from the film version.  Shame on him!  However the book is still simply astounding.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick's last film should not be toyed with. It is a movie that left me in awe for many days after I saw it. I had to see it three more times just to fully unerstand it. If you REALLY love Kubrick and truly can understand what he means in all his films, then you will realize that this is a truly phenomenal work. From the very first scene, the entire film is full of beautiful music, breathtakingly beautiful women, intrigue, mystery, and flashes of both surrealism and super-realism side by side, reminding one of a dream (or nightmare); thus adapted from Schnitzler's novel TRAUMnovelle. If you are captivated by the very first scene (with Shostakovich's waltz and Nicole Kidman's bare back exposed) as I was, you will undoubtedly enjoy the entire film. It is in one word &quot;beautiful&quot;. This movie was not appreciated by the majority of the critics, but that is simply their problem. This movie is NOT for everyone; a bit too philosophical and psychological for some (A Jungian-Freudian mix), and also a bit too graphic for others. Nonetheless, all the senseless hype aside, Kubrick's last film is indeed the culmination of a great director's lifelong work. You will either despise this movie or regard it as a great work after seeing it.
6303314015|5.0|Yeah, you heard right. Disney is not planning to release the DVD version of the Lion King until the year 2004. Though they did say that they are planning to release it this fall as a part of a special edition collector set. The problem is with that is it'll cost anywhere from 250 to 500 big ones. Speak out and demand that they release The Lion King DVD sooner!!

0345350499|1.0|Let me start as so many other reviewers have: by saying that the ideas behind this book were intriguing, but the actual book fell fall short of its promise. And now for my responses to the standard topics.<br />Length: Could have been cut nearly in half. Writing style: Rich and descriptive, but often too much (see above). Historical inaccuracy: Didn't much bother me. It's a fairy tale; it doesn't have to be perfect. Religious inaccuracy: See above, and add enough ignorance on my part that I didn't really notice it. Anti-Christian bias: I found a lot of the pagan opinions on Christianity to be interesting and thought-provoking, and the fact that they were as petty as the Christians more or less erased the bias in my mind. Characters: Loved 'em when they weren't scheming or being tragically obsessive (about a quarter of the book).  The idea that this book spawns life-changing bursts of feminism in its readers scares me.
B00005B4GU|4.0|So, Radiohead fans. What's the verdict? More accessible and emotional than Kid A, as some critics have claimed? Or yet more obscure prog-rock navel gazing from, in my humble opinion, the World's Greatest Band?<br />Probably a little of both. Being a huge fan of Kid A - which has just overtaken OK Computer as my favorite Radiohead album - I had very high expectations. At first, I hated it. I found it inaccessible, even for Radiohead, and thought I would rarely play it. Disappointment was an understatement. Not being one to give up easily, however, I persisted - and I'm glad that I did. Amnesiac is phenomenal - with only two exceptions (the unlistenable 'Like Spinning Plates' and the pretentious, irritating and just plain awful 'Life in a Glass House').<br />But enough nitpicking - the rest of Amnesiac is astonishing;  encompassing jazz, lo-fi, prog rock(!) and a little bit of classical music. Highlights include the gorgeous new single 'Pyramid Song' - it's descent into jazz is brilliant; The wonderful 'You and Whose Army?' - which starts off in the style of 40s crooners The Ink Spots (an acknowledged influence), and descends into guitar-driven madness, and The Morning Bell Amnesiac, which is a re-worked (arguably more moving) version of the Kid A Track.<br />I don't want to go on and on and bore the pants off you by describing every track - but I just want to let you know that Amnesiac and Kid A, are two pieces of art every home should have.  I highly recommend them both, if you are unfamiliar with Radiohead, and are looking to expand your musical horizons.  <br />Thanks, Radiohead, for making the music you want to make, and for not submitting to any corporate pressure to make 'OK Computer 2'.<br />Real music is still alive, and you guys are at the forefront.
0441003257|5.0|Who would have ever thought the end of the world could be so funny? Pratchett and Gaiman, apparently. What starts out as a divine comedy of errors soon develops into an epic tale of the infinite shades of gray between good and evil. The characters are not just engaging, they're lovable. It's wonderful to see the contrast between Crowley and Aziraphale completely cease to exist as they show that there's not that much space between Heaven and Hell. But character and comedy aren't the only bright spots in this book. More than anything, it has a deeply cerebral level. It's a wonderful book to read and then just sit back and think about for a while.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek The Motion Picture is a good film. It works on many different areas of entertainment..but Star Trek The Motion Picture-Director's Edition will be a great film. As good as the first version was, for years it has been handicaped by a horrible rush to release date, which meant many unedited optical effects and no preview screening. For years this has rankled its director, Robert Wise, the acclaimed director of The Sound Of Music and The Day The Earth Stood Still, and editor of Citizen Kane. Now, over twenty years later, Mr. Wise has been given the opportunity to go back and restore, rework, and refurbish this classic film. It will feature a reworked soundtrack, additional scenes,improved optical effects and more. It's thought provoking storyline, wonderful Jerry Goldsmith score, fondly familiar characters,and beautiful visual style make  for a fulfiling cinematic experience.The Human Adventure Is Just Beginning...
1558908358|4.0|Even today, Tron is mentioned in our pop culture.  My above title, is not meant to be insulting...actually it's dialogue from a great &quot;Simpsons&quot; Halloween episode where Homer crosses over to another dimension, which reminds him of Tron.  When he asks if anybody saw the movie, only Chief Wiggum says Yes, then pauses and says, &quot;I mean, no&quot;, as if to imply that many of us love Tron, but are just afraid to admit it, probably because the movie was not a success.  <br />Like many others, I felt the DVD release was good and bad.  Good, being that the picture and sound quality were very impressive.  Bad, being that Disney had released a very, very expensive Laserdisc edition of Tron which included a ton of extras, and none of them made it on the DVD except for the trailer.  But I think, hopefully, now that Disney is beginning to come around in the DVD universe, a Special Edition release seems a likely possibility.  The only question is, how long will it take for them to get around to releasing it?  It really shouldn't take long.  Why?  The special features have already been made (for the CAV laserdisc: deleted scenes, pre-production animation tests, soundtrack music deleted from the film, excerpts from two behind-the-scenes documentaries, theatrical trailers, concept art, storyboards, publicity materials, computer animation demo reels, and more) they'd just need to transfer them to the DVD and that's it.  Unless they want to add something more, like a cool audio commentary with Jeff Bridges &amp; Bruce Boxleitner.  I would love an Isolated Score of the wonderful music by Wendy Carlos, which has never been released on compact disc and is out of print in all other formats.  But perhaps the fact that the film was not a hit in theaters is the reason for the delay of a new release?  Maybe Disney doesn't think it will make enough money to justify making it.  Personally I think they're wrong if they think that.  Let's just keep our fingers crossed and pray thatthey come to their senses.

B00000K31Q|5.0|The movie is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina &quot;Kat&quot; Stratford (Julia Stiles). Bianca is the popular sister who wants to start dating a popular boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan)and Kat is the social outcast. Trying to keep his daughters from dating for fear they may get pregnant, their paranoid father (Larry Miller) makes a family rule where Bianca cannot date until Kat does, which seems impossible. New kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has a huge crush on Bianca and, thinking Bianca likes him in return and wants to date him, he and his friend Michael Eckman (David Khumoltz) devises a scheme where they try to pair Kat off with the school &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). <br />By reading the basic plot above, you probably think this is just another Teen Flick? Well, though technically a teen flick, it lacks the shallowness that other movies of this genre have. With witty dialogue, some very funny physical stunts, some great acting, and a hip soundtrack headlined by Letters To Cleo, this film is a definate must own.<br />As for the DVD, for people with 5.1 Surround Sound, this movie is perfect! However, it is very disappointing in the extras department. The ONLY thing this DVD has is the theatrical trailer for the movie. So unless you really, REALLY want to own the theatrical trailer for the movie, I suggest you save your money and go for the VHS version instead.

B00000064E|5.0|I am the owner of over a 1000 CD's and have spent a lot of time collecting 60's 70's rock and folk.  Just a couple of months ago my brother-in-law sends me Nick Drake for my birthday.  I went nuts.  His voice and lyrics remind me of Leonard Cohen, his music has a very clean sound, and his guitarist is fantastic.  Going to my books I found out this guys interesting history which especially includes his real performance anxiety and the lack of FM radio in Britain during his era. All they played was pop at the time thus neglecting a real master.  If you like the fusion of folk, acoustic rock, and classical elements with clear tight vocal arrangements then you cant lose with this one.
0345350499|5.0|Books that turn expectations upside-down are always favourites of mine. This one is no exception. <br />So many more limited authors seem to think it is a really great idea to rewrite the Arthur legends and come up with dull but worthy heroic fantasy. Bradley didn't. She created a vision that was both fantastic and imaginative but is also rooted a fair amount of historical understanding - the period of history in which Arthur is rooted was a period of religous change: Pagan religions declining or changing in the face of Christianity; immense social and cultural dislocation is also understandable as more matriarchal societies were superceded by patriarchal ones. <br />But that's not the point, of course. Bradley, in subverting the conventional Arthur story, wrote a fine and moving piece of fiction, replete with memorable characters and real emotional development. I know I always go on about the need for emotional maturity in novels - but to me, this is what makes or breaks stories. This is a story about people and their understandings and relations with each other, it isn't a piece of propaganda or a manifesto for anything. Sure, it is pagan and it is feminist, but those things made up what Bradley was and were part of what made her such a good author and worthwhile human being, so what do you expect? People who think that there are only certain allowable perspectives from which one should see the universe should either learn and be prepared to change, or leave more complicated and nuanced visions like Bradley's well alone. <br />The Mists of Avalon is a classic, a beautiful and humane work that should read by anyone with an open mind and a love of well-crafted fantastic writing.
B00004ZD69|4.0|I've scanned the (...)reviews that are posted on this album. An interesting pattern appears to be there, in which people are very split on its merits -- the majority are crazy about it (and really feel they have heard something very new and special), while the vocal minority feel almost scammed by it (emperor's new clothes and all that). I am in the former category, as I find the music new, exciting, moving, frightening, beautiful, sad, and exhilirating, all at once. But I can see why it's not for everyone. It loosely falls into some sort of category of \\"symphonic rock\\" -- kind of like an updated Pink Floyd sound (Atom Heart/Ummagumma vintage). Once you get past the scale of the music (if you do get past it), you can get caught up in it. It's definitely not something where you can listen to it for 3-5 minutes (your average song length), and then decide whether you like it or not -- you have to take it in as a whole. If people want to take this one step further, I suggest some of Glenn Branca's rock symphonies. <br />One small point: I didn't see much mention of the artwork/packaging, which is great.
B000056K04|3.0|its overall not a disaster.  As a old time Dave fan, who bought Under the Table and Dreaming when it came out and then quickly Remember Two Things on the independent label, and considers Ants Marching one of the greatest songs of the 90s, you could say i definitely appreciate the older sound of the band a lot more.  The reaction to this album has certainly not been in short supply.  One reviewer wrote &quot;The main difference between &quot;Everyday&quot; and previous studio releases is that some of the choruses and bridges absolutely soar and reach new heights.&quot;  I'd care to disagree and say that the main difference between Everyday and the classic DMB is that the old stuff was written and performed by the band and Everyday is written by Ballard and performed by Dave Matthews.  Now I'm not saying that this album and this new sound is bad... however i do feel that it is subpar compared to the rest.  For an old fan, Everyday is not UTTAD, Crash, or Before these crowded streets, but they will know it by now because any old fan will have already bought the record.  For new fans, Everyday is most likely a great record, not spoiled by false expectations, and a refreshing dose of rock music that is definitely worth picking up.   No song on here is a jam classic such as Ants Marching, Two Step, or Lie in Our Graves, for nothing is jammed out.  All the songs clock under 5 minutes, unreal for DMB.  By comparison none of the unreleased Lillywhite Sessions songs fall shorter than 4 minutes and Bartender is over 10 minutes.  However in concert Everyday when combined with #36 is solid and upbeat and ranks up there with some older material, and the rest of the tracks sound better.  Personally I enjoy Everyday and So Right the most of the Everyday songs, along with Angel(also widely expanded in concert), What You Are, The Space Between, When The World Ends, and Fool to Think.  I Did It is in my opinion the worst song on the record, but thats a personal opinion.  I think withtime, concerts, and an upcoming DVD release that is rumored to be from the recent Folsom Field concert, the songs will evolve and earn a respected spot in DMB's material.  Of course, the live material is what makes Dave Matthews. Finally, there is the issue of Everyday vs The Lillywhite Sessions, produced by Steve Lillywhite prior to Ballard's work and including 12 different songs, most tour tested previously.  The Lillywhite Sessions contain such songs as Bartender, Grey Street, Grace is Gone, and Big Eyed Fish.  Having possessed the Lillywhites for awhile,and finding it superior(and giving it much more air time) then my Everyday album, I'll give my opinions on the critiscms of it as an album: consisting mainly of the opinions its too depressing, contains no radio friendly hits, and would have ruined them financially and decreased concert outturn.  The sessions are somber, and most of the songs are of a depressing nature, but there is an openess and honesty on the Lillywhite Sessions that is more identifiable then the poppish and fake Everyday songs.  As to the opinion that there are no radio hits, I personally feel Greystreet, Sweet Up and Down, and Busted Stuff could have been hits, and also since when has DMB been about Radio hits(BTCS didnt have much radio play compared to other bands).  Finally, there is no way the Lillywhites would have done anything but increase interest in touring, because the casual fans Everyday attracts buy records, while the old heads the Lillywhite's appeal to buy the tickets. To sum it up, Everyday is a decent album, and could be a very good pickup if you're new to DMB.  However I'd suggest Live at Red Rocks or UTTAD and Crash to any new fan whose looking into DMB, before this album, because this is probably the weakest Dave release to date.
0553106635|4.0|The whole thing is pretty good idea for....PC game. I dare say the game will be  great. About the script? Well.. It is more like having ... with you average girlfriend. Once a date is o.k, once a working-week is not so bad, but once a day? And we are talking history-flavoured fantasy here. Mr.Martin is a greatest in that field.  His first book  was like Revelation-comes-true. But over the third one, there is so many identic historical data that some true believers ought to demand  a footnotes! After all there is nothing wrong about getting lost in his ever-lasting descriptive scenes a-la Leo Tolstoy. Real pitty this is not the game to disable features at wish! History is beyond esteem once per storyline, quite digestible once per chapter, but once-per-page?  ONE HISTORY TOO MUCH!
B00002NDB1|4.0|For some reason people consider this to be a very weak album, and this is far from the truth. You're right, Bruce Dickinson is missing (and I suppose you're already used to the fact that Adrian Smith is too), but they will come back on the next album, and if you're willing to accept  Blaze Bayley, you'll have a fun ride throughout the entire spin of the disc. The first time I listened to this album, and to be more specific, to the opener - Futureal,  I thought it was the crappiest album I will ever listened to, but after several listens I found out that its actually a GOOD album, yes! Still, it is one of Maiden's weakest albums, but that doesn't mean much as Maiden's catalog is full of masterpiece albums. Even the weaker albums are still good metal albums. Back to this one, it opens with Futureal. You've pretty much never heard such a Maiden song before, its different - but good. Less than 3 minutes of complete metal action, it may sound quite cheap at start, but then you'll like it - its catchy and has good riffs and a nice solo. The second song is the weakest chain of the album. Its called the Angel And The Gambler and the problem with it is that its 10 minutes. 10-minute songs can be excellent, but this one is just a 4-5 minute song played over and over again. Basically all parts are pretty good, but they are just repeated over and over. If you're not really concentrating on the music (doing other stuff at the same time) it could be a great song, but if you're all &quot;in it&quot; then you'll get bored after a few minutes. Anyhow, next is Lightning Strikes Twice, its a decent metal song, has a good opening, and a strong chorus, and clocks well at just under 5 minutes. Track no. 4 is The Clansman. Many consider this one of Maiden's best epics. Its a long 9 minute song that builds up slowly, and is very melodic. Still, it will take quite a few listens to like it. Personally, I think its good but I don't find this as the highlight of the album, though many others do.  The fifth track is When Two Worlds Collide. I find it quite similar to Lightning Strikes Twice (perhaps because of the two-twice metaphor). Anyhow, it also builds slowly, has a good chorus, and a strong ending - a strong number (6:17 minutes). The Educated Fool picks up next, and shows Bayley's abilities at full strength. It builds up slowly and becomes more and more rapid. Towards the ending it becomes very fast, and is overall very enjoyable at close to 7 minutes. Track no. 7 is Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger: an 8-minute song in the vein of The Educated Fool. Like most other songs on here (except for Futureal of course) it starts up slowly and builds itself, with a deep Bayley-chorus. The nice thing is that it becomes quicker and quicker as the minute clock progresses, that's very nice indeed. The masterpiece part of this starts at about 5 minutes into the song, when things start getting really fast, and the guys are playing as if they're 20 years old (especially Steve). Then you get a 2-minute instrumental part with great solos throughout. The ending minute is slower as the starting ones. As you could figure, this is my favorite song of the album. The ending song is Como Estais Amigos, a slow and deep song, and overall a strong album closer. That's it, only 8 songs on this album, like the classic 80's Maiden albums. Still, this is certainly not Powerslave, Somewhere In Time, or 7th Son, but yet remains a strong album.  All those people here telling you how bad this is don't have a clue. They probably heard the name Blaze Bayley and already came to critize this album. I will not exaggerate if I say that with Burce Dickinson on it, it could have been the same class as Chemical Wedding (and that is a very high class). Anyhow, this is a very enjoyable album - not the best, but not the worst, and one of the better offerings 1998 has in terms of metal. If you're a loyal Maiden or Bayley fan you owe it to yourself. If you're just an average metal fan you canstill try it, and like it!

0385474547|3.0|Chinua Achebe is quite a writer, with beautiful descriptions and quite a touching story.<br />It's just that, though, that makes &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; unfinishable. With too much descritption that blows an extremely slow plot out of proportion, a reader doesn't even know what the conflict is until halfway through this book. By that time, the reader will have read countless descriptions that are at first, beautiful literary works, but eventually turning repetitive and boring.<br />If you actually suceed in finishing the book, you may have enjoyed at most 50% of it. At other times you find yourself reading about everyday life with no excitement and no problem until halfway through the book. Character development is poor and thus a reader never truly connects with the characters, and the plot was not done justice with Chinua Achebe's slow writing style. Sure, he may have used some beautiful phrases of description, but it did not help a reader in turning the page.<br />To cut it short, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is, in most aspects, boring. The extraordinary plot is ruined, because you won't even have realized what the plot is before you put this book down.
B00005B4GU|4.0|It's my first Radiohead album and the music is pretty soft.  I wish it had more upbeat music in it.   However, the quality and composition of the songs is first rate.
0679777547|5.0|Who would have thought that a book about books could be so intriguing. To any book lover this is a dream come true. Perez-Reverte's, The Club Dumas, rose quite quickly to the top of my favorite books list as soon as I read the first few pages. The style in which he writes draws the reader in and leaves you wanting more as soon as the last page has been read. The double plot draws the reader in and only reveals itself towards the end of the novel. The Satanical aspect is an uneasy yet suspenseful thrill that adds to the novel as a whole. I was inspired to dive into the realm of Dumas after reading this novel and from their I added another new favorite, The Three Musketeers, to my list. The manner in which Perez-Reverte combines the plot of The Three Musketeers into his own novel is masterly and thouroughly executed. Any lover of books cannot deny the fascination this novel breeds towards the books of the past. Through his writings I have become even more devoted to my already undying love of books and have expanded my list of enjoyable authors through the connections I find in his novels to others of history past. That is why I feel that this book is one that makes you want to read more. I truly recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest fascination with reading.
B000002U82|5.0|One of the seminal works of this group, if not of the genre of modern rock music itself, Dark Side of the Moon is a seamless piece of art that transcends not only its genre, but also the works of the band itself, whose collective works are impressive by any standard.<br />It's hard to believe this piece is 30 years old.  It should be considered one of the truly few pieces of music in any class that is able to withstand the test of time and continues to seem ageless.<br />Anyone interested in the music of our time ought to have given this one a listen at least once.
B00003CXDU|3.0|As much a send-up of fan-hood as sci-fi tv, this clever adventure has something to offer everyone. Star Trek fans will see the jokes coming minutes in advance...but that's why we're so cool. The alien race called Thermians present themselves as Pee-Wee's Playhouse rejects, as they grovel and beg for assistance in fending off a deadly enemy. Unaware the mercenaries they have drafted are actually typecast actors who now make a buck as celebrity Mall grand-openers, they take great pride in having secured what they believe are the bravest warriors in the galaxy. The amotivational &quot;rock monster&quot; is a highlight, and is strikingly reminscent of many Star Trek TOS episodes. Very easy to swallow; and Sigourney, as Gwen, as Madison, makes quite the ravishing blonde. Heart-warming finale leaves one wishing for a sequel.
B00004YKUY|5.0|This album is one of the best releases I have heard in the past decade.  It has everything that a melodic rock fan--and almost any Journey fan--could want.  The opening track--&quot;Higher Place&quot;--is the epitome of a great melodic rock song with its catchy chorus and guitar riffs.  I heard that song and knew that Journey is still in fact very much alive.  The rest of the album is amazing as well, with not one bad song in the lot.  Some may criticize the amount of ballads, but it is impossible not to like the songs nonetheless--and for sure there are still plenty of rockers!  From the should-have-been-huge ballad &quot;All The Way&quot; to the moody, jamming &quot;All The Things&quot; to the amazing slow blues song &quot;Livin To Do&quot; to the epic rockers &quot;World Gone Wild&quot; and &quot;To Be Alive Again&quot;, this album is an absolute delight from my favorite band of all time.  Considerably better than the last Perry album &quot;Trial By Fire&quot;, which truly did have too many ballads.<br />Obviously this album doesn't rock as much as &quot;Escape&quot; or &quot;Frontiers&quot;.  However--and I truly mean this--it is almost as good.  It's hard for me to believe how little it has sold thusfar and that I have not heard a note of the album on any radio station.  I would hope that people who had the obvious good taste to listen to this band would be less fickle than the teeny boppers out there who are always only interested in the latest &quot;flavor of the week.&quot;  I'm telling you--give this one a chance; it is truly fantastic!<br />To address the supposed old fans who are now modern day naysayers:  I saw this lineup in concert just a week and a half ago at an outdoor arena in Hartford, CT, and they were INCREDIBLE.  And to the misinformed fool just below my review, the place was PACKED.  The performance was spirited, and Augeri carried off the classics--as well as three songs off this album--spectacularly.  This band is still relevant to me and should be to any TRUE Journey fan.  This latest album, even with the legendary Steve Perry gone, belongs right next to the other classics.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is one of the best novels I have read in a long time.  The reader is taken on a wild ride through a surreal world beneath the cracks of London.  Each character is so different that it's hard to imagine them all part of the same story.  The author ties them all together beautifully, and the storyline flows smooth enough to make the book as easy to read as it is enjoyable.  His brilliant use of sarcasm and wit in creating London Below add a humorous flavor at just the right places without detracting from the plot.  It's a wonderful read.
B0000542DJ|5.0|The feature is engrossing from start to finish, no mean feat for a feature over 3 hours long. Kevin Costner (never better) is ably supported by a stellar cast, including Kevin Bacon, Ed Ansner, Jack Lemmon to name a few. The film interposes stock footage - including the famous Zapruder film - with the directors own vision to piece together a viscereal view of what happened leading up to, and during the asassination of JFK. The trial at the end of the film is Costners greatest moment where he poses hard questions to a disbelieving courtroom, with a passion for the truth, and a tear in his eye:                                                                               &quot;Remember your dying King&quot;<br />A superb anamorphic transfer, with special features over two discs, this DVD is an essential purchase for those interested in one of the darkest days in world history.<br />Thoroughly recommended.
6300214028|1.0|I wrote a favorable review earlier, but that was before I knew (it was recently found in USSR records) that John Reed recieved over 1million from his pals in the bolsheviks/soviet union in the 1910s and 20s.  <br />It's not the movie's fault, because the makers had no way to know, that Reed was not so much an idealist who did too much dreaming for everyone's good, as a flat out paid communist agent serving his masters for cash and probably not asking too many hard questions to keep that cash coming in.<br />  Everybody admires an idealist (even one who is wrong), but nobody likes a toadie, and this revelation makes the movie, no matter how well done, mortally flawed and a waste of time.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I do not know why, but any new Beegees release is a thing of joy for me.  Could it be because of the purity of their melodies, tunes that carry a tinge of sadness and far-away abstractness even when they deliver such clean and wholesome subjects, and even when they are foot-tappers and danceable to?  They take me back repeatedly to familiar and comfortable ground and makes my life worth living from their one album to the next.  <br />&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is no exception even though I must say it does not have a throat-grabber like &quot;Alone&quot; from their &quot;Still Waters&quot; album.  This one's more of a sleeper.  But the gorgeous, shimmering harmonies are still there and I couldn't care two hoots for those who deem it unfashionable to listen to this heavenly trio.  If they don't get it, they don't get it, and they're the one's losing out.  <br />Coming back to the album itself, my favorite track is Deja Vu where Robin neatly bridges the styles of different generations with a performance that would have won appreciation in this or any of the last couple of decades.  There is also greater delegation of lead-singing duties with Maurice dominating on more tracks than is his wont.  The title track with its spare arrangements gives the brothers a new folksy touch and room to develop into a new direction for this millenium. <br />Keep it going, Barry, Robin and Maurice.  You don't know how much you elevate the &quot;Ordinary Lives&quot; of us ordinary mortals!!!!

B00003CY5K|4.0|Reese Witherspoon shines in this flick about a silly blonde going to Harvard Law School.  I really enjoyed the characters, plot, soundtrack and background shots.  Not everyone will love it, but it's a definite win.
B00002E23E|5.0|I like a variety of music,like:jazz,rock,r&amp;b,classical etc.This to me is Led Zeppelin's best live concert so far.The BBC sessions cd dosen't come close.They were to me just progressing more as a concert act in concert,improvising and ab libing and everything.The Song Remains The Same is were it is for this and the BBC cd is just the beginning embryo stage.I like this film a lot and would appreciate it more if the DVD had some extras:like outakes and interviews with the surviving Zeppelin band members and most defenitally more concert footage and remastering.I hope they are reading this so someday they can hop to it,getting it done. Gimmie Shelter,The Wall,Spinal Tap and The Doors are now out as Special Edition DVD's and I hope they can do the same for this fantastic movie.Keep on rockin'!
B00004U30D|5.0|This film had &quot;Dreamworks&quot; written all over it ... IT IS A BEAUTIFUL FILM. It certainly deserved every Academy Award it got, and was one of the most deserving &quot;Best Picture&quot; award-winners of the decade. It is a dark-spirited film, but is yet a mesmerizing drama. Final word? If you can buy it, buy it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|It's hard to believe that when Labyrinth was released in June of '86 it didn't do well. People weren't impressed. Some people say that things get better with age. Maybe this is also true with films.<br />Labyrinth is the ultimate fantasy adventure story. Sarah, the heroine, has to find her way through the magical labyrinth to get her baby brother back from the evil Goblin King. Along the way she makes friends and enemies as she fights temptation and reminds us what is truly important.<br />The release of this DVD was a long-time coming. It was worth the wait. Presented in wide-screen, that means we can see all of the goblins in hidden in the drawers and not just the one speaking, and Dolby Surround. The picture quality is good and the hauting soundtrack has been captured excellently. <br />Also included on the disc is the original cinema trailer and the original production featurette \\"Inside the Labyrinth\\". Probably as valuable, if not more, as the film itself. It's a facinating glimpse into the making of a masterpiece. Including interviews from the cast and crew and, more importantly, the Muppet master himself, Jim Henson.<br />This movie is probably more popular now than it has ever been and for good reason. And for just over ... bucks it's a movie must for anyone who is young or just young at heart.
B000059PQ2|4.0|I own both of these DVDs seperatly, and I would have to say this is a great deal for anyone just getting interested into Dario Argento's work. Although these are by no means his best works (Suspiria or Deep Red) they are both very good movies. And are a must for anyone with a good horror/thriller collection.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Many of us can relate to the warmth of this music. It is like Mom and apple pie and explains the reason the movie and music are currently so very popular. I highly recommend this CD. In it's own way, it will be one of the &quot;classics&quot;.
B000002OOY|5.0|It's wonderful when you hear this theme; such a sweeping majesty, a strong and powerful way to start a great film... Oh! Sorry! Didn't mean to drift off. It's a writer's thing. Anyway... This score is brilliant, to say the least. Tracks Raptor Attack and My Friend, The Brachiosaurus are some of the most origional music I've heard Williams do. If you get this score, you won't be disappointed. If you've just bought it -- hurrah for you! On Film: ***** On CD: ***** Overall: *****
B00005IBGQ|5.0|i have read many mixed reviews of this sophmore (though not sophmoric) effort of the wonderfully talented canuck, rufus wainwright.  i can only say that i can support the favorable ones.  i have been a huge fan of rufus' since i first saw the video single 'april fools'.  it moved me to buy his debut disc and i have been continually moved ever since.  this new album just drives me further in love with him with every listening.  i admit, it was a bit tough to get past the newly added pop elements of the arrangements, but they hold all of the same richness as tracks such as'millbrook'  or 'foolish love'  and the vaudvillian feel of 'matinee idol'.  find it in 'evil angel' and 'rebel prince'; it is all layered in there.  also, despite the pop sugary coating--which i believe will open him to some new fans--some of the bouncy vivacity of his previous works seems mia.  but! the light air is still alive and kicking in 'rebel prince' and the dynamic bightness shines through in (ironically enough) 'shadows'.  such lyrics as found in 'greek song' prove that lust doesn't have to sound dirty:  &quot;you turn me on you turn me your body heals my soul&quot;.  mmm... the point of all this is that any TRUE music fan can't help but respect this man.  and even the casual listener should be able to appreciate it.   oh, i could ramble on and on about lovely lovely rufus, but i will leave it with my word of protection:  if anyone has a bad word to say about his sweet voice, take it up with me!  it is the sound of human beauty!
B00004T0P1|5.0|James Newton Howard is getting better and better, that's all I can say. This soundtrack is WONDERFUL, as everyone who's heard it will agree. The highlights are 2,4,5,16, and most definetly -7-! I recently heard his score for Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and it's fantastic!  One of his scores for next year will be Disney's Treasure Planet, aand I eagerly look forward to that.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost In The Shell offers a blend of suspence, thrill and above all non stop intregue of the unknown. The animation is superb, the storyline is quick and the plot is well weaved. I strongly reccomend it to new anime fans who are starting this magnificent journey.
0684800713|4.0|TSAR brilliantly capture's the feelings of disillusionment and detachment that the so called &quot;lost generation&quot; felt.  The book is a little slow to start but the last two third's which take place in spain are wonderfully written.<br />The main protagonist Jacob Barnes, left with a wound received in combat, is impotent and deeply in love with brett an english woman engaged to another man. The irony of Jacob being passionate about the bull fights, the very epitome of masculinity, and him being impotent does not go undetected. The entire book is for me about people wanting thing's they know they cannot have, and yet wanting them more for it. Robert Cohn the Jewish outsider desperately wanting acceptance, Jacob wanting passion, Mike escape through alcohol and all of the above wanting Brett.<br />In fact Brett is the fire to which they are all drawn and ultimetly burn themselves against
B00004TH83|5.0|This cd is just great! it will have yr emotions running free from the first track to the last... Lara Fabian's english debut was supervised by such producers as  Walter Afanasieff, Pat Leonard and Brian Rawling...she has been able to come out with a product which is heavely AC Top 40-oriented but nevertheless quite multi-layered. You have it all here, from &quot;Adagio&quot; (which is presented both in its English and Italian version as a tribute to her Italian roots - thanks Lara, you make me so proud of being Italian!) - a Queen-styled epic built on the Tommaso Albinoni melody, to the bouncy &quot;I am who I am&quot; and &quot;I will love again&quot;, not forgetting such masterpieces as &quot;Love by grace&quot; and &quot;You're not from here&quot;, where the beautiful lyrics add up to a great passion from Lara's voice. And if this ain't enough...take a listen to the equally splendid &quot;To love again&quot; or &quot;Broken vow&quot;, and you will have the proof this woman ranks up right there with the great Barbra and  Celine, where the voice is not used for merely singing but it is used for performing the song out... I never gave a 5 star-rating before, but i am sure her sophomore album will be even better (just for hard-core fans...accordingly to the official Diane Warren site, Lara recorded a couple of her songs titled &quot;Love found me&quot; and &quot;Undivided&quot;, which for some reason did not make it on this collection...if my feelings are right, some major surprises are waiting up ahead...). Ottimo lavoro Lara, brava!!!!
B00005LB50|5.0|I love the vaults. I've been waiting more than 30 years for this particular Box. The demos give a glimpse into what could have been. Even more amazing when you realize they only existed for 25 months or so. Sure, I wish they'd included &quot;Hour of Not Quite Rain&quot; anyway. I wish they'd included Jim Messina's &quot;Carefree County Day.&quot; (Young does dis Messina for his mixing job on Last Time Around.) The completeist in me would like to have everything in  one place. Plus the extended version of &quot;Bluebird.&quot; But I'll settle for this. The new versions of  &quot;On the Way Home,&quot; &quot;Pretty Girl Why,&quot; and even the mix here of &quot;Down to the Wire,&quot; are all great. Even the silly &quot;Kahuna Sunset&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Stomp&quot; instrumentals made me smile. These guys had a lot of fun before the ego wars really got going. You can hear it on the early stuff. And best of all it's nice to see how many side men and bit players were on the tracks all along. That was a real revelation. Crosby on &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot; and all of these unknown folks like Bobby West, Gary Marker, alongside jazz names like Carol Kaye and Richard Davis. <br />At long last. Now if only somebody could find some live tapes someplace, or stumble over all of the missing TV footage. C'mon it must be out there someplace. They were on TV a lot.<br />My faith is restored. Yep, they should have been rich. A real shock to discover their managment ripped them off, and they never made any $ to speak of. That's the biz. But what they created is here to stay.<br />Thanks Neil, thanks guys, for making this happen.
B00004STW3|1.0|This movie was a horrible display of everything. and I KNOW that the special effects and the plot were supposed to be campy but THE MOVIE SUCKED!!!! it was a pathetic excuse for a movie. I subjected myself to this torture not once, but twice and i still didn't find it funny!
0553208845|5.0|I've read this book in the course of one week, and I really enjoyed it, every page, every message, every experience carrying a profound message .... it's easy to see some similarities with our own life, places change, faces change, bodies change, but existence it's all the same. I would also recommend these titles:<br />1)&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda&quot;<br />2)&quot;Wisdom for the new Millenium by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar&quot;<br />3)&quot;Communion with god by Neale Donald Walsch&quot;.
B000002KAT|5.0|The first couple times i listened to this album, i felt like the reviewer who couldn't find any intersting music aside from &quot;The Way Young Lovers Do.&quot; Though music may take a back seat on this record, it's beautiful nonetheless. Some of the songs go on kind of long, but that's what makes them so special. A mood is set from the beginning, and it's drawn out by Van's passionate vocals and personal improvising. You've got to clear your mind on this one. If you start thinking about the lengths of the songs, you're in trouble, because this album is about a place and a feeling, not a beat or a phrasing. The lyrics are sort of three dimensional, in that they create an image for the entire album that blends with the music, to conjure up something magical. &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; the song, is probably my favorite track, along with &quot;Beside You,&quot; &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Madame George.&quot; It's at times difficult for me to listen to Van, because you have to be patient and listen repeatedly for his music to sink in. But when you give his albums time, they're worth it . And this one is definitely his best. Maybe even the best album ever, but everyone has their own opinion. Get it only if you're going to really listen.
B000002H33|5.0|As someone who recently discovered Metallica's pre-Black Album material, Master of Puppets and And Justice For All are truly awesome, with the slight edge going to Master. While Metallica's newer material can be either great or so-so, Master of Puppets is unrelenting all the way through...hard and fast-paced, yet complex, musical, and lyrical as well...not one track takes a proverbial \\"day off\\". Though Metallica still rocks with the best of 'em, I doubt if they'll ever surpass the heights reached on Master of Puppets...it's just too good.
B0000399WI|5.0|This review could in no way do Frank Darabont's classic any justice.  It is, quite simply, the greatest movie of all time.  At the end of two and a half hours, you sit infront of the TV with the greatest feeling in the world.  Nothing is wrong with this movie!  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the preformance of their lives, and the rest of the cast is amazing.  If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste the money on renting it...BUY IT!!!
0783225881|4.0|I think it is.<br />When a movie come showing us the simple and in the same time fascinating side of the life, living in harmony with the nature, playing sports with family and friends, without all that complicated and grotesque felling of trying to be so profounde and in the same time scarying people so many movies did. The only thing I'm sure this is a innocent movie. People are humans, they work, they smile and they cry, and they could be happy in the most coomns moments of their life, that's all this movie is about. In the metter fact, the story is so simple, it make you think what's this movie is trying to tell you, and doing only this, you already knew this movie isn't  here for money, it's here to be a truly masterpiece without trying to be for itself. Thinking of this, the answer about &quot;is this heaven?&quot; is, yes, it is. Heaven pure and clear.<br />Looking into the movie in the other side, you find a wonderful soundtrack that help you fell more grateful with the movie in the most touching moments, like in the end, in particullar. Good actors and a beautiful landscape that make you wish you were there, in the middle of all that magic.<br />The movie have great morals that goes along with the story, and right after seeing it, when the credits come, you only fell how simple was this movie and how honest and brilliant it was too.
0312117337|5.0|This deck is a beautiful, very complex tarot... it is wonderful for in-depth use and a look at internal self. For everyday use, it is too complicated.

B000055WIQ|1.0|THE EXORCIST, the saddest and most disgustingly bad movie of all time, is the classic story of a young girl, Regan, whom through a Squeegy Board, becomes posessed by Satan.  The film is supposedly based on a True Story about a young boy, whom in 1949, became posessed.  That is unconfirmed.<br />MY REVIEW:<br />&quot;I hate this movie with a passion because it is so evil, and only a devil worshiper would love this movie and want to watch again and again. It is the ultimate evil you can find in this world.  The scary thing about it is, is that this movie is based on a true story.  NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG: This movie is VERY scary, but is just a gross out devil movie.  No one in this whole world should see something so terrible.  IT IS BAD- plain and simple, and I mean BAD as in it isn't a good movie for anyone to see.  So all of you people who say this is a great movie, you just make evil seem so good.&quot;- MJV &amp; the Movies.
0767821769|5.0|This Movie can be seen over and over again. You will laugh,cry  you would just want to be there. It is an all time favorite. Everyone whom I have talked with, that saw the movie give raves about the movie.  I recommend that every step-mom to be see this film it will give you an enlightened on what you may be getting yourself into. Julia Roberts is my favorite actor of all times. She had so much patience in this movie and she always just go with the flow she was wonderful!!!!
B000059QY3|5.0|I have been a fan of Gheorghiu since I heard her Verdi heroines. She is probably one of the best Verdians nowadays, singing with great drama and control as well as a beautifully seductive voice. In other words, technique and beauty (both physically and vocally) all in one. It is heaven to simply watch her beautiful face and eyes while listening to her flawless, espressive singing. Therefore this DVD is a must for all her fans and opera fans. The covent garden set is beautifully staged and singers acted very well for a live performance. Recording is superb considering it is a live recording with minimal coughs and other stage/audience noise (Actually one of the best, well balanced live recordings I've heard). Beautifully conducted by Solti, especially the prelude to Act III. The other casts are all excellent. Some may want a more lyrical tenor than Lopardo but he sang with great drama and expression. Nucci is warm and sympathetic. Gypsy dance was entertaining. Make-up is great in that Gheorghiu really looked anaemic in Act III. This is as great as live opera can get, especially when it is so well caught on film.
B000002J27|5.0|I,m sorry but phill collins's voice is just better. this album also has probally the best written songs period.It is also not like later albums like invisable touch which are just too poppy. This is genesis at it's best.
B00003CY5K|5.0|This is a great film.  It is so funny that you are laughing through almost the whole movie.  It is about a pretty, popular, rich girl who tries to win her boyfriend back by getting into Harvard law school.  No one thinks she can make it as a lawyer. This is about her experience.

B00005LQ04|5.0|DUE TO A SYSTEM ERROR THIS IS A CORRECTED REVIEW!! I had obtained a UNCUT bootleg copy of this movie some time a go(dont ask!!)and it was even better than when i first saw it. People today just dont get it. These days attion spans are short, which means low IQ levels!! What im getting at is this movie holds up better than the mindless and boring (bloodless)horror of today. Even though the effects are dated a little bit, they can still make your girlfriend squrim!! Unlike the really fake cgi stuff out there now. Yes the story is a little silly (and i mean a little !!!) and the acting so-so. But its a horror movie!! From overseas!! So just sit back, relax and enjoy a shining star of this genre. Now its finally comming to DVD. I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!

B000001E21|5.0|If there is an album by Leppard that could be classified as HEAVY, here it is. One listen to this CD, and you can't help butwonder why these guys kept gems like &quot;Desert Song&quot;, &quot;Fractured Love&quot;, &quot;From the inside&quot;, &quot;Ring of fire&quot;, &quot;I wanna be your hero&quot; in the cellar for so long. Desert Song takes the cake for being the most enigmatic and haunting Leppard songs ever; a dry parched ride into the desert, until Steve Clark unleashes the flood with his lead solo. This one song alone bears the strength of what the band was capable of, and how underachieving they are in terms of creativity (albeit some excellent tracks in SLANG). The songs &quot;Fractured Love&quot; and &quot;From the inside&quot; delve into the never before seen darker side, yet so genius side of the band. It really becomes clear now how much this band misses Clark and Allen's left arm once you are through with this album. I need not mention regarding &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot;, &quot;Miss you..&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;...they are vintage Lep stuff and good listen, but never the type of songs that would intrigue the listener.
B00001OH7U|5.0|this is an essential for anyone not just fans of bowie. It demonstrates bowie as an artist and not just a money hungry entertainer.
B00005LB9O|5.0|When `The Man who' was released two years ago I was hooked and Travis became one of my favourite bands so I eagerly waiting the follow up. I must say that now after buying the album and listening to the tracks many times I am not disappointed. The album starts off with `Sing' that is definitely a sing along song as is `Flowers in the window' with the latter's melody sounding similar to the Beatles . The dark and moody `Last train' is a fantastic track, and `Indefinitly' clicked after I listened to it three or four times. `Side' is more reminiscent of `The Man Who', and could easily end up being a single. Also you just can't stop listening to the charming guitar driven `Pipe dreams'. The only thing lacking here may the assurance of a `writing to reach you', or `driftwood'. But this album is just as solid as the last one and Fran Healy delicately and impressively puts his point across. Travis cannot be ignored and are an integral part of music because their songs are memorable and their music doesn't take long in appealing to people.

0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley shifts the focus of the greatest British legend, the tale of King Arthur, from the Christian male perspective, to that of the powerful, old religion led by women and centered in the Holy Isle of Avalon.<br />Morgan le Fay, or Morgaine, is a warm, enchanting and above all real, woman.  She struggles with her dual role as wise-woman, powerful priestess and sister, mother, lover and wife in a growing Christian society.  Having nothing against the Christ, only &quot;his priests&quot; who trample on the traditions and beliefs of the Old Religion, Morgaine battles to find her place in the center of the worlds at war.<br />Morgaine's brother, King Arthur, has struggles of his own, but it is through the eyes of the women in his life that the true undercurrent of power can be felt.  Gwenhwyfar, his sorrowfully barren wife, plays her own role in the fate of Britain.  As do Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, Igraine, mother to both Morgaine and Arthur, and the wicked Morgause, sister to Viviane and Igraine and perhaps the most intrinsically evil character in the story.<br />This story takes place in a time long gone, but definitely not forgotten.  Through Morgaine, Viviane, and the other women of the Mists of Avalon, the Legend of Arthur and Camelot is now open to the hearts and souls of powerful, hopeful women for all eternity.
B000002U8A|4.0|I might go so far as to say the synthesizer might need to be turned down a bit, or there are to many horns, but these small complaints are overshadowed by the excellent songwriting!  &quot;The Reflex&quot; is perfect for the exact reason that the critics hated it--the words make absolutely no sense and yet you will be singing them by the second verse whether or not you've ever heard the song.  &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, although even the band has said they are a bit shaky on their feelings about that one in hindsight, is hands down the most elated and uplifting song I've ever heard!  The echoing guitar arpeggios in the background of prechorus could be a song in themselves.  And the &quot;Seventh Stranger&quot; seems to exude genuine heartbreak.  There are a few songs of note in between these songs, all of which are undeniably catchy as well (but then again so is strep throat).  But the bottom line is that the album is worth buying even if only for the three songs I've mentioned.
B00003CY5K|5.0|This movie shows that you can achieve anything, once you set your mind to it.  It's smart, witty, intellectual, and stupid all in one great combination of a movie.  This is one that everyone should see.
0440234743|4.0|Thank you John Grisham for giving me such pleasure in reading this book!  I think it is one of you best.  I am a christian and it was so refreshing to see Jesus and Christianity displayed somewhat realistically.  Your writing skills keep me wanting to turn the page.  Being from Memphis, I relate to all of your books on some level. I would love to see &quot;The Testament&quot; as a movie.
006092988X|5.0|A deeply moving and all around great book. Smith captivates the spirit of a young girl in full. One of the best pound for pound books of our time. Being 13 years old and just getting into classical reading I would say this book is very easy to understand and read. It compares easily with To Kill A Mockingbird and Diary of Anne Frank.
630469654X|4.0|A knight played by Rutger Hauer and his lady played by Michelle Pfeiffer both run afoul of evil-bishop played by John Wood. Through the auspices of bishop's confessor played by Leo McKern, our main stars are placed under a curse.

0425180638|3.0|...until you take it too far. There's a certain attraction to having a main character who has flaws he or she is combatting at least half as hard as the &quot;bad guys&quot;. After all, it's juvenile to expect heroes who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, isn't it? The problem is when you go past the DMZ of mediocrity and wind up with someone who's too dysfunctional to save the day. Kay Scarpetta in this book is hardly the Meryl Streep-esque intrepid lady forensic scientist I've come to admire over the years. She's torn between a paranoia caused by recent events of the last couple of books and the individualistic cussedness that made me a reader of Cornwell books in the first place. The problem is that this stand-alone compulsion now works against her by making her reluctant to reach out to some pretty obvious sources of support. Like the niece who she more than half raised and now wants to help the aunt who was more a mother to her than her real mom. Like her shrink friend who is Scarpetta's own de-facto aunt, but can't get past the barriers. Like her detective friend who's mostly succeeeded in keeping his unrequited crush on her from screwing up the friendship too badly. A word of warning--Cornwell is exaggerating Marino's rather abrasive Sipowicz-clone personality in this book to the extent that if you didn't know him from previous books, you'd write him off as a real a**hole. But as for Scarpetta in this book, it's hard to root for a &quot;good guy&quot; who has an Olive Oyl need to to be rescued from Bluto. After all, who gets to be Popeye? I think the whole anti-hero thing has run its course and needs to be outgrown, by authors and readers alike. Tina Turner once sang &quot;We don't need another hero&quot;. But I think we need this particular hero back.
0792839730|5.0|This star-studded film is a must see film for those interested in World War II. This is one of the '70s big budget war films, which covers Operation market garden. Field-Marshall Montgomery's plan that took place September 1944. The Allies attempt to break out of the deadlock in France, and thereby dramatically shorten the winning of the Second World War. Operation Market-Garden was the largest daylight airborne raid of all time. They tried to capture several bridges in the Netherlands and by capturing and holding them, provide the Allies with a direct road into the German heartland. Of course this film shows how the term \\"Military Intelligence\\" is an Oxymoron. Recon showed that there was armor in the area and the strength of German forces in the area was in actuality much larger than expected. The British General's with their own agenda's (beating Patton to Berlin) ignored all warnings. It stars Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, and Anthony Hopkins.
B00000DGXN|3.0|Although the music on this CD is of a very high standard,the mix is awful. Corea's piano sounds terrible .It has a very unpleasant timbre to it, and Metheny's level is way below the rest of the band, with the piano being way too loud during the guitar solos. Maybe that's the way they wanted it, because the piano comping sounds more interesting than the meandearing guitar solos. In fact Metheny sounds like he's out of his depth in the company of Corea Burton and Haynes. The whole project would have worked much better as a quartet without the guitar - and I say that as a big Metheny fan. If you wanna hear Metheny really play, listen to his recent trio work! On the up side, Burton and Corea weave their usual magic together and the rhythm section is stellar. The new tunes don't add up to much though, so this CD isn't one for playing all the way through without skipping tracks. As a fan of all the musicians on this CD individually, I found the whole thing a bit of a let down. It was an interesting idea though...........
B0000524E5|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. The main story line is about a small town girl named Violet, who wants to be a songwriter. She moves to New York for her dream to become a songwriter, she gets robbed and becomes desperate and gets job in a bar \\"Coyote Ugly\\" because she wants to make it on her own. Has sexy girls dancing on the bar and songs that make you want to buy the sound track. This movie is a hidden chick flick for guys. Everyone should enjoy this movie. I highly recommend it!
0553284347|4.0|Although I don't come from alcoholic parents and they don't leave close to me, this book helped me to understand the different types of manipulations that they use consciously or unconsciously to control their children.  It helped me to identify some of those and to be able to take a vacation from them without hurting their feelings.  Also, since I read this book I can deal with them at a different level and far more effectively.
031286504X|3.0|Quite slow, with pretty much just one man left, all the book talks about is him.  There is only so much to TELL.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book several years ago when I bought my first ice cream maker. It is fantastic. The fun part was creating ice cream that was available at the grocery store! Our family favorites are Cherry Garcia and Oreo!
0671027573|1.0|This was my first mystery by Linda Howard and I was very disappointed.  While the heroine's were cute and the plot had some entertaining twists and turns, the relationship between the hero and heroine was unrealistic. In one chapter, they are seething at each other and the next they are involved in a steamy love story. The infinite details of their sexual encounters were not woven into the story but obviously dropped in to &quot;jazz&quot; up an otherwise simple story line.  It's a shame - while I enjoy romantic/sexual subplots in a mystery, a writer needs to integrate these elements and Ms. Howard failed to do accomplish that task.  Secondly, the mystery was easily solved as there were few potential vilans. Thirdly, the text was primarily dialogue with few indepth descriptions and little anaysis of the criminal's mind. And lastly, the motive was a bit contrived. It was a fast/easy read but scarcely what I would consider a good mystery.
0312263120|2.0|I must admit I was rather pleased with the general writing style of the author, I imagine he's normally quite good at both telling the story itself, and building characters one cares about.<br />This book was however, a major disapointment.  It's not only the most technically flawed book of it's kind I've ever read, but it's failed in every turn it possibly could.  The technical flaws are not limited simply to the mathematical nature of cryptography, but the characters he discribes are not at all believable.<br />If you think you'd like this book based on the introduction to the storyline I would rather suggest you pick up a copy of Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.
B000002KDO|5.0|Well lucky me, I came across this among other Black Sabbath albums in a used books store, and purchased Master Of Reality for approximately 7 to 8 bucks.  I don't regret spending one penny of it.  Tony Iommi masters the guitar, even with the handicap of two missing fingertips and having to use homemade replacement ones.  The songs such as Sweet Leaf, After Forever, Children of the Grave, Lord of This World, and Into the Void all show Black Sabbath's capability of exceptional, solid, deep heavy metal and rock n' roll.  However if you listen to the lyrics, you'll note that Sabbath had no problem going into subjects of Christianity in songs like After Forever, and actual good messages or stories in other songs.  Not only that, but Sabbath doesn't seem to be so determined to focus on the whole satanic stereotype that other metal follows.  As I said, Iommi masters the guitar, even beyond any simple riffs you might find in a metal song.  Orchid is by far one of the most beautiful pieces I've heard on guitar.  To this day it still gives me chills.  Songs like this and Embryo also show that just because you may be in a metal band shouldn't at all set some sort of unwritten rule saying you can't do anything but hard n' heavy.  I think being in a metal band is more than just doing the deep hard hitting kind of music (though we thrashers can't get enough of it when it's good!).  I think it's got a lot to do with doing whatever you want, and letting the fans make their own opinion.  But anyway, to get back to the review, I recommend Master of Reality to ANYONE that loves music of the guitar and rock music, because there's something to the taste of all of those people on this album, from Into the Void to Orchid.  This is without a shadow of a doubt, a truly first rate set of songs.
0684853523|5.0|Being a writer, I was anxious to see whether Stephen King could come up with any worthwhile gems that the other stock-in-trade how-to books had missed... he didn't disappoint. If you take the time to read between the lines of &quot;On Writing&quot; you'll find a whole load more than anyone else can possibly offer. It's not a &quot;do this, do that&quot; book, it's an insightful book of how the master gets it together.<br />Included in the book are many insights into King's own life. Not only are these a bonus, they add to the whole picture of Stephen King's ability to turn out bestselling novels time after time.<br />Buy it today - you'll not be disappointed.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Doesn't get any better than this, 2pac speaks his mind like no other...
B00000IPAX|1.0|I was a huge fan of blink until they became sellouts.  I loved flyswatter, Budda, Cheshire Cat, and Dude Ranch.  But then they came out with this CD.  I was so mad because they had become pop sellouts.  Songs like All The Small Things and &quot;What's My Age Again&quot; make me sick.  I'm sick of hearing people say they are blink fans when they haven't heard their old stuff like Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch.  They think their fans just because they have EOTS.  Your kidding yourself if you think they aren't pop.  Listen to this CD after listening to Dude Ranch and you will realise their sellouts.  This CD is terrible.
630522577X|5.0|G.B. Shaw's Pgymalion was the inspiration for this magnificient adaptation. Lerner's words were poetic and lyrical and in Henry Higgins case, very satirical. Loew's music was just right, never overshadowing the verse. Subtle might be a good word. Mr. Harrison and Miss Hepburn bring livliness and fun to their characters and Stanley Holloway's turn as Eliza's father purely brilliant. I also liked Gladys Cooper as Henry's mother. If I have one favorite part it has to be the Ascot races where Eliza's exurberance gets the best of her but at the end she is more than a match for Professor Higgins and watching her transformation is great fun. All in all, a great film. Too bad, musicals have been little made in recent years and we are subjected to too much sex,blood and gore. Whenever I want to return to a time when Hollywood honored wit and charm, I put on My Fair Lady.
B00005AAFS|5.0|All I have to say is that this CD is amazing!!  I seriously thought Sehnsucht was going to be their best album and that it would all go down hill from there.  When Mutter came out I admit I doubted it until I heard it and I was blown away. If you like any Rammstein, you must not be without this CD.
6305499365|5.0|This movie is the funniest I've seen in a while.  Anyone whos worked in an office environment can relate.  Witty dialougue, hilarious characters, Mike Judge has created a timeless Comedy Masterpiece.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's quite difficult to pin-point Radiohead's abilities and actually describe the band in the words.  They are the best band in the world, and that's that.  Their latest album Amnesiac once again vouches that the band is not afraid to make music that's different, but also spectacular at the same time.<br />Packt like Sardines, the opener, is an implied declaration that the band is maturing.  Pyramid Song shows Yorke and company's mastery of musical atmosphere.  You and Whose Army has a hell of a climax and IMBW has great guitar-bass interaction.  Spinning Plates and Life in a Glasshouse show Radiohead's eclectic styles , as both songs venure off in two completely different lands but still succeed in mesmerzing the listner.  I've saved the best for last - the coolest song ever - &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;, track 8, has a cool bass line, fantastic drums, and genius mixing.  The climax of the song, where Yorke wails &quot;Why don't you quiet down&quot; is mixed and layered with another voice shouting &quot;I just wanna live in the promised land, I just wanna be free,&quot; shows the band's ability to manipulate machines.<br />There are two real reasons people don't like this and I'd just like to defend the album.  For one thing, people are comparing these albums to previous Radiohead albums and demanding another &quot;Bends&quot; or &quot;Ok Computer.&quot;  That's childish and naive to think a good band should do something that's already been done.  Having a carbon copy of OKC or The Bends would just turn out to be a very boring album that only the critics at Rolling Stone would like.  Secondly, people say Radiohead is too weird and submersed in electronica/techno.  It's basically ignorant to criticize music that is based on a different formula that people are used to.  People are scared to compare Radiohead with Miles Davis and Led Zeppelin and the Beatles, but the matter of the fact is that good music of any kind is capable of being compared to good music of other genres.<br />bye now, appreciate radiohead and appreciate life

006109594X|4.0|I read through a few of these reviews, most notably the bad ones. I thought this was a great book, and I have reread it, and read many of his other books. But one thing in all the reviews kept bugging me... People say there are technical errors. Would you have preferred if it was an English force throughout the whole book? If so, then the Ranks would be perfect, as Admiral Woodward is English. But he chose to make his book realistic. The book is written fantastically, and any technical errors made are simply because his advisor was not part of your system. The book is well written. Screw technical errors. If you read Tom Clancy, it is set in the future often, and some ranks do not even exist! Simply take it as what it is... a mystery (not military fiction) designed for normal people. The technical jargon is there to make people sound realistic to us normal people. I do not profess to know anything about the navy, military ranks, or anything else like that, except for what I learnt in this book, and what this book prompted me to find out. It is a great book. <br />So let it be, and let people read the mystery, the intrigue... not the obscure clerical errors made by a publisher.
0060392886|5.0|This is the best book for true crue fans. I have been following the career of Motley Crue since the early 80's. I have seen them in the early days in Orange County, the Whiskey, all the clubs in LA. They are one of the true LA hard rocking bands. This is an excellent book that explains their lives, not just as the hard drinking, drug taking party boys; but it also explains their problems in life just like everyone else. If you enjoy the LA club scene from the 80's and Motley Crue, this is the book to get. No holds barred, no secrets kept! They talk about everyone from their ex-wives to the famous in Hollywood. I am glad I bought it! I couldn't put it down!
B000000OF6|5.0|I was raised like it was the 80's, and of course my favorite song on this recording is &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; lol. The Waynes World point of view wasn't very far off. I've heard most of the songs on the discs, but not some others I haven't even heard of. I love the vocals, guitars, and just the sound is fantastic. I seriously recommend this for any fan. :)
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the best album of the year and a truely great addition to hard rock. Although, slow at times, great songs like The Grudge, Schism, and one of my all time favorite songs Parabola really make this an excellent record. I would advise any fan of hard rock to purchase this album.
B000059RL3|5.0|I must say that this is one of my all time favourite albums. I have to say that the best rack is by far the detriot mix of &quot;What's Going On&quot;. At first I thought their was an  error in my speakers (marvin appears to only come from the left), but when the familiar harmony (Father, Father) came in on the right, I was completely blown away. Don't just take my word for it. Buy this album NOW and listen to perhaps the greatest album by one of the 20th Century's most gifted talents.
B00002SSRZ|1.0|This cd contains some of Santanas Best stuff.  The transisition to DVD was not good.  The music sounds &quot;tinny&quot; and I was disipointed.  This disc should have been left in its original analog format, it sounds better in two channel.  Dont waste youre money on the DTS version.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Hannibal is well made and thanks to Anthony Hopkins again playing Hannibal Lecter I get what I want. I understand that this might be a movie that many find disgusting or bad and that's fine. But trying to say that this was the sequel to the original &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is wrong, both as a movie and as a book. <br />The first book and film was &quot;Red Dragon&quot; filmed under the name &quot;Manhunter&quot; with Brian Cox (Braveheart) as Hannibal Lecter (retitled Lecktor in this film) and it is actually a pretty good adaptation of that first book. As with the second one, everybody knows that Anthony Hopkins made for one of the most memorable and dangerous serial killers in motion picture history so I don't blame that most people think of this as the real original. But what happened with the adaptation of &quot;S.O.T.L&quot; was that it actually became better then the book. More linear and fast paced. Now, &quot;Hannibal&quot; became much more violent and offensive as a book then compared to &quot;S.O.T.L&quot; but this is toned down in the movie. (If you don't belive me, read the book.) And &quot;S.O.T.L&quot; became more violent as a film. (Once again, if you don't believe me, read that book.)<br />So, is &quot;Hannibal&quot; a good film, yes, I would say so. But it isn't a good enough adaptation. It takes away some of the characters which could have made for a more important movie and it also takes away Hannibals background and the original ending. The only thing that I didn't like with the film was Julianne More as Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster is still much better). &quot;Hannibal&quot; lives on thanks to Anthony Hopkins once again being able to play the title role. The book is better.
B000056IKU|5.0|Not as tuneful as NEU! 75 or as revered as NEU! #1, it is the most interesting in terms of remixing.  By simply slowing down and speeding up different tracks they create totally different feelings and totally different songs.  Super 16 and Super are polar opposites, 16 is slow and druggy and sounds like the monster under your bed, plain super is intense and punkish.  The modern concept of the remix starts here (plus the rest of the songs are beyond excellent, as it goes without saying for NEU!).  While the other two are most listenable, this is the NEU! you CANNOT live without a minute longer.
B00003CXRP|4.0|A fresh, unconventional story - that we aren't exposed to in most movies.  The sweep of where our life lies amongst the world's totality is both the &quot;human condition&quot; and the most gut-wrenching personal experience of our own... something one can meditate upon for days after viewing this film (as I did all this evening and morning) - Enjoy and Grow.
B000056IKS|4.0|Groovy!  Not really what I expected, and some of the songs aren't songs as much as they are sounding paintings, but still great to listen to in the dark.  Although it's the weakest of the bunch (too many of the &quot;songs&quot; seemed tossed off) it still sounds newer than most new music.  And the dropout on the second song is supposed to be there!
B00004U8P3|5.0|Why is it that according to critics, movies and music for that matter always has to be arty and have a lot of depth? Sure, Jurassic Park might have a weak story, but who cares really? It's interesting nonetheless, and damn if it isn't exciting and amazing. I still remember the first time I watched Jurassic Park. It was in the theatre, and my goodness, I was totally blown away. The special effects in this movie are amazing, even today, and the scenes with the T-Rex and Raptors are absolutely thrilling, especially the raptor scenes. I love the scene where the two raptors are in the kitchen with the two kids. Definately my favorite scene in the movie. I can appreciate a good, critically acclaimed movie when I want to, but sometimes you just need to sit back and let yourself be thrilled, and endulge yourself in great special effects without having to worry about the symbolic meaning of this, or the meaning of that. Critics need to learn to enjoy movies like this for what they are, thrillers. You pay your 6 or 7 dollars, and for roughly two (in this case 3) hours you're brought on an exciting roller coaster ride of a movie. And really, the Jurassic Park series so far is one of the best in that category.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|The production values here are tighter and cleaner than the unnecessary excesses that at times overwhelmed the content of his first release. The songwriting is also more pointed, crisp and varied in approach. The lyrics are still rife with that damnable ambiguity, but who cares when he can deliver &quot;GREY GARDENS;&quot; pleasantly reminiscent of, but far more sophisticated than, the Left Banke's &quot;PRETTY BALLERINA.&quot;<br />The polytonality of &quot;SHADOWS&quot; is rich with unusual harmonies atop a shuffling syncopation as Rufus sings, &quot;out of these shadows comes the light.&quot; This stuff goes way beyond the boundaries of today's Pop Fluff.<br />I understand that &quot;EVIL ANGEL&quot; was meant to be some sort of tribute to Led Zepplin, which is understandable, if this is true. While this track slowly builds in intensity one can almost discern the bombastic drums and nearly-percussive strings attacking the Zep's epic &quot;KASHMIR&quot; from &quot;PHYSICAL GRAFFITTI&quot;.<br />His track &quot;CALIFORNIA&quot; is peppy and clever, with tongue very firmly in cheek (you cheeky devil!) All in all a very melodic and enjoyable disc that stands up well to repeat listenings. You don't find that many releases you can say that about these days...
B00005BCNC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. At the beginning of the movie you're shown the type of person Tom Hanks character is. And then when he's stranded on the desert island the two people just seem totally opposite, and that's a pretty cool effect. He is a workaholic typer person living a very fast paced life one minute, and then the next he's stranded with nothing trying to survive. The performance by Tom Hanks is very very good as well. It's just him obviously, but it never gets boring. Through much of the island scenes there isn't much talking, but watching his gradual progress on the island is just captivating. Throughout his time on the island you can gradually see his sanity beginning to crack, but always he manages to hold on with his picture of the woman he loves. The caracter Wilson, appropriately named, is pretty silly in a way, but you really find watching the movie that you begin to see &quot;him&quot; as a real character and not an inanimate vollyball. The scene where Tom Hanks character loses Wilson is very good. When you look at the fact that he kicks up such a fuss over losing a vollyball it's hard to feel anything, but it's the idea that he loses his only companion, his friend for all his time on the island that is the idea there. Anyways, then he is rescued and is returned to his home. The scene with him lying on the floor in his hotel room turning the light on and off looking at the picture is absolutely beautiful. It really shows the effect that the island had on him. He's home, but yet he's still the person he was on the island. The highlight of the film however is the meeting with him and the woman he loves. The tension, confusion, anticipation, etc, is all there, and it really pulls the viewer on emotionally as well. The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a crossroads, and he smiles. There is still hope even though his life was stripped away. <br />All in all, this movie is beautiful, and very very good. It takes the viewer through so many emotions,that it's hard not to lose yourself in the film. Oh, and the scene where the plane goes down is totally intense, I almost forgot about that. Anyways, check this movie out, you definately won't be dissapointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is so great, words can not describe it! If you love hard rock with a bit of alternitive, tons of music, and meaningful lyrics, this is one great CD for you. I remember how I used to be a pop junkie, trying to get my hands on any and every BSB cd out there. I was watching MTV and One Step Closer came on. I couldn't believe it. I was hooked after that. After I got Hybrid Theory, it was like a revalation. I couldn't believe it, this was real music. Raw talent. No Nsync memeber could do that. It was unbelievable. I never put it on stop. I listned to it every chance I could get. A few of my favorite tracks are Papercut, In The End, Crawling, Points of Authority, and Runaway. I loved everything though. Nothing could ever compare to this CD. If anything was better than this, I would die in shock. Pop music doesn't even come close. Never have I seen such talent, such passion, and such MUSIC! Sorry, BSB, but you don't stand a chance.
0553106635|4.0|Interesting reviews by the readers!  ....  I can see both points of view, if you like clean, traditional fantasy this is not for you.  And, I can see some folks seeing it as dragging on forever without much resolution.  Certainly if you read fantasy for the cool spells and huge magics, this isn't for you.<br />If, however, you enjoy characters who will surprise you and a wildly complicated plot, then this is your series.  Particularly noteworthy in the third book is the development of characters who have been on the perifery to this point.  Especially Jaime Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, and Sandor Clegane each of whom plays a much larger role than in previous volumes.<br />While I would agree that portions of A Storm of Swords dragged on a bit too much, the overall pace was great and the surprises kept on coming.  ....
B00004SCS1|4.0|System of a down one the few promising bands that have broken through the general populaces layer of non-knowledge and survived to bring out a follow-up album. Personality woven into the style of neo-metal gives them their own sound. The vocals are amazing; I had no idea Armenians could sing so well and with so much original style. If you like original tone, song structure, tempo changes (something most new bands have not even experimented with as a musical hook), and lyrics with a sense of humor and purpose, then buy System of a Down. Look out for their new single; it's already on the radio. Hang on to bands like System, because creativity is a scarce attribute in today's music.
B00003CX7L|5.0|In this sequel to Toy Story, Woody (Tom Hanks) begins to fear that his usefulness as a toy is coming to end. When Woody is stolen, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) organizes a rescue. While our erstwhile heroes are seeking Woody out, Woody finds out the truth about himself; it seems that in the '50s he was the star of a hit show - Woody's Round-up. Given a choice between returning to his owner (and facing the end of his usefulness), or staying with the Round-up gang and living forever in a toy museum, Woody is torn. Simultaneously, the rescue team is facing peril after peril, culminating in the ultimate confrontation - Buzz Lightyear versus the evil Emperor Zurg! <br />This movie is outstanding, and even better than the original! The darkness that shaded the original (Sid) is missing in this one, and the minor sadness is quickly replaced with adventure and hilarity. The New Villan, is toy Collector Al (Wayne Knight) who does an amazing &quot;bad-boy job&quot;<br />But as an added bonus, the VHS includes the original Pixar cartoon Luxo Jr. and a set of outtakes (both originally seen in the theatre version), plus a video of the Riders in the Sky singing the Woody's Round-up Medley.<br />Toy Story 2 concerns itself with what happens when Woody is abducted by an evil, money-grubbing toy collector(Wayne Knight). Without making it into a lecture, the movie points out the ugly greed of toy collecting for profit, not fun. The movie gently asserts that toys are for us to play with and to enjoy, not to be stuffed on to a shelf to gather dust. It'll break your heart when you see Wheezy included among the yard sale items; you'll want to rescue him yourself. <br />&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; also includes some special touches that carry over from the original. The Pizza Planet delivery truck makes an appearance in &quot;2&quot;, and the results are hilarious when the toys attempt to drive. At one point, the toys must cross the street to get to Al's Toy Barn, and they do this by hiding under orange road cones, with hilarious/disastrous results -- it reminds you of how Woody and Buzz sneaked into Pizza Planet in &quot;Toy Story&quot;. It's little touches like these that really illustrate how much they tried to make &quot;2&quot; feel like the original.<br />These are great Disney productions that does not have your run-of-the-mill Disney story line. These aren't musically inclined like most Disney movies, except for a couple of songs in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. And these movies aren't Disney remakes of a fairy tale or a historical event. <br />The movie is vibrant, funny, and heartwarming as the first one, the soundtrack is entertaining, and the action is spellbinding. <br />But I would also like to recommend  &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;, and &quot;Antz&quot; which has the same brilliance in animation and story telling as the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies.<br />Thanks,<br />Jordan
B000000FG8|5.0|This cd is just plain motherf**king amazing. Every track is a classic song, but the best ones are Sounsystem, Unity, Knowledge, and Take Warning. The tunes are great, the recording quality isn't, but who cares when it still sounds so good. I love new and old school ska and punk, but this is close to the top of my list. They were the pioneers of ska punk, and I wish they would have stayed together, becuase they would've just gotten better and better. Luckily, we at least have Rancid, who are a pretty damn good band in their own right.
B000002NHN|5.0|Ah, what a wonderful album. Loreena McKennitt's voice is a marvel, synthesizing the superhuman accuracy and strength of operatic soprano with the rich narrative quality of folk singers. Her skill as a composer is likewise impressive, as she stacks ethnic influences on a foundation of tried-and-true Celtic resources that makes for beautiful and compelling songcraft. The pristine recording quality heightens the album's mystique, making every instrument perfectly clear in even the broadest arrangement.<br />And isn't that voice beautiful? <br />Each song tells its own story, but the beautiful, exotic soundscapes lend themselves very much to the listener's imagination. &quot;Marco Polo&quot; might evoke images of Oriental landscapes, while &quot;Skellig&quot; generates lamenting -- and somewhat romantic -- imagery. If the gorgeous and elegiac &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; doesn't give you goosebumps, you must be a zombie. Especially noteworthy is the tragic ballad &quot;The Highwayman&quot; set to music. This ten-minute piece seems a bit repetitive for the first few listens, although you'll later find that the immaculately crafted composition subtly builds in intensity, adding the presence of stronger percussion and a more desperate, emotional flavor. I can't explain it, but &quot;Night Ride Across the Caucasus&quot; means a lot to me deep down. It must be something in the heavenly poetry, the exquisite melodies, or the stunning vocals. The chorus really is the best thing ever...well, almost!<br />And she sings like an angel, doesn't she? <br />Additionally, this CD features a great set of liner notes that sports little bits from McKennitt's journals, highlighting some of the influences for these songs, which I found very interesting. Some of those ethnic touches are hard to put your finger on, so having it pointed out helps. Great cover art too...really sets the tone for the album, I think.<br />And her voice sure is gorgeous, isn't it?
B0000028UK|5.0|&quot;Saw things so much clearer...&quot;<br />In &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;, Eddie Vedder foreshadows this album's effect on rock in the 90s. Vs. mainiuplates harsh lyrics and an aggressive sonic landscape into an easily understandable form. Whether it's the driving percussion of the leadoff track &quot;Go&quot; or the acoustic mayhem of &quot;Elderly Woman...&quot;, this record illuminates what rock has been trying to say for years.<br />Philosophy aside, this album kills. Each track is memorable and different from those around it. Pearl Jam could have made another Ten, but they took the road less traveled. From Vitalogy to Binaural, it is evident that this record truly defined the band's sound. Immaculate.
0375501851|5.0|This book has an enourmous amount of potential and the end is a little abrupt, but overall it does a great job entertaining and showing little tid-bits of cultural positioning in England. The characters are fun, maybe a little more could be done with the females and their social make ups. Looking forward to her next,
0893815500|5.0|I first learned of Salgado from reading &quot;Magnum 50 years at the frontline of photography&quot; Magnum lost a great when he left. For months I removed this book from the shelf of the local Borders and studied it over a cup of coffee. Any photographer could learn a lot from study of this book. I eventually bought the book and I continue to study it about once a week. Salgado's eye for showing people's pride while doing what many would consider distastful is what sets him apart. While I like his later books something about this one touches me deeply
0802130208|5.0|I just want to say that, as all you can see in this reviewing site, if you look at all the rankings, there are a lot of possibilities you are goning to love this work. I can assure you that all of the people that not liked this work, are the kind of people that didn't like the Quixote or Ulysses.<br />So, they have to hate it because they didn't get it, and have to hate the people that got the point of this book.<br />It is about the Odyssey of a fighter against our absurd world.<br />I think all the people that hate the book because of their mental poverty, are the Dunces still confederating against Toole, like we know the dunces confederated against him through his attempts to publish his book during his final years. So, thank all of you Dunces, maybe you not only helped him to die, but you helped him to give us this masterpiece. <br />And, like someone below said, cancel your next three days appointments, you won't be available.
0790744295|4.0|One of the first &quot;horror&quot; movies I watched, Creepshow till this day is still very entertaining. While not being scary (at all), it does tell clever stories with some note-worthy actors. The stories that stick are &quot;father's day&quot; and &quot;the Crate&quot;. A great pick for horror fans of all ages.

B00003CXN4|4.0|Stephen Soderburgh deservedly won the Oscar for Best Director of this film.  (Being nominated twice in the same category--Erin Brockovich was the other--for those who don't know--was a coup.  Instead of likely splitting the votes, the Academy actually went with the better film.)  His use of color in all the three major segments of the film (especially the Mexican part) was brilliant.<br />It does make me hope that Soderburgh goes back to some of his earlier stylistic efforts, such as &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot; and (flawed as it was) &quot;Kafka&quot;.  But his work still reflects that he can make popular films with an edge.  His career should flourish for years to come.<br />However, of the three story lines, the &quot;Michael Douglas Drug Czar&quot; was the weakest.  It was too pat and unrealistic on many levels.  (Most especially the ending and resolution.)<br />Catherine Zeta Jones's performance was surprisingly effective and believable.  Don Cheadle was excellent as well.<br />Without a doubt, the star of the film was Benecio Del Toro and the Mexico segment was by far the best.  He deservedly won Best Supporting Actor.<br />So, if not a perfect film, it was excellent on many levels.  It's well worth a viewing.<br />It also makes me want to watch the British mini-series version &quot;Traffik&quot; on which the film is based.
B000002LVB|4.0|&quot;Loaded&quot; is the least sounding Velvet Underground album. With the departure of John Cale, The Velvets lost their creative avant-garde force and Lou Reed took over making a solid album that would establish Lou Reed's sound for better or worst (depending on your opinion). While I can't say this is as good as the last three VU albums were, it definitely has its moments. Songs like &quot;Who Loves The Sun&quot; and &quot;Oh Sweet Nuthin'&quot; would make it on my list of favorite VU songs. &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; is probably Lou Reed's most classic song. &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; tells the tale of rock and roll in its finest glory. &quot;Head Held High&quot; shows a more powerful side of Lou Reed, vocally. &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot; is a display of good country like The Byrds and Bob Dylan have done before. Overall this album is more solid and well produced than the first three albums but lacks the high energy and creative force that made The Velvet Underground different from the rest.
0684833395|5.0|I first read this novel in 1967, when some friends were fighting in Viet Nam and others were marching against the war. Somehow this novel embodied the absurdity of the Viet Nam war, although it was written about WWII. I marched in Chicago and read and reread this novel.

0380817683|5.0|As a big fan of Marian Keyes, it is really hard to pick a favorite title. However, this particular one won out. Probably because it dealt with such a serious issue as drug addiction with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. <br />First we are witness to Rachel's self destructive demise and subsequent transport to rehab. Just when it gets serious, Keyes livens it up with that wonderful British humor.<br />My favorite section of the book is Rachel's initial take on rehab and reaction to others. Reminds me so much of the movie &quot;28 Days&quot;.<br />I don't want to go into much detail and spoil it for you but you are also privy to life after rehab.<br />In short, if you haven't read this Keye's novel yet, get going!

I have never heard Comfortably Numb So Awesome! The whole performance of Dark side of the Moon was outstanding! Shine on You Crazy Diamond was Flawless! Hey You Sounded Even more poweful than it did on Is There Anybody Out There? (The Wall Live) The only thing I would Change on this CD are the few tracks from Division Bell. Change them to Pigs(Three Different Ones), and Echoes! Astronomy Domine sounded identicle as the one performed in 1967 only with more Power. Roger Waters was the greatest Lyric Writer I know of. OUT WITH THE OLD IN WITH THE NEW... IF YOU CALL 60+ YEARS NEW!
0767819446|4.0|What makes this movie special: 1. Amazing scenes of the 1930's. 2. Interesting plot that gets you sometimes lost in a maze of thoughts. 3. The main actor in this film was Craig Bierko. And he succeeded in his good performance.<br />The only mistake in this movie was the last minute of it! Yes, the CGI of the year 2024 was POOR!<br />I recommend watching it, and you might need to do so twice at least to gather all your thoughts together!
B000002A3T|3.0|What can I say he tried. They brought on a new sound. A soft mellow Atmosphere. I love it but I'm rating it 3 because it isnt the Pink Floyd sound this is more of an Atmosphere CD with words. Please don't think badly of me because of my rating this is the best I could do. I'm a die hard fan! Really I am!
B0000047CX|5.0|Why for me, of all the great and varied records ever made, is the relatively modest 'Getz/Gilberto' the most precious?  Is it the miraculous, once-in-a-lifetime meeting of four talents - composer/arranger Antonio Carlos Jobim, tenor sax Stan Getz, singers Joao and Astrud Gilberto - performing a perfect selection of the most perfect songs ever written?  Is it those songs themselves, the ultimate expression of bossa nova yearning, flavoured with the warm colour of Brazil, yet available to anyone who's ever cried and dreamed in their bedroom?  Is it that swirling, monotonous, barely perceptible, yet crucial bossa nova rhythm, taking hold of your body and mind until you too, without noticing it, are swaying like a samba?  Is it the creative generosity of Stan Getz, whose saxophone IS the sound of this music, but who is perfectly content not to shout about it?  Is it the delicious vocal interplay between Joao and Astrud Gilberto, he mumbling privately to hmself, she quivering to hit the right notes, so distant yet so complimentary you feel you are eavesdropping on the most deeply personal conversations, an especially disturbing one in the deceptively wistful 'Corcovada'?  Is it that miracle of popular music, 'the Girl from Ipanema', a song I must have heard a thousand times, and which still has the power to transport me to another world - a tantalising play between Joao's exotic foreign frustration, eloquent music and Astrud's drily amused interpreter?  Is it 'Para Machuchar Meu Coracao' (To hurt my heart), quiet, circular heartbreak, along with 'Insensatez' the most beautiful, haunting, heartstopping, wistful song ever written?  <br />All of these things on their own would serve to make 'Gilberto/Getz' a masterpiece; together they make it a treasure.  What makes it special and personal, I think, are the unassuming shards of milky piano that can occasionally be heard behind the surface delights.  Played by the composer Jobim himself, they are the emotinal key through this faraway world into your own heart.
B000002C1V|5.0|One of their best! My favorite Pink Floyd Cd's go from Meddle To The final Cut. We should have known what was going to happen after this CD having it named The Final Cut. What better a title for Roger's departure. It was performed excellent. So depressing... thats the Floyd sound I have grown to love. It started on Meddle's last tune (Echoes) and ends on the Final Cut. Goodbye Waters... We will miss you... But... THE SHOW MUST GO ON!
B0000046W9|5.0|There is a line here sung by Astrud Gilberto (from an American song, but never mind) - 'I feel so gay in a melancholy way' - that sums up for me the eternal appeal of bossa nova: beach music cooled with sadness that somehow seizes your tired soul, making it feel warm and happy.  <br />This remarkable set - which, along with 'the Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook', is the only CD I intend to take to my desert island - contains the five prodigious bossa nova albums recorded by Stan Getz in the early 60s: 'Jazz Samba' (the still sparkle-fresh collaboration with Charlie Byrd that introduced bossa nova to the world); 'Big Band Bossa Nova' (a not always successful attempt to combine two mutually exclusive forms, but featuring two epic classics, 'Manha de Carnival' and 'Chega Suadade'); 'Jazz Samba Encore' (an otherworldly masterpiece with Luiz 'Black Orpheus' Bonfa and singer Maria Toldo); 'Getz/Gilberto' (my own treasured favourite, a matchless meeting of four great talents, Getz, Jobim, Joao and Astrud Gilberto) and 'Getz/Almeida' (a rigorous, last gasp jazz workout).  <br />All the great classics are here - 'Desafinado' (will anyone ever spell this right?), 'Insensatez' (swoon), 'O Morro Nao Tem Vez', 'One note samba', 'The girl from Ipanema', 'Corcovado' etc. (you'll know them all even if you think you don't) - together with some less familiar delights.  What is perhaps most exceptional is the way Getz adapts like a chameleon to the very different needs of his various collaborators, and yet still retains the distinctive, emotional sax genius we know and love.  <br />There are some extra tracks included as well, including Getz's only collaboration with Baden-Powell, some live numbers with the Gilbertos, and an absolutely blissful, happysad 'It might as well be spring', the only track I've ever heard that actually DOES sound like spring.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This movie is long... really long. I felt like I was watching a film student's project. The cheap gimmick of the different colors for the different settings served little purpose.  Also, the handheld camers shots did little to add to the feel of the movie. The numerous characters were never really developed to a point where I had an interest in any of them.  I really couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them (maybe that was the point of the movie - but it made me quickly lose interest).  Even a wonderful performance by Benicio Del Toro couldn't save this movie.  This movie was written from the point of view of someone who observed drug culture in the 70s.  Many of the situations seem to reflect the attitudes of that era and not what is going on in the year 2000-1.  After seeing the previews I really wanted to like Traffic, but it seriously let me down.
B00003W8NM|2.0|It's easy to dismiss \\"Fight Club\\" as either a brilliant masterwork or a testoserone pumped, self indulgent, piece of trash. I'm sorta taking the middle ground. This movie deals with what I call easy philosophical ideas. What is reality? Are we in realization of it? What is free will? Do we have it? (I don't think we do) What is maleness, femaleness, happiness, value of human life and a whole bunch of other stuff is thrown into the mish mash. And it delves into easy societal issues about consumerism, cults and/or mass mentality, male agressiveness. The movie never really says much about any of these topics except to merely mention them and to take one of them and turn it into a plot icon for the movie's ending so we can go, \\"Wow that was cool\\". The movie takes these topics and puts layers of testosterone imbued cynicism, brutal violence, generous helpings of post Tarantino filmmaking and a grungy Marilyn Manson/Rob Zombie music video aura atop. This film is painfully and cynically gung ho. There's alot of style here but no real intelligence to back it up. This is the kind of film a fresh outta high school, angry, alienated, anarchist, raised by Limp \\"Biscuit\\" teen would make who wears Ernesto Che Guevara tees because Rage Against the Machine does, yet not knowing a smidgn of who he is, what he did or what he stands for. (Not that I know much anyway) Sigh. On the flip side the film is very witty and has a strangely liberating ending...albeit terrifying. This movie would have been great if played out as a straight action movie and not try be intelligent or give off the impression of intelligence. I'm giving the film 2 stars because it's showcases the talented directoral efforts of Fincher who is an excellent visual composer. His talents could be used more efficiently in other material, and has been. \\"Seven\\" is a far superior and thrilling film.
0425180638|1.0|I swore after I read Black Notice that I wouldn't buy another one of these.  This will definitely be my last.  Take the same story line as her last few books and add more sex and violence and there you have it.

If you think this book would be childish because you've heard about it. It's somewhat childish in parts of it, but the quality of  the characters  makes up for it. If you like an excellent adventure book I reckoned that you go pick this book up right now.
B00003CY5K|4.0|Legally Blonde, a frothy chick flick filled with laughter, perk, and Prada pumps, centers  on sorority president Elle Woods, a perky blonde who is dumped at the exact moment when she believes she will  be proposed to. In order to get her &quot;love&quot; back, Elle moves across the country to study at Harvard Law, where is she finds herself surrounded by studious and ambitious peers who shun her for all she says and does. Despite this, her optimistic attitude forges friendships with a few misfits like herself. When Elle begins to get the hang of her lawyer gag, she, with her prof and a handful of other students, is asked to handle a murder case.And it is then, when Elle really starts to shine, that she begins to doubt herself. Will Elle be victorious? Well, you'll  have to see the movie for that one. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good light &quot;popcorn movie&quot; It has the humor, romance, friendship, and happy ending that all would enjoy. I, a blonde, found it highly amusing. For a good laugh or Friday night, this is one to consider.
014028009X|5.0|I love this book. This book is the funniest book I've ever read in recent six months. When it's blue day, just read and be refreshed. I bet you'll love this book and may buy the Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason too in the desire of something Bridget. It's really addictive and somehow make me think in her way.
0140067477|5.0|one day during a strange conversation with the sister i loathed growing up, we found we'd developed common tastes in art and literature.  at the time i was reading everything i could find on tantra, and she was reading everything she could find on taoism.  so, the next time we got together we gave each other a book.  she gave me &quot;the tao of pooh&quot;, and i loved it!  even though i've read several other good books on the subject since, i've still gone back to read this one agan.  if you're just getting into taoism, this is the book to read first!
0385484518|5.0|This was such a good book!!  I have to admit, though, I watched some of the movie before I read the book, which I hate to do.  I found out, though, that the movie is surprisingly accurate.  I mean, while I was reading the book, pictures and parts of the movie would pop up in my head, and it was exactly like what I was reading.   The book was well written, and it was pretty graphic, but I would really recommend that everyone watch the movie, because it is soo accurate, and it really helps to add to the seriousness of the disease, and the emotions the characters felt.  So read the book first, and get pictures in your head of how you imagine it all happening, and then watch the movie. It's such a powerful story, and I just can't get over how accurate ever single detail and line is in the movie.  The part about the wife was a little different in the movie, but everything else is just like the book.  I would love to meet someone like Morrie when I go to college!!
B000000OAL|4.0|It is now over 16 years since I first listened to this album from Queen. Initally I wasn't that keen on it, probably because the album didn't feature any of Queen's 'hit' singles.  Another reason too for not giving the album the same 'respect' as their later offerings was the fact that the album didn't chart until after their second album Queen II was released the following year (1974).<br />Nowadays the album means far more to me.  I think that it represented an excellent debut album for the band.  There is alot of musical flexability present throughout the album's 11 songs.  Favourites include LIAR, GREAT KING RAT &amp; DOING ALRIGHT.  The bonus track 'Mad The Swine' (which was not included on the vinyl or cassette versions of the album) is especially welcome onto the album's CD format.  It's a great song to listen to as well...very enjoyable.<br />If you like Queen and you don't as yet have this CD in your collection, then I would strongly recommend you to buy it.  The album will grow on you after each listening, believe me.<br />Long live Queen!
6305428522|5.0|This film is an excellent character study. Patricularly of the two leads, Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren. The Stempel character would have ordinarily gained the sympathy of the film's audience for his rejection due to his lack of good looks and star power in favor of the pampered pretty-boy Charles Van Doren, but Stempel comes across here as so obnoxious and annoying that you could see why he was unceremonoiusly dumped. The fact that he willingly goes along with the game show fraud all along kills any empathy for and you end up wanting to tell this whiner to shut ... up! Van Doren is a bit more toxic, in that he covers his deceitful nature with polish and charm. The man could rob a bank while making the cops smile, so it's a very satisfying moment when he gets his just desserts.
B00005LMBK|4.0|the only reason this isnt the best album of the year is because it had the misfortune of sharing a birthyear with the flawless Cannibal Ox album.However,this is still a very,very good recording.Its hard to categorize exactly what it sounds like,but if your expecting 'clint eastwood'type stuff you might be dissapointed.Its kinda like portishead meets stereolab meets beck and its hot to death.
B000003TAR|5.0|Those lyrics echo the album in a way. This album is more artistic then Nevermind. Compare the lyrics to Nevermind to In Utero. In Utero wins in a blow out. Don't get me wrong, Nevermind was a sweet album, but this one takes home the gold. Also, this is a great indication on where the band was going towards musically. The first line on the album is &quot;Teenage angst has paid off well&quot; that line it's self gives a great idea where this album is heading. &quot;Serve The Servents&quot; has one of the greatest solos I've ever heard. This song is basically a diary of Kurt's life from childhood to stardom. Next, we got &quot;Scentless Apprentice.&quot; A violent sounding track with a catchy drum beat and a blood curdling scream. You don't even have time to recover and then comes &quot;Heart-Shaped Box.&quot; The shall we say &quot;big hit&quot; off the album. This is one great song and probably has gotten the most radio play. After that, we have &quot;Rape Me.&quot; Kurt's second anti-rape song, the first being &quot;Polly.&quot; A really good chorus and will leave you humming it for awhile. &quot;Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle,&quot; is the most underated track on the album. Listen for yourself. &quot;Dumb&quot; has to be the saddest song anyone could ever right. Great lyrics and a beautiful cello part toward the end. &quot;Very Ape&quot; is a little punk ditty. Clocks in at 1:54. This leads us to another violent song. &quot;Milk It.&quot; Kurt Cobain is very abstarct with his lyrics. They paint a picture that I can't put into words. Now, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea.&quot; Wonderful song. Now for my personal favorite, &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter.&quot; You'll will be blown away by this song. Distortion is king! &quot;tourette's&quot; is another punk rock ditty. Kurt said this was the weakest track on the album. He is right. This should have been a b-side. A fitting end to an album, &quot;All Apologies.&quot; This song is the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; of the 90's without a doubt. So, in conclusion. If you are looking for another Nevermind, you will probably be let down or may love it. Kurt Cobain is greatly missed. We could use him in today's chaos.

B00003CXS4|5.0|Movie Summary: Turkish and Tommy are two likable small time wanna be gangsters. They live in England and run a few money making scams including bare knuckle boxing and slot machines. We follow their adventures as they try to stay out from under the thumb of Brick Top a gangster higher up on the food chain. From there things get more complicated and more fun as we are introduced to a myriad of characters most of which are trying to get their hands on a giant stolen diamond.<br />My Opinion:  I was very pleasantly surprised with Snatch. I really had no expectations and ending up liking it a lot. There was tons of action and that was great. It was quite violent, but the violence was part of the story and not thrown in as an after thought. There is a slightly complicated plot that holds the entire movie together and that was great as well. There were a lot of very interesting characters and you guessed it, they were great! I could see how someone could get confused by the plot or the large number of characters, but with a little bit of attention you can do it. Everything just fit together so well that I was amazed. I haven't seen Ritchie's other movie Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, so I can't comment or complain about the similarities but I can't imagine complaining no matter how similar they are. In fact if they really are similar then I've got another great movie to look forward to. Brad Pit is incredible as the fighting Piker. I really wasn't a fan of his before this and really didn't want to be, but I'm definitely leaning that way now.<br />DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 as well as full screen. DD 5.1. Both picture and sound quality are great. This is a two disc set with the second disc containing tons of extras including trailers, Making Of feature, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.<br />What You Should Do:  See Snatch. It is a violent complicated fun movie that deserves a look.

0767903862|5.0|Being an Aussie, I was naturally interested to see what an American writer made of our fine country. And boy did I see. How can I describe Bill Bryson's writing? Take an American, who grew up in the Midwest learning all about morality, society and baseball. Stick this man behind the business desk of the London Times for several years, during which he'll have easy access to any of the numerous works of the Monty Python crew, Terry Pratchett novels before TP got famous over your side of the Atlantic, and other such examples of British humour.<br />And then let the man loose writing travelogues. <br />What a brilliant, brilliant book. Having been to several of the places in the book - indeed, living in one of them - I recognised a lot, and the book was even better for the recognition. Even if you never saw the Alpine National Park in your life, or Uluru or Surfers Paradise or Canberra (which is just as tedious as Bill says)... you'll laugh out loud all the way through the book. And take the serious bits seriously, too. Australian history is doled out when Bill gets to the relevant bit of Australia. Stats about the loss of half a million hectares of national park - enough to cover four decent-sized US national parks - are written right alongside humorous conversations about eating bogong moths. And the book is even more all the better. That much more natural.<br />What a brilliant book.
B000002UCN|3.0|Released in 1976, after Harrison's EMI contract had lapsed, this title is a study in missed opportunities.  In its original LP format, side one consisted of Harrison songs recorded by the Fab Four, with side two containing solo material.The original (North American) cover art has been replaced here by that used in overseas editions of the album, but it's no improvement...the current graphics have a thrown-together quality.As for the tunes---the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  It seems somewhat cynical of Capitol/EMI to include Beatles recordings here, as if to say Harrison didn't have enough quality solo work for a &quot;best of&quot; set.Keep in mind that this was before the time of boxed set collections, with rarities like obscure b-sides and outtakes.Having cleared those hurdles, though, the music itself is a decent introduction to the Quiet Beatle's song- and record-crafting career. I'd recommend it to those new to Harrison's work, and to the Beatles freaks who have to have EVERYTHING. Perhaps EMI will someday rethink the concept of a solo Harrison &quot;best-of&quot; set.Here's hoping!
B00004VVNE|5.0|This is an underrated gem from Sidney Lumet. This film could very easily have departed from its ultimately brilliant course, and been turned into an overblown, over-the-top, unrealistic &quot;Doomsday&quot; farce.  But Lumet holds on to reality and presents us with a very realistic, and quite frightening look at what could possibly happen if one of our bombers should get a false message to attack Moscow. Henry Fonda is totally believable as the U.S. President trying to avert a catastrophe. And check out a young pre-&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; Larry Hagman as the Russian interpreter! I liked Larry very much in this role.  He, like everyone else in this good cast, remains completely realistic and believable. I don't think this film would have had as great an impact on the viewer had it been shot in color. The stark, brooding black-and-white photography adds volumes to the mood and setting of the film. Buy this one NOW! And if you have never seen it before, watch it immediately upon getting it!

0385247125|3.0|With its double spacing, positive tone and simple language, this book is aimed towards a 9-14 year old audience. It is an interesting biography, actually written by the Gloved One with the assistance of the late Jackie O as his editor. It is not a balanced biography, but then again, who would expect the enigmatic, eccentric Jackson to write a totally honest biography about himself? Unfortunately, he has a lot to hide nowadays. What I do like about his biography is that Jackie O was careful to ensure Michael's writing sounds like Michael, and not like some &quot;As Told To&quot; celebrity ghostwriter. (Often celebrities use ghost writers for their biographies since most cannot write that well.) There's a lot of great photos of Michael and his friends and family. This book also has pleasing graphics, so visuals were taken into consideration, which I, as a graphic designer, can appreciate. A light read for a rainy day. A positive, upbeat book for kids.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Most would not consider a film about the war on drugs 'great entertainment'. And they're right. It was beyond great. 'Traffic' is an amazing film that shows three sides to the 'war on drugs'. There are three stories here all mixed together in a series of short cuts that jump from one story to the next, leaving the viewer wondering what will happen and what they will see next. The first story that we are introduced to involves a cop named Javier, played by Benicio Del Toro. Javier and his partner become involved with a general who is actually playing drug cartel on the side. The general wants to get rid of all the other cartels in Mexico, but only so that he is the only one left. The second story is that of the newly appointed drug czar, Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas. While he is trying to adjust to his new surroundings, his daughter (played by an amazing Erika Christiansen) is getting deeper and deeper into drugs with the aid of her boyfriend Seth (played by surprise, surprise Topher Grace from 'That 70's Show'!). The final story is sort of two stories that are interwoven. This one involves two undercover cops (played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) and the woman they are watching (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones). The woman did not know that her husband was involved in selling drugs. When he is carted off to jail, she finds that he was deeply in debt to a cartel named Juan Obergon. As all these stories start to unravel, the viewer is shown a world where the motto is 'Once you get in, you can't get out'. We are taken to places we would never go, see things most people have never seen and we are taught a valuable lesson. I'll let you figure out what it is on your own. Steven Soderberg is obviously a great filmmaker ('sex,lies and videotape' and 'Erin Brokovich') and with 'Traffic' it is only made more clear. The way the stories are interwoven and the way they look make this movie as visually stunning as it is well-acted. I'd also like to applaud the screenwriter Stephen Gaughan. I look forward to his directorial debut. As far as the movies last year went, 'Traffic' was and is a stand-out motion picture among the mediocre films of today.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Armageddon seemed, if nothing else, an action film made purely for entertainment value. But the film simply doesn't work. Everything- the characters, the situation, and the acting is unrealistic. If you like sci-fi movies or love to see continous explosions, this is your movie, as my teenage brother can attest to. But I didn't believe the characters for a second. They all looked like they were reciting lines. The romantic subplot doesn't strike me as real, and the enmity between father and daughter seems forced. The director tried to humanize the movie with sequences from around the globe, but that too looked forced. Not to mention that I didn't feel any threat of impending doom. The world is about to experience an catasrophe! And I felt absolutely no suspense, no fear. You would only love this movie if you live for special effects but it loses its human touch. It is too predictable. It is full of cliches.I liked Independence Day much better since it incorporated both fear and emotion in the viewer, or at the very least me. I must admit though I was stricken when Paris demolished. QUELLE DOMAGE!! I'm used to my hometown being blown up anyway.
6304428928|5.0|Good story. Excellent character development. Nice photography. First-rate music. And a brilliantly controlled performance by Dustin Hoffman. ..... This is &quot;Rain Man&quot;, 1988's Best Picture Winner. And rightly so. This script plays out very nicely, as we are drawn into the world of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt and their cross-country adventure. This is a film to watch and enjoy over and over again!  It MUST be viewed more than just once! And remember to fly Qantas whenever possible.....because &quot;Qantas never crashed.&quot;  :)

080017948X|5.0|This is perfectly charming movie, so much so that one can actually describe it as charming.  It's a simple concept, that of a man trapped into living the same day over and over again. What sets it on a pedestal is the writing and acting.  The writing is flawless, this is simply one of the few films where everything works and while no fat is seen for trimming, one also sees nothing that was left out.  However, none of this would matter were it not for the acting.  The supporting staff is excellent, McDowell, Elliot and even every actor in a bit part.  However, it's Bill Murray's show all of the way.  He is amazing.  One thinks of him as a comedic actor first and he is certainly great in those moments here.  However, for the movie to work you must believe his transformation from jerk to saint.  There is a montage of scenes where he tries to escape by various methods of suicide, it starts off darkly funny and then over the course of thirty seconds smoothly transforms to sheer anguish and pain.  I can think of no other actor who could have pulled this role off, with perhaps the exception of Steve Martin (based on another amazing movie, &quot;All of Me&quot;) but Murray owns this film.<br />Put it this way, this movie is one of the very, very few (&lt;5) that I regularly pop in the player and enjoy just as much the 50th time as I did the first.
B00000273M|5.0|I loved The Bangles growing up and I still do.  Their music is timeless and it is always a joy to listen to them.  My absolute favorite song by them is Going Down to Liverpool which, in my opinion, does not get the praise it deserves.  If you love this group or are just a casual listener, get Greatest Hits!
B00000IPAX|3.0|This is a good CD in its own respect, but I must warn you, it is nothing like Cheshire Cat or Dude Ranch.  What makes it different is the lack of &quot;punk&quot; drums.  The machine-gun, cymbals blasting sound that is so prevelant in nearly all punk albums has been replaced by a slower more &quot;poppy&quot; sound.  Listen to Dude Ranch and then to Enema and you'll hear what I'm talking about.  I guess that this change is due to Blink getting a new drummer.  Don't get me wrong, this album still has some really good songs, but I was extremely disappointed in it.  My advice to you is: borrow it from someone first before you spend your money on it.
B00005K3LU|5.0|When I bought the &quot;Die Hard Ultimate Collection&quot; set, I really didn't think they would be able to do much with the very first Die Hard.  It's a pretty old movie.  I really didn't know if they could do much to improve the picture and sound quality of the movie.  Well, I thought wrong, for when I watched this movie, I was completely shocked and stunned.  I said to myself, &quot;I can't believe they made this movie better.&quot;<br />This has to be one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  The picture is ten times more crisper and sharper than the older DVD version.  When the terrorists shoot out the glass windows to trap Willis, you can literally see every single piece of glass landing on the floor.  Also, the sound is explosive and very impressive, especially if you can watch it in DTS.  When I watched this new version of &quot;Die Hard&quot;, it was like seeing it for the very first time.<br />If you are not familiar with &quot;Die Hard&quot;, here's the story:  Bruce Willis is John McClane, a very short tempered New York cop.  He goes to California, hoping to patch things up with his wife, who works at the Nakatomi Plaza.  All of that changes when a group of terrorists, armed to the teeth with guns and explosives, decide to take over the building.  Now, the only one who can stop them is McClane, and believe, he's not too thrilled with the idea, but he knows he's the only one who stands a chance against them.  McClane goes on a one-man war, running around the plaza, taking out the bad guys, and trying his best to stay alive.  As soon as he hears the first gun shot, McClane knows he's about to have a very bad day.<br />This is a must have for anyone who loves &quot;Die Hard&quot;.  I know some might be hesitant since they already have the first box set, but believe me, it is worth it.  Filled with non-stop action and thrills, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a classic, and should be seen by all who loves action films.  Again, I must say this is one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  An easy five out of five, without question.ansfers I have ever seen.  An easy five out of five, without question.
B000002MP2|4.0|the best song on this album by far is &quot;long view&quot; and is sthe only real song i like off it i mean it has the hits &quot;basket case&quot; and &quot;when i come around&quot; but they arnt nearly as good as long view i bought this for that song and i really only listen to thaat song if i put that album on<br />Stand out tracks: long view,basket case
B000001GXI|3.0|As the others have noted, this set has many admirable qualities: Wunderlich's singing is a dream, and the conducting is a delight.  Nonetheless, I find that the weakness of the two female leads makes this a less-than-satisfying recording.  Roberta Peters' Queen is out of control:  the high passages are terrifying, but for the wrong reasons. Evelyn Lear's Pamina is not comparable with those on a number of other recorded versions of this opera. As a result, there is too much magic that is missing from this recording.
0425180638|1.0|Unfortunately, the 468 pages of this book were put there to give some space between Point of Origin and Patricia Cornwell's next book. This effort was boring and confusing. You may keep on reading in hopes that she will make sense of things, but you'll be disappointed.  I re-read this book to learn what I had misssed, but it seemed even more jumbled the second time.<br />Do yourself a favor and read all her early Scarpetta books, or at least Post Mortem and Cruel and Unusual, but stop before you crack the cover of Point of Origin. Avoicd this current book, The Last Princinct. There are so many delightful mystery-thrillers out there.[....]

B000003N7K|5.0|The hard-bop of 'blue train' served as my introduction to the talents of John Coltrane, and later I 'progressed' to listening to both A Love Supreme and Interstellar Space. When my dad bought this album home a little over two weeks ago, it was a revelation to me that the man who is generally considered to be an 'avant' jazzman could play such heart achingly gentle and tender ballads with such feeling and taste (not that his other work lacks feeling, taste, or heart either). This album is the proof that Coltrane could do it all and do it better too. All the non-believers need to hush the fuss and dig on this.  Oh Yeah, why have I never heard of Johnny Hartman before? This man has a voice like an angel and should be a superstar in his own right. These two brothers click on this set.
0140072187|5.0|My dad bought this for me in junior high. Since then I have probably read it a dozen times. Probably the most powerful book I have ever read. Mason was a Huey pilot in Vietnam. It has been called the greatest book about the Vietnam war, and I have never found cause to argue with that.
B000005YZM|4.0|Odessy and Oracle is as baroque an album your going to find from the 1960's. When it was released in late 68, it was passed over for not being pyschedelic enough. With bands of such fuzzed out mayhem, (Jefferson Airplane, Cream, etc.), ruling the charts, this album fell through the proverbial crack. Rod Argent and Chris White wrote almost as if they were listening through a glass at the door to Lennon and McCartney talking about song ideas. (The above statement could be factual since the album was recorded at Abbey Road.) My personal favorites on this great album are &quot;Beechwood Park&quot; and &quot;Brief Candles&quot;, two very Beatle-esque tunes. The rest of this gem is very lavish and adorned with multiple vocals and tape effects. &quot;Time of The Season&quot;, their greatest achievement, is also on this album. If this album got the attention it deserved, the Zombies would be among the living.

B00005LB50|4.0|I agree wholeheartedly with some of the previous positive reviews.  The Demos and unreleased material are fantastic and in great quality, a major upgrade from previous bootlegs.  Its wonderful to hear the previously released material in best quality ever.  However, given the 4th disc; with the first two albums complete, the songs from these albums which appear earlier in the box set, should have been released in the opposite format from the 4th disc.  Songs from the first album could have been in stereo on discs 1 &amp; 2, and Mono for the second album. The upgrade of the first album is not as dynamic as the others.  There is room on the discs for more songs, and I'm not sure why they left off Carefree Country Day and In the Hour of Not Quite Rain,which should have been included just for completeness sake.  The longer version of Bluebird would have been nice just to hear, but I agree with Neil and Steve that it really isn't that good.  Overall very worth the $... I paid, but could have, and should have been better.
B000001Y42|4.0|this cd is raw limp and i love it, its quite uniqie album and most of the songs are good on this one but the ones that are good are realy great so it deservie 4 stars for those songs songs like &quot;pollution&quot;, &quot;counterfit&quot;, &quot;leech&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;, &quot;clunk&quot;, &quot;stuck&quot; and &quot;no body loves me&quot; are very kool tracks and are worth hearing over and over again buy this if u are into nu-metal and limp cuz u wont regrete it<br />stand out tarcks: pollution, counterfit, leech, faith, clunk, stuck, no body loves me

B00000J2KT|5.0|As Pvt. Joker says to the film crew interviewer, only half-joking in his snide and cynical manner.  The whole scene of the men being filmed under fire and then interviewed was just one juxtaposition of absurdity in Kubrick's wonderful take on the Viet Nam war.<br />Of course it would take Stanley Kubrick to finally quit the screwing around and show us a real D.I. dehumanizing and rebuilding recruits into killers in a realistic recitation of a Viet Nam era Marine Corps. Boot Camp.  Lee Ermey was a D.I. and his Sgt. Hartman profanely ripping a new-one on one Boot after another is a piece of work.  And of course, he is brutal to the goat of the platoon, poor fat Leonard (Gomer Pyle), harassing and tormenting him into a homicidal disassociative psychosis. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio are wonderful as tormetor and tormented.<br />Then there are all the other nice Kubrickian touches, such as Hartman using Charles Whitman (the Texas U. sniper) and Lee Harvey Oswald as positive examples of Marine Corps. marksmanship.  No doubt is made of the fact that Hartman's job is to desensitize and harden these young men for combat or they will not survive.  But, it is a cruel exercise, just as shoving young, mostly teenage Americans into a faraway &amp; confusing war is a cruel exercise.  And, it is a thin line, as Hartman &amp; Leonard's fates attest.<br />So, Kubrick gives us the training then takes us to the war.  This is not the jungle war, but the war in the city of Hue during the Tet Offensive.  It is more upfront then the guerrilla-style jungle combat, but as we see, just as ambiguous in the end in its execution and purpose.  Kubrick gives us lots of little touches and anecdotes.  One of my favorites, the Col. breaking Pvt. Joker's chops over his peace button using sports metaphors about &quot;getting on the team and going in for the big score&quot;.  Wonderful.<br />Kubrick doesn't romanticize the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong either.  The long line of executed villagers lieing in a ditch covered with lye, who had been gulled into reporting to and then murdered by the Cong is shown with an effectively quiet eloquence. Cruelty and savagery abounded there.<br />The final conflict, with the entire squad held-up and shot-up and terrified by what turns out to be a teenage Viet Cong girl says more about who and what we were fighting over there than any long diatribe.  The entire might of the U.S. forces, best trained and equipped in the world, can be devastated by an AK47 wielded by a determined teenager.  Kubrick does not judge these Marines, nor the enemy they faced.  He shows the dilemma, and let's us decide the worth of this effort.  He shows death on both sides, and leaves us to ask the questions.<br />And the young troops march to the Perfume River singing the theme from the Mickey Mouse Club.  Two cultures in collision?  Young men in combat somewhere they never should have been sent?<br />Kubrick's camera work and recreation of combat is as good in its way as Saving Pvt. Ryan's was in its way.  His sardonic humorous touches are numerous and welcome.  His choice and placement of music is, as was always true in his later movies, nothing less than brilliant.<br />Like all of Kubrick's later movies, when I first saw Full Metal, I was a little disappointed.  It didn't seem BIG like Dr. Strangelove or 2001.  But, I have seen it many times since, and I cannot find a flaw in it.  When it starts, I have to watch it all the way through.  Stanley set such a high standard, it always seemed a little disappointing when you first saw the later films, but they age well.<br />Now, I think this is another masterpiece of economy and story telling.  It says a lot, without preaching.  A terrific film.

0380973650|5.0|I have been following Neil Gaiman's writing for a long time now, since his early days in The Sandman.  I can honestly say that this is his greatest work yet.  For those familiar with Gaiman's work, you will find this common territory.  Still present is his ability to bring out that childlike part of us that embraces the unbelievable and allows our imagination to make it believable for us.  Gaiman grounds his fantasy in reality well enough that the reader begins to believe that his fantastic tales could actually be occuring, even though it goes against all rules of normal life.  Where Gaiman has transcended his earlier work is in his skill with the plot.  While all of Gaiman's works have that page-turning quality that propels the reader towards a climaxm, this story has a great mystery that keeps the reader glued to the book to find out &quot;who dunnit&quot;.  I have read all of Gaiman's work and can say that this is his best writing so far.  He has truly reached a new pinnacle in his career.
B0000033OT|5.0|While it is true, that Donny truly shines in live performance, this was my first introduction to Mr. Hathaway as an impressionable 18-year old longing for a male musical identity.  Before, it had been all females, most notably, Aretha.  However, when I first heard &quot;Thank You Master For Saving My Soul&quot; I KNEW that I had found the ultimate model.  His piano playing is quite simply flawless.  He also established his reputation here as one who covers whatever tune he feels he can lend something to, and prime examples were &quot;Misty&quot; and, of course, &quot;To Be Young, Gifted, And Black.&quot;  Each and every time I listen to him (or today, his daugher) I am reminded of what an awesome talent he was and a definite loss to the industry he was.  To be sure, some cuts stand out more than others, but when you look at his body of work as a whole, you can see how he made a lasting impression on serious musicians.  Above all, I recommend any of his live recordings and to make your collection complete, you owe it to yourself to give a listen to anything this man recorded.

B000009QPG|5.0|This is Seasons in the Abyss.  Seasons in the Abyss is one amazing alblum that has one amazing song after another.  Trying to visualize the lyrics in the songs is scary. The songs talk about death, death, dead bodies, and death.  This may seen kind of boring but it isn't.  This is probably the alblum that brought many people to Slayer and what better way of doing it than this.  It gives us the ultra-fast and ultra-aggresive song War Ensemble on its first track, this should already win you over.  Then in between we get songs that are fast, scary, controversial, and hellraising.  Then in the end you get the title track Seasons in the Abyss.  This is a Slayer classic that will have you banging your head until snapping.  Get this, it is one of the best metal alblums ever made.

Beautiful stage sets, a contemporary edge to a period piece with Attracive Actors with enticing voices, singing about the rollercoaster of Love. Breathtaking, and Ewan Mcgregor?  The bomb!
B000002LFZ|5.0|I love this CD, it has all the favorites that I remember playing in our living room as I toddled around.  I find myself being drawn to more and more music from the early 70's, and this CD is among my favorites in my new growing collection.
B000002KBA|1.0|This album is horrible, I mean absolutely horrible. It realizes the very worst possibilities of 70s rock. Screeching unintelligle vocals without inflection; uninspired amateurish ax-work that seriously makes you wonder if Richie Blackmore isn't drunk in the studio; and songs that somehow manage to be devoid of rhythm and melody at the same time. Richie Blackmon shows no creativity and less talent on guitar- Jimmy Page's roadies were better guitarists.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles made some very good albums, but by and large they were a singles band.  Their greatest hits collection culls together their finest songs which are among the catchiest of the 80's.  The band were knee deep in the sounds of the 60's and their songs are laced with the bright and sunny sounds of flower power.  The album features their number one songs, &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; and &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; as well as their all time best song, the mesmerizing cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's &quot;Hazy Shade Of Winter&quot;.  The Bangles are one of those bands that many people will never admit to liking, but will turn up the volume and sing along when &quot;Manic Monday&quot; comes on the radio.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have never been a fan of rock, listening to rap almost exclusively with a few exceptions.  Then I saw the music video for &quot;Crawling&quot; on MTV, and I loved the song enough to buy the CD (figuring that would be the only song I liked on it.)  Wow was I wrong, I've had the CD for about a week and it has been the only thing I have played in my new Mustang!  <br />1) Papercut - Great first song to intro. the CD.  Listen to the song once and the chorus will pump you up without a doubt.<br />2) One Step Closer - This is really a fantastic song seems to be the most &quot;hardcore&quot; on the album, it is usually underrated simply because it has been overplayed on any rock/alternative radio station in the U.S.<br />3) With You - Great song, pretty catchy chorus (like any of the songs on the CD).  Really shows how impressive they can be vocally.<br />4) Points of Authority - This one has a very cool beat but the chorus doesn't come close the calibre of most of the other songs on the CD.  Not the best song on the CD but not bad at all.<br />5) Crawling - What can I say about this song, by now you've probably heard it and love it or you wouldn't even be reading this or considering the CD.  Great lyrics, unfortunately it will be overplayed as well to the point where you don't even realize you have been singing the whole song out loud until it is over.<br />6) Run Away - Good song, this one has a great chorus and great lyrics.  The lead singer's voice is really put on display in some of the verses in this song and he doesn't disappoint.  <br />7) By Myself - Personally, I love the beat and chorus to this song.  To me it sounds very unique and it really gets you hyped.<br />8) In The End - One of the best songs on the CD, a shining example of how they are so different from Limp Bizkit, Korn, Papa Roach, etc...  It also shows how great a song can be with a little meaning behind it conveyed through amazing vocal talent without using a single word that might result in an &quot;Explicit Lyrics&quot; sticker on the cover.<br />9) Place for My Head - Great song very catchy, great vocals by both the lead singer and his counterpart.  This one is one of my favorites simply because of the chorus.<br />10) Forgotten - Not a bad song at all but it doesn't do for me what most of the other songs do. (I never leave this track on repeat in the car CD player)<br />11) Cure for the Itch - Very melodic relaxing example of what their DJ can do without any words.<br />12) Pushing me Away - Another great song, great finish to the CD although I think &quot;Place for my head&quot; would have been a better last track.<br />Overall - What an impressive debut CD for a band that has proved they can blow Limp Bizkit out of the water by improving on what they do best - rap/rock.  Much more harmony involved in these Linkin' Park songs than any Limp Bizkit song I have ever heard and you will not get sick of the songs after just a few times of hearing them like most headache-inducing Limp Bizkit songs where all it seems to be is screaming to the beat of decent background music.  Sometimes actual vocals and meaning to the words makes for a far better CD than just doing it &quot;for the Nookie&quot; can.  Can't go wrong buying this!
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore's WATCHMEN is a brilliant piece of art and literature. For anyone who percieves artwork incorporated with text as merely a &quot;comic&quot; is unfortunately missing out on a world of incredible insight, meaning, depth, and fascination. If you've stumbled across THE WATCHMEN, and happen to read this review, I implore you to buy it and read it with an open mind. You will be a changed human being. And, once you have warmed to the fire of this art, move on to The Sandman and Preacher. It gets better.
0385501560|5.0|victor mancini uses an almost stand-up comedy routine to endear himself to the reader so that he can purge himself of the burdens he bears within his soul. but how serious are these burdens?  are they really self-destructive thoughts and feelings or is this a man who is taking his actions much too seriously?  his mother is a mess from day one and probably before.  he has no career.  he has a strong mind but lacks self-confidence.  mr. palahniuk uses humor to keep the energy flowing and allow the reader to see a light at the end of the tunnel on some issues that can be dicey to confront.  this is the first book of mr. palahniuk's that i have read but will certainly not be the last.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is the greatest work of the Smashing Pumpkins, but also the most amazing work of a generation of musicians--the 1990's alt-rock group.  Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc. may have produced extraordinarily influential works but none can match the sheer power and beauty of MCIS.  The creativity and amazing production work speaks for itself.  A masterpiece.
B000002TQV|4.0|Before Radiohead turned into the genre-defining band after OK Computer and Kid A, they were the top of rock, and this album fails to dissapoint if you're looking for loud, bombastic rock or more quiet, beautiful songs.  Songs like &quot;Planet Telex&quot;, the title track, &quot;Just&quot;, and the most rock of all, &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; are songs with an army of guitars, and Radiohead manage to pull it off.  Other songs like &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; (the biggest single), and &quot;Bulletproof&quot; are on the other hand, very acoutic.  Overall, it is a solid album, with just I guess one track that never clicked for me, &quot;Bones&quot;.  The best songs, in my opinion, are &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, and &quot;Black Star&quot;.  It's not really the Radiohead we're used to now, but they certainly had this great album before they opened their sonic textures and political statements.
B00000DGUG|5.0|A very good second &quot;international&quot; release. I'm not supprised this album did'nt sell as well as the first (how could it) but I,m also supprised it did'nt fair better. Its one of my favorites. I love jagged little pill but this one is A little better I think. Well do yourself A favor and by this one. I know I will do myself another favor in november when her new one comes out.
B000002GB9|5.0|Styx was a true innovator in the genre of what is now sometimes referred to derogatorily as &quot;corporate rock.&quot;  To me, this music is a lot more creative and enjoyable than anything that came out in, say, the early 1990s.  Any fan--or listener of rock radio over the years--is familiar with the epic &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;, which starts with a pretty piano introduction but eventually builds up into a memorable, anthemic chorus.  But most of the other tracks are of equally high quality.  How about the mystical &quot;Castle Walls&quot;?  The title track reminds me of how Dennis DeYoung, despite how great his voice is suited for ballads, was once quite a great rock and roll singer.  Tommy Shaw's &quot;Fooling Yourself&quot; and JY's &quot;Miss America&quot; futher emphasize the diversity of this band in their music.  While Styx always made a practice of changing its sound, this is what the band sounded like at the height of their '70's prime.  Clearly a unique and memorable classic rock album, and despite what the critics say, the fruits of a very talented band.
B00004LN16|4.0|I was 22 years old, I was never really interested in music at all. Then I saw AC/DC performing the song &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; on MTV's TRL and my life was changed at that moment. This album was my first proper introduction to AC/DC and after a year of listening to this album, It Rocks!! &quot;Lip&quot; truly has some classic rock n roll tunes. On &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, AC/DC sound suprisingly vibrant &amp; inspired, as opposed to the plodding of &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; which was a pressured album release. Even though Brian Johnson should still see a throat specialist, his vocals are much improved. After 20 years of wear &amp; tear, Johnson still shreds his pipes with unmatched intensity, which means more to me than any imperfection in his voice. Even though Bon Scott was by far AC/DC's strongest lyricist, At age 52, vocally Brian Johnson can still easily overpower Scott. And that's where the the album has its few shortcomings, the lyrics, as with almost any other post-Bon Scott album. &quot;Damned&quot;, House of Jazz, Meltdown, &amp; Come and Get It, all have great riffs, but not so great lyrics. OTHER THAN THAT, &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; has some of the strongest AC/DC tunes in almost a decade, &quot;Safe In New York City&quot; has the best groove of the album from beginning to end, Rudd, Williams, and Malcolm Young lay it down, while Angus Young tears up the fretboard with a blistering solo and Brian Johnson punctuate the song with reckless and unrestrained intensity, &quot;I FEEL SAFE IN A CAGE IN NEW YORK CIITTYY!! Throw Away the Key!&quot;......&quot;Can't Stand Still&quot; really displays a fresh and clever way of playing a good ol' 50's rock n roll tune, this song could easily revive Chuck Berry's career.......Now &quot;Hold Me Back&quot; &amp; &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; (their ode to Elvis Presley) are truly two of the strongest songs AC/DC have ever recorded, undoubtedly equal to anything on &quot;Highway to Hell, Back In Black or Razor's Edge&quot;. If you've never liked AC/DC, &quot;Lip&quot; won't change your mind. If you consider yourself an AC/DC fan and do not instantly like this album, Guess What? You're not an AC/DC fan, the fact of it is you were never an AC/DC fan because there is simply nothing to dislike about this album. &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; rocks with a passion and it's the essence of AC/DC.
B00000J7S8|5.0|A gorgeous voice; liquid silk, with that slight throaty attribute that just enhances every song. Perfect notes, extraordinary balance &amp; control. Just wonderful.<br />The last track (the bonus track) is exquisite, the diamond amongst a selection of the finest pearls.<br />Buy it.  And then buy another copy as a back-up because you will play this one so often that you'll wear it out!
0789723107|4.0|I am working on a research project that involves web site usability and I thought this book was very informative. They get right to the point .. with both positive and negative examples for their different usability issues. No long drawn out explanations .. just what works and what doesn't. I am currently reading one of Jacob Nielsen's books, and although he also makes many good points about the same things .. he takes longer to do it. Although I find his biweekly column to be necessary reading for web design, Nielsen seems a little more opinionated and full of himself. When reading this book by Krug, I felt like this was someone who was more in touch with the real people because he was a real person .. rather than because he had done multiple studies and surveys. The author has a sense of humor and treats his subject light enough that you don't fall asleep trying to wade through the intensity. <br />I would recommend that all web designers read some book on usability before taking on their first (or next) project. This one is fairly easy reading, while still making a lot of good points.
6304169558|5.0|This is one of the movies that I can see a hundred times and never get tired of it.  The storyline is amazing, but the effects are tremendous!!!This movie brings you into the storm chaser's brain almost.  They bring you along for the ride!  I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the sickest album of 2001! TOOL is one of the few bands  still around making decent music that will actually mean  something ten years from now. Right now, at this point in rock history we are at a breaking point. Something has got to give. All you hear on the radio is crap, but that is nothing new. Everybody is copying each other. Everyone is cloneing each other. And that's a good thing, for real music. Because sooner than later all these clones are going to end up canceling each other out. Bye bye to Fred Durst and his followers. See also STAINDED. See Also Linkin Park. It happened in the 80's and it will happen again. Ten years from now true music fans will appreiate what TOOL has done for music. The disc starts off strong with 'The Grudge' and never really slows down much after. I can see how some critics compared this album to a FLOYD ablum. Some tunes though dark remind me of Meddle. The Floyd album right before Darkside. There is just so many layers to it. Songs that are like that are 'parabol' and 'parabola' Not only great musically, but also deep lyrics. &quot;this body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. embrace this moment, remember, we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion.&quot; My personal fav tune is 'tick &amp; leeches' but it is hard for me to skip by any song on this album. It really is an expeirence, from start to finish. If you have any taste in music you won't be disapointed, but hey, that's just my opinion. TOOL Rules!
B0000027F3|4.0|I was very disappointed in this album when it first came out, but I think that was only because I was still in college in my party mode, listening to all the chick-metal bands like Poison, Warrant, etc.  Priest had remained one of my favorites, but I suppose I was looking for them to bust out and become a really big name with huge radio hits, which they had attempted and failed with \\"Turbo\\" (considered by many to be their worst album, but one of my favs by far).  I suppose I wanted a Judas Priest album to play at parties and share with my friends of tamer musical tastes, and this one obviously wasn't going to be it.  <br />It has since become one of my favorites.  If you can completely tune out the cartoonish lyrics and song titles, it is a great slab of metal, an excellent recapturing of the band's past glories, and an appropriate swan song to the Rob Halford era (he'll be back, trust me).  It is not without its duds, in fact I think the lead-off single \\"Painkiller\\" has a pretty weak chorus after building up with great drums and guitars.  \\"Metal Meltdown\\" is only marginally better, don't know why that one was selected for \\"Metal Works `73-`93\\".  Everything else sounds great, Halford's voice is pristine as always, and the production by newcomer Chris Tsangarides adds a new dimension after so many years with Tom Allom at the board.<br />Recommended cuts -\\"A Touch of Evil\\" (basically a reworking of \\"Night Comes Down\\" from \\"Defenders\\"), \\"One Shot At Glory\\", \\"Between The Hammer &amp; The Anvil\\", \\"All Guns Blazing\\", and \\"Hell Patrol\\".
B000002H72|5.0|If you are a Pixies fan and don't give this album Five stars you obvious should be killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey. This album is pure genuis. From the cool guitar in 'debaser' and Blacks screeching voice in 'Tame' The poppiness of 'Here comes your man' The simpleness of 'La la love you' It is all just classic. My personal fav Pixies disc, and it is hard to pick because Suferosa has it's moments. If you like bands like Nirvana, The Toadies, Local H, you may not know it, but you like the Pixies as well. Every now a then I'll be listening to this album, and catch Cobain stealing styles. For example listen to almost any song of the second side of 'Incesticide' and you'll find Pixies influence, big time.
0060278234|5.0|This is an awsome book, that wonderfully followed the first one with a keep you on your toes adventure. A wonderful story, about a young clare with no sight, a prince on a rescue mission for his friend, and his skeptical friend from Ancelstierre. If you read the first one the secound is a perfect follow-up, and I'm very much looking forward to the third.
B000006MS3|5.0|This album is remarkable - it is full of anger and passion. It can also be a frightening experience to listen to. Drums feature heavily on this album and so does Kate's many amazing voices. Her voice is remarkable and exudes such confidence and range. She screams, whispers, sings backwards and then can sing like a Diva. This is Kate Bush's first solo production and it still sounds remarkable. There are some songs that can break your heart &quot;All The Love&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot;, which contains the line &quot;with a kiss I'd pass a key&quot;. Brillant! There is also the distrubing &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; where Kate screams in rage and fear. The song has a memorable ending (you have to buy it to know what I mean). Kate also gets involved with Irish music &quot;Night of The Swallow&quot; and her opus &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, a song about the plight of Aborigines. Fantastic! Other themes include rape, being involved in a bank robbery, and the elusive journey of finding truth and understanding. This is another Kate album that has been overshadowed by the grandeur of &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;. This album was not a commercial album. Kate took control over her career and music during this time, and she has never looked back!
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger might be a book that you've always heard about and never settled down to the actual joy of reading it. Now is a good time. It's fairly short weighing in at 123 pages but the awesome power of Camus' artistry is that he accomplishes exactly what he wants efficently. It is the story of Monsieur Meursault, an office worker in his 30's whose mother has just passed away. As the book opens he is travelling to the nursing home where she died. Much has been said of the coldness of the character but he feels guilt about his mother. Throughout the novel there are hints that he believes he killed his mother by putting her there. Meursault seems to have lost his connection with humanity. He behaves more like an automaton that a man. He goes to work, he makes friends, he has sex, but he does these things on automatic pilot. Who knows why he kills the stranger on the beach? Meursault would probably say &quot;what difference did it make if I killed him or not?&quot; Good and evil have become irrelevant to him. I do not see why on the back of the novel and in some reviews I have read it is said that he is drawn UNWITTINGLY into a senseless murder. I believe he did it to wake himself up from the big sleep he had sunk into. If he killed a man, it would prove he had an effect upon the world. He could wipe out a life. In these days when we have to put up with OJ and Timoty McVeigh, the trial scenes written in 1946 seem very prophetic of times to come. The lawyers are more interested in appearances and drama than they are in prosecuting or defending the accused. All you would have to do is include TV cameras in the courtroom scenes and substitute lethal injection for the guillotine and this novel couldve have been written in 2001. It would still have the haunting power. It is a beautiful book. I don't know if its one of the greatest ever, but it is great. One of the other disturbing images in here is an old man that lives in Meursault's building who owns this mangy looking mutt that he is always beating and cussing at. When the dog disappears the old man loses all purpose in his life. In his own way, he was showing love for the dog by torturing it. It's just another way of showing the lies we invent to hide the truth from ourselves. I think Meursault was the biggest liar of all. Brillant translation.
B000002UA7|5.0|This album is essential in anyone's record collection. Kate was alternative even before alternative became marketable. She has her own style and is often copied. She is an original. This album contains many of her singles up until 1986. This album includes a powerful new vocal of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, the mad percussion of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; - one of the best singles ever. Every track is fantastic and musically varied. Kate is an ambitious artist who involves herself in her work completely. From the writing, production, backing vocals and keyboards. A Kate Bush recording is a Kate Bush recording.
B000002J1O|5.0|What an album, what an album. Masterpiece. This CD, with music released originally in 1973, is pure delight, GENESIS at top notch form !! Everyone here sounds amazing, production is great. And to think this same band (without Peter Gabriel) would release things like &quot;INVISIBLE TOUCH&quot; ....
B000002U9E|5.0|I first bought &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; as a twelve year old. This album changed the way I listened to music forever. All these years later, this album still remains my favourite. There are so many layers to this album. From beautiful harmonies, weird backing vocals and strong imagery conveyed perfectly with Kate's unique voice and original songwriting.The first five songs deal about love and understanding. The songs are written in an unorthodox way, but are able to penetrate deeply - making you feel the joys and fears of love. From &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; to &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; to the title track. &quot;The Big Sky&quot; is one of my all time favourites - Kate's many voices are extraordinary. The line &quot;you never understood me -you never really tried&quot; almost reflects the relationship between Kate and the media. &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; is eerie, where Kate sings &quot;mother hides the murderer&quot;. The next seven songs is probably the most ambitious thing Kate has ever done - her concept piece &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; deals with the thoughts of a woman drowning. Her past, present and future flash before her eyes, as she tries to come to terms with her mortality. Musically and lyrically it is extraordinary. This album is testament to Kate's continual influence in pop music. Because she is not a prolific artist, some people tend to forget of her importance in pop music.
B00000BKDW|5.0|I'm one of those old Maiden fans who keeps remembering the old days of POWERSLAVE, PIECE OF MIND, SEVENTH SON ... That was before the &quot;dark days&quot; of things like &quot;NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING&quot; and &quot;VIRTUAL XI&quot;... This POWERSLAVE is fantastic, eight great tunes ( some better than others ), the band in top notch form, going for it with impressive will and desire. IT's a role model for metal.
B00004X01U|2.0|Madonna can do better. With &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, the heavily underrated &quot;Erotica&quot; and parts of &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna showed some real depth in her music and songwriting. I was waiting for a masterpiece and then &quot;Music&quot; arrived.<br />This is the first Madonna album that does not contain lyric inserts. And no wonder! The album is lyrically trite (&quot;I like to singy singy singy/like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy&quot;), and musically sounds dated. The overuse of voice decoders add to the antiquity of the album.<br />Not all is entire gloom. There are some good moments. The title track is catchy and humourous, &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; are little pop gems. <br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is a real big faux pas. Nothing more said!<br />&quot;Music&quot; seems like a conscious effort to tackle the pop queens of the day. In this respect it fails. Madonna is exceptionally talented, and can write some beautiful songs (&quot;Oh Father&quot; is testament to this talent). In this album she has sacrificed lyric content with dated dance sounds. Perhaps Madonna could of used Norman Cook of Fatboy Slim fame, to create some atmospheric dance vibes. <br />Waiting for the next studio album.
B00003CXE7|5.0|If your looking for an unbelievable emotional action/drama movie that lights up the screen and leaves your cheering for more, then Gladitor is the movie for you. Gladiator, in my opinion, is without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen. It has everything you want in a movie, a wonderful cast, big action scenes, and a kind of drama that leaves you with emotions you've never felt before in a movie. The main character, Maximus, (played by Russle Crowe),is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an empire. Enough said. Russle Crowe gives an absolutely outstanding performance, he makes you believe and feel everything Maximus goes through in the film. The DVD is of this movie is awesome. Its loaded with tons of extras and is the best sounding DVD yet, with both dolby and DTS! Everyone must own this DVD, even if you dont have a DVD player, go out and buy one just for this movie! You wont be sorry! This movie rocks! The best movie ever!
630460288X|4.0|I like this movie for a variety of reasons: 1) The &quot;be well&quot; future is just prime for some great one liners. 2) The action sequences aren't the usual &quot;Bad guys 1&amp;2, approach the hero one at a time and get kicked in the head. Bad guys 3-7, stand there looking stupid.&quot; 3) The plot is original. A LOT of action movies lately have been one of maybe three or four formulaic plots (bad guy with a nuke, rescue your illegitimate son, etc..) 4) Denis Leary. I love his sarcasm and thought he was great in the role of Edgar Friendly. This movie is great for the price, it's on TV so little now you really have to own it if you want to watch it. This text refers to the DVD version.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|During the summer of 2000 (while stationed in Germany with the army),I heard a hauntingly beautiful yet melancholic song entitled &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;. Imagine my surprise when I learned that it was A-ha. I immediately went out and bought the CD &quot;Minor earth major sky&quot;. Now more than a year later, I have not stopped listening to this album.<br />I have been a fan of A-ha since my high school days and was quite pleased to hear them return in such fine form. &quot;Minor earth major sky&quot; is not only their best overall album but one of the finest albums I have heard in recent years.<br />Other reviewers have broken down each individual track so I will avoid doing the same. Suffice it to say, In the age of &quot;Boy bands&quot; and bubble gum music, it's quite refreshing to hear such a finely crafted album that is full of melodic and haunting melodies and mature lyrics(their best ever). Highlights for me are the title track, &quot;Summer moved on&quot;, &quot;The sun never shone that day&quot;,&quot;I thought that it was you&quot;, and &quot;You'll never get over me&quot;.<br />It's a shame that most of the people in the US will never hear this album. I cannot recommend it enough! Buy it! Cherish It!
B000002KBA|5.0|I came upon the Deep Purple saga some time around the time of the 'Black Night' or 'Fireball' singles.  (I was only 10 or 11.)  'Machine Head' was the first LP I ever owned, and boy, did it get worn out.  But I haven't quite worked out why it took me until last year to get into 'In Rock'.<br />There were copies of 'In Rock' floating around at the boarding school I attended.  Bruce Dickinson, who went on to front Iron Maiden, was in the same year, and he owned a dog-eared, secondhand copy.  Goodness knows how he earned the nickname 'Gunge', but it's fascinating to trawl through the Amazon reviews which spot the linkage between 'In Rock' and Iron Maiden.<br />And speaking of linkages, one of my favourite driving albums of all time is Golden Earring's 'Moontan' (1973) -- the one with 'Radar Love' on it.  I'll enjoy the album slightly less now I know 'Flight of the Rat' on 'In Rock', because the Earring's 'Big Tree, Blue Sea' is so clearly a derivative.<br />For me the stand-out track is 'Living Wreck' -- I just love the clear guitar riff, the echo on the drum sound recorded in the vast studio in Portland Place, and the wonderful soloing between Lord and Blackmore.  Lord's organ was always one of the most intriguing aspects of Deep Purple -- until you splashed out on a reasonable hi-fi, it was often hard to tell whether you were listening to a guitar solo or an organ solo.  With the range of keyboard voices so limited in those pre-synth, pre-sampler days, it was left to the ingenuity of the band to decide how to keep a full-time organist busy.  In Van Der Graaf Generator and Atomic Rooster, the organist (respectively Hugh Banton and Vince Crane) often provided the bass through pedals.  In Deep Purple, ELP and Atomic Rooster (again), the organist was also the band's leader and he would also insert himself not just as chief soloist but also as the carrier of the riff.<br />'In Rock' is a must-have for historians of heavy rock.  The only question is which version to get -- this or the remastered 25th anniversary edition.  The latter undoubtedly has a clearer sound and highly informative sleevenotes.  But don't worry too much about the extra tracks which are fairly dispensable.<br />This is not music to work to.  It has to be played loud.  Forget yourself and your responsibilities.  Transport yourself back to your own teenage years and enjoy yourself, until your own children come and complain about the noise.-- this or the remastered 25th anniversary edition.  The latter undoubtedly has a clearer sound and highly informative sleevenotes.  But don't worry too much about the extra tracks which are fairly dispensable.<br />This is not music to work to.  It has to be played loud.  Forget yourself and your responsibilities.  Transport yourself back to your own teenage years and enjoy yourself, until your own children come and complain about the noise.
0679721037|4.0|i had originally expected this to be another cookie cutter books about what had happened and why we should all feel sorry and the like. what surprised me later on as i got on in reading it was that had one been not yet informed on the unlikely event of august 6, 1945, one might think it to be a rather compelling fiction story. it was much akin to Night and The Grapes of Wrath in that it told a story about something often taken for granted. one thing is for certain though; read this before you go out and see pearl harbor. it puts nonbiased views better in place.
0452281881|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in recent times. Like many of the other reviewers, I was wary of the fact that the book is written entirely as a series of inter-company e-mails. However, Beaumont pulls it off fantastically.<br />The key element to the humor is the duplicitous nature of the main characters. In the personal e-mails to each other, we see what they really think, and in the business e-mails, and to contrast, the business e-mails are all brown-nosing and have the forced quality of many official e-mails.<br />There also several running jokes, such as the agency president's e-mails getting diverted to the Finnish office, and the many amorous liaisons among the underlings.<br />What I found surprising that Beaumont was able to flesh out the characters so well. Every one of the characters has a unique voice and as the book progressed, I found myself cheering when something bad happened to Simon, the conniving creative director.<br />I whole-heartedly recommend this book to all.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This outstanding film makes a good follow-up to FAIL-SAFE which came out at the same time, looking at a very similar scenario but in a chilling, dramatic fashion. Of course, if you're a masochist, you could view this first.<br />    Highly recommended, chock full of great lines, hopefully the deleted &quot;pie fight&quot; sequence will surface some day.
6302759110|3.0|This movie is for many, i believe, an aquired taste. The bizzare speedy camera shots and episodic surrealist images may seem too strange, what to speak of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder's accents. But even they grow on you after a while. Watching it a few times over, i began to see a clearer vision of what the director and screen writer had in mind. Despite a plot, the movie is held togeather by the intense love between Dracula and Mina (in the movie, his reincarnated wife from 400 yrs. earlier). Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are the cream of the crop here, Hopkins as the excentric, yet practical Dr. Van Helsing, and Oldman, of course, as the perfect forlorned and despairing Dracula. <br />Winona Ryder has a talent for playing sensitive period piece women who have inner strength they may never realize, and Keanu Reeves is underrated no matter what he does.
0312979479|5.0|Very few books have kept my attention the way this book did.
0061020680|5.0|A great novel about death and other aspects of life, with wonderful, intelligent view of one of my favourite authors. Here, the taboo of death is treated with a deep satiric but rather genial way. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone who wish to enjoy life and genius.
6302860253|5.0|I bought this tape when it first came out and have watched it many, many times since then.  Even saw it on the big screen at Hollywood's Egyptian theater last year with LA Opera League and a lengthy in person interview with Julia (who is really funny, intelligent and charming!).  I've seen Domingo perform it on stage many times and also have seen Julia perform in person.  She is a wonderful actress with a small but lovely voice and her technique makes the best of her instrument - she's at her best in this video.  Domingo is still the standard for Don Jose and \\"The Flower Song\\" in this video is just thrilling!  Of all the videos of Carmen, including live productions, this is my favorite.  It is not without flaws, of course, but overall, the setting of Ronda and performances of a quality cast are superior to other videos of Carmen. I love it and most of my opera friends do too!  (Compare videos to CD's, even laser disc/DVD? apples vs. oranges.) The CD of this is just fine also, but there are many other CD's which are also excellent if not better; not so with video.  This is a keeper until a better one is filmed.<BR>I bought the DVD and was disappointed in the cuts!!!!  The intermezzo is totally gone!  I guess they wanted to get in on one disc instead of two due to the length of the opera.  Therefore, I give the DVD only 4 stars and recommend the VHS version instead!  Great film to get newbies into opera.  I still love this film and watch it often on VHS!  Why do they always go for the cheap?  So many opera DVD's don't include casts, background, story, or subtitles....This is still one to buy in 2004!
B000053VAF|1.0|I think that's the biggest beef I have with this movie - that some actually think it's \\"intelligent\\"! How far we have fallen ...<br />Is it blasphemous? Not really ... it's too puerile in its pretensions to be blasphemous, because it ends up taking shots at an unrecognizable form of Catholicism. Monty Python, while hilarious, makes the same mistake - they've ignored Homer Simpson's \\"it's funny because it's true.\\" The best humor and satire work because they things they parody and attach are represented somewhat accurately. \\"Dogma\\" spoofs a \\"straw God\\" - a God of their own invention. And falls flat.<br />Is it funny? There are a couple of funny bits, but otherwise it's actually quite lame in scripting and pace. I enjoy a good satire as much as the next guy (\\"Life of Brian\\" comes to mind, although again saddled with its confused theology. But whereas Python is enjoyable because of their silliness, \\"Dogma\\" limps because it's just stupid and shows a non-understanding of the subject matter.) \\"Clerks\\" is infinitely better in these areas. (Warning for those who haven't watched it: \\"Clerks\\" is funny but quite vulgar.) Affleck and Damon are good at delivering what passes for sophistry these days, but the heroine, Bethany, is flat, lifeless, monotonic, and sardonic. Almost as if she didn't realize the camera was rolling and it was time to act. Chris Rock suffers through awful lines. Rickman is somewhat fun, although his lines suffer from the movie's childish theology.<br />Is it parody? Satire? People, it's just not intelligent enough for either. Unless \\"Can God make a rock to heavy for Himself to lift\\" is the extent of your idea of intelligent philosophizing.<br />As for charges that the Catholic Church slept throught the Holocaust - perhaps *reading* (since we're at Amazon, after all) some actual history will prevent such tired falsehoods from showing up in scripts in the future. Wasn't a Pope honored by the Jewish people for saving Jews? Seems to ring a bell...
0618135871|4.0|As with all (or recent) Philip Roth novels, this struggles somewhat to avoid identification. It is like a beast caught within a sack half its size. You try to hold it - you want to keep it within the sack after all - but you quickly realise that whatever you do - however much you slam the sack against a wall or attempt to keep your hands together around the lip of the bag - sooner or later, the thing in the bag will get out and then where will you be?<br />The beast metaphor is sort of apposite too. In the opening maybe thirty pages, the beast is a snake. It comes as something of a shock after the last three novels (the collossal genius of &quot;American Pastoral&quot;, &quot;I married a Communist&quot; and &quot;The Human Stain&quot;), all voiced by the (now) retiring Nathan Zuckerman, to hear David Kepesh. Salty snake-like David Kepesh. The first thirty pages (at least) slip round you in a way that makes you shudder. The words are oily. Naked with a dirty kind of honesty, sexual flagrancy. You don't like David Kepesh. He is a vulgar erudite snake. He is a sexual predator. He is a kind of celebrity (in the way that, say Frasier Crane is a celebrity), regularly appearing on a Sunday morning culture programme on the TV.  We know David Kepesh. We have met him before, in &quot;The Breast&quot; and &quot;The Professor of Desire&quot;. <br />And yet and yet.<br />He has an affair (only the latest in a long line but different and dictinct for all that) with a young student Consuela Castillo, a girl who does not understand art (who questions her relationship to Picasso, for example, in a way that suggests she puts too much thought into what she perceives, and how she is perceived). Unlike his countless previous conquests, though, Consuela unseats Kepesh and leaves him floundering. He is riven with jealousy. He wants to possess her in a way she has never been possessed before. He dissects the position of dominance within their relationship: yes, he is dominant, because he is 62 years old and knows more than her, but, at the same time, she is dominant because she is young and beautiful: the relationship is described by Roth as a &quot;braid&quot;, and the braid - when mentioned - remains with you throughout the first reading. <br />To combat this reliance, he takes up with another former student, a student he had an affair with years before who he meets by accident one day. Kepesh also ruminates upon his relationship with the son that hates him and blames him for the way that life has turned out. <br />Still, the affair with Consuela continues, only to be abandoned over something and nothing. Kepesh admits that it takes him three years to get over her. Three years to get out of the desperate need for her, the reliance upon the habit of her. There is a sense of Kepesh, within the pages of this short book, as a man keenly aware of loneliness, wanting company every second of his life, whilst at the same time desperate to be free of any kind of emotional shackles. David Kepesh is a twenty five year old (not wanting to settle down, not wanting to be lonely) in the body of a seventy year old. <br />What is important - and what slips within your reading alongside the braid of dominance - is the title. As with &quot;The Human Stain&quot; the title offers as much in the way of a challenge as the actual book. It's called &quot;The Dying Animal&quot; after all.  Just who is the dying animal? The most obvious choice would be Consuela, who phones Kepesh on New Year's Eve, 1999 (over three years after the end of their affair) to tell him that she may be dying. At the same time, however, the animal is Kepesh, giving into that braid of dominance once more. You can extrapolate further: the dying animal is sexuality, a certain kind of sexuality, a certain kind of masculinity. All these readings braid together, twisting and turning with the reality of smoke or fog.<br />As ever, it is a compelling ride. As ever, even in a short book, you can't help but feel cowed by the enormity of a person's talent. As ever, there are parts of the book that appal you - but that feeling, that being appalled, is part of what makes reading Roth novels so exhilerating. As ever, the specific becomes magnified. As ever, you can only read and re-read and over-read and over-complicate, and succeed in complicating and confusing the story. As ever, this is a story. To be enjoyed and shocked by. To be exhilerated by. As ever, once finished, you can but look to what comes next.
0767803434|4.0|... to be an American! (No matter where you're from.)<br />Terrorists hijack Air Force One. Harrison Ford is President. Take it from there.<br />A well-paced thriller, with characters - good and bad - having more than one dimension. Moments of ruthless cruelty - and moments of extraordinary courage and valor.
0385501560|3.0|Blame &quot;Fight Club&quot;. The movie and the book. Blame &quot;Survivor&quot; (the book, not the TV show). You see. Chuck Palahniuk has set himself up. He only has himself to blame. You go write two blazing, incendiary novels, people have expectations. Every novel has to be blazing and incendiary. More than that: each successive novel has to be more blazing and more incendiary than the one that preceded it. The conclusion I reached - ooh, about midway through &quot;Choke&quot; - was that, whilst making for a better read than (the unholy mess that was) &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot;, &quot;Choke&quot; is not quite as good as &quot;Survivor&quot;. Or rather, &quot;Choke&quot; is only as good as &quot;Survivor&quot; and - now that he has a back catalogue, as it were - it is time to raise the bar somewhat. <br />Which isn't really very fair, I know. Because &quot;Choke&quot; is a great book. A messy (but in a good way), diffuse look at what is rapidly coming to be a Palahniuk type (itself another problem: the narrators of his novels, be they men or women, are all the same voice): the post-outsider. Because Palahniuk's narrators are not just your average outsiders. They are former Cult members like &quot;Survivor&quot;'s Tender Branson, or models without a jaw like whatever the name of the character in &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot; was. Victor Mancini (the star of this particular fable) has a mother who used to be a sort of outlaw and is now dying from Alzheimers. To raise the money to keep her in a care home, he chokes on food each night in restaurants, safe in the knowledge that whoever saves him will inevitably feel beholden to him, for making them a hero. They send money. He pays bills. Victor is also a sex addict. He attends regular meetings (are you thinking &quot;Fight Club&quot;? me too) of sex addicts (except where they go to follow a twelve step programme, Victor goes to take notes).  What else, what else? Well, he works in a theme park that seeks to recreate the educational aspects of 1734. Everybody who works there is on some kind of unprescripted medication. He has a sort of a romance going with his mother's doctor. His friend Denny collects rocks. Just your average collection of fruit loops and start-of-the-century madmen then.<br />And of course it is all hugely enjoyable. A kind of romp. A Palahniuk romp. It's just that we've had Palahniuk romps now. It's time for a new trick. Because if, as every Tom, Jick and Harry contend, he is the new Don DeLillo, the new Bret Easton Ellis, the new whatever, it is time he set himself a challenge, it is time he sent himself a bomb wrapped in brown paper through the post, it is time he gave us Palahniuk's &quot;Underworld&quot; or &quot;Glamarama&quot; or whatever.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Like many people, I did not discover what by many is considered the greatest rock &amp; roll album of all-time until the Beach Boys had passed into the 'Nostalgia Oldies' genre...what a tremendous loss for me.  I had heard for years about what a masterpiece this record was, and to be frank, I only thought that music written by Beethoven and Mozart could earn that status--boy was I WRONG.  Brian Wilson, one of the strangest songwriters of our time, has penned something truly magical.  When someone like Paul McCartney says that this is his favorite album of all-time, that certainly says a LOT.<br />As many before have noted, there are many reasons why 'Pet Sounds' is great, in fact, there are as many different reasons as there are different types of people, but there is one thing that we ALL agree on:  This album is truly a phenomenon unto itself.  Almost nothing compares to it (all serious music lovers will understand and agree) and comparing 'Sgt. Pepper' (another great album--but also the most overrated Beatles' album) to 'Pet Sounds' is kinda like comparing the first World War to the Gulf War...they were as different as can possibly be.<br />I in particular enjoyed both versions of these songs.  Many wonder why they were originally recorded in Mono when Stereo was widely considered the way to go...Brian Wilson was virtually deaf in one ear, so he couldn't even HEAR it stereo, and therefore concentrated on the minor details, the things which really made his production superior to virtually everybody in the recording business.  In short, there is almost nothing I could add to what has already been said about this musical masterpiece.  Anyone who truly appreciates music and does NOT go into listening to 'Pet Sounds' expecting to hear a bunch of 'Surf Tunes' will be surprisingly disappointed--at FIRST.  After a few listens however, the true genius behind this audio treasure will begin to show itself...and the more you listen, the more you appreciate.  In other words, buy, open, listen and enjoy.  Repeat.s, buy, open, listen and enjoy.  Repeat.
0553573403|5.0|This book is awesome. Simply put, there are very few books I have ever read that are better than this. Having only read the first book in the series, it may be too soon to compare it to Tolkien, but it definetly seems poised to reach that level. Martin writes his characters incredibily realistically, they act and behave just as they should. One of my main complaints against a series such as Jordan's &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; is the fact that he never seems to take any risks, I was never shocked in the least, because he made it clear early on that nothing was going to happen to his precious characters. Martin writes smart, his characters lie, betray, murder, as many would in the positions they are placed in. I loved the character Tyrion, of the house Lannister (AKA the imp). Hated by his father for being misfigured, and having a soft spot in his heart for those similar to him, always speaking what comes into his incredibly sharp mind; im still not sure which side he's on.<br /> I also liked how Martin chose to not have just one pov, he switches between characters (and thus pov) every chapter, similar to what Jordan does, but slightly different. It keeps things fresh, and moving. In doing this he is able to skip the &quot;down time&quot; that isn't worth writing about.<br />In the end, anyone who loves fantasy, nay anyone who loves good literature will love this book. Don't be scared off by the fact that it's labeled fantasy (for those of you that dislike fantasy), because while it has many fantasy elements it's something much more than that. Martin has succeded in what I fell is quite possibly the hardest task for an author, creating a living, breathing world. If you can tell me his world is not alive, I will tell you that you have never read this book. with richly detailed characters, an extensive back history, and the inevitibility of the fact that &quot;winter is coming&quot; make this a phenomenal read, and i would tell anybody that. Very Highly Recommended
B00000G3Q4|4.0|Five college students spending a weekend at a cabin in the Tennesse woods accidentally revive demons who possess their bodies.This low budget wonder isnt much in the plot department but it features lots of inventive energetic camera work and plently of hysterically gruesome special effects.Most of the violence is committed against unfeeling demons so its not hard to take.Though a sequence in which a women is molested by a tree is in poor taste!
B00004XQP4|5.0|With their sixth studio release, Green Day has shown a more mature side to themselves. There is a reason that there are no songs like &quot;Longview&quot; or &quot;Basketcase&quot; on this recording: Billie Joe and the guys have grown up. While this may upset some people, I feel that a true testament to the quality of a band is how they grow over the years. I have every Green Day album and while this one strays from any they have done, I think in its own right, it is fantastic. If you truly listen to the message the songs convey, you will understand that the band has been through a lot, and unlike a lot of bands today, Green Day has survived. I hope the band keeps expanding their horizons and I am looking forward to many more Green Day albums.
0399226907|5.0|My 2 year old son LOVES this book. Although I am tired of it (ha Ha) he will have us read it to him 5 times in a row. Definitely an excellent book for toddlers.
0671024256|5.0|I wish I had read Stephen King 20 years earlier. I'd be a much better writer.  His explanation of a passive sentence is something I've been looking for all my life.   The way he explains everyone can understand.  Of course, as he'll probably tell you, he would not have the time or the inclination to write a book on writing 20 year ago.<br />I`ve been reading King's On Writing all morning. I believe that I got more out a morning reading than I would have in week's classes in professional writing.  Stephen King is more than a good writer he is a brilliant writer who loves his work. His explanation and examples of a passive sentence is the best I've ever read.<br />I am going to read some of Stephen King's book that I missed because I was too busy reading the types of book that I like more-the psychological suspense novel.  Besides I read what is available and a good friend has been loaning me a fairly heave load of reading lately.  You guessed it, psychological suspense novels.  I have been looking over the books that Mr. King thought enough of to put on his list of readables.  I am happy to say that I have enjoyed most of them.<br />I am glad that he had writing to get him through the post accident experience, he had a really bad incident, which will be with him forever.
B00005B36H|3.0|**REVISED** I listened to this album for a few years since my original review and while I will still only give it 3 out of 5 stars for being less edgy than I appreciated in their original albums I still liked it.  If your a TOOL fan there is not a lot to choose from as they tend to put albums out once every 7 or 8 years.  Worth the buy for sure.
B000002J29|5.0|I had the amazingly good fortune to witness Genesis on the tour that SO was recorded from.  I have owned the album, cassette, and CD of SO, and every time I listen to it the memories come flooding back. Other reviewers have commented on the power of Suppers Ready on this recording and I can only add that it is worthy of any superlatives that you can think of.  Collins' emotion and passion are no more evident than in the closing section - New Jerulsalem.  I can tell you that when that song ended live the entire audience sat silently for at least a minute in stunned awe. The rest of SO is worthy of almost as much praise.  Carpet Crawlers is better live than on Lamb, and listening to Steve Hacket on Firth, well, just get it, crank it, and close your eyes.
0792843584|4.0|This is truly a remarkable movie. Far underrated and dismissed due to the hubbub over the cost and Cimino's behavior during filming. Heavens Gate is visually stunning, a marvel of period work with rich detail and texture. It is a bit long at times and the DVD version looks and sounds far superior to the VHS version. However I noticed there are no subtitles in the DVD version when the immigrants speak. Has anyone else noticed this? If this is a fault of MGM it is a major gaff and allows much dialog to be missed. Anyway, a movie much better that most of the reviews, and a must see for any film buff.
0446677450|2.0|Frankly, this is a very poorly written book.  I suppose the lessons about money were instructive -- to a degree.  I think they were reasonably well illustrated, but talk about beating a dead horse.<br />Granted the purpose of this book is not to shake up the literature scene, but to talk about peoples' attitudes about money and how irrational they can be.  To the degree it does that, the book is worth reading.<br />The thing is, the package ain't pretty.  Having to read through the &quot;narrative&quot; is quite painful, if not completely uninteresting.
B00003CX95|5.0|Military conflicts are my interests, so that was the reason i picked this up and as soon as i watched the first battle i was hooked to this movie. The ferocity of medevil warfare always interests me from the weapons to the battles that ensued and this film was the closest at showing what war was like back then. Some of the scenes i saw in this movie made me squirm a bit. This movies battles is the equilivant of Saving Private Ryans which is pretty grusome. Highly recommended for war fanatics.
B000002AHC|5.0|A wonderful masterpiece, still holds up well, and &quot;Goin'Back&quot;, still brings a tear to the eyes. Kicking back by the pool, a couple weeks back, sippin' adult beverages with a couple of late 40's buddies, listening to this on the boom box, nobody said a word. Everybody listening closely. You don't see that much anymore.
B00004U0OQ|5.0|This Cd is the Best! The songs are all awsome and the cool audio clips from old horror movies makes the music even better. The best one of whole bunch is More Human Than Human. Too bad they disbanded, but then again Rob Zombie is even better Solo. Check out Hellbilly Deluxe!
B000021Y74|5.0|This is an awsome german flick with an even better soundtrack. a real independent film favourite, the best way to describe it is this: Pulp Fiction meets Trainspotting meets Groundhog Day. You get the action of Pulp Fiction, the sound and feel of Trainspotting, and the daily reliving of Ground Hog Day. Great movie and a welcome change from the regular list of choices.

0140277447|1.0|It goes without saying that in the Pacific theatre of WWII, both the Japanese and Americans committed despicable atrocities. I agree absolutely that the Japanese' systematic medical experimentation on POWs and raping of tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese women is separated from the evils of Nazi Germany only by an order of magnitude or two. But the Americans were hardly saints: besides the mobilization of Japanese-Americans into concentration camps, the nuclear bombing of two civilian cities on the eve of the Japanese surrender was entirely unjustified (if you think that the nuclear bombings were necessary to forestall an invasion, I highly recommend Gar Alperovitz's &quot;The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb&quot; to dispel your delusions). Nonetheless, as an American who has spent a year in China, I'll be frank in admitting my bias against the Japanese side in interpreting the events of WWII  Reading or watching depcitions of the Rape of Nanjing (The HK-produced movie &quot;Nanking 1941&quot; was a particularly engrossing dramatization) viscerally disgust and anger me.<br />All of that being said, I find it a terrible shame that this amatuerishly written, poorly researched book has become the definitive word on the subject. While Chang's description of some of the gruesome details of the Rape of Nanjing were riveting (how groups of Japanese generals would go around having contests seeing who could decapitate the most civilians, the use of POWs as live bayonet practice, the sheer number of rapes), nonetheless she clearly lacks a full understanding of the broader historical or cultural background underlying this 'incident.' Chang would have benefited from taking an intro level class on modern Asian history at a local community college before starting to write this book. For a more nuanced take on early 20th century Japanese history, you would do better to ignore her one paragraph summary and look it up in Grolier's encyclopedia. While she was not aiming to writea dense footnote-laden tome for an academic audience, the popular audience nonetheless deserves more than context than the pitiful scraps that she offers. <br />Her coverage of the Japanese denial is only marginally better. Indeed, the erasing of historical memory in the 20th century by both the Japanese and Chinese (ahem... June 4, 1989) is another tragedy in itself. It is frustrating to see all the effort being put into preserving the memory of the Holocaust, while Japan publishes history textbooks that don't even mention 'comfort women.' Still, her insistence on calling the Japanese government's head-in-the sand denial that these events ever took place as &quot;the second rape of Nanjing&quot; is utterly maudlin. It is more fitting of a Lifetime movie than a history book.
B00002EPJH|5.0|I know little -- perhaps next to nothing -- about jazz (or anything beyond Top 40 for that matter), and was given this CD by a dear friend.  I have rarely been so moved by a piece of music; the tenderness and delicacy of each track, particularly Blame It On My Youth and I Loves You Porgy, are well-nigh overwhelming, if you let them in.  This CD enriched my life, period.  If you're coming at jazz or the &quot;quality music&quot; thing from anywhere near my beginner's perspective, I recommend that you buy it.  It's a good start, and I'm grateful I discovered it.
B00000I3JD|5.0|This CD is magical, the lyrics are deep. I've been a Lauryn Hill fan from the way back days of the Fugees and she's simply AWESOME. It's no surprise she nabbed 5 Grammys from this album, her first solo. This represents what good music should be, just buy it and listen to it's magic!!! To say the truth, this album deserves 10 stars!!! Lauryn, I thank God for your life and inspiration, keep up the good work!!!
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the greatest album that I have heard in years! This concept ablum is an absolute amazement! The albums starts off with a spoken part by the character of the Hypnotherapist, leading into an accoustic guitar part with vocals. Then right into \\"Scene Two,\\" starting off with an instrumental overture that is just amazing. The mix between guitars, keyborads and drums is incredible. \\"Strange Deja Vu\\" continues with a basic narration by Nicholas that gets the main ideas of the story down. The music just blows me away here, too, including the starting guitar riff, using the great augmented 4th chord.<BR>\\"Scene Three\\" starts with simple piano part and a vocal line. In \\"Fatal Tragedy,\\" the narration continues with a great riff about half-way through, doubled by the bass drum. The keyboard solo towards the end is a nice intro for Rudess' first Dream Theater album. \\"Beyond this Life,\\" which is in 5/4 for most of the piece, is a flashback narration. This probably has my favorite drum part on the album. The guitar riff is cool, too. \\"Through Her Eyes\\" is a ballad that closes out Act I. The piano and guitar work nicely to create the somber mood.<BR>\\"Home\\" is the greatest song on this album. The Eastern sound at the start is cool. The vocal harmonies are cool. The drum part is cool. The bass part is very cool. The guitar part is really cool. And the keyboard part is really, very cool. And yes, that is Victoria moaning. \\"Scene Seven\\" is another instrumental piece that features very fast and very complex parts to it. Try to pick out \\"George of the Jungle\\" in the bass part. \\"One Last Time\\" is a good piece, too. \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is a great power ballad. The guitar work at the end is wonderful. \\"Finally Free\\" closes the piece, ending with the sounds of a record scratch and static. Just amazing.
B00000JCOV|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this album, but then I realized it was a very good, nearly great record.  The range of Corey Taylor's voice, and the many sounds provided by the band make this one of the best nu metal albums around, I do like when taylor gets melodic and even does more of the rap/rock thing.  Id like to see more of that, to compliment theyre trademark brutally hard vocals on the next album &quot;Iowa.&quot;
B0000033OZ|5.0|ELP's first release starts with a giant leap right into the world of progressive rock. &quot;The Barbarian,&quot; although not adressed on the album, is an adaption of Bartok's &quot;Allegro Barbaro.&quot; All three musicians recieved writing credits on this piece.<BR> &quot;Take a Pebble&quot; was a piece the Lake wrote before joining ELP. It was not recorded, however, since he felt that he needed a different sound to it. Emerson was able to produce that sound with his piano work on this piece. The song also has an acoustic guitar solo by Lake, one of the few guitar solos that ELP will have before focusing on being solely keyboard-led.<BR> With the help of one of their roadies, Emerson and Lake adapt &quot;Knife Edge&quot; from Janacek's &quot;Sinfonietta,&quot; and it is a great hard-rock track.<BR> The last 3 songs feature the talents of all three players. Emerson's &quot;The Three Fates&quot; showcases his organ, piano and counterpointal writing skills. The third fate, &quot;Atropos,&quot; also has a characteristic that is common for the band: it is in 7/4 time. ELP's abuse of time signatures is one of the defining characterists of this new progressive rock genre.<BR> Palmer also gets his two cents in with &quot;Tank,&quot; written by himself and Emerson. The song features an absolutely superb drum solo, and a reworked, orchestrial version is on the &quot;Works, Vol. 1&quot; album.<BR> Lake's &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is arguably ELP's most widely known song. The ballad, which constrasts greatly with the other songs on the album, was a last minute addition to the record. Through it's radio airplay, ELP became well known. The synthesizer solo at the end of the song was the first intelligent use of a synthesizer in a popular song. Emerson, however, was not happy with the solo, since it was only his first take at it. Despite his attempts to re-record it, the solo ended up on the record. In order to get away from this &quot;pop&quot; sound and create a synth part that he was truly proud of, the next song that Emerson would write and record would be &quot;Tarkus,&quot; featured on ELP's second studio album.
0671027344|5.0|I just finished this amazing novel and had to share how much I loved it and would recommend it in a heartbeat.  The passion and emotions that Charlie feels leap out from the pages.  I would literally laugh out loud, or sit quietly, amazed, and saddened by what I had just read.  I can't recommend it enough, and good luck to whoever begins to read it..you're in for a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will make you happy and &quot;infinite&quot; in the end. READ IT. ;-)
B0000033P2|5.0|Wow. \\"Endless Enigma\\" is one of my favorite songs from Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The beginning is such a cool start. Then the organ parts with the great lyrics takes over. \\"I'm tired of hypocrite ... with tongues in their cheeks, turning their eyes as they speak.\\" Then Emerson uses the piano fugue as a bridge, which I just love. The piece finishes off with the organ part again. Overall, kick...!<BR> Greg Lake goes back to a ballad with \\"From the Beginning.\\" It's just another song that gets airplay on the radio. Also, Emerson and Lake use the honky-tonk style with \\"The Sheriff.\\" And the band arranges Copland's \\"Hoedown,\\" that is just fabulous. This creates the formula that ELP uses for their albums that really starts to create brillant results.<BR> \\"Trilogy\\" is also one of my favorite songs from ELP. It goes through different sytles, from 4/4 to 5/4 to 6/4. I just can't get enough of it. \\"Living Sin\\" is another rock song that is OK, but might be the low point on the album. The record does end on a high note, however. \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\" is another great Emerson synth piece. All I can say is, \\"Daaaaaaaaaa, daa da da da tut, ta taaaaaaaaa.\\" Just listen to the song to understand.

B000002U82|5.0|Is Pink Floyd the greatest band of all times?  Maybe, but probably not, and is Dark Side of the Moon the greatest album of all time?  No, but it's definitely close.  Without a doubt &quot;brain damage&quot; and &quot;eclipse&quot; are two of the most beautiful atmospheric songs I've ever heard, and &quot;brain damage&quot; makes a song transition right into &quot;eclipse,&quot; which I'm sure most readers of this review have heard already on the radio.  The cool thing about &quot;eclipse&quot; is the background vocals, it sounds as if Chris Cornell is doing them, obviously he's not.  The majority of this album is completely mellow and is prog-rock, with the exception of &quot;money,&quot; which is a pretty cool 70's rock song. &quot;Us and Them&quot; is another bada$$ track, it is absolutely beautiful, the song gave me the goosebumps and it puts modern day bands to shame, the saxophone on &quot;us and them&quot; adds a very loungy feeling to the song, and the keyboards add a classical feel to the song.  From start to end this album is a piece of art, and I would recommend this album to any lover of music.  For anyone who has succumbed to a lot of the brainwashing modern music has done, buy this album to remind yourself what music is all about.
0140177396|3.0|This book is a great book to read and do a project on for a LA class, mostly honors LA, 8th grade and upto HS.  What makes it so good is the fact that the plotline is interesting, even if it does get thrown away in a suprise ending, it is intresting to read about until that point.  It is short, you can read it in 1-2 days, and LA teachers love it because it is one of those novels that gets you to think 'critically'.  It's a win-win-win.  Great story for your entertainment, short if you are short on time, and gets you to think.  It actully contains some pretty heavy stuff in a little package.
6303148352|5.0|I have no clue what else to say about this movie that hasn't been said.  It's groundbreaking, entertaining, funny, scary, like Jaws genetically engineered.  Jurassic Park is one of the finest pieces of Sci-Fi ever filmed.  I remember seeing it opening day.  I was....7 or 8 years old.  And I was mesmerized by these hulking giants of 65 million years ago suddenly in the real world.  The Tyrannosaurus Rex is the definite star of this film.  She has the most kills, the most screen time of all the dinosaurs, and is just fun to watch, especially the classic scene where she saves the humans from the raptors.  This movie probably IS owned by eveyrone in America right now, and the DVD edition will make it able for future generations to experience what we all did eight years ago.  An adventure 65 million years in the making, Jurassic Park.
078322737X|5.0|Please believe me!  I was 17 during the summer of '62, and this excellent movie seems more like a dream than an actual film.  It captures the feelings, the personalities, the innocence better than any film of this type.  George Lucas' lighting and pacing throughout this wonderful film casts a surreal, dreamlike feeling.  The characters are believable, despite a cast of future all-stars.  There's the common guys like Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss, the nerds, the hoods, and the local hot-rod legend. Even Harrison Ford makes his debut as a redneck hotrodder named Bob Falfa.  McKenzie Phillips plays the typical 13-year-old.  The music soundtrack features many of the 50's and 60's great hits with a hint of reverb adding to the dreamlike atmosphere.  A poignant film, that leaves you emotionally drained at the end. Anyone who doesn't like this film must have no romance in their soul.  Stick to WWF.  This is one of the all-time greats!
6305508550|5.0|The time has come for a movie of this caliber! It should be played in all Board(bored) rooms in corporate America, projected on the billboards that clutter our highways and made a mandatory requirement of Business 101. Office politics, absurd policies, and Jennifer Aniston (sorry had to say it)make up this extraordinary farce of corporate America. Chain restaurants, sparkling clean suburbia, and traffic jams. What else can be said. To truly appreciate this movie does not require you to be an engineer or programmer, all you need is to have a mindless meaningless job and the inspiration to take matters into your own hands. Oh yeah, one thing you do need, however, is to make as many people as you can gather around the tube and watch with you.
1563896656|4.0|With many visual and textual references to other types of literature, including 19th Century American girls' lit (notably What Katy Did- one of the funniest jokes in there!), this is an immensely enjoyable adventure. Industrialised London is overbearingly Victorian and gothic, India is full of murdering heathens (very un-pc!), and men still feel the need to protect poor little women... It's a gem, but a gem that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd recommend it to anybody, including those who read extensively in all genres, and those who don't. I read it twice in 24 hours after getting it, picking up on new things each time. When's the next volume out?

0380973650|5.0|Following Neil Gaiman is like following the piper to the misty horizon. Neil is a story tailor, and what he weaves into the momentary existence of the reading experience is something made out of pure magic. I read allot of Gaiman's stories I own all of the SANDMAN books, he's STARDUST fairytale SMOKE&amp;MIRRORS and other works and I have to say that I was never disappointed when I start one of this tales of great fiction. Gaiman, in my opinion, is a great storyteller and what makes him great is the ability to convey he's message with stories that mix fact with fiction in a most bizarre and exiting way like no other author in our time. American gods is by far, he's most mature and touching work that I have read. It is dark and yet appealing, disturbing and at the same time griping. It is a story of a man and a story of a time. Like in all of he's work Gaiman uses his vast knowledge of history and other works of fiction to manipulate the world he creates into a living-breathing world, a world that can be ours if we just dare to step in. Gaiman takes us on a journey not only into he's AMERICA but into OUR OWN MINDS, our owns desires and pain, into the heart of what makes us all humans, for better or for worse. American gods is Neil Gaiman in his finest.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have been a BGs fan for over 20 years and I love their old stuff from the 60's, 70's and their excellent CD from the 90's, &quot;Still Waters.&quot;  But &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; is incredible!  I have listened to it repeatedly, raved to my friends about it, and it makes great company in the car, at home, and when I'm on the treadmill at the gym.  I LOVE the songs with Maurice as lead, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air.&quot;  Robin's strong, deep voice in &quot;She Keeps on Coming Back for More&quot; is fresh and powerful.  Barry's voice is still as magical and sexy as ever and I loved his sound in the title track, which is one of the best songs the brothers have ever written.  This CD surpassed all my expectations, but I was so sure I would love it, I ordered it before it was available.  I would travel to another country to see the BGs and I can't wait to see them in concert.  I wish the U.S. radio stations would give this CD some air time instead of always playing the same old tired pop music from the 80's and 90's.  Anyone who thinks the BGs are all about disco hasn't listened to them in the past 20 years. I also love the symbolism of the CD cover, with Barry standing already arrived (due to being 3 years older than the twins) while Robin and Maurice are walking in, with Robin just slightly ahead of Maurice, just as was the case when the twins were born, Robin about 30 minutes ahead of Maurice.  Very creative cover.
B000002UJQ|5.0|... that you don't already know about this work of art? You have to have been under a very heavy rock since 1997 not to understand the primary place in music that this album has taken. Call it &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Call it &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. I refute all comparisons.<br />What &quot;OK Computer&quot; is is transcendent, material, and important -- not in the wrong sense, the political sense, the debasing sense -- but in a deeply personal sense. If you listen, if you can shut out the jackhammer clatter of your life, the SUV adverts and the &quot;we've-gotta-have-this-out-by-Friday&quot; nonsense and the stock portfolio madness and the cell phones ringing in movie theaters and the opiates of modern life broadcast toyou 24 hoursaday 7daysaweek over200channelsfromallaroundtheglobe....<br />If you listen, it will speak to you in a way that mothers speak to children. It will educate you. It will be a window, and through that window you will be able to see your postmodern life and our postmodern society for what they are. And it can also be a door through which you might escape.
0790733226|5.0|This was my first DVD purchase, and I couldn't be happier. This is definitely one of the top five SF films of all time. I personally would place it third after 2001 and 2010, but ahead of any Star Trek or Star Wars film, as much as I enjoy them. Its strong points are its evocation of &quot;sense of wonder&quot; and intelligent treatment of a core SF theme; if you prefer action and special effects you would rank it lower. There are a lot of nice special effects here but they don't dominate the movie as in Star Wars.<br />I don't know of any other film that gives such a balanced presentation of the conflict between science and religion. My only problem was the claim that &quot;95% of the world's people believe in some sort of God&quot;, a figure which is preposterously high but goes unchallenged in the movie. Ellie (the protagonist) should have laughed at this claim rather than being cowed by it.<br />Things you should know:<br />-- This release is lean in extra features; there is no extra video included. The only substantial extras are annotated reconstruction of some special effects and three alternate audio-commentary sound tracks, one by Jodie Foster herself. For someone like me who would be entertained listening to her read a phone book, her audio commentary is a real bonus, like having her sitting there next to me explaining the movie(!)<br />-- On a standard TV the video shows in a relatively narrow band; it's in 2.35:1 format, which is as far as I know the narrowest presentation used for DVDs; it uses just slightly more than half your screen. You should not let this prevent you from buying the DVD; like me, you will *someday* get a widescreen TV, and it's still quite enjoyable on a standard TV.
B00005LB9O|4.0|There's hardly a song on the disc that doesn't stand up on its own as a glowing, shimmering pop song. Travis has a now-obvious talent for constructing songs that get into your head and don't leave. One can see why they're the hottest thing going. This is probably the most instantly accessible CD I've heard in a long time. I'm enjoying it thoroughly.<br />That said, it should be noted that those of you who come expecting Radiohead 2 will be a little put off. That level of  complexity and experimentation just isn't there, at least not yet. But Travis is a great pop band in their own right, without need of comparison, and &quot;Invisible Band&quot; is a brilliant pop record.
0451169514|5.0|Beware - this book will make you pay the price of the highly imaginative.  This is a huge book, but it's well worth the time invested.  The characters King creates are both incredibly real and heartbreakingly familiar.  These people all have one thing that makes them different from other people, that gives other kids something to pick on them and scorn them for.  However, i will be suprised if you don't recognize at least one of their traits in yourself.  IT, a supernatural being, loves the taste of terrified kids. IT has the ability to change it's shape into whatever IT's prey is most afraid of, be it a werewolf...or a doberman pinscher.  The main &quot;good guys&quot; in the story, known as the Losers Club, discovers the existence of IT and tries to kill IT.  They are aided in their struggle by another being, who remains nameless and mysterious.  This Other is never shown in the book.  Who will win? Read it and find out!<br />Fortunatley for my mental health, my house has a septic tank, not sewers (I live outside the city).  Warning: this book is addictive.  You will want to read it again and again.<br />Many people say that the movie was bad, and while it certainly was not as good as the book, it was still really good.  The only problem is that they made it WAY too short (4 hrs. instead of 8 or so) and edited out more parts than they kept.
0451167716|5.0|As a teenager who constantly looks for a means of escape from a dreadful life, when I picked up this book I read it in hopes of reading a book that had everything!  Action, romance, humor, death, and despair.  Not to mention an awesome story line. At the time of reading my mind was uncorrupted by the famous film.  I suppose because of that I can be considered lucky because I was able to devour every word from the genius Mario Puzo without relating to the events in the movie.  Anyway, the book is very exciting with plenty of action and an excellent plot line.  The characters are developed nicely from the hot-tempered Sonny to the strong, silent Michael.  With all the easily related to characters in the book you just can't help but feel excited when all of the parts come into play.  I wish we got read books like this for school!
B000002U8G|4.0|Floyd is liked or hated by millions for widely varying reasons. I believe &quot;Meddle&quot; could be an argument for both; Die-hard fans will note the origins of sounds and musical approaches that came to fruition in later (and better selling) albums. Critics of psychadelia could justifiably shrug the album off as a young band trying to find its sound.<br />Personally, I love Floyd, mainly for the fact that each of the early albums built progressively on the previous attempts. I listen to Meddle and hear a band that could have easily succeeded as a blues act, a lounge act, or a mediocre pop-music act. But that wasn't enough for them -- the first and final tracks prove that the band was interested in a deeper, more layered, and much more progressive sound than any established genre of the time could provide. No, it's not their best album in my opinion, but it is a necessary step to greater works like Animals, Dark Side, and Wish you were Here. All fans of Floyd should recognize this for what it is...an important chapter in the history of the band's one of a kind sound.<br />As a side note...Seamus is as good a blues track as you'll hear on any Clapton album. Pay close attention to the piano and harmonica work (rare in Floyd, but excellent nevertheless). It's amazing Floyd could master an American art form so convincingly, only to set it aside after a wonderful sample was recorded, setting their sights on establishing an art form of their own. This they did.
0316779237|4.0|You may recognize someone you know in at least one of the six, occasionally dark, often amusing short stories in David Sedaris' Holidays On Ice. Stories which have been brought together like wandering members of the same family at Christmastime. <br />There is the first person account of one of Macys elf-hirelings. There is the newsletter writer; a woman who puts a thinly veiled cheery holiday spin on her family's life of tragedy, horror, and despair. There is Dinah, who happens to be a whore. There is the children's' holiday pageant reviewer who brings us front and center with all of the effrontery and mercilessness of a Broadway reviewer. A Hollywood television producer delivers the sermon for a Christmas Eve service at a very rural church. Finally, there are the competitive neighbors who sacrifice more and more every season in the true holiday spirit of one-ups-man-ship.<br />You know some of these people. They scare you, they should. They also amuse you. They may even be you. The identity connections and the feeling that these tales aren't as made-up as they seem are what makes these stories so funny, and at the same time so frighteningly real.
B000002JEV|5.0|BBC Sessions, one of the few albums available allowing a glimpse into the live concert show of Zeppelin besides bootlegs. It does not have a video to accompany it like The Song Remains the Same, which possibly could enhance the feeling of it yet in my opinion a much better buy if you are looking for the true feel of a Zeppelin concert. The music flows and the improvisations make sense. On TSRtS the tour was being recorded in its final leg and the band was sure to be tired and not at its full potential in BBC Sessions you are allowed a glimpse at a fresh band excited about being on its first ever live radio appearence. These are mostly early songs with the latest tracks being ones from Led Zeppelin IV. The CD features the first ever live performance of Stairway to Heaven along with Black Dog and Going to California. It also features three different versions of Communication Breakdown and an 18 minute long Dazed and Confused. So to sum it all up BBC Sessions is a much better buy than The Song Remains the Same so if I had the choice this would be mine.
B00000AFDW|4.0|Psycho Circus is a good rock record.  In fact, there are some songs that stand out as being pure KISS and pure rock.  Most notably, &quot;We Are One,&quot; &quot;Raise Your Glasses,&quot; &quot;Journey of 1000 Years,&quot; &quot;Into the Void,&quot; and the title track stand out as the best.  Peter Criss' ballad (not written by him) is pretty forgettable, and Gene's &quot;You Wanted the Best&quot; is just silly and inappropriate. <br />With that said, this album sold poorly-considering this was the first album since 1979's Dynasty that featured the original KISS lineup.  It's a good record but why did it fail?<br />The answer is simple.<br />Mercury Records did no promotion for this album, there was barely any radio or television promotion (I never remember seeing a single commercial for such a monumental album on TV.)  Plus, they released only two singles-the title track and the embarrassing &quot;You Wanted the Best.&quot;  The video for &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; was also a bit undesirable and MTV refused to air it because it just wasn't that good.  &quot;We Are One&quot; should have been the second single-it's a great song with a catchy chorus.  Gene sings about being one with the fans-very personal and emotional-seeing his own face staring back at him from the crowd.<br />Plus, Gene and Paul have huge egos.  They are almost allowed at this point but since this was the first album from the original guys, it's a shame that Peter and Ace were only given one song each.  Ace is the best song writer KISS has ever had and his contribution to this album, &quot;Into the Void&quot; is one of the best.  Gene has always commented that since Peter doesn't play an instrument besides drums, it's hard for him to write good songs.  That's simply not true-let's not forget who wrote KISS' most successful song ever-Peter with &quot;Beth.&quot;  If Gene wasn't happy with Peter's songs-why didn't he jump in to help and collaborate with him on a song or two?  Ace and Peter should havebeen on this album more.  Why not more songs?  I would have liked to see three songs by each member.<br />OK-getting off my bandwagon.  This is a good record.  Though it just wasn't handled or promoted properly.  Such an important and monumental record should have been heavily promoted but Mercury Records gave up on it the day it came out-shame on them.  I guess they'd rather put more money into new bands that wont make a dent in rock and roll history.  Can anyone say &quot;Saliva?&quot;  Or &quot;Hanson?&quot;
B00004VW5A|5.0|You must have this set. It's worth every cent it costs. It has just about everything from Elvis' finest era-the 50's.  The only thing missing are the Sun outtakes but that's just a quibble. There's very little sub-standard material and a whole lot of brilliant music.  Compulsory and compulsive listening.
B00000JFC5|3.0|Here's a great way to make a buck.  Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius.  I have to give Moby credit though.  At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove.  When he keeps the field out of the studio, he creates some thoughtful moments, such as &quot;Porcelain&quot;. And original collaborations like &quot;Why does my heart feel so bad&quot; shine as well.  Overall, the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music.  But has Moby changed the face of music?  At the very least he's learned how to program its soul.  My recommendation:  Buy this along with an Alan Lomax field-recording.  Decide for yourself if the tree trimmer has injured any of the roots.
6305499365|5.0|Because I was never a fan of &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;, I did not pursue seeing this movie in the theater.  But when my hubby advised me to watch it, I reluctantly did so and BOY AM I HAPPY I DID!.  &quot;Office Space&quot; is hilarious.   It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and enjoy every time!  I can't believe a film so funny and clever was not a box office hit and was overlooked by the critics! I think it has something to say to anyone who has ever worked in an office.....or actually to anyone who has ever worked!!  I recommend it to all my friends.
0070511136|5.0|If you need to sell but are not the &quot;sales&quot; type, I think you'd really like this book. I've just started a business and have been deeply dreading going out and selling my services because of what I've read about &quot;closing&quot; and &quot;overcoming objections&quot; and all that. Whenever I'd read Tom Hopkins, Zig Ziglar, et. al. and I would just think, &quot;I CANNOT SAY THAT!&quot; Pushy sales people make me want to puke. I am so glad to have found the alternative. Plus, I really like the fact that this is not just somebody's THEORY - it's based on research.
B000002A33|5.0|This is a great album that many would enjoy.  Unfortunately the screaming have now been all but forgotten.  The great songs on this album such as &quot;Dying Days&quot; and &quot;All I Know,&quot; deserve a place in the library of any fan of rock, pop, or alternative, a great album!  Buy it now!
B000002UA2|5.0|&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; is an excellent Floyd album, quickly becoming one of my favorites.  There are some slow, melodic tunes on this one, as well as some hard-rockers.  I like all of the songs on the cd, there all good.  If you really like Floyd, check this one out.  You wont be disappointed
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Let me start by saying this album is worth the money even without the CD.  The picture album of Kravitz inside the front cover of the case is priceless.  It is yet another example of an artist who takes himself way to seriously, and is good unintentional comic relief for the rest of the album.  As for the actual music on the CD, when it is what Kravitz does best, centered around guitar, it is excellent, &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; make up about three fourths of the album, and prove very entertaining.  The rest of the album is a little soulful for me.  Fans of R&amp;B might enjoy them, but for me they were a little to far off of his great guitar-work to make the album.  Nonetheless, the excellent guitar ballads make this album well worth the price, and put it high on my recommendation list.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Dexter Gordon was, in my opinion, the most under-rated of the great bop saxophonists.  This album proves that and more.  A must for any collection, the range Dex shows off on this album is incredible.  From the ballad \\"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears out to Dry\\" to \\"Second Balcony Jump\\" to \\"Cheesecake\\" this album swings and sobs.  My recommendation to bop fans is to buy every Dex album you can afford, starting with this one.    An album so unrelentlessly swinging, utterly joyful and (at times) beautifully melancholic is a rare find indeed.  Dex's sound is thick and juicy at all times, and really picks this group up.  In particular, \\"I Guess\\" is as beautiful as beautiful ballads are expected to be played... in quite a traditional-sounding way.
B0000009UX|5.0|So many good things have already been said here about this record, there's not much more to say.  But I'll try.  I'm sixteen years old and have been collecting records for a few years.  I discovered Elvis Costello a few months ago and have been collecting his records since.  When I got Imperial Bedroom (afer his first three masterpiece albums, as well) I knew I'd hit gold.  I actually fell in love on the first listen, having already known the best-known songs.  I cannot get over how seamlessly the songs flow together, for example from &quot;Kid About It&quot; to &quot;Little Savage&quot;, and the way &quot;...And In Every Home&quot; fits into side 1 (yes, I bought in on vinyl, for no less than $2.50...my best record purchase ever).  Perfect production and the sheer quality of the music alone will addict you.  I understand the comparisons with the Beatles but IB deserves to be distinguished as it's own work of art.  If I could only ever buy 1 CD again, it would be this one. I would have waited all my life for this album...good thing I found it at this young age!
B000002TPS|4.0|You know its funny how I never really got Megadeth. I mean, I like thrash as much as the next guy (as well as death, black and power metal) but Peace Sells didn't ring any bells and I wasn't impressed by Rust In Peace either. So when a friend told me that he'd bought Youthanasia I had no reason to be interested. That is, until he played it to me.<br />Now, lets get this straight, I'm not a massive fan of rock. I prefer my music more extreme. But this CD just struck a chord with me that I didn't know was there. It's not metal, true, but its nonetheless a great album. I would say that a band who have expanded their sound have sold out. I mean, if you were a teeny-bopper would you buy an album by a band called Megadeth? This simply shows that they can write melodic rock as well as thrash, and in my opinion they do it better.<br />This contains some brilliant songs. It's got catchy choruses, great riffs, delicious leads (the fact that even though Master Of Puppets is regarded as Metallica's greatest album people still say that the best leads are on Kill Em All, and why? Because Dave wrote them) make for a very pleasing album. The opening track could be better, but all the others rock hard. The best tracks are Train Of Consequences, A Tout Le Monde and Youthanasia.<br />So anyway, this is a great album. Very listenable, very good. Oh, and a band who sell out don't continue to play solos like this. So accept it! Great album. Go buy now!
0471381985|5.0|&quot;Value Investing&quot; is a book most value investors will want to read.  As I progressed through the early Chapters of the book I was starting to form the impression that this book was the best of its type I have read - and I have read more than a few!!  In the end I backed off giving the book &quot;superstar&quot; status but would still without reservation place it in the 5 stars must read category - especially for those about to read their first book on &quot;value investing&quot;.<br />Chapter 3 discussing the &quot;Three Slices of Value&quot; is the highlight of the book. The book is very readable - and unlike many similar texts has a good blend of the conceptual with quantitative examples.  For those that have already read extensively in this area the second part of the book on famous value investors will be going over old ground.<br />From time to time the book raises concepts such as &quot;Enterprise Value&quot; and &quot;Dividend Discount Model&quot; with little or no explanation which could leave the novice reader frustrated.  The book also leaves few clues about further resources that the reader might tap to dig even deeper into the topic.<br />Despite these negatives a great addition to my library which I have already gone back to for reference purposes.
B00005JKES|5.0|a triumph, an underappreciated gem of television, as groundbreaking as the twilight zone, the x-files wouldn't exist without it, David Lynch takes a northwestern small town murder mystery and turns it into a legend.  the only question is... why have companies been putting off the making of this DVD collection for so long???? when this goes on sale (hopefully sooner than later) BUY IT!!!  You'll never see a series like this ever again..
B0000025OP|5.0|I have been a Dylan fan for over 20 years. This is a lesser-known album, and was actually either not easy to find in the 70's and 80's (but occasionally wound up in the cut-out bin).  This album may not be the best introduction to Dylan, but for those who alreadly love his stuff, it represents a very mellow/sad/bitter/bittersweet group of songs.  Perfect for rainy afternoons, either alone (right after a break-up), or with a lover by your side.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is the second chapter of what I like to call Metallica's Trilogy.  It is considered by many fans (myself included) to be not only Metallica's best album, but also the greatest heavy metal album ever.  Metallica made a quantum leap from RIDE THE LIGHTNING, which in turn was a quantum leap from KILL'EM ALL.<br />On MOP, it became evident that Metallica wanted more than just being the heaviest, fastest, loudest band on the planet.  They combined the dark heaviness of Black Sabbath, the speed of Motorhead, plus the musical and lyrical intelligence of Rush.  Smarter lyrics, stronger melodies, and more diverse songs were what the band strived for then.  MOP focused on all of that with a vengeance using eight masterfully constructed songs that contained not one wasted note.  The band improved upon all of their song styles that I mentioned in my review of RIDE THE LIGHTNING.  Only this time the prevailing theme was CONTROL.<br />Lyrically, this album was an indictment on the (mis)uses of power.  &quot;Battery&quot; dealt with being controlled by one's violent urges; &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is about drug addiction; the horror of war and the military establishment is made painfully clear in &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;; and one my favorites is &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;, a song about TV evangelists that was released one year before the PTL scandal.  Unfortunately, Metallica never wrote a song about the MTV/radio trend control that they would later fall prey to.  But I think I attacked that little mishap on my review of LOAD.<br />MOP showed something that you very rarely see, people working at the top of their potential.  This is Metallica at their most diverse, best produced, and at their most intense level.  Though they came close on 1988's ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, they would never again reach anything near this level of creativity.
0385501560|4.0|Heres where I place Choke in the Palahniuk universe: Not as good as Fight Club or Survivor but a lot better than Invisible Monsters (really did not like IM for some reason).  Choke started out well and was going well right up to the last few chapters--Palahniuk was going for something really really big and right when you find out the truth--he yanks everything away, his build up just fizzles away into a no-ending.  Now the book is decent on its own, but after FC and Survivor, I felt like I had Palahnuik Blue-Balls.  It leads up into nothing. Ah well it was a worthy try, a decent 3 1/2 stars--I may re-read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything, but if your a Palahnuik Newbie, stick with FC or Survivor (if you read Survivor keep your head up for the secret ending).  Everyone take care and be safe.
B00000IAU3|1.0|boring, derivative, whiny, sleep-inducing.<br />I guarantee, if Eminem had not sampled her unremarkable song &quot;Thank You&quot;, she would be nowhere. She has a nerve playing STADIUMS across the country (which, by the way, have been 1/3 to 1/2 full). She's not a particularly good songwriter - she's wishy-washy and dull. Go spend your hard-earned cash on PJ Harvey, Janet Jackson, Sheryl Crow, Madonna, Eva Cassidy or Lucinda Williams - Chicks who ROCK! Not on over-rated bland 'pop' sung by a girl who got really, really lucky one day.
0441172717|5.0|I was really, really intimitaded to read this book.  I had heard a lot about it, how epic it was, and that scared me away from it.  But, after being hounded by two best friends to read the damn thing, I did...AND I LOVED IT!  It grabbed me about 30 pages in and after that I read it every moment I had, almost forgetting about my girlfriend in the process. So far to date I've gotten through 3 books in the series (which is sad, but I like to read a variety of books, so I've been book jumping--Now I'm back baby).  Give it a try, and if you're intmitated by any book, read it, you may be missing out.  P.S. you should get the Anniversary HardCover edition if you can, the print and production is a lot better.  Now onto Crime and Punishment....
B00004WIBW|5.0|I thought this movie was great. The graphics were terrific, storyline followed the book, and not to mention Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci were in the starring roles makes this film splendid.
B00003CY5K|5.0|This has got to be one of the best comedies I have seen this year.It was too perfect.Reese Witherspoone was perfect in this movie.The cast all did a perfect job in this movie.The movie was not only very funny,but it had a bit of a moral to it.The moral is to believe in yourself and thats a very good moral.If you saw Clueless and loved it,then you'll definatly love Legally Blonde
B00003CXSP|3.0|First off, I absolutely hate Ridley Scott.  His fetish for the acid trip-like dream sequences is annoying and usually they don't fit into the rest of his cinematography.  That wasn't what really ruined this film.  What did it in was the fact that it followed the novel beautifully until the last 3 or so chapters, when someone had the horrible idea of changing the ending!  In the novel, Hannibal and Clarice just happen to run off together.  She never tries to escape, he never cuts off his hand.  It's supposed to end as if there will not be another sequal.  But no, someone, be it Scott or whoever did the screenplay, didn't have the sack to use that ending.  It would be too offensive for the public to handle, so it was changed so Hannibal still looks evil and Clarice still looks like the good \\"guy\\".  In Hollywood, good and evil can not merge, it's just against all rules of filmmaking, right?  Someone shouldn't have been as concerned with their paycheck, and more concerned with making a true adaptation of a novel.
B000003BEV|2.0|The Stones are such a fine band, and so I really just can't understand why they felt it necessary to copy the Beatles, and do it in such poor fashion.<br />Sgt. Pepper was not a copy of anything, but instead it was the Beatles being creative, and innovatively remaking their sound.  Rather than the Stones doing the same thing in thir own way, they tried to remake Sgt. Pepper!  As a result, this album is a mess.  I've read other reviews where the reviewer doesn't see the similarities.  Besides the superficial similarities (album cover, the Stonen' outfits, etc), the music itself tries to mimic Sgt. Pepper.  What's with the bizarre sound effects???  What is the flower power sound???  That's not the Stones!  It worked for the Beatles because they were never a blues based rock and roll band in the same way the Stones were.  Not to mention the Beatles simply possessed the talent necessary to pull off such a change in sound from their previous stuff, and still make mega-high quality music.<br />On the otherhand, the Stones were great at blues based rock and roll.  They should have forgotten about orchestras, sound effects, etc.  The Stones were one of the greatest bands ever, and yet they were always in the Beatles' shadow.  I guess they thought if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Well, it didn't work here.<br />This album was useful in one respect though.  I think after realizing how terrible this album was, the Stones saw the error of their ways, and decided to make a masterpiece in it's own right, Beggars Banquet.  I say &quot;in it's own right&quot;, because it's not some cheap copy of a Beatles record, but a fine example of why the Stones are one of the greatest bands ever!  It's original, innovative, and true to themselves.  In fact, the only problem with Beggars Banquet is that after its original release, the Beatles released the &quot;White Album&quot;, with it's cover all white.  The Stones then had Beggars Banquet subsequently released in an all white cover too!!!I just don't understand why they did it.  Anyway, thankfully Beggars Banquet can only be bought with the original artwork nowadays.<br />In my opinion, part of the reason the Stones were always in the Beatles shadow is because they seemed to purposely put themselves there.<br />Back to Their Satanic..., I wouldn't buy this unless you're a die-hard Stones fan.  If you're just an occassional listener who only likes the best stuff, buy Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile On Main St.  Those are by far the best the Stones have to offer.
B000002UAX|5.0|Reading a review that gives this album only 1 star is so amusing.  Have you noticed?  Some kid talks about listening to the Beatles, and then turning 12.  Then he compares the Beatles to Guns N' Roses!  I guess he hasn't quite turned 13 yet.  Maybe that's why he had problems with his grammar.<br />Anyway, this album is spectacular simply because there are so many &quot;standards&quot; on it.  It's amazing that one album can have so many high quality songs.  I do admit that a few songs could have been left off.  The problem is, there are more than enough superb songs to fill two sides of a record, and so if they cut 6 or 7 of the not so great songs, what would they do with the other 6 or 7 great songs on the same record that need to be there?  They couldn't have made 3 sides to an album.  Nowadays, the problem is mute because of the CD.<br />Some of the best songs on the album are:<br />I'm So Tired, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, Back In The USSR, Dear Prudence, Happiness Is A Warm Gun,<br />Piggies, Mother Nature's Son, Revolution 1, Martha My Dear.<br />There are other great songs, but those are my favorites.  They are classics really.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper is a classic album.  It's considered the greatest album ever.  When listening to this album, I've found that it's much better when I try to imagine myself in 1967.  I think of hippies, flower-power, making love rather than war, and I think about how nothing else produced at the time quite captures this image the way Sgt. Pepper does.  Certainly not the Who's &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;.  Definitely not the Stones' &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;.  Cream and Hendrix are producing great music, but it's a bit heavy for 1967.<br />I then think about how no other album produced before Sgt. Pepper can really be considered a concept album the way Sgt. Pepper can be.  Think about your favorite album pre-1967...it doesn't matter who's album it is...it is basically a bunch of individual songs that do not flow together with the greater purpose of making the album itself a fine piece of music (and it should be noted that it was not meant to do that, pre-Sgt. Pepper).  Sgt. Pepper is the first album that can be taken as a whole, putting aside the individual tracks.  <br />This is why Sgt. Pepper is considered the greatest album ever.  It perfectly captures the era, and is the first concept album.<br />Overall, I've found that many of the songs on Sgt. Pepper do not withstand the test of time in the sense that I wouldn't listen to &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; if it came on the radio, unless the other stations had all commercials.  However, when listening to the album as a whole, the song has it's place.  Every song on the album has it's place.  When I listen to Sgt. Pepper, I do so only if I can listen to the album in its entirety.  That is when it sounds the best.  The only way to improve this album would have been to leave off any names to the songs...the album should really just be one big song.  Aside from the individual tracks having names, it really is just one big song.<br />For those who feel they would like a run-down of the songs, however, here is the scoop:<br />1.  Title Track - Paul's introductory song.  He wanted all of us to imagine that the album is being played not by the Beatles, but by Sgt. Pepper's Band; this is because the Beatles wanted to distance the album from the &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; Beatles.  We are to assume the Beatles of old are dead, and the new &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; Beatles have taken over.<br />2.  With A Little Help From My Friends - Many people seem to think this is John's song.  Actually, Paul wrote it for Ringo to sing as Billy Shears, Sgt. Pepper's Band's lead singer.  The message is clear, FRIENDS are so damn important.<br />3.  Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - LSD?  Hmmmm, I'm not sure if I believe John's explanation for the title or not.  John was a very clever man, and I find it hard to believe he missed the LSD connection.<br />4.  Getting Better - This song is one of my favorites!  Paul really got into the meaning of 1967.  Things are better now, aren't they?  I'm not sure if things were better for him because the new the album was brilliant, if it's because he just took a hit of something, or if it's because his pocket book was going to be lined with even more dollars/pounds after the release of the album.  For the rest of us things were better because we had freedom, respect, etc., from the establishment, and if we didn't, we didn't care because they were the squares, not us.  Listen for the chorus when they sing &quot;got to admit it's getting better...&quot;  You'll hear John sing &quot;couldn't get much worse&quot; in between the chorus lines.  I like it.<br />5.  Fixing A Hole - Pauls song about ???  I'm not sure what he was thinking, but when I hear it I think about all the phonies out there, as if I was Holden Caufield.<br />6.  She's Leaving Home - Paul's song tells the story of so many youths who ran away from home to get &quot;high&quot; in San Fran.  Very meaningful in 1967.<br />7.  ...Mr. Kite - John basically copied the lyrics rightoff an old antique poster he owned that advertised a circus.  The sound is the selling point here, not the lyrics.  The sound is just so out there...you feel like you're in a real carvnival...while on drugs.<br />8.  Within You Without You - George's song that basically tells us all that we're selfish, and we need to love one another.  I dig it.<br />9.  When I'm 64 - Paul's song fits simply because it follows the whimsical feel of the album as a whole.<br />10.  Lovely Rita... - Paul's new love song.  Not about how beautiful, perfect, etc, she is.  This is about a meter maid, and meeting her sisters.  Very strange when looked at that way.  Not a conventional love song.<br />11.  Good Morning... - John's song about how good life can be.  &quot;I've got nothing to say but it's ok&quot;.<br />12.  The Reprise - Paul wanted to let us know the show was over.  Sgt. Pepper's Band is done.  They're going home now...the lights are on.<br />13.  A Day In The Life - John and Paul put together two songs.  This is brilliant.  The show is over...Sgt. Pepper's Band is finished.  This song takes us back to reality.  This song is again by the Beatles, not Sgt. Pepper's Band.  Basically, this song let's us know that we don't live in the whimsical world of Sgt. Pepper...the world we just listened to for over half an hour.  We live in a world where people die, people hate, and people don't care.  This song is a masterpiece...no exaggeration.<br />Well, that's it.  Is the still the greatest album ever?  Maybe yes, maybe no.  But it hit home more than any other album in its time, and that counts for something.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|What an incredible movie! This film was extremely captivating. It draws you in from the beginning and drops you off rather abruptly and reluctantly when &quot;The End&quot; shows up on the screen. <br />Need a quick overview of this Luhrmann masterpiece? Christian(McGregor), a young impressionable writer, flees to Paris against the wishes of his father, turning down his fortune to seek his Bohemian dream of love. There he meets Toulouse-Lautrec(John Leguizamo), who pulls him into a lifestyle of absinthe, Spectacular! Spectacular!, and Moulin Rouge. In the famous Parisian nightclub, he meets Satine(Kidman), a popular courtesan, whom he falls in love with. A powerful romance ensues, despite hazardous perils.<br />Personally, I've seen this three times in the theatres and I'm still craving more of that thought-provoking picture. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; truly kidnaps all five senses and takes them for a ride, which is brought about by stunning fast-pace scenes, a simple but inviting plot, and beautiful performances by a great cast.<br />Those scenes and that director. Baz Luhrmann never fails to impress people. Leave it to him to incorporate pop music ranging from David Bowie to Madonna in a turn of the century film! An image of an ostentatious Harold Zidler belting out Like a Virgin will forever be engraved in my mind. Also, another aspect of the film that was rather innovative and extraordinary was the mixing of scenes. We watch a passionate tango dance occuring in the Moulin Rouge at the same time as we view a rendezvous between the Duke and Satine. While both of these scenes hold enough on their own, the marriage between the two is stirring and attention grabbing. It also points out the nuisance of blinking.<br />Though the storyline isn't anything new, creativity in other areas more than makes up for the predictability in the plot. For example, the acting in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is remarkable. I have seen several movies that star the Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, and he always offers depth, charisma and poignant portrayals. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is no exception for his impressive resume! His character, the sensitive, love-inflicted Bohemian writer Christian, is handsome, believable and devoted to the lovely yet doomed courtesan, Satine(played by the inspiring Nicole Kidman). Their love affair is naively pure and majestically brought about by the great chemistry between Kidman and McGregor. Another great actor in this film is the talented Jim Broadbent, who offers a humorous and captivating role as club's owner, Harold Zidler. His performance is truly one of the best I've witnessed this year in the cinema! He adds so many sides to his strident character that the movie would simply not be complete without him.<br />The overflow of vivid emotion that other motion pictures miserably lack is blended with raw talent and amusing comedy to form &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. This film leaves its' audiences craving more, driving a crash course into an insane atmosphere of the uninhibited onslaught of merging sensuality with sparks, then falling into the conclusion with a dazzling array of cinematography. Luhrmann has certainly outdone himself.<br />I've not covered even half of the great points of this amazing movie, such as Ewan McGregor's spectacular singing voice or that operatic moon. There's only one solution to this disturbing problem - go see it, and immediately! But you must be aware that this wasn't made for historical purposes, or to rival a big action blockbuster. This is, simply and purely, &quot;a story about love&quot;.
6303334598|5.0|Truly a delightful movie. I love the fact that the Charlie and Yvonne are so innocently just &quot;doing the right thing&quot; whilst staying so unassuming and carrying on with their lives. The scene at the end in their &quot;darkest hour&quot; almost had me in tears, and really showed out their true characters. A real heartwarming film - for a change I felt a well spent 90 minutes rather than an empty hour and half. Refreshingly different from the usual shallow romantic comedies out there which are all basically the same.
B00003CXRP|3.0|My hat goes off to Mr. Tom Hanks.  I am a huge fan of his and thought he did a tromendous job in this film.  I can't say enough for Tom Hanks, he is truly a brilliant actor.  HOWEVER!  Hellen Hunt's character can't wait for him?  What the hell is that all about?  &quot;I knew you were alive. . . I always loved you&quot;  What is that supposed to mean?  You knew I was alive and loved me when you got married and had a kid within 1 year after I disappeared?  I could understand if she waited like 3 or 5 years and then had to move on but she was movin on within like 3 months.  That really ruined the movie for me!  But the acting is worth buying it for.
B000002LRX|4.0|A minor masterpiece of schitzophrenic rock. Mike Patton's excursions in Mr. Bungle set the stage for this album, Faith No More's bravest and most experimental. It starts out sounding mostly in the traditional hard rock/FNM vein, but quickly moves on from there to far more dangerously experimental waters. From hilarous excursions and vocal madhouses like RV, Kindergarten, and Be Aggressive, to pseudo-progressive rock songs like Jizzlobber, this is the Faith No More album to own. Few major-label releases are this wild and brave, and not many are as satisfying. Look to pick this up if traditional-sound rock music is simply not your cup of tea.
B00005221M|3.0|If you've previously seen the original video release or theater release of this movie and enjoyed it greatly (as I did), then the chances are good that you will NOT like this &quot;directors cut&quot; edition.  It's very hard to pin down what exactly is wrong with the changes--mostly it's a matter of breaking down the emotional intensity of the original film into a sort-of-boring revision.<br />Also, even if you've not seen this movie before, you are probably going to be disappointed in the absolutely minimal &quot;special features&quot; on this disc.  I also found that the sound quality was pretty bad--in several places I had some difficulty hearing the dialog.<br />What I recommend is to rent the movie on VHS if you haven't already, and wait to see if they ever release the correct version on DVD (I'm not holding my breath).  Personally, I regret buying this disc.
6303418287|1.0|Yep, this is another one of those &quot;Completely Faithful to the Book&quot;  well, no not really  situations. If Kenneth Branagh were any more of a ham, he'd be stuck through with cloves and topped with pineapple. He is just terrible! The movie begins, like the novel, with a wooden ship out there in the icy waters. They take on a mysterious stranger, like the novel. But then Kenneth Branagh fairly shouts at the captain, &quot; I..Am...Victor..........FRANKENSTEIN!&quot;  Like, why would that mean anything to the captain, y'know? It's not as if he said he was Napoleon or some other indisputably famous person any seafaring man would have heard of before. And Robert DeNiro--what's with the baseball stitching on your head? No, it's just an unholy mess. You'd be much better off with Colin Clive and his monster, Boris Karloff.
B000002UAQ|5.0|So many words have been written about this masterpiece, and deservedly so.  Many fans list it as their favorite; many young people start their Beatle trek with it. I'd like to share my views of this landmark album. <br />I wasn't introduced to the 'real' Revolver until 1977, when I picked up the import LP.  By that time the truncated Capitol version was lodged deep into my memory banks.  So was the truncated version of Rubber Soul.  Ironically, that truncated version of Rubber Soul had one huge impact on me, so seamless and fetching was its folky, wonderfully melodic flavor.  Then, when, admidst great anticipation, Revolver came out in its 11 song version on Capitol, I was actually a bit disappointed.  The three songs that were cut for American release were all Lennon songs: And Your Bird Can Sing, Dr. Robert and I'm Only Sleeping.  That left only She Said She Said and Tomorrow Never Knows, not nearly enough Lennon.  Think about it.  George had three songs on the album; Lennon had two.  I was indignant!  Outraged!  It was largely Lennon's presence on that Capitol Rubber Soul album that had such an impact - It's Only Love, Girl, Norwegian Woood, In My Life, Wait, Run For Your Life - all wonderfully melodic songs.  And let's face it, while Tomorrow Never Knows was undeniably innovative and brilliant, it doesn't have the melodic or harmonic interest of any of the aforementioned Rubber Soul Songs.  That left one song, She Said She Said, to give me my melodic Lennon fix.  Not nearly enough.  That first time I listened to Revolver, I thought, &quot;Wow!  Where's John?&quot;  I was disappointed.<br />That disappointment lingers to this day, but I do believe that Revolver is the showcase for the best writing of McCartney's career.  He is the main writer for Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Got to Get You Into My Life, Good Day Sunshine and Here, There &amp; Everywhere.  Wow! (Remember, ALL these songs were on the 11 song Capitol version).  Paul has written many classics, but EVERY song he was the main writer on this album is a bonifide classic.  Certainly he was strong on Sergeant Pepper, but his writing there did not match this brilliance.<br />OK, I'll admit, reinstating the three Lennon songs does balance things out, but it's obvious that by this time he'd eshewed the melodic folk style he'd explored so well on songs like I'm a Loser, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, Girl, It's Only Love, Norwegian Wood, etc.  His acid period had begun, and I admit to missing his softer, more melodic side.  That said, his songs on Revolver are brilliant in their harder, sharper-edged way.  She Said She Said and Dr. Robert are excellent rockers (Ringo's drumming on She Said She Said is incredible, one of his five finest moments on record).  I'm Only Sleeping and Tomorrow Never Knows are innovative and evocative.  And Your Bird Can Sing still just blows me away.<br />This was certainly a democratic album.  Five Lennon, five McCartney and an unprecidented three Harrison...oh, and one co-written for Ringo, the goofy, lovable Yellow Submarine.  Of the Harrisongs, Taxman is the one that really stands out.  Love You Too may be innovative (first pop song to use all Indian instrumentation), but I haven't seen anyone list it as a classic Beatle song. I Want to Tell You at least has a durable guitar riff to recommend it.<br />There, I've got it off my chest. I love Revolver, I may even agree it may be the group at its pinnacle.  However, my personal favorites are still Rubber Soul and Abbey Road. Oh, and for a display of brilliant pure pop/rock songwriting and singing, I can't forget 'A Hard Day's Night.'  But, hey, these guys didn't put out any clunkers.  I don't consider Yellow Submarine a proper Beatle album; I don't think they do either.  And despite (or maybe because of)its flaws and its scarcity of new Lennon songs, Let It Be is still a satisfying listen for me.  The rest of the catalog is uniformly superb; each album has something to recommend it.
078062565X|5.0|So Fay Wray confides into the tuxedo lapel of Bruce Cabot, the brave first mate who saved her from the clutches of Kong. They stand in the wings of a theatre, looking at the giant ape now held by chrome steel chains on stage, but little do they know that Kong is far from vanquished, that his fury is only moments from being unleashed on New York City itself. &quot;King Kong&quot; really is one of my favorite movies of all time. Where else can you find gritty Depression era sentiments mixed up with a wild action horror film? Other horror movies from the 30s--&quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, even &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the most part--concern elegant drawing room aristocrats in full evening costume, but &quot;King Kong&quot; is about working class folks trying to make a living, whether it's cranking out a jungle movie like Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) or running a ship like Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). And poor Ann Darrow, who can't even find work back in NY, becomes a figure of obsession for the dangerous natives of Skull Island.  If you love movies like &quot;42 Street&quot; and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, I assure you,  you would find the same kind of dialogue in &quot;King Kong&quot;. Every time I watch it, I focus on some other detail, like the mutterings of the ship's crew as they make their way through the marshes trying to track down Kong, who has absconded with Fay Wray in his fist. Or the wonderful histrionics of Fay as she reacts to Kong's battle with a Tyrannosaurus Rex--and remember, she's really seeing nothing, all the figures are really clay models added later! Or the little faces at the skyscraper windows who watch as Kong destroys an elevated train near Herald Square. Here is one movie I genuinely never tire of watching. I can't imagine that there's somebody who has never seen &quot;King Kong&quot;, but if that's so, don't deny yourself the pleasure any longer!
B000006XSD|1.0|You know, there's a reason why Alice doesn't do much of his solo period work live in concert anymore.  So much of it is pitiful -- and he knows it.  Ok, he'll do a few cuts from &quot;Nightmare&quot; and tons of great songs from the Alice Cooper group.  But he seldom -- if ever -- plays songs from &quot;Goes To Hell&quot;, &quot;Lace &amp; Whiskey&quot;, and &quot;From the Inside&quot; (the embarrassment trilogy).  Out of this trilogy, this is by far the weakest -- and that's saying a lot!<br />&quot;But,&quot; the die-hards retort, &quot;It contains the hit single 'You and Me'&quot;. -- just another reason to avoid this tragedy.  Not any strong cuts on this one and there's really nothing positive to report on this album.
0790744473|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again, and I have whenever I've rented it! Gene Kelly and pal Van Johnson lose their way on their shooting vacation in the Scottish Highlands and stumble upon Brigadoon, a magical town that only appears for one day every hundred years. In its way, very similar to &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, another story about enchanted fantasy places. Like Ronald Colman in that movie, Gene is not happy with his life back home and finds peace and contentment during his day in Brigadoon, not to mention love with the fetching Cyd Charisse. Van Johnson is like the character of Colman's brother, never seriously entertaining the idea of settling in Brigadoon. And like the petulant Maria in &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, we see an inhabitant of Brigadoon who wishes to leave and see the world outside. The difference between these two characters, though, is that we don't really know why Maria hates Shangri-La; we have pity for the fellow however, since he must  see the woman he loves get married that night to another wealthier townsman and has no opportunity to meet anyone else or better his position in society. His decision to escape from Brigadoon opens up the most exciting scene in the movie, when all the townsmen must follow in pursuit to keep him from breaking the enchantment and causing Brigadoon to disappear forever. While there are the usual dance numbers for Gene, I particularly enjoy the highland fling dances of the ensemble, which are genuinely thrilling.     By all means, settle yourself down in a comfy chair with some loved ones and take in &quot;Brigadoon&quot;--you won't regret it.
B00000JMQE|5.0|This is an AMAZING fantasy film! And I am a loyal fan of the 1939 Judy Garland classic, but let's remember that it's not like that is really the source of the Oz stories! I love both films. They are totally different. While this one is sometimes described as a horror film, it's really not, but it has a lot of very scary moments! It would be interesting to see this film done as pure horror, and the same thing goes for Alice in Wonderland, but while this is scary and may give some kids nightmares, it's not a horror film, it's a magical fantasy that is dark in comparison to Garland's Oz. I've never read the books, not yet anyway, but I hear this one is far more loyal. The effects are wonderful! People who call them laughable must only be doing so out of spite! I notice that a lot in reviews lately. This is a visually stunning movie, and as every other fan here has said, it by no means is a sequel to the '39 version. I realize it's called Return To Oz, but that just means the character has been there before!! Still, there are several throwbacks to the '39 classic for those of us who are loyal fans. While I would never want to change the old classic, Fairuza Balk was probably waaaaay more appropriate for the role, and all the other characters were far more like they would actually appear had it been real as well! This film is done in a serious mode, and that works fine. Just don't watch this thinking it's a Judy Garland sequel! Come on, it's from the '80's! I don't remember if I saw this one in theaters or not, but I think I did. It probably would have done much better had it been released today! By the way, this is a great movie to watch around Halloween, and if you enjoy it I strongly recommend the Worst Witch, also starring Fairuza Balk and made shortly after.

6301797906|5.0|This 1940 classic is a film that was remarkable for its time and still packs a punch today. It is a movie that contains a very complex political message within a very simple story of simple people. It takes a very basic story of a family moving to California during the depression and turns it into a powerful, enthralling and heartfelt film about people, politics and the way the world works. It is an excellent adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, which even Steinbeck himself declared to be a powerful thing on its own.<br />The film centers around the main character of Tom Joad who is played brilliantly by Henry Fonda. Tom has just gotten out of prison only to find that his family and all of the other families in the area have been kicked off their farms by the banks. Most of these families decide to head to California in search of work that has been promised to them by pamphlets and brochures. Tom's family decides to do the same and the rest of the movie is about the hardships these people come across on the way to and in California. It is a well-known story that is loved by many people but the true core of the story is the political message within. It is a very leftist film and the message of the verge of communist or \\"red\\" but it was at the time a very real and much needed idealism. The message is mainly presented through the character of the Preacher or Casy but by the end it is Tom himself who is spreading the word of unions and fair work.<br />The directing is fantastic and who would expect anything less from John Ford who is considered by most to be one of the, if not the greatest director from the days of old Hollywood. This is one of the films that proves this statement and is bested only by \\"The Searchers\\" in my opinion. The skill in which Ford frames his shots is incredible and quite unheard of for the time. He uses techniques and shooting styles that would have been more common in the Seventies up until now but here's John Ford using them in 1940. The lighting is one of the best parts of the film and Ford uses every available chance to use natural lighting usually at the hand of a candle or match and the results are astounding. The film has a feeling and a huge amount of style to it. It is truly a work of art.<br />I think Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine put it best when he said, \\"In the film, Joad butts heads with the behemoth of capitalism and realizes he can find redemption only through struggle. It really spells out the capitalist system's indifference to humanity. I'm shocked the movie even got made in the U.S.\\". I would agree with this statement and go even further to say that it was amazing that this film was not only made in the U.S. but in 1940. This is a time when the more \\"red\\" way of thinking was not as accepted as it has been for the last thirty years or so.<br />Steinbeck's book is amazing and the movie is a powerful adaptation that is fit for any fan of great movies, particularly fans of films that have a social message to deliver. If you have not seen it I whole heartily suggest that you do.<br />Thanxs....

You'll be surprised!!<br />This is such a great movie!!  Whoever says that it follows the same storyline as Rocky... well not really!  The only similar event would be the big showdown at the end.  Besides that... most of the movies are way different.<br />I always get goosbumps when lil' Daniel beats Ali in a game of Hockey.  You can see the pure look of joy when he scores the goal!!  <br />Das my boy!!!!<br />Hieu &lt;with a 'U'&gt; Nguyen
B00005B4GU|4.0|The effect that Radiohead has over music listeners might have changed, but only for those who do not fit in with this deep, inspiring, daring and sometimes dreary approach contained in their music. It's clear that the Amnesiac material relates to KID A. As the former, Amnesiac holds the listener in a world of fuzzy but astonishing melodies and noises that makes you think, at first listening, that you lost your money or something like that. For these people I recommend careful and relaxed new Amnesiac sessions. Try that. Try with Kid A together in the random mode of your CD player. The reason for 4 stars is that this album was sort of a continuation for KID A (yeah, I know they were made at the same time!), with no really twisting new songs in the whole structure. And here goes a strange thing I noticed, that might make some reviewers think I'm out of my mind... I found some parts of this recording pretty much inspired from some sounds contained in old Sega Genesis games, such as Streets of Rage II and Ecco the Dolphin. Well, you know how game &amp; music fans are... Just check that if you've been a game fan in the past decade.
B000051VQR|3.0|This was a good CD, but it just didn't posess the usual edge that they have shown in their previous albums. The songs weren't as catchy and the intrumentals just didn't quite measure up the the green day standard. Even thought they didn't out do themselves with this one, they are still really talented and are a great band.
B000002O4S|5.0|A complete classic in modern science fiction movies, Back to the Future is a perfect film in all aspects, including music.  If you've been a teenager in the 80s and saw this movie you know what I mean. As for the songs, see just how the 2 Huey Lewis pieces fit perfectly in the story. Or how the old songs make you remember of the romantic scenes. But the better ones are the instrumentals. And rarely do I like instrumental music so much in a movie. The sound ambient created by Alan Silvestri IS the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; heart and soul. Buy this, you won't be disappointed if you're a soundtrack fan. If you're not, this is a nice introduction to how a bunch of ten songs can make a great movie even greater.
B00004ZAZZ|5.0|I love this CD.  Along with the US tracks there is also three bonus tracks that are really lovely.  All of these songs are great, even though some people think some are stupid like, &quot;Where Are You Now.&quot;  Probably my favorite on this CD is Lucky and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know.  Party songs like &quot;One Kiss From You&quot; and &quot;(I Can't get no) Satisfaction&quot; are just great!  From there are the beautiful ones, including &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; and &quot;When Your Eye's Say It&quot;  The best ones for people are the powerful songs, like &quot;Stronger,Oops!... I Did It Again, and Don't Go Knockin' On My Door.&quot;  The three bonus tracks rock.  Girl In The Mirror is one of the most beautiful songs there is.  You Got It All is cool, and so is Heart.  Dear Diary is a cool song, but I think it should be longer.  You must get this CD.  Great songs are in it.
0525945636|2.0|This book disappointed the devout Follet fan in me. The book does have exciting moments, but its often very predictable, a trait definitely not desirable in any suspense books. The amnesia thing does seem interesting, but the author doesnt pull it off that well. I found Bourne Identity, (by Robert Ludlum) which has a similiar idea, immensely more exciting. I would recommend that to any avid reader of suspense. This book however is just okay.

B00005ATQH|4.0|Devoted as I am to Vladimir Nabokov's novel of Lolita, and as much good as there was in Adrian Lyne's more accurate interpretation of it, I must confess that Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film version functions better than either as social commentary.  Nabokov's novel was radically subjective - not a thing happened unfiltered by its hero's own vision. Transliterated as it was by Adrien Lyne, the result was claustrophobic.  Kubrick's film, by contrast, invited us to stand outside and look in at the strange behavior of mid-20th century America's \\"progressive\\" middle-class.  That was the right approach.  By not asking us to relate to an obvious pedophile, or any of the other characters, Kubrick allowed us to fully absorb the ethical and emotional consequences of their interactions.<br />The oddly named Humbert Humbert (James Mason in, perhaps, his finest performance), comes to America from some unspecified European country.  Looking for lodging, he crosses paths with Dolores \\"Lolita\\" Haze (Sue Lyon), and her mother Charlotte (brilliantly played by Shelley Winters).  What follows is a black comedy swirling giddily around a host of sexual taboos - pedophilia chief among them, as Humbert finds himself sexually obsessed with the teen-aged Lolita.  Had this been a TV-movie of the week, Lolita would have been the saintly victim of the villainous Humbert.  Instead, Kubrick and Nabokov's Lolita is a precocious manipulator - awakening to her sexual identity and the strange power she can exert over members of the opposite sex.  The difference, of course, is that she is a child and doesn't know any better; Humbert is an adult and damn well should.<br />So, for that matter, should Clare Quilty, Humbert's rival for the attentions of the young nymphet.  Quilty, though sicker than Humbert, is a farcical character, played brilliantly by Peter Sellers - the Robin Williams of his day.  The edgy, blackly comedic tone is no better exemplified than in the scenes he and Humbert have together.  It becomes obvious as the film progresses that, in some twisted way, Humbert actually loves Lolita, while Quilty sees her more as the object of a fetish.<br />By the end, Humbert is reduced to a broken shell of a man, and it does not really matter if we approve of his behavior or not: he is still sympathetic, as much a victim of his own demons as Lolita herself, or her hapless mother.  Without lifting a finger to \\"redeem\\" him, Kubrick forces us to come to terms with Humbert's humanity, as well as his perversion.<br />Compare that to sanctimonious pap like American Beauty, a film that nearly demands that we &quot;understand&quot; its main character, even daring suggest that disapproving of his infatuation with a teenaged girl is akin to the homophobic excesses of his sadistic, one-dimensional ex-Marine neighbor (apparently ugly stereotypes are perfectly OK when applied to conservatives).  Add to this a few patently absurd, over-the-top plot developments and Kubrick's Lolita begins looking better and better.<br />Many have suggested that, had Kubrick made Lolita in a more permissive atmosphere, a different (therefore \\"better\\") film would have resulted.  I doubt it.  At the end of the day, Kubrick's Lolita is more about foolish, pathetic, self-destructive behavior, than pushing the limits of what salacious content we are allowed to see on-screen.  It is about how obsession and hypocrisy can crush a person.  It is about how very funny we are as a species, with our propensity destroy each other and ourselves for the pettiest, most absurd of reasons.t becomes obvious as the film progresses that, in some twisted way, Humbert actually loves Lolita, while Quilty sees her more as the object of a fetish.  <br />By the end, Humbert is reduced to a broken shell of a man, and it does not really matter if we approve of his behavior or not: he is still sympathetic, as much a victim of his own demons as Lolita herself, or her hapless mother.

B000002BVN|5.0|this Michael Jackson cd is a bit more hard core than the others but it's worth it. the first 5 songs are fantastic, with messages in each of them. the remixes are the best ive ever heard! usually remixes always sound worse than the actual songs, but these are really really good. after reading online reviews, I honestly was not expecting much of this cd, but i bought it anyway and was really surprised. this cd is another great one to add to your MJ collection :)
B00000ILDE|5.0|The Scott film was good, especially at the end.  But this one, it captures the fear and intensity of close quarters combat like nothing else.  Perhaps it takes Giger's creatures to actually reach the jaded audience, but this one does it.  The very premise of the beings just makes it sickeningly scary.  The production and casting are still benchmarks, though some of the green screen footage of the drop ship in the reactor complex now needs to be CGI touched up.  I will disagree with most of you on one point, though.  The additional footage is not necessary.  In fact, I think the scene with Newt's parents actually harms the narrative flow and suspense by giving too much away.  The first &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version was the best, in my opinion.

Repeatedly... &#8216;Good OmensEis an absolute gem...
B00003CWN3|5.0|Before buying this movie i had already watched THE BRANDON TEENA STORY and I knew a lot about Brandon Teena. Since my first time of hearing the story I have been deeply gripped by it, Brandon may be a stranger to me but I felt something. This movie has followed the life of Brandon and his struggles and his love for Lisa. His fears and his hopes of triumph. Hilary Swank is amazing as Brandon. I have never seen an actor play a part with such belief and realism. I forgot it was Hilary and saw her as Brandon. Chloe Servigny was great as Lisa Tisdale. I could see the passion she shared with Brandon. A lot of strong actors made this movie moving, gripping and thought provoking. Watch this movie, it will change your outlook on life, i guarantee it.
1558216340|2.0|If this had been written simply as a novel I could have enjoyed it more.  Unfortunately, everything was entirely too fantastic to be believed.  I think the con artist who wrote this book found a quick way to gain some attention and a few dollars to pad his wallet.  And the character, Mr. Smith!  Give me a break.  Knowing the readership would be mainly English-speaking, he chose a name impossible to trace.  Back up the book with some facts and I will gladly change my opinion.
0425180638|1.0|I could not finish this book.  It just rambled on and on, with no story to speak of, and certainly nothing to keep this reader's attention.  Terribly disappointing.  I had to check the cover to make sure it was really written by Cornwell.  I tried to keep reading, thinking it would get better... or get SOMETHING... but it never did.  Totally boring.
0440224764|4.0|I have read most of Grisham's past books, and this one is by far and away one of the best I have ever read by any author.  But (and I know y'all knew that was coming) the ending just STUNK.  Absolutely NOTHING to do with the rest of the book, it was like he said to himself one day, &quot;I'm bored of writing this book, my deadline is coming up, I might as well just end it right...HERE!&quot;  Other than that, it was an excellent book.

If you have this book a wonderful imaginative adventure is never far away.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This is the best DVD ever (as of right now).  Not only is it a great movie, the special features are awesome, director &amp; cast commentary insightful (although Helena Bonnham Carter's was obviously recorded elsewhere and edited in), there are cool special features on the second disc such as deleted scenes and alternate scenes.  As many of you already know, this is not just a movie about fight club.  Ed Norton plays a nameless character (well, he makes up names in the movie, but his real name is never revealed).  Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, Mr. Cool, tough guy, doesn't care about worldly posessions.  Meatloaf plays Bob.  And don't forget about Helena, who does a fantastic job.  This is a really good movie and an especially great DVD.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album was a tremendous accomplishment.  A gem of all gems, the mother load of everything rebellious.  Everything was congruous for the band; rage came from living in LA. Every song is a masterpiece in its own right, a statement of how growing up in LA can affect someone.  <br />This band's energy and intelligence were so compelling, so in depth, so genuine.<br />Freedom was their first ever video.  I remember reading an interview where Zack was saying how they (The whole band) was hanging out on his parents couch, and the video came on for the first time.  I remember the video well.  I doubt MTV will ever play it again.  I had to see it on the Headbanger's Ball.  It aired maybe twice on the Headbanger's Ball, and then was never to be seen again.  Too \\"serious\\" for the MTV community. &quot;...Brother, did you forget your name, did you lose it on the wall.... listen closely to the end of this verse, Zack whispers something very important here (See title of review).  I think he forgot his own message only moments after uttering the words.<br />Take the Power Back is a brilliant song, featured in such movies as Natural Born Killers, look for the scene where Woody busts out of jail.<br />Bombtrack is also a great song, featured in Matrix, at the very end of the movie.  <br />Fistful of Steel is their greatest song in my opinion, both lyrically speaking and musically, this song was an inspiration to me for years in the early 90's.  &quot;Not a silent one, but a defiant one, never a normal one, 'cause Im .......&quot;<br />Brilliance, on a record.  That's about it.  If you haven't purchased this album, you're completely missing out on a terrific jolt to the music community.<br />Unfortunately, Rage never grew or improved, and instead milked their wonderful sound until there was nothing left, not even Rage.  In my opinion, this is their only accomplishment.
B000000WCA|4.0|Belive it or not, this 10 track sugar pop classic is actually a pretty good listen.  The Spice Girls managed to capture maturity, innocence, and a sense of fun and put it all in one disc.  The CD kicks off with their breakthrough singles Wannabe and Say You'll Be There.  Who hasn't hummed at least one of these songs in their life?  Mama is actually a very good ballad, and is probably the best on the CD.  Poppy dance tracks like Who Do You Think You Are, Love Thing and If You Can't Dance set most of the album's tone though.  The girls are not only here to make a dent on the music world, but to have some fun as well.  Contrary to popular belief, there are some very mature and sexual moments on this disc.  Lyrics like &quot;Are you as good as I remembered baby/get it on, get it on&quot; are hidden every now and then in the album, and Naked is about a girl determined to use her sexuality in a positive way.  Even though the Spice Girls were a fad, they made enough of a mark that they will be remembered for a pretty long time.
B000002UB3|5.0|First of all, let me say that Abbey Road is by far one of the best albums I have ever heard.  There is no doubt about that, and if you're a fan of anything music, you simply most own this album.  Now that I've said this... this certainly is NOT the Beatles best album.  I think it's a little mediocre for a Beatle album.  Arguably, the top five powerhouse, blow-your-mind-away Beatles Albums are Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, and Abbey Road, and Abbey Road is also arguably the worst of the five.  The best is Sgt. Pepper, NOT revolver, as many people (including VH1) are now saying, followed by the White Album, Rubber Soul, and finally Abbey Road.<br />Here are my opinions of Abbey Road: First off, the album is brilliant.  I would say the second part is the Beatles at their most uniform, joining the songs all together and putting parts of earlier songs in later songs, and mixing it like it's a piece of art, which it no doubt is.  Of course, the songs can't be listened to alone, by themselves, and if anyone tells you that \\"The Sun King\\" or \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" [stinks], then they simply have taken the songs out of context, which isn't fair to judging the Beatles.  Moving on...<br />The first part of the album is also absolutely amazing.  Poor Ringo is overshadowed by George, who is overshadowed by Lennon/McCarteney, and rightly so, because Octopus' Garden is maybe one of the worst Beatles songs of all time.  Maybe it's just me, but I really don't like it that much, except for some of the sond effects, which for that time were quite revolutionary.<br />\\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Something\\" are great songs, but certainly not one of the best songs of the Beatles.    \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" are absolutely two of the most brilliant songs ever recorded, no doubt about it, and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is easily the best song of George Harrison (not, as most people think, \\"Something\\").<br />I also think that \\"Because\\" is one of their more brilliant, inspired, works, because its probably the Beatles creepiest song (it sends chills down my spine every time I hear it), but it also is so \\"out-there\\" that it brings it all home with great music.<br />The rest of the songs in the first part (before \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\") are ok, but not standout-amazing like \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\".<br />\\"Golden Slumbers\\" and \\"Carry That Weight\\" are always included together when being judged because \\"Carry That Weight\\" is practically a continuation of \\"Golden Slumbers\\", and the song(s) is amazing.  \\"Once there was a way to get back home, Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing you a lullaby\\".  The Beatles at their best.<br />\\"The End\\" is actually a pretty good song.  It includes Ringo's only drum solo in the history of the Beatles, which is just great, unlike his song-writing, (too bad he didn't do more solos before, he really was a good drummer) and the last line of \\"The End\\" (and thus their career, if you don't include \\"Her Majesty\\", which comes after 15 seconds of silence and I don't think was to be really included as part of Abbey Road but more of a playful encore by the Beatles) is maybe the most memorable line of their career: \\"And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.\\"  Simply stunning...<br />A wonderful way to end their long career of amazing records, but again, not their best work.  However, if you don't own this album in your collection, go out and buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002U9E|5.0|I discovered this back when it was a record and CD's didn't even exist. It was the first Kate Bush record I ever bought and I have to say, now that I own all of her CD's, albums, and tapes that I believe this is some of her finest work to date. Kate Bush is such an artist and an amazingly talented one at that (how many &quot;pop musicians&quot; these days can you name who write their own music and play instruments fabulously on their records?). Unlike so many of those so-called musicians today who pump out albums each year with all kinds of glossy hoopla and media and god-knows-what-else to cover up the fact that they are talent-less, Kate Bush has always remained true to her craft.   Listening to this CD is a true experience, like reading a fabulous book from start to finish. I suppose one could say it has a happy ending, although that's up for debate. One could also say that most books have some fairly common themes: love, desire, grief, fear. This CD has all of this and thensome. From the eerie &quot;Under Ice&quot; to the universal theme of &quot;Mother Stands for Comfort&quot; the truly amazing if not somewhat disturbing &quot;Waking the Witch&quot; and the lovely lullaby-like &quot;And Dream of Sheep&quot; well, truth is, I could go on and on about all of the songs and how they've moved me in some way. I bought this album what, almost 10 years ago and I STILL listen to it and I still get something out of it with each listen.<br />If you've never owned a Kate Bush album before, I think this is quite a good one to start out with. I'm convinced that anyone who buys this one will want to buy everything else this virtuoso has ever recorded. <br />And by the way - the woman can dance, too!
0471603864|5.0|This books supplies what everyone needs when coming to nuclear and particle physics, a good beginning. It is intuitive and very clear and nice to read, allthough it wont supply the math rigour a grad student needs but will give an undergrad some idea of these subjects. Griffith has done a similar good job in electrodynamics (allthough there is more rigour in math)
B000003TA4|5.0|A long time ago, I had never heard Nirvana.  I despised them, nonetheless, for having bad music.  I was so ignorant!  About a year ago, I actually listened to them, and they quickly became my favorite band.  This album is the single best album on the face of the earth, hands down.  What we have here is a group of patented Kurt Cobain backwards phrases (&quot;We can plant a house, we can build a tree,&quot; et cetera) to a great beat; virtually no thought is required to enjoy this music.  If you like thought, you can analyze everything in the music; it all means something.  Everything from the extremely slow and disturbing &quot;Something in the Way&quot; to the loud and popular defining song of the early 90s, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; to the up-beat and exciting &quot;Lounge Act&quot; to the morose and quirky &quot;Drain You&quot; -- it's all good!  And that's just to name a few examples; there's a word limit on these reviews, so I can't even BEGIN to describe the goodness of &quot;In Bloom,&quot; &quot;On A Plain,&quot; &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Breed,&quot; &quot;Polly,&quot; &quot;Territorial Pissings,&quot; or &quot;Stay Away.&quot;  If you want fast, if you want slow, if you want exciting, if you want depressing, if you want GOOD MUSIC, you'll buy Nevermind, and you will NOT regret it.
006019250X|5.0|Most of my friends have read this book, so it's been recommended by more than one person. When one of them gave me the book in Spanish I read it voraciously and loved it! I bought the book in English for my son (20) who is trying to find his own treasure, and this book was a source of inspiration for him,(so I met my objective). It's a parabole that must be passed down like a torch.
6305014140|4.0|Ninja Scroll is a very well made movie. The animation in it is fantastic. The battles with the Devils were very exciting. Each one had a weakness and strength. The music was good but nothing that really stood out. The story however is very well devoloped and you're introduced to the characters quickly. However there were a few scenes that were put in that seemed pointless. For example, the sex scene with the master ninja. Overall this movie was very good and I believe an (older) anime fan should add this to his/her collection. Warning: Lots of gore and nudity.
B00005ASHM|5.0|When I bought this album in 1966, I had just broken up with my current girlfriend the night before. I purchased it along with &quot;Big Hits, High Tides, and Green Grass&quot; by the Rolling Stones and &quot;If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears&quot; by the Mamas and Papas. Needless to say, when I played it first the other two were soon neglected. I had never heard anything like it before and now thirty-five years later, I still haven't. If you have never heard this, please do yourself a favor. You will never forget it or regret it!
B000007MVD|4.0|The Beatles' only official live document, excluding the 1977 release of LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL (out of print, thankfully) which was never more of an interesting side note as the screaming fans almost made the band inaudible and the tape quality was simply not that exciting, stands as the long lost link in The Beatle's impeccable legacy as muscicans.<br />Twenty nine of these cuts have been previously unreleased, and while, sadly, there are still a few more cuts from these sessions left in the vaults, this by far and large presents the lion's share of the BBC sessions.  What makes this package really first rate are the previously unavailable cuts which would have made a really good double album back in vinyl days.  Had they released a double album of just good old fashion rock and roll covers it would stand proud against the rest of their legacy, and beating Dylan to the punch of having the first double album ever.  Why a lot of these cuts never made it has always been beyond me.  The songs here really shows The Beatles' roots and influences and how they assimilated them into their own sound in the very heights of Beatlemania, that time era of 1963-1965 where no one could get enough of them.  While I've never been a fan of The Beatles doing Chuck Berry, they do a cut of his toward the last of Disc 2 (I think it is \\"Don't Go\\"), which is really good.  Almost all of the cuts were good enough to be included on those first five albums, although the takes themselves may not have been.  The sound is generally pristine though because of some of the tape quality it suffers a little on a few cuts but never sinks below listenable, as AMG points out.  The rest of the cuts are from their official canon, with such early staples as \\"Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" and \\"Things We Said To Day\\" highlighting the show.   <br />Another very interesting thing is it shows this band playing live, and you can just feel the rush and giddy excitement these boys had, and gives you an insight into why The Beatles have become such a major part of our culture.  Very highly recommended as a look at the creative processes of The Beatles and just good solid rock and roll back in the early days before they would move onto lush psychedelic music of the last half of their career.  This album has been a staple of my Beatles collection ever since I bought it back in 1998 or '99, and I haven't understood why Amazon did not include this until just recently. <br />Bottom line:  Top rate stuff.  Buy it today!  This has been out since 1994 and you haven't got it already?????
B000002AZ8|4.0|First, let me air my greivences. Why are so many reviewers defending &quot;Bugs&quot; and &quot;Stupid Mop&quot;? They are terrible songs. It's not even music, just snippits of accordian or piano while Eddie plays out his need to say nonsensical stuff.<br />Hey, I do feel like everyone's allowed a few clunkers, though. These two songs aside, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; deserves nothing but the highest praise. The opener, &quot;Last Exit,&quot; is a great romp for the band, and it heats up from there with the smoker, &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; and an angry &quot;Not For You.&quot;<br />Other highlights are the concert staple &quot;Cordoroy,&quot; about Eddie Vedder's disdain for fame; &quot;Satan's Bed,&quot; a crunching view of how messed up some rich people are; and &quot;Immortality,&quot; more of a ballad, really, but still a very powerful song.<br />All in all, I would recommend that people buy this album, even if they have to skip over a few tracks. It's not perfect, but it's a great example of what Pearl Jam can do with their great talent.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Hey if you like classic songs, you know the ones that you hear on the radio on the oldies station, but you're not sure who sings it, or don't know who Billy Joel is. Listen to this record. Billy Joel was a master that everyone loves, it's just they don't realize it yet. On the first cd Billy Joel dazzles us with his classic rock 'n' roll hits like \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Anthony's Song\\" and \\"Only the Good Die Young\\", at the same time shows us his talent as a song writer with \\"Always a Woman\\", \\"New York State of mind\\" and \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\". The second part graces us with songs like \\"My Life\\", \\"Uptown Girl\\", \\"The Longest Time\\" and one of my favorites \\"Goodnight Saigon\\". <BR>In my not so humble opinion Billy Joel is one of the best performers of all time.  He is a masterful pianist and an accommplished composer.  In a day and age when there are songwriters and performers, Billy Joel is one of the few that does his own writing of songs and therefore the performances are heartfelt and genuine.  Not only is he a great performer but he has proved that he can withstand the greatest enemy of performers...TIME from the date of his first album to the date of his last Billy Joel covers three decades and just as many generations of time!
B00003CXP1|5.0|I saw this movie twice.  Once in the theatre and more recently on DVD.  The first time I saw it I had high expectations because of all the film buffs that highly recommended it to me.  I thought it was a bit slow moving the first time I saw it, but once I walked out of the theatre, I was deeply moved.  In order for a movie to be good, I need to walk out of the theatre in amazement--amazement in the acting and amazement in the plot.<br />Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto were both excellent in this movie.  Burstyn played Leto's mother, Sara Goldfarb, so unbelievably well.  She was a pathetic, sad, old, self-pitying woman who became addicted to diet pills and eventually went crazy.  Leto, who played Harry, eventually had his arm amputated because of a growing infection from heroin injections, and Jennifer Connelly, who played Marion Silver, humiliated herself by succumbing to acts of sexual violence in exchange for heroin. <br />This movie does not glamourize heroin use.  It truly makes you think about it's fatal consequences.
B000002J27|5.0|In 1976 Genesis was known as one of the most progressive rock bands worldwide, highly successful throughout Europe and much of the world, even if they had only achieved modest success up to that point here in the US. By 1986 Genesis had amassed even greater successes worldwide including the US, as a Top 40 staple on radio as a pop hit making machine. Surely if you were comatose, or stranded on a desert island during those ten years, having last heard 'The Lamb Lies Down...', only to return and hear 'Invisible Touch', you'd have no way of understanding how Genesis circa mid-seventies could have evolved into Genesis circa mid-eighties. Well it is this album, 'A Trick of the Tail' that provides the bridge.<br /> Genesis in totality, 1969 to present is loved by almost no one. There are two different camps of Genesis fans. Many prefer the early progressive quintet of the Peter Gabriel era, whilst many others prefer the poppy hit friendly trio of the Phil Collins era. But it is a rare beast that actually loves the whole gamut. The only unified crossover appeal between the two camps generally comes with this album and it's follow up 'Wind and Wuthering', appropriately the only two albums Genesis made as a quartet. <br /> After the departure of flamboyant vocalist and primary lyricist Peter Gabriel, many in the press and fan base had Genesis written off for dead. After an exhausting search for a new lead singer proved fruitless, the lead vocal duties were handed to the groups drummer Phil Collins. This was at least a safe choice as Collins was already a familiar voice to fans, and had already been heard on lead vocals a couple times since he had joined the band in 1971, as well as being the primary harmony vocalist to Gabriel during the period.<br /> The first fruit of the 'new' Genesis, 'A Trick of the Tail' was a sheer slap in the face to critics and nay-sayers who thought that Genesis died with Peter Gabriel's departure. The difference is immediately noticeable, as the witty and ironic lyric crafting that was a trademark of the Gabriel era is severely watered down in this first post Peter release, but ironically the music is actually more melodic and immediately accessible than any release that had come prior. <br /> 'A Trick of the Tail' is not quite the Peter Gabriel era Genesis, but it is still also a far cry from the pop machine of 'Invisible Touch'. The songs here are still very progressive, running in odd time signatures, with extended instrumental sections, and only one track running less than 5 and a half minutes.<br /> The album is also very balanced with the songs all being of nearly equal caliber. The sonic trilogy of 'Dance on a Volcano', 'Squonk' and 'Los Endos', the exquisite 'Entangled' and the moody 'Ripples' all are superb. If the weakest link would have to be pointed out, it would probably be 'Robbery, Assault and Battery', but that is not to so say it isn't without it's own merits, it just doesn't quite stand up as well as the remainder of the album.<br /> All in all, 'A Trick of the Tail' is far and away the best album of the Phil Collins vocalist era of Genesis, and really the only album that to these ears, is comparable in overall quality and enjoyment to the Peter Gabriel era albums of 1970-1975. It was the last truly great Genesis album, and unfortunately, every album in succession after this one, took one more step away from the progressive band that Genesis was, and one step towards the straight forward pop band that they eventually became by the end of the eighties.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Snatch, the follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels, amazes from start to finish. The movie consists of three differant plots which weave in and out of each other.  Although very similiar to its predecessor, Snatch improves on the formula that made Lock Stock such a success. The DVD for the movie is incredible. A double disc set loaded with features.

B00003CXRP|4.0|Dreamworks pictures strikes again. While Cast Away was only a mediocre movie, this DVD really rocks. You get two discs jam packed with commentary, deleted scenes, great audio\video, and hours and hours of fine family fun.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|this CD is a pretty good CD.  some of the tracks seem to be a recycled version of one of their previous songs, but they still sound good.  i would suggest this CD to people that like modern rock.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca may very well be the greatest movie ever made. It has action, romance, deciet, and some of the greatest one liners ever. The DVD features an incredible print of the movie. A must own for everyone.
B000005JA8|5.0|this has to be the most amazing piece of work ever. No one I mean no one has ever pushed envelope on what music could be or how it could be expressed. I can't imagine anything ever being so imaginative for it's time.

0375703861|5.0|I heard about White Teeth while reading a review of The Feast of Love(which the reviewer did not like). So thank you. I loved them both. I picked up some more future books from reviews on White Teeth. So much for the benefits of reading 142 Amazon.com reviews. I gave this book a 5 star rating because it was a pure joy and I want to help get the overall rating to 4 stars. White Teeth is one of the best contemporary novels I have read. I enjoyed it the same way I enjoy Tom Robbins. I am learning while I am laughing. The various characters stick with you even if they do fade in the text. I thoroughly enjoyed the biting irony.It's too bad that so many readers were put off by their expectations. I am also anxious for Zadie Smiths' next book.

0761957553|4.0|A.Field's &quot;Discovering Statistics&quot; (using SPSS for Windows)is a must book for not only undergraduate and graduate students but also for the instructors like myself. The language of the book is  stimulating the redaer, and Mr.Field's way of explanation is both a creative one and has the sense of humor which makes the book more readable. Its content is well-designed and the reader is able to follow up what each type of analysis is all about, and more importantly how the outcome shoul be interpreted. Although first chapters are written as a refreshment of statistical knowledge, I would like to suggest to the reader to have a primary knowledge about both the basics of research methodology and statistical methods as well as statistical techniques to use them in accordance with the research problem(s).I would also like to point out the fact that some critical issues like &quot;the meaning of standart error&quot; is explained in an efficient way in comparison to that of ordinary statistics textbooks. In short, the book is, indeed, a very helpful one for anybody who wants to use SPSS for this or another reason.
0780627024|1.0|This file should really be subtitled, \\"Let's pretend the Sixties actually made things better.\\"  While this movie is a thrill to watch and the story is not too bad, one never loses the feeling that he or she is being lectured.  Ross fails to heed his own admonition about black and white.  The fifties are painted as an illusion at best or an oppressive, fascist society at worst.  But don't worry; a little free sex will fix everything.  Of course they throw a little book burning for legitimacy.  I've got the sequel, \\"Return to Pleasantville.\\"  Good old Bud can come back to the town to find the town populated by poor single mothers with a thriving abortion facility, the malt shop now a STD clinic and all this in brilliant color.  <br />I understand that Pleasantville was not intended to be an Isben play, but a little more depth to the fifties characters would have greatly improved the film.<br />BTW, the Civil Rights Movement started in the Fifties.
0393317552|5.0|I would classify myself as the quintessential &quot;lay person&quot; when it comes to evolution and world history. This book is jam packed with facts and theories that were news to me. I was presented with lots of good information that I consider myself better now to know. Let's just say that the average high school education does not do this subject area justice.<br />The book is well written, very easy to read. While Mr. Diamond does sometimes try to drill a point home through repetition, I absolutely could not put the book down. It was way too interesting.<br />Once I was finished, I did not agree with 100% of Mr. Diamond's conclusions, especially his omission of what I consider a giant factor in European expansion, their culture. But that does not take away from the fantastic read I had, and the valuable information I feel I have gained. This book makes you think. What more can you ask for?<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|In many ways, this movie is a variation of the concept the movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot; explored, with a slightly more deeper focus on the character-relationships between the father and the son character.  Perhaps it is the presence of Dennis Quaid that makes it feel like an 80's film.  Or maybe it is the changing-past-altering-future time travel concept.  Nevertheless, it's a fun concept to explore, the idea of being able to communicate with somebody from the past through a radio, and thus warning that person in the past, thus altering the events of the present.  This is basically what happens when John, a police detective, finds himself communicating with his presently dead father in the past through a HAM radio and manages to prevent his death.  As a result, it somehow results in a set of serial murders, of which John must try to solve (with a help of his dad).  The relationship between the father and son are quite endearing and the mystery thriller and sci-fi elements are an interesting bonus.
B00005K9QP|5.0|The 2cd Blues album pales when compared to this one. Recorded in his early 20's Clapton has not played with that tone or imagination ever since. There are many Clapton albums to get, but if you want to know why he was considered as the best guitar player in the world, this is the answer.
B00004XQ83|5.0|All I can say is that great things come in unusual packages.  I am 19 yrs old, and I listen to mostly rock, but when i heard &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; I HAD to have it. &quot;Don't leave nobody but the baby&quot; is a lullaby turn sultry which is great. The movie is all about catching those little hints like the newspaper in the fire and the lullaby turn sultry. Give it a try, its makes me happy to hear the cd, even &quot;Man of Constant sorrow&quot;.

What it means to be true to your spirit, even if you're not perfect and surrounded by hate and ignorance. Shows how love is affected by those around you.
B000050XEI|5.0|I've listened to this CD many times, and I do not get bored with it. I have all her other titles, and enjoy this as much as the others. My two year old daughter will stop what ever she is doing when the CD begins playing. She is intrigued by the music, as am I. Her instrumental, composition, and vocal talents are amazing. If you want something to help you slow your world down for a few minutes, put in this CD (or any of her others), sit down, close your eyes and listen.
B000002KD9|5.0|After stellar work with Crazy Horse(formerly the Rockets)and C,S,N&amp;Y,it was only fitting that Neil Young would use the best aspects of both on his third solo album.Few would have thought that AFTER THE GOLDRUSH would now occupy it's position on &quot;the greatest albums of all time&quot; then.In fact,a few reviews I have read from that time slam GOLDRUSH as a &quot;minor,irritating work&quot;. However, time has long since vanquished such views and this album remains one of the first to buy if you've a beginner in the Neil Young stakes:<br />TELL ME WHY - Haunting acoustic number that starts GOLDRUSH with atmosphere.Great harmony vocals.Memorable lines: &quot;Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself,when you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?&quot;<br />AFTER THE GOLD RUSH - Sad song about man's destruction of the earth and the possibility that all this wastage will drive us off the planet in search of a new one.The lone piano and french horn drives the poignant lyrics home.Young sounds like his heart is breaking.This was written after reading a script given to Young by his good friend Dean Stockwell.Covered by Trio on their second album.  <br />ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART - Young's thoughts on new love and the advantages of being careful.Piano is right up the front again ,with lilting harmonies from David Crosby and Graham Nash.<br />SOUTHERN MAN - Hard rocker with angry guitar leads from Neil and Danny Whitten,about the bloody history of slavery in the American South's past.This started a short battle of songs between Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd.<br />TILL THE MORNING COMES - Extremely short singalong with a half-hearted warning in the lyrics.<br />OH LONSESOME ME - Young takes the Don Gibson classic and slows it down to dirge speed.Now THIS guy sounds lonesome.<br />DON'T LET IT BRING YOU DOWN - Neil tells of bad things happening all around us,yet we ignore them totally.This song,more than any before hand,painted Young as being &quot;less than an optimist&quot;.<br />BIRDS - Bequates new love with first solo flight of a bird. Glorious harmonies cause this song to soar(no pun intended).<br />WHEN YOU DANCE I CAN REALLY LOVE - Guitar rocker of new love and the joy it brings;loving the way he/she dances.Memorable lines:&quot;I can love,I can really love,I can really love!&quot;<br />I BELIEVE IN YOU - A partner who continues to love his spouse,after an unmentioned incident;though his doubts are haunting him and his trust is slightly wavering.<br />CRIPPLE CREEK FERRY - A short burst of song heralding the arrival of the Cripple Creek Ferry.The captain stands alone and the Gambler is getting ready to disembark or desert.Atmospheric ditty that does it's job as the album closer.
B000059S9D|5.0|I agree Chris Turk's thorough review, with one major exception: the album does NOT &quot;go downhill&quot; once you come to &quot;Hatesong,&quot; no, not at all.  At this point, &quot;Hatesong&quot; is just the beginning of the best of PT's music!  It is an amazing piece with brooding lyrics and a wonderful darkness to it.  Of course, &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; is simply one of the most spectacular epic pieces ever written!  I liken this to Yes's &quot;Awaken,&quot; full of body, length, emotion, and the most brilliant use of orchestra to back a rock piece you'll ever hear!<br />I saw this band in concert, and I have never been so awestruck by the sheer musical genius of Steve Wilson and his band, Porcupine Tree.  Get this disc, listen to it, let it settle in, and once you feel that you love this disc so much that you wish it were twice as long, go buy &quot;Stupid Dream.&quot;  Once you are so crazed by that disc that you cannot put it away and you just want more and more and more of Porcupine Tree, then get out your credit card, and pick up everything they have ever issued.  THEY ARE THAT GREAT!!<br />In essence, Porcupine Tree is a blend of Pink Floyd, Radiohead, (old) Genesis, King Crimson, and ELP . . . . but BETTER!!!
B00005B4GU|3.0|Other People have said the Thom and the guys wouldn't have got away with this album if it weren't for 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer'. I agree. It's simply not possible for debut bands to release music that is this adventurous.<br />Radiohead have established such a happy relationship with fans and the media that they can release anything, call it art, and succeed.<br />Having said that, people wouldn't belive it if it weren't partially true. Thus 'Amnesiac' is a good album. <br />If it weren't for bands like Radiohead and Primal Scream, who relentlessly push the boundaries, the music industry would become stuck in a rut, stuck in a rut, stuck in a rut. And it just so happens that the mystique that surrounds every Radiohead release enables them to be more pioneering. It's all good...
0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood is a wonderfully complicated romantic story.  In it the reader is shown the inner-most thoughts of the characters.  This novel presents us with and helps us to better understant the different types of love a person can possess for another as well as showing how we deal with the loss of a loved one.  This is not your average &quot;fairy-tale&quot; romance novel, but an honest and sincere representation of the love a young man feels for those around him and what he does to cope with these feelings.

068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes instantly draws you in to the life of author Frank McCourt.  You will feel what a young Frank was feeling and will feel an overwhelming urge to help him.  Frank McCourt is a magnificent author who will instantly grab you.  He is honest (sometimes brutally) about how he is feeling and the situation he is in.  The innocence of a child is shown in this memoir.  You will laugh, cry, and even get angry.  This is a wonderful story that will leave you hoping that things will turn out O.K.  It will also show you that your life may not be as bad as you previously thought.

014028009X|4.0|Although I was expecting something a little different, Bridget Jones's Diary certainly did not disappoint me.  This is a hilarious portrayal of life as a thirty-something single woman with problems existing in every aspect of life.  As she struggles to come to terms with her single status, mother's mid-life crisis, career, smoking and alcohol addiction, and weight, we are able to catch a glimpse of ourselves in Bridget's &quot;quirks&quot;.  I think that almost any woman will be able to identify with the funny situations in which Bridget becomes involved.  Because there is a little piece of Bridget in each of us, you will find yourself hoping that everything will turn out all right for her.  It also may help you to realize that writing in a journal may provide you with some laughs as you look back at your own misfortune.  I thought that this book was (v.g.)!
B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie is proof that with enough money you can get anyone to do anything. This film would have been better if they just had a huge gila monster swallow the cast as soon as they hit the rock.   The only historical signifigance this film has is it marks the point at which a lof things just began to .... Aerosmith ... after doing this film. Ben Afleck ... after this film...... <br />If your looking for a big rock movie try Deep Impact
B00004Z459|4.0|This cd is worth it.  if you like the rap/rock style than this is your cd.  the rapping is good and the singer's crazy loud voice adds to it.  It takes awhile but once you listen to the songs a couple of times you get used to it and start to get in to it.  My favorites are:<br />1: Because it has a good beat. 5: Because of the guys crazy and after awhile annoying voice. 6: Nice rap and chours  8: a more meaningful song more rap good chours 9: good rap has a nice beat and chours 10: starts out fast and loud but calms down and rocks!<br />Overall a good buy!
0064407667|3.0|Just like Lemony Snicket says, &quot;If you don't like books with unhappy endings, you might as well put this book down.&quot;  I gave this book three stars because it was a little too unhappy.  I enjoyed it because it had a mix of a little comedy and horror.  I liked Sunny because of all the strange things she said.  I think the hooked handed man was mostly mean to just Sunny and Violet.  Lemony Snicket is a harsh writer, but I enjoy his ability.  I please ask you to read this book because it is very interesting.

630575067X|5.0|This movie is tied with Star Trek II as my favorite movie of all time.  The original Star Wars Trilogy was good, but Episode one was unbelievable.  The special effects, the best fight scene in cinema history, the Vader mythos origin begins, and Obi Wan Kanobi (Ewan McGregor) made a huge breakthrough performance, he really overshadows Neeson (Qui Gon Jin) as the heroine of the story.  Yoda is cool as ever, and the Princess is super hot. The SFX are breathtaking, much better than the original trilogy. Although many fans didn't like this move consider the following comparisons:<br />Original Star Wars vs. Episode 1 Luke Skywalker:  Dreamer who wants to be a Jedi, but he's really mundane and wimpy, looks and acts like the kid who got beat up in high school.  Jedi Savior?  Bwahahwwahhhbwahhhaa. Episode 1 Counterpart:  Obi Wan Kanobi McGregor acts like a Jedi: cool, intelligent, fearless.   His fight scene with Darth Maul is the best fight scene ever.<br />Darth Maul vs. Darth Vader<br />Maul is just plain bad, he's evil, and kicks butt, and he doesen't have to breathe heavy, and wear all that crap like Vader.  Don't get me wrong, Vader is a sci fi classic and legend, but did he really seem evil?  Did he really seem intimidating?  Maul takes on two awsome Jedis, Vader couldn't even take wimpy weeney Luke, the wannabe Jedi, Maul vs. Luke... Get ready to join the force Luke.... Hans Solo vs. Oui Gon Ok, I know Han is not a Jedi, but I needed somebody to compare to.  Han is so bad, he's like the ultimate gunsliner, but he can't act, and the guy seemed like a wimp like he does in all other movies...and people complain about Jar Jar's bad comedy... How about Chewbacca(Arrgghhharrrrg)  Solo:  \\"Laugh it up pukeball, Or furball, whatever, it was cheesey, and not funny. Original Trilogy highlight:  Alec Guiness, as Obi Wan, great actor, and performance, one of the main highlights of the original film. Buy episode 1, it is a masterpiece, and the only movie I have ever seen that overexceeded my expectations, a keeper.
B00003CXCS|5.0|This movie came out the same year I was born 36 years old is this movie and stills carries it's weight in gold like a new release.  When I first saw this movie I could have been no more than 5 my grandfather took me to the theater to see two movies I don't remember what the first one was, but man when the Sound of Music came on I was taken away it was like I was part of the von Trapp family.  Oh the songs were the best my two  favorites are: These are a few of my favorite things and Do Ra Mi Fa So La Te.  I thought Julie Andrews was the most beautiful woman I have every seen on big screen and Christopher Plummer remarkeably handsome at the time I didn't understand why this movie had me in a spell as I got older and watch repeats of it on television it wasn't the same TV edited so much I figure well I was just a kid, but never the less I still watched it everytime it came on it was just something about that movie. I introducts my children to this movie.  Now that I have it on DVD I got the same feeling I got when I first saw it at the movies with my grandfather warm and joyiness I felt like that five year old kid again.  If you are a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan then this is a must have in your collection of Musicals truly more than a Classic.
B000003S0K|5.0|Went to NYU film in the mid seventies. This was the album that we fell asleep to. Eno's influence is do heartfelt amongst so many others. Genesis' Lamb Lies down on Broadway is &quot;enoissifed&quot;, and then Peter Gabriel's solo career. The talking heads were very shy, naive folk when they first met Eno. He gave them a sound for the ages. <br />He was a god that pulled strings, a deus ex machina puppeteer, who works from above. It will be one of you desert Island discs.<br />Check out &quot;801 Live&quot; for some of these songs live, with old cronie Phil Manzanara. Great live performances.
B000002WYT|5.0|DMB is incredible. This CD is highly addictive. Fun, passionate music. Run out and buy it now, your soul will thank you.
B00000I41J|5.0|Recorded in 1958, one year before the legendary 'Kind of Blue' session, this performance is dominated by Miles Davis, and Davis' cool, modal influence. The droll, conversational tone is evident throughout, even on the &quot;hotter&quot; tracks. The sound is pure Miles Davis Quintet, even though Miles and Cannonball are playing with Hank Jones (who does the usual superb, tasteful job accompanying), Art Blakey (excellent, but restrained) and Sam Jones (solid). Cannonball is wonderful, but is somewhat corraled here with Miles running the show. For those of you who love the Davis sound, this is a fine session, but &quot;Them Dirty Blues&quot; is closer to the &quot;real&quot; Cannonball.
B000002L7J|2.0|I love &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot; The rest of the album is just ok. Not my type of music. Buyer beware!
B000007T1M|5.0|It's been quite awhile since this discs release and since I got it it's spent a good portion of time in my cd player.  Every member is a master at the insturment he plays and utilizes them as best as they can.  Instead of making radio friendly songs that basically sound the same all the way through the song, SOAD will change tempos and Serj will change singing styles every few moments to keep the energy flowing.<br />There next LP is set for release in August and from the 5 songs I've heard off of it, it's going to be even better than this one!  I can't wait.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|This is the first and only action thriller I think that was able to engage me emotionally.  This was definitley Clint Eastwood's best role surpassing his some-what overrated performance in Unforgiven.  Here he plays Frank Horrigan, an aging man still clinging on to his job as a secret service agent because he couldn't protect JFK.  Then comes John Malkovich's character.  Frank, living a life full of regret, is given a second chance to prove to himself and to the honor of his duty to get in the line of fire(during the climax set int he elivator, Frank finally gets in the line of fire risking his own life knowing that the snipers around the area cannot see what's taking place inside).  As for John Malkovich's character, I thought it was tragic that him and Frank were basically products of the same government.  The revealing of the villain's childhood photos was effective in its ability to make me feel pity for him.  A psychopath who feels he's been turned into a monster by the government.  A villain not seeking money but seeking closure and vacant vengeance.  These were several things that made this action thriller stand out from the rest of its genre.  Now if only more action movies put story first and then the explosions second...
B000002LR3|5.0|Screamadelica is the Alternative release, for the non Alternative listener.  I was introduced to Screamadelica via the weekly playing of the song Loaded, as the theme song of a local college radio alternative show. As a big fan of upbeat, pop rock; I loved Loaded.  My preferences aren't the pseudo dance numbers. Rather, the several richly textured, almost hypnotic rock cuts. I feel they're very underrated, and have stood the test of time, since the 1991 release of Screamadelica.   Damaged gets my vote as the best song on the release. This emotional, heart on your sleeve, but not wimpy cut; never fails to result in the volume being cranked up. I'm Comin Down, the very next song, almost makes your brain melt, with it's diverse instrumentation.  Movin On Up, Shine Like Stars, and especially Come Together, are also excellent examples of well done Pop Rock.  Fans of 70's progressive or art rock would especially enjoy the excellent production values displayed on Screamadelica.
B000002GF8|4.0|Let's put it this way: there are only two songs on this album I DON'T really like (Synchronicity II and Tea In The Sahara).  I can listen to Synchronicity II on certain days, but I always skip Tea In The Sahara.  I love Sting's lyrics, and this album has some of his best work.  Even &quot;Mother&quot; is a great song, although I hated it when it first came out.  The song explores how children can never really shake the influence of their parents, no matter how hard they try to differentiate themselves.  <br />Another thing that makes this album so great is the subtext.  The tension between the members of the band was reaching it's peak.  (You can actually SEE the tension in the photograph on the inside cover.  The way Sting is looking away from Stewart and Andy says it all.)  Unlike many bands, however, the tension actually HELPED them.  It made the music much more intense and alive.<br />Finally, I admire bands that know when to quit.  If The Police had stayed together, they would have become the 80s version of the Rolling Stones.  Breaking up at their peak leaves us wanting more, and I think that's the best way for a band to go out.<br />It's not perfect, so I can't give it a full 5 stars.  But it's pretty damn good.
0767802470|5.0|I saw the original much shorter version on the big screen years ago.  I remember the opening title card first listed the number of German submarines deployed during the war. Then they displayed the number that returned from their missions. I don't rememember the number but I remember my jaw dropped.  I also remember the end of the movie which took a sudden turn and left me a bit stunned and so all I felt like doing was sit in my theater seat and watch the credits roll through 'til the lights came on again.  What goes on in the middle brought immense poignancy to what happened at the beginning and the end.   Two hours or four hours, Das Boot is proof a great movie can never be too long.  You will spend that time locked in the belly of a German Submarine as both the hunter and the hunted thanks to the brilliant work of Director Wolfgang Peterson and the amazing Academy Award nominated cinematography of Jost Vacano who moves through the narrow corridor of the submarine with a camera with the grace and speed of a jaguar. I had the pleasure years later as a production asst. of tossing a styrofoam plane back and forth with him for about a half hour. He speaks German mostly so I don't remember exchanging but a few words but it was cool. I could say a lot about the many intense moments and the great acting as well.  But let me sum it up in this way.  Someone commented the film was given 3 Oscar nominations but did not win in 1981. However The Internet Movie Database which lists almost every movie since the beginning of film has a viewer rating ranking. Of all the movies reviewed in the database Das Boot ranks in the top one hundred best rated films of all time at number 36.<br />   I have one more point to add. Das Boot is one film that is better to watch dubbed than with subtitles. The English dub is so good I actually had to tell someone last week after an hour of watching the film it was dubbed. She finally noticed it after another five minutes. <br />   The DVD is excellent with a much higher than average picture and sound clarity. When the bolts pop off in the sub with the Dolby 5.1 track running its quite a cool experience. There is a running directors commentary through the whole four hour runtime. Also a making of documentary and more.  If I had a wish it would be that the shorter version would be available on the second disc. The longer director's cut is no better or worse than the shorter version, however when introducing someone to the film for the first time, everyone does not have four hours to devote to a film in one sitting no matter how good.
B00003CX95|5.0|Regardless of this movie's historical accuracy, (which is pretty good)Gibson's ability as a director to combine the story of Scotland's battle for freedom from the English tyrant Edward the Longshanks, and one oridinary man's struggle in a role he never wanted could not have been done better. Braveheart does all of this and more as the story unfolds on many levels dramatically and intensely. I cannot put into words just how good this movie is. The DVD itself is not much better then the VHS verson, with the exception that the sound quality truly does this magnificant soundtrack justice, and the picture makes the ferocious combat 5x better. If you have never seen this movie, you've been living under a rock, and if you have and didn't like it, then i have nothing to say to you. However, for those of us who love this movie nearly as much as I, this DVD would be an excellent addition to their collection.
0767819446|4.0|A unique and certainly compelling sci-fi film that blends an element of the film noir within the atmosphere of sci-fi. The only films I can compare this to slightly are &quot;Dark City&quot; or &quot;Existenz,&quot; but this film is no more like them other than in tone, mode, and lighting. Enjoy.
630542845X|5.0|POWDER    (USA - 1995)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital    Every so often, a movie comes out of nowhere which touches you so deeply, on so many levels, that it stays in your heart forever. POWDER is such a movie.    The premise is deceptively simple: Following the death of his last remaining adult guardian on their isolated farm, a young albino man nicknamed 'Powder' (Sean Patrick Flanery) is taken into the custody of local authorities. But his genius IQ and ability to harness electricity - leading to spectacular displays of apparently 'magical' behavior - arouses the suspicions of frightened townsfolk, and while he's able to change some people's lives for the better (and how!), others are too consumed by hatred to accept this strange, unique outsider. Thus, the stage is set for potential tragedy...    Writer-director Victor Salva (also responsible for the superb RITES OF PASSAGE, 1998) has constructed a modern parable which works both as a simple entertainment and as a powerful meditation on the nature of Good and Evil. Episodic in structure, the narrative pitches Powder's strange appearance and gentle manner against some of the worst aspects of the human condition - bigotry, mistrust, cruelty - and though Salva makes a brave attempt to portray these shameful characteristics in various shades of grey, his script acknowledges that some people are defined by their hatred and cannot easily be changed. That said, whilst the film doesn't flinch from the rough stuff, it's ultimately a joyous celebration of the human spirit: Though evil flourishes, goodness prevails.    POWDER contains a wealth of memorable moments, but some scenes are truly outstanding, such as Powder's first appearance as a ghost-like figure hovering in the darkness of the cellar where he's been hiding since his grandfather's death; the beautiful/terrible moment in the dining hall of the reformatory when Powder realizes he's never going to be accepted by his peers, no matter how hard he tries; the emotionally devastating sequence with the wounded deer (absolutely unforgettable!); and the sheriff's (Lance Henriksen) last desperate attempt to communicate with his terminally-ill wife (a touching, wordless performance by Dannete McMann). Few other 'fantasy' films of recent years have been so deeply, profoundly moving as this.    Production values are top-notch all the way down the line: From Jerzy Zielinski's beautiful, flawless cinematography, to Jerry Goldsmith's low-key score; from Waldemar Kalinowski's unobtrusive production design, to Dennis M. Hill's expert editing - this is the work of talented craftspeople operating at the top of their game, perfectly in tune with the director's intentions. But the real magic is conjured by a superb cast: Top-billed Mary Steenburgen and Jeff Goldblum are quietly effective in virtual supporting roles, while Brandon Smith underplays the part of a bigoted deputy sheriff whose life is changed forever by his encounter with the title character. As always, Lance Henriksen (who also played the lead in Salva's earlier THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, 1994) distinguishes himself as a humane but disillusioned lawman whose convictions are thoroughly shaken by Powder's remarkable abilities. Look out, also, for terrific turns by Bradford Tatum (as the leader of the bullies who make life a misery for Powder), Missy Crider (the potential love-interest) and the always-wonderful Susan Tyrrell (the sheriff's well-meaning but narrow-minded housekepeper) in small but crucial roles.    But the heart and soul of the picture is, of course, Powder himself, played with heartbreaking sensitivity by Sean Patrick Flanery. Almost unrecognizable beneath an unusual makeup job (by industry veterans Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman) which preserves much of his natural beauty whilst also emphasizing the characters' appealing otherworldliness, he plays Powder without any trace of self-pity; instead, he highlights the kindness andvulnerability of a Christ-like figure whose greatest curse is his total comprehension of the world and its inequities, and by his understanding that he'll never be a part of it (when a vicious thug whispers in his ear: \\"You really think you can be like us...?\\", you half-expect Powder to reply: \\"Who'd WANT to be?!\\"). Powder embodies many of the qualities which are largely absent from our own lives - goodness, compassion, and an appreciation of Nature in all its rich diversity - and Flanery captures those qualities with vivid grace. Of all the fine performances in this exceptional film, his is the most dignified and triumphant.    Though aimed at the widest possible audience, POWDER's theme of the persecuted loner will strike a real emotional chord with anyone who's ever found themselves on the sidelines, watching the rest of the world go by. This is a movie which speaks loudest to the outsiders amongst us, the disenfranchised and the dispossessed. It will be warmly embraced by anyone who's ever reached out to others and been rejected... anyone who's ever felt lost and afraid, or found themselves alone in the dark... anyone who's ever believed that the world has turned its back on them because of WHO and WHAT they are... anyone who's ever stood aside from the crowd and refused to relinquish their ideals in the face of overwhelming odds... POWDER is THEIR movie, their glimmer of hope. Once seen, never forgotten.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Remember back in high school, when you were getting picked on because you weren't pretty, or smart, or popular enough.  Those days are brought vividly to life by brian depalma's adaptation of Carrie.  Sissy Spacek is tragic as the girl that everyone loves to torment.  Her performance is so real, that I found myself close to tears.  Piper Laurie as Margaret White, Carrie's religion-crazed mother is so over the top, but it does not detract from her (oscar nominated) performance one bit.  A young John Travolta, and Nancy Allen are featured in the cast, as well as Amy Irving in her film debut.  (And a very cute William Katt).  Some people say that Carrie is a  horror movie, but I think it is a tragic coming of age love story--with a twist (the twist being that our little &quot;ugly duckling&quot; has the power to move things with her mind).  the suspense is racked up so high, especially the &quot;prom night&quot; scene, that you don't even realise you have been holding your breath.  Brian DePalma's direction, as well as the cinematography (effective use of spilt-screen visuals), and an amazing soundtrack propel this movie above any movie I have seen in a while.  Most movies made from stephen king books tend to be horrible, but this one hit the nail on the head.
B00005B23A|5.0|Jamie Lee Curtis turns in a performance in this movie that just blew my socks off!  She is a mousy housewife toying with the idea of having an affair with a real looser pretending to be a spy.  Her husband pretends to be a real looser, but is really an Arnie-at-his-best invincible spy.  The fireworks start when Arnie finds out what Jamie is up to...<br />Fast moving, never a dull moment.  I really enjoyed this one and I think that you will too.
0802130208|3.0|Ignatius F. Reilly is undoubtedly one of the finest comic creations I have ever encountered.  As one reviewer all too accurately points out, the word &quot;valve&quot; will never quite seem the same.  I found our anti-hero far from annoying, unlike everybody else it would seem, but I did have trouble sticking to the book.     The characters are for the most part colourful, albeit fairly thin (except the rounded kook himself!), however for some reason I just didn't feel the impetus to keep on going.  I did persevere but only because I didn't want to miss anything more from Ignatius, for example I skipped through most of his peace party launch - I just couldn't be bothered.  I think that where the &quot;plot&quot; is advanced the characterisation has to take the back seat and it is the latter which makes the book.   I would still recommend that you read this book, it would be a shame not to have acquainted yourself with the strangest protagonist in literature, you might even find a little piece of yourself in him.

0684869713|1.0|*The Fountainhead* is Scripture for Ayn Rand's cult of selfishness.  Its proponents tend to be those overly frightened by and unaccepting of the prospect of an existence that is at best unpredictable and unknown--it gives false comfort in its upholding of universal &quot;moral&quot; priciples.  This is the same kind of thinking that was behind the &quot;White Man's Burden,&quot; &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; and the eugenics movement of the 20s and 30s.  &quot;Fascist&quot; is *not* an extreme epithet to tack to this piece of rubbish.
B00005LB50|5.0|Well it's been a long time in the making but that wait has been justified!  What a great box set.  The sound is incredible, its so crisp you'd swear they are in the room with you. And yes I said &quot;THEY!&quot;  Come on people, lets not forget that this was Stephen's band and that Richie is one of the all time great voices in rock.  All I seem to read is how great Neil's work is here and I concure, he is truly a giant, however, don't short sell the others. Bruce Palmer was an extrodinary bass player, Dewey Martin was a fantastic drumer, Jimmy Messina a great producer/engineer/bass player and all together they combined to make a wonderful sound. Thanks Neil for taking the time to make this classic. I can't wait for the Archieves.
B00005JKES|5.0|I can honestly say, having been in my mid-teens when Twin Peaks was aired, that this was a TV show that changed the course of my life forever.  (Call me a loser and laugh if you will--I don't care.)  Never before or since have I seen a TV series as surreal, clever, and disturbing.  Forget the Sopranos--Twin Peaks  is the best TV drama EVER!!!  WHEN it finally is released on DVD I will know that there truly is a good and benevolent (but, in the TP spirit, quirkily twisted) God.
B000059R8Y|5.0|Clapton is one of those artists that has never said, &quot;I'm the best&quot;, and I believe that's exactly what MAKES him the best.  He keeps growing and exploring, letting his nimble fingers travel every inch of his guitars until he finds just the right rythym for just the right song.  If you have any taste in good music, I guarantee that you will not remove REPTILE from your player for many many weeks.  Your feet will be tapping, your mouth will be humming, you'll recieve strange looks from your friends and family when they catch you playing air guitar!  But ultimately, you'll be saying &quot;WOW!&quot;

0312954468|5.0|My sister bought me this book and to tell you the truth, I would have never picked it up for myself.<br />I must say this is probably one of my favorite books. <br />A fictional book about ancient Egypt, I thought I would never enjoy, but the characters are so intriguing I couldn't put it down. Even though the lead character is a slave, this book has a very romantic quality to it. But what really caught my attention is the way Wilbur Smith transports you into ancient Egypt with his wonderful imagery and action packed plot lines. <br />I found myself very caught up in his amazing characters he brings to life in this book. It was not the same old predictable story that you see in so many other books.<br />If you are looking for and adventure story and like to be drawn in by the plot, I highly recommend River God. Just be warned, it's not for the faint of heart.
B00003CXBK|4.0|If you want to see the world's best animation, rent or buy this movie on DVD.  The artwork is superb, almost unbelievable. <br />The plot is brilliant.  With the possible exception of Ashitaka, (the lead character), there are no real 'good' guys or 'bad' guys. Although there is a lot of violent conflict between the humans and the 'spirits of the forest', most of the characters are only doing what they think is best for their own kind. <br />The English dubbing is the best I've ever seen.  I recommend that the viewer also watch this movie with the original Japanese dialouge and English subtitles.  <br />There are plenty of 'spoiler' reviews available to read here, so I won't go into plot details.  <br />Unfortunately, this otherwise perfect movie is slightly marred by some offensive and totally unnecessary male-bashing.
B00004TH83|5.0|While the rest of the album is predictable and indeed on the same  wavelength with Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, Adagio is perhaps the only song to redeem pop music for the last 5 years.  The idea itself of taking a piece by Albinoni and remaking it into a song is great. The execution transcends simple vocal mastery.  In this song, Lara Fabian is pure musicality, affecting you directly, almost physically. If you listen to only one song this year, this should be the one
B00003CY5H|4.0|Audiences receive the 1-2-3 punch of three generations of terrific actors.  Brando...De Niro...Norton.  The Godfather, The Taxi Driver, and the...uh...Fight Club guy.  Actually, I'm an admirer of Edward Norton's and of course, you can't go wrong with the other two (what were their names again?).  Seriously, this is a good film.  While it moves a bit slow, the movie pays off well at the end.  All in all, a very satisfying summer film.      Well acted, beautifully shot, well edited, and well directed.  This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the last twenty minutes.  So sit back and enjoy...not at your computer!  In the theater!  Geez...what did you think I meant?
B000002J09|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums in the 70s.  My LP gradually got worn and scratched.  This CD is beautifully remastered and sounds better than my old LP, even when it was new off the shelf.  Great album by a great group.  This is truly a classic.
0345440757|5.0|I wish I had read this book before I gave birth.  I think if I did, I would have understood what my baby was trying to tell me those first few weeks.  I highly recommend this book to any new parent as another great perspective in communicating with your child.  I found reading this book along with books written by Pediatricians and Child Psychologists have provided me with great information so I can make a more informed decision of what I would like to do.
B0000039QA|5.0|It was '92, when I first heard of Big's talent, it was played on a track called \\"Party and Bullsh##\\". He wasn't promoted much back then, still underground.<br />In '94, I was working with a few cats from BK, that claimed they new him ( not sure how true that was ) but they had some copies of his tracks, before the somewhat more refined versions came out on \\"Ready to Die\\".<br />What I am saying is, Big was not just an entertainer who was larger than life; there was always an element about him that made him humble, and real.  The image of  a fat kid hanging on the corner trying to \\"make some money to feed his daughter\\", its real.  And to us, he  personified our lives and captured the details through his words.  We lived and unfortunately, died through and with him.<br />Remember when he was getting his award, he said \\"we did it, Brooklyn !\\".  We, not I.<br />And when Pac was attacking him, did Big make an album to retaliate ?  No.  \\"F# the crimes now, I'm doing rhymes now.\\"  He wanted to continue to make music, to see his kids grow, \\"The sky it the limit\\". It should be every father's right.<br />When I heard Big had died, I thought why !  Another one of us shot dead !  Is it all entertainment for you ?<br />If you love Big, then buy the album. Big's lyrics reflect on his life, and this album is one of the best ever, equal in quality and lyrics to the first, and his underground work.<br />Puff Daddy on the other hand, I don't like.   He is fake.  His production is ok, but it was all Big's talent and voice that made every track phat.  Big broke Bad Boy off, and made them what they are today.  ( And a lot artists too, like Mace, Lil' Kim, Junior Mafia, 112, Total, Greg Mack ).<br />There are a lot of phat rappers out there,  and many more that never make it, or haven't made it yet. After Pac and Big died, the industry has been promoting [crud].  ( Eminem, Dr. Dre, Nelly, etc. ) Yes Big was one of the best, and so was Pac.  <br />But Rap will continue, and more Playaz will come;  unfortunately, none will ever come back.<br />Respect Life !
B000003CKH|5.0|Their Velvet Underground influence is showing...does anyone else think so?
B00004TH83|5.0|While the rest of the album is predictable and indeed on the same  wavelength with Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, Adagio is perhaps the only song to redeem pop music for the last 5 years.  The idea itself of taking a piece by Albinoni and remaking it in a song is great. The execution transcends simple vocal mastery.  In this song, Lara Fabian is pure musicality, affecting you directly, almost physically. If you listen to only one song this year, this should be the one
B00003CXS4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. But it didn't have the charm of Ritchie's first film, &quot;Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels&quot;. <br />This movie's got some strong points. It's funny, well shot and fantastically edited. One of the film's running gags is the difficulty in understanding certain characters. Which brings me to my strongest complaint about the film. If you don't have an ear for accents, good luck understanding ANYONE in this movie. It gets frustrating at points. I had to see the movie twice just to get straight what everybody said to each other.<br />There are a lot of similarities between this film and &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot;. But the first one had more of an appeal, because it was about long-time friends getting themselves in a mess of trouble. It makes it easier to identify with the characters. We've all got friends who get us in tight spots, and that's why &quot;Lock, Stock....&quot; is more fun to watch and more engaging. <br />I would say that if you're a big fan of &quot;Lock, Stock....&quot; and Ritchie's style, get this. I did and I don't feel cheated. But this film does have some marks against it. This isn't a buy everyone should make.
0399226907|5.0|Highly recommended as a foundational piece in your child's library.  Vivid colors keep my 4 month old's attention and I personally love the story which motivates me to read this book to my baby.
B000002H97|2.0|Yes this album was succesful, yes MTV spinned Sandman to death, yes it was critically acclaimed but why?  Those who fell in love with this band after such metal masterpieces as Ride and Master suddenly felt betrayed.  This was heavy, but it wasn't exactly metal, and it wasn't exactly mind blowing or great.  The majority of people who bought this record were people who had never owned a Metalli record before.   This brought Metallica's music to a wider audiance, and people who had shunned the band in the past because of they're dislike for heavy metal and thrash bought this one.  This album is pretty weak considering this is the band that wrote such metal anthems as Battery and For Whom the Bell Tolls along with the classic One.  I mean it felt weird listening to it for the first time, it just didn't sound like Metallica.  Don't get me wrong, I don't wanna go out and buy a record by a band that keeps making the same kind of album over and over, but the music wasn't as ear catching and the lyrics weren't as as thought provoquing, Metallica weren't growing older and becoming melower, they just couldn't get it together on this one nor any after... This album has some okay songs : Sad but True and Wherever I may roam, but two out of twelve cuts doesn't go in my book as excellent.  If you are into the new stuff Metallica does(namely Load and ReLoad) than I think you'll love this album to death but for the rest of us, we'll just have to go back in our minds and remember the days when this band actually made music that could get us banging our heads as well as put us to sleep.
B000050HTO|5.0|I bought this CD for my 18-year-old son's birthday, and he absolutely loves it.  This has got to be the best collection of Bob Dylan's songs ever released.  It has everything from the old (Blowin' in the Wind) to the new (Things have changed.)  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
014028009X|4.0|Very funny.  A romance novel presented in a clever way.  Bridget Jones is adorable.  Actually quite like a lot of my single girl friends.
B000002U88|5.0|After releasing his stellar live album Nine Tonight, Bob Seger came back with the best album of his career, The Distance.  The album is full of vivid tales of the common man.  &quot;Even Now&quot; is a soaring rocker while &quot;Makin' Thunderbirds&quot; is a pulsating, Detroit flavored shaker that Bonnie Raitt provides backup vocals for.  On Against The Wind, Mr. Seger played a number of song with a country flavor.  He goes one step further on Rodney Crowell's &quot;Shame On The Moon&quot;.  The song has a hypnotic piano and great harmonies and moved up to number two on the charts which at the time was his highest charting single.  &quot;Love's The Last To Know&quot; is good ballad while &quot;House Behind A House&quot; shakes along.  &quot;Roll Me Away&quot; is classic Seger with tales of freedom and a powerful chorus.  &quot;Comin' Home&quot; is a tale of redemption while the closer &quot;Little Victories&quot; is a great portrait of the little moments in everyday life where one triumph's over life's obstacles.

0800177975|4.0|This is one of the top all-time underrated movies of all time.<br />It failed at the box office due to poor advance critic ratings. But what to real critics know?<br /> This movie is pure, classic Arnold, which a touch of fantasy thrown in!<br /> If you don't believe me, rent it first and see what I mean.  Then get back online and order this DVD.<br /> You'll agree with me I'm sure.
B000002U8U|4.0|Stranger In Town follows Night Moves in tone, but Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band up the ante.  The album's opener, &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot; is a blazing rocker with a soaring chorus that has a powderkeg energy.  &quot;Still The Same&quot; slows things down and with a melancholic piano riff that reminds you of a guy singing the blues in some piano bar.  The song became Mr. Seger's second top ten hit.  &quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot; has become a parody of itself as you can't go to a wedding or other similar events without hearing it.  It's an okay song that has taken on more notoriety than it deserves.  &quot;Feel Like A Number&quot; is a great song that nicely captures the feeling of being a small cog in a big wheel.  &quot;We've Got Tonight&quot; is a beautiful song that Mr. Seger's sings with heartfelt earnestness and is nothing like the retched version by Kenny Rogers &amp; Sheena Easton.  The album's closer, &quot;The Famous Final Scene&quot;, is one of his most ambitious songs and is great capper for the album.
B00003CXFU|3.0|I saw this film with my ex-boyfriend. He didn't like it very much, but I thought it was WONDERFUL. In my opinion, Erin (Julia Roberts) acted a LITTLE obscene, offensive, and vulgar at times, but I thought she was a very sweet and caring woman. George (Aaron Eckhart) was a funny guy at times, too. I especially liked Ed (Albert Finney). The reason I liked him is because he was so strict and business-like. The one person I couldn't stand was Theresa Dallavale (Veanne Cox). This was because I thought she was SUCH A SNOB! In conclusion, Julia truly shines as ERIN BROCKOVICH!
B000005JA8|5.0|The music is brilliant in its rhythmic complexity and intensity.  It's so rhythmically dense that it will take repeated listens until you start to appreciate them, for certain (it has for every other Beefheart fan in the world).  Once you catch the vibe, and enjoy this hybrid offsping of Rolling Stones-style rock, authentic blues vibe, big band swing, and dadaistic poetry, you'll be hooked.<br />The music and the band's performance are so intense that it's truly scary.  If you want to hear something intricate and brilliant, this is for you.  Don't give up on it, keep listening (maybe to Side 1) a dozen times or so, and you'll likely be hooked.<br />Being as it has 2 LPs worth to extend itself over, this is definitely Beefheart's best album.

B00004Z459|4.0|This is a great CD. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because there is a little bit too much screaming. I like songs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10    11 is cool, but its more just for fun. This is an awesome CD and you won't regret buying it.
B00000J7A2|5.0|This band's basic sound was tough blues-rock, and within that framework the tracks here are tight, diverse, and extremely imaginative.  Love songs and pop songs exist alongside straighter bluesy material and some hard rocking stuff.<br />And, there is some absolutely brilliant material on here that anticipates the rest of Beefheart's career.  &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; and &quot;Electricity&quot; are compositionally brilliant, and clearly the work of a musical genius.<br />The sound is better than on previous issues, for sure - less flange, less overring.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|LIZ FRASER HAS THE MOST UNIQUE VOICE IN MUSIC. SUCH A VOICE THAT &quot;LYRICS&quot; WERE NOT NEEDED. ROBIN GUTHRIES SHIMMERING GUITARS AND MUSIC FRAME HER VOICE PERFECTLY. &quot;ORANGE APPLED&quot; IS BEYOND BELIEF IN ITS EXECUTION. THEIR BEST MUSIC HAS AN ALMOST CHILDLIKE WONDER ABOUT IT. I AM ALSO GLAD THEY PUT IT IN CRONO ORDER SO WE CAN SEE THEIR PROGRESSION THRU THE YEARS. NICE JOB.
031286504X|5.0|That movie has been the best interpretation of this novel so far (even though it supposedly has nothing to do with it).  A close second would be &quot;The Homega Man&quot; episode of The Simpsons.  This is one of the many cornerstones of 20th Century horror which Matheson is responsible for.  The story is a character study of Robert Neville--the last human being in a world entirely populated by vampires--and all of the existential implications that entails.  Very well-written, creepy, and thought-provoking.
6305069611|5.0|I read some of the reviews, and don't be fooled by all these 12-15 year olds who say it's bad. I'm 16 now, and i first saw this movie when i was 14. I understood it as much as you can the first time you watch it, and if you're thinking while you're watching, then that's pretty much 100%. This movie raises questions about the society and government we live in, things we're exposed to, relationships, human desires...lots of questions. It is really a work of art. I was unfamiliar with the book, and director. And i still loved it. I am 16 years old and I still loved the movie. Yes... I am a rabid fan of David Bowie's, but even if he wasn't in it and I still watched it, I would have loved it. (Honestly though, David is perfect for the role. He's a very talented actor and added greatly to the movie.) This is a great movie for people who like to think and I recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a Bowie fan!
B0000214F0|3.0|Screenplay butcherings and unnecessary sex aside, this movie proves entertaining for those who find the enormously morbid amusing. While a man's rise to and corruption by absolute power is an old idea, both historically and artistically, \\"Caligula's\\" chronicling of one of the older and more well-known cases is rather fascinating, if only for the freakishness and outlandishly atrociousness of it. Having not read Vidal's original screenplay, I can only hope that it contained more than merely a generous helping of Suetonius' tabloid-style biography of the man backed by excessively provacative scenes of cruelty and public humiliation and death. Still, if you find the hyper-disturbing appealing (which I do, though not enough to watch this over and over), you may enjoy this.<br />Of course, there are the porno scenes, which add little, if anything, to story; for instance, the lesbian scene in Scene 19 of the DVD is completely unnecessary, while the portion involving Caligula's \\"Imperial Bordello\\" goes on far too long. Only one, I found, could not be almost completely skipped over: that of Tiberius' (Peter O'Toole) orgy room, which interlaces images too frantically with Tiberius' character development to miss entirely,though I do consent that his character--a mad, perverted tyrant--is quickly established. If unnecessary sex scenes--almost certainly tacked on by Guccione when Brass and the cast weren't looking; it's right there in the credits: \\"additionally footage directed by Bob Guccione...edited by Penthouse Productions\\"--do not appeal to you (though that may be your intention: purchasing porn cleverly disguised as sensational biopic), then you probably will want to rent or purchase the R-rated version.<br />A word on the quality: horrible. The footage is grainy, some lines are out of synch with lips, and I know I saw a hair in the film towards the end (on a DVD!). Still, the movie is watchable (in terms of visibility, anyway), although I felt the porn scenes had been touched up noticeably more than any others.<br />Acting, now. The performances by the principle actors (McDowell, van Savoy, and Mirren) make up for a piecemeal story of increasing morbidity. As said before, most of \\"Caligula\\" seems drawn more out of Suetonius' shock-value history than any screenplay, but this is rendered almost unnoticable by McDowell's laudable, nearly over-the top performance as the sociopathic mad dictator, which perhaps matches nicely the original ambition of the project, if not the outcome. At times (read, \\"frequently\\"), however, that performance comes dangerously close to McDowell's character Alex DeLarge in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (another, better bit of disturbing cinema, though not as grotesque).<br />Final review: Quality of film--weird and overly ambitious. Porn scenes--annoying, and mostly unnecessary. DVD quality--[not-good]. Acting--great, drawing attention away from a fragmented plot. Ultimately, if the truly disturbing is your thing: enjoy! Otherwise: STAY AWAY.
0380973650|5.0|I don't think I read Neil Gaiman's books as much as I live them.  Although my everynight dreams are invariably odd, American Gods has me dreaming thematically.  Pantheons, wise, animate corpses, and fantastical voyages inhabit my sleepy-time.  Had they not, I would have doubted Neil wrote the book.  His writing has always given my subconscious a sharp poke in the ribs.<br />Although the main plot itself is engrossing, the details are what really win me over.  I've always been a mythology and folklore buff, so the asides about the small lives of gods are particularly delicious.  Who would have thought transplanted efreets become cab-drivers?<br />American Gods is also a roadtrip book.  It takes you around to the little towns, big cities, greasy spoons, and tacky tourist traps that make up the United States.  It's also a tale of immigration, detailing the diaspora of the Europeans and Africans (and their deities).<br />I have the distinct feeling we may be seeing out-takes from this novel surfacing as stand-alone short stories.  If nothing else, American Gods is certainly going to set off an avalanche of fan fiction and trigger the imaginations of many writers.  I know it has my brain brimming with possibilities....
B00003CX5P|3.0|Isn't it odd that George Lucas claimed that he would not release Star Wars on DVD because he felt fans and viewers were being exploited?  This is comming from the mastermins who released the original Star Wars how many times?  My lord every year we had another reason to buy the same old trilogy just because it had a new cover.  Well here we are again and it appears George has given in to the DVD craze.  I guess I am a hypocrite for signing the petition to get it on DVD.  Anyway I am always wondering what George will do next.  To be quite honest he has been surprising me the past few years.  First off he re-releases (And ruins) the original three films and then creates this mediocre film.  Yes the action and graphics were exciting and yes the acting was lacking. (What was the point of Samuel L Jackson and Liam Neeson anyway?  Both of them acted as though they were dying and uninterested.)  What I find most compelling about this film and the subsequent release of it on DVD is that George really got lucky back in 77.  He wrote some stories that are not too different from many of the classical Sci Fi stories and got in touch with some great film writers and directors.  That is where we get the first three films.  But please George spare us on the next 2 because now that you are solo it is obvious you have no idea what you are doing.  The films are too childish and simple which is odd because in your books you can't come to a simple conclusion or come to a point without boring the reader with pages or drabble.  Anyone ever read his stuff???  If you are still alive I am amazed. The Star Wars films will always be my favorite films of all time but I must admit I was let down by this prequel and it could very well be the last film George ever makes if only to spare us true fans the agony.  Thanks for hearing out my complaining.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Not many movies will make someone laugh, cry, and dance around the theater like Moulin Rouge. I should know; i saw it twice and did all three (both times). The music is spectacularly performed, and the acting is phenominal. This movie brings out the best in both of the starring actors, and is witty, romantic, suspenseful, funny, and beautiful. A must-see!!
B000007VCM|5.0|I was never a fan of the Cult and had no idea who they were when I mistakenly bought the &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; record single back in 1985. I had figured I might as well listen to the record before returning it. I ended up buying the record at least two more times from the damage that playing the song over and over again did to it.<br />Years have since passed and it is still my all-time favorite song. The song is simply hypnotic and is as close to a &quot;visual&quot; experience as I have ever had listening to music. The decievingly simple lyrics call out against the complex layers of sound that surround them. Together, they fuel the hearth in the album's central them and climax, Love.<br />Love is a tribute to what can be accomplished when musicians submit their mind and soul completely to their craft, creating a sound that is pure in its cause and poetry most of all. If this was not the case in the production of this album, then greatness simply sprang forth of its own accord and for its own purposes.<br />Once in a very short while, an album comes along that is required listening. Don't miss this one!
B00005BCK6|5.0|Volume 25 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Star Trek contains two stories showcasing superior writing and offering plenty of action.<br />A Piece of the Action remains one of Trek's most popular episodes.  In essence, it's a time travel episode, without the time travel, which frees the story from the usual &quot;Don't alter the future&quot; constraints.  The hands of Gene L. Coon, who co-wrote this episode, are evident in the colorful writing, and in the banter between the characters.  Deliberately, the Iotians are all made to speak using a nonstop stream of 1920s cliches.  When Kirk adopts these cliches, and eventually persuades Spock to adopt them, the course is set for maximum comedy.<br />By Any Other Name is mostly standard action fare, involving the Enterprise being hijacked by an invading force of Kelvans from another galaxy.  These esoteric aliens have taken Human form to be able to function in a human environment.  The solution is to introduce them to the pleasures of the senses, which creates a chance for James Doohan to shine as Scotty gets a Kelvan, and himself, drunk.  This episode also highlights one of Kirk's finest characteristics: his willingness to forgive.  Even after the Kelvan leader has killed one of his crew, Kirk is willing to extend the hand of friendship and offer the Federation's help.<br />Both sound and picture are fine.

I've been a DM fan for years, and was thrilled that they'd released a new album.<br />The first time I listened to it, I was so disappointed that I almost wanted to cry.  I told everyone that it just wasnt very good, and couldn't believe it from one of my favorite bands.<br />Over the past few weeks, I've listened to it here and there, and I'm now convinced that this is a very, very cool collection of songs, and plan to retract my previous statements.  It's classic DM in so many ways, and yet, quite different.<br />I ask any detractors to give it another listen.  It grows on you, it really does!

6300185311|4.0|This is a good Doris/Rock romp.....but the star of this picture for me is Paul Lynde!  As the over-the-top cemetery plot salesman, Lynde steals each of the few scenes he's in during this flick!  Tony Randall, as usual, provides \\"rock\\"-solid support of the main characters.  But Lynde....Just thinking of his part in this film cracks me up!!  His initial scene with Rock must be watched at least 10 times!  Lynde is so happy with his job of selling cemetery plots, he nearly bursts when he gushes to Rock ...... \\"You want to surprise her! Well this will give her a real thrill!!  It makes a very thoughtful gift!!\\"  And don't forget, when you purchase from Green Hills, Paul will throw in the first year's gardening at no additional cost! (\\"How's that hit ya??!!\\")  :)  :)
0380788624|5.0|Cryptonomicon is an amazing book that oozes personality and detail.  Quite possibly Stephenson's best work to date, Cryptonomicon weighs in at a moster ~1000 pages.  Is it worth it?  Quite simply yes.  The book takes som time to get going, but when it does it truly hums.  The only part that I found to be disappointing is the ending, but hopefully that will be aleviated sometime in the near future when Stphenson publishes the sequel.

B0000039LE|5.0|The first always seems to be the best. Halloween is no different. This original 1978 classic still shines today as a masterpiece of the horror genre! We see no blood, no gore, no grotesque creatures....just the ever-chilling \\"shape\\" of Michael Myers and his cutlery!  The aura and atmosphere of this film is so vivid! And together with that unforgettable music...a classic was bound to be born. The eerieness of the whole film is hard to put into words. Even the scenes shot in daylight will scare you (especially with that music score to accompany them). It's been copied a million times since, but never been surpassed. The new DVD version is bound to be even better!!
B000051VWW|5.0|I loved this CD! Sensual and soothing, it's perfect for a relaxed evening, or a long drive. Worth every penny.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I recently found myself compiling a personal CD containing cuts from the four most recent RADIOHEAD albums (The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac).  I was not surprised to see that I wound up with no less than five cuts from OK Computer.  I enjoy all four albums immensely (as well as Pablo Honey, the first RH CD I ever owned), but I must say this is the ONE to have if your are limited to one.  RADIOHEAD is the perfect combo of retro and avant garde.  I can only salute what they have done to reinvigorate modern rock music!  My personal favorite, &quot;Lucky&quot;, has to be one of the all time masterpiece four-minute songs ever written in a rock style.  I think you will be pleased with this album even if you have never even heard of RADIOHEAD but are a fan of the genre.  Enjoy!
4789007758|5.0|First of all, you need both this book and the beginner's guide (Also available).  The index in the back of this volume references both books and occasionally you will look up a grammar phrase and find it's in the blue beginner's volume.<br />Expensive, but a necessary reference.  My main gripe is that it's sometimes not obvious how to look up a phrase and i spend a lot of time digging through index.  A little standardization would help (Ex: yarou to suru... would you look this up under &quot;you to suru&quot;, or &quot;to suru&quot;, or &quot;suru&quot;?)<br />The appendices offer good usage info on topics as compound verbs and counters.  I use it as an English counterpart to some of the japanese profieciency exam grammar reviews that are available in Japan in Japanese.
B000002UBB|5.0|I was surprised by the lack of attention this album has (only nine reveiws?)  I thought it was great!!  I'm only 18, but I have a tendency to &quot;borrow&quot; the albums my dad has gathering dust in our music cabinet.<br />Steve Miller is the ultimate relaxor.  Put his music on, and I can almost guarantee you, you WILL be feeling better by the end of the album!  This one is definitely no exception.  It's got a lot of good stuff on it.  My absolute favorite, however, is Serenade.  Absolutely beautiful!  Just sit back, close your eyes, and put your troubles behind you.  THANK YOU STEVE!!!!!
0425098478|5.0|Bought the book for a management study group after having read it several years ago.  Excellent tool for new managers.  Easy reading in parable format.  Lots of follow-up work available by Blanchard and others.
1881273156|5.0|This book opened my eyes to the different types of love.  I have been married for 17 years and it changed my marriage.  I recommend this book to anyone who feels that their mate is not &quot;filling their love tank&quot;.  If you are craving for love from your mate, read this book - then get them to read it.
6304675348|5.0|It was better than I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. It was better than I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, better than EVIL DEAD, better than, SCREAM 2 AND 3. It is my favorite horror movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved it, w/ a mix of pure horror, and mystery, Scream is the gotta see horror movie. BOTTOM LINE: Scream rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6304712936|5.0|I found this movie to be beautiful and riveting. I love the beauty and detail of the eighteenth century atmosphere, particularly because it's my favorite era in history. Maybe it wasn't completely historically correct, but I personally do not watch films to be educated and nitpicky, but to be entertained. Take it for what it is, which is a beautifully photographed and composed film offering a great feast for your senses.<br />I liked the confusion surrounding the essence of Salieri's character, because while he's jealous and insulted by the arrogance and talent of Mozart, he's also intrigued and strangely drawn to him with an almost obsessive reverence. The film was long, don't get me wrong, but the whole plot was successfully executed for the sake of sacrificing the audience's attention span. <br />This film also brought about a new interest in Mozart and classical music for me, which is also why this film gets five stars. The compositions and planning for the film were spectacular. I don't even want to think about how much they budgeted on this piece of eye candy. Instead, just watch the film and sink into a different era of time.<br />PS: I hardly think getting off your butt for one minute to flip a DVD over is worth giving the film one star. How lazy can you get, people?
B00003CY5H|3.0|The movie was ok.  The acting was acceptable with some exceptional moments by Norton.  The major problems I had were with the speed of the film.  It dragged except for the very end and the end was predictable.  Realistically, I would have been happy renting this movie in a couple months.  If you are a real Norton/De Niro fan, you may find it worth the $8 to get in the door, otherwise wait for the video because the film is not worth seeing in the theater.
B000002I77|5.0|This is by far one of the best fusion albums out there.  Cobham brings musicians Jan Hammer and Tommy Bolin  together, and the result is Psycho Hendrix meets Miles  Davis with a twist of funky James Brown. The album stands out because its not difficult to listen to like some other jazz albums. The drum grooves are as funky as they get. The music is not smothered with too many horns. Tommy Bolin's guitar work is miles ahead of its time. Extra Note - Some rap artists have taken samples of <br />this album (Red Baron).
B00000055E|5.0|Ok, I'm gonna keep this real simple, if you like tupac's music at all then this album,is just another great piece of work!with exploding tracks like:I'm losin it,Wonder if heaven's got a ghetto,do for love,and other songs are just the beginning to understanding this album,this is what we harcore pac fans like to call; a page in the life of a legend. I love every song,and every track pac has ever wrote,he's perhaps,no,no,he is the Greatest rap singer of all time,so don't hesitate to cop this album.
B000005ALN|5.0|Older is one of the best albums from the 1990's in my opinion. It was a long wait since his last album in 1990, but this fan wasn't disapointed. The death of his lover caused George to reevaulate his life, and this deeply introspective album is very dark and depressing, but it's truly beautiful in its own ways. His words come from wisdom and experience, you can feel his pain in each song. There wasn't a song that didn't resonate in my soul when listening to this album, even to this day. The album is very jazzy in a sense, and there isn't much uptempo material other than the hit Fastlove, and another single from the album, Star People. <br />The songs are so beautifully written, and sung with every bit of passion and emotion that sits in his soul. He poured himself into this album, and its truly remarkable.  Songs like Jesus to a Child will stand as classics forever. Other truly great songs here are It Doesnt Really Matter, You Have Been Loved, and Older, only not a filler track is to be found anywhere on this collection.<br />This album is perfect when you are feeling sad, and want to understand yourself. Just turn out the lights, sit by the fire, have a glass of wine and enjoy this truly compelling collection of material, its his best yet.
0385484518|5.0|What more can be said about this astounding story?  I have purchased copies for my entire family, and about a dozen friends.  Morrie has lessons to teach young and old alike, and many are the same.  One of the most touching books I have ever read.
0696204800|5.0|WOW!  This book just arrived, and I'm about to see if I can buy it in hardcover.  It is far and away the best basic quilting book I've ever seen.  In addition to helpful tips, it includes 501 blocks -- a color photo of each, a very clear diagram (showing where each colored/printed fabric would go), special directions for assembly (where applicable), etc.  I can't recommend it highly enough -- and can't believe that I'm this excited about a BH&amp;G book (not that I expected there to be anything wrong wiht one -- just that I never dared hope that it could be this wonderful).
B000002HRE|1.0|Let's be honests with ourselves: almost no band can keep releasing good records forever. If that was the case, hou could people divide between average records and masterpieces ? METALLICA is not exception to this rule. At one point or another along the road, a band's creativity in songwriting begins to decline. THis doesn't is necessarily  represented by accute drops in sales. Sometimes a band's common release, worst than previous, sells more than any other release by that artist (example: Bruce Springsteen's BORN IN THE USA). Of course the band will deny that, after all they're professionals whod epend upon the quality ( or marketing) of their music for surviving. Let's see some examples: 1) AC/DC - after Back in Black nothing was the same - according to some, even after Bon Scott died; 2) IRON MAIDEN - after SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON nothing was the same; 3) BLACK SABBATH - after Ozzy left or according to some after HEAVEN AND HELL with Dio, nothing was the same; 4) VAN HALEN - after 5150, or according to some after David Lee Roth left. With Metallica, this happened after AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, or, according to some, after MASTER OF PUPPETS. It's clear for all to see, there's no chance to deny the fact that METALLICA went downwards musically after that,. I'm not saying this is due to becoming soft or whatever. The songs simply just didn't have the same quality anymore.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Even if you're not into science fiction, this is a great movie to watch, if not own.  In a society where nobody lives over 30 years of age, it's interesting to see how humanity has evolved.  It seems that almost everybody is OK with dying prematurely at age 30 - it shows how callous humanity can become when they are &quot;going along with the crowd&quot; or (unwittingly or not) become involved in &quot;groupthink.&quot;  This movie show how these problems can be avoided; it is possible to break out of the mold.  Although it can be painful at times, it is possible to be an individual within a socialistic environment.<br />This movie is a classic!  The DVD version is especially clear, and it gives some good features with it.  I had hoped it might include some of the deleted scenes, but these seem to be largely lost.  Although I remember seeing parts of this movie years ago, I appreciate it more as an adult.  Now that I'm older, I can understand the meaning behind this movie.<br />I encourage everybody to at least watch this movie once.  At times, the effects, scenery, and characters are a little cheesy or outdated or two-dimensional.  But, it was made in the mid-70's, so what can you expect?!  Right now, at Amazon, it's selling for a really good price - well worth the money!
067144901X|5.0|First read as a library book, my baby and I enjoyed this book so much I had to buy it and I am now purchasing it again as a gift.

0590353403|5.0|J.K. Rowlin create a masterpiece with her first installment in the Harry Potter series.  This is a truly fascinating book about a young boy who finds out he is a magician.  All his life, all he has known is torment and mistreatment, but now he has found where he truly belongs.<br />In this book, young Harry tries to live up to his name and fame as the &quot;boy who lived.&quot;  Harry knows nothing of his past, except from what other tell him - he also knows nothing about the magical world.  He finds that a completely different world lives next to his own &quot;muggle&quot; life, just out of sight.  Now, Harry is on his own to make friends, learn magic, and try to understand his incredible luck!<br />I thoroughly recommend this book to readers of all ages.  Although some people are against this book, I feel that adequate training for a child can help them distiguish between reality and fantasy.  For me, this book is an A+!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I don't usually enjoy country music, but while watching the movie, I found myself wondering when the soundtrack would be in stores. My favorites are Down to the River to Pray, and I'll Fly Away.  There's alot of life in these old songs.
0767802659|4.0|The plot is a little thin, and the acting is a little mediocre; but for some reason, I actually liked this movie.  As most people know, the movie is based loosely on the book of the same title by Robert Heinlein.  &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; contains special effects are that are pretty good, and the &quot;bugs&quot; are pretty nifty to watch.  I really could care less if the movie supposedly has a deeper, subtler meaning; after all, the reason I watch movies is to be entertained, and this movies certainly does that.
0679879269|5.0|This is the ONLY book that has ever made me cry. That says a lot. Pullman brings his earth shattering series to a spellbinding end. It is truly fantastic. This book also challenged me to think about my faith, and my morals, and my goals. Pullman brought the book to the best ending imaginable, however sad it was. To those who think that this is a sacrilege, I strongly disagree. Pullman does not attack faith, just ignorance. Those who do not question, who follow because they are told to follow, are the root of the evil in this book. Besides, this is only a book. A work of fiction. It is not the end all, and it doesn't have to change what you believe. However, I am strongly disposed to agree with many of his views. I truly adore this book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Pullman's strongest truth; one of the strongest truths I have ever come across actually is that where we are right now is most important. Not the past or the afterlife; this is moment is the greatest of them all. You will not regret reading this book.

0790729628|1.0|The director didn't know what he was doing when it came to editing this film, the producers did a much better job. My problem is that I loved the original and hate with a passion this version. Why don't they release the orginal movie so I can throw my directors cut in the trash.  I would give this DVD a zero star if I could.  The soul of the movie is gone.  I'm a believer that androids with this level of ability have as much right to live as humans.  The fact that we think they are our slaves and property with no rights is outragous.  Equal rights for machines are coming in the near future and a man-machine war for equal rights is ahead (see Terminator I/II).  The union of harision ford and the replicant in the ending of the movie is soooo significant.  The beginning of the next phase of man-vs-machine.
1587880490|5.0|Awesome book!!!  It really helps remind you of what is truly important in life. You can truly relate to the characters. We can get so caught up in things that do not really matter in life.  This book reminds you of what does. Family, Friends, Love.
B000000OTY|4.0|of all the double live albums i have listened to and found enjoyable, this one ranks high on the list.  It exhibits some of Grabriel's great songs, both commercial and non-released.  The one ingrediant, however, that allows me to put it on the proverbial pedastal is the vocals of Paula Cole.  What a great series of performances she gives. Her voice on Don't Give up, and the now legendary live version of In Your Eyes enhances and completes these songs in a way that is missing on the original tracks.(although they stand well by themselves). The live cuts of Blood of Eden, Solsbury Hill, and Washing of the Water (to just name a few) remind the listener just how great these songs are lyrically.   One great aspect this live album has that i liked was the first song that was selected.  This live version of Come Talk to Me is fantastic and sets the tone for the rest of the album.   If you are a Peter Grabriel fan, this album is a must.  Although is leaves out some Grabriel Mainstays, it does have a great song selection, and is musically as entertaining as any other Peter Grabriel album out there.
B00003CX6P|4.0|Writer-director Anthony Minghella (\\"The English Patient\\") builds the suspense slowly and stealthily in his handsome adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's classic thriller. Set in the most picturesque parts of Italy during the late 1950s, the movie focuses on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a resourceful young American who's hired by a wealthy New York shipbuilder to bring the older man's playboy son (Jude Law) back to America. Unfortunately, the son doesn't want to go home. Even more unfortunately, neither does Ripley. As an ingratiating nobody who becomes dangerously addicted to lifestyles of the rich and fatuous, Damon somehow manages to remain sympathetic even when he behaves like a sociopath. Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett make the most of secondary roles, while Jude Law (\\"Gattica,\\" \\"Wilde\\") makes a serious bid for stardom with his breakthrough performance as a fatally careless voluptuary.
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's star-studded romantic comedy adventure is the best escapist entertainment there is. It anticipates the thrills of the James Bond genre but recasts the hero as the Hollywood equivalent of an everyman (it's easy for a guy to imagine he's Cary Grant, right?).<br />Boring old advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) signals a bellman in a hotel lounge to ask where the nearest telephone is. He is mistaken by two henchmen for a fellow named George Kaplan (not to be confused with famous Jazz radio host Michael Kaplan). He rises and walks toward the phone only to be escorted by the thugs to a mysterious mansion.<br />Examining this initial action sheds light on what's so delightful about the entire movie. The henchmen are trying to track down a man named George Kaplan. They don't know what he looks like but they know he's staying at this specific hotel so they have him paged. Roger Thornhill appears to respond to the page so they nab him. The coincidence seems innocent enough and the action of all parties involved plausible enough that we're never challenged to suspend our disbelief.<br />At the same time, the underlying story that sets the coincidence in motion is something that could only be cooked up by a wily screenwriter. In this case, Ernest Lehman. It's a shaggy dog story that will cast its unwitting protagonist into a world of international espionage, into the arms of icy blonde du jour Eva Marie Saint, and clambering over Abe Lincoln's nose on Mount Rushmore.<br />The script, peppered with sexual innuendo, suits Cary Grant's sly, sexy style. James Mason as his sophisticated nemesis is a perfect match. We're asked to believe that Eva Marie Saint's character who falls in love with Grant, once fell in love with Mason. It's not too much of a stretch.<br />Working on this gorgeous, big budget, big star production must have made Hitchcock yearn for simplicity because he followed it with the $800,000 Psycho.<br />The road picture aspect ofthe film allows Alfred Hitchcock to strut his directorial stuff in locations as open as a corn field in Indiana and as tight as a railroad train sleeping compartment. We visit the United Nations Building, Union Station in Chicago, the Mount Rushmore observatory...it's almost like taking a vacation. Don't miss the bus.

Not too happy about the way women are viewed and treated, but this one's funny along the lines of a manic Kubrick ride, if he ever ventured into this territory [slightly with Nicholson in &quot;The Shining&quot;].<br />AND watch out for Christian Bale - rising talent!

0790729725|4.0|The one and only thing that kept this film from getting a 5 star review is the fact that the DVD is not up to par.  You have to flip the thing over during the movie.  Considering the fact that you can get the whole movie on 1 tape this is totally unacceptable.  The film itself though is marvelous.  I consider it one of if not THE best mafia movies ever made.  Everyone needs to see this film at least one time in their life...if for no other reason than to be familiar with some of its often imitated lines.  &quot;Funny? Funny how?&quot;

0064407667|1.0|Where's the beef?  This book is all style and no substance.  The plot is predictable, the characterizations skimpy.  The writing style whets the appetite, but upon digestion, the book leaves the reader hungry for a better read.  My 10 year old bookworm turned down an offer of more books in the series after reading this one.  Upon reading the book myself, I agree it's not worth the time.  How disappointing.
B0000029LG|5.0|Well this is one group of cd's that I truly love.  MJ has put together a wonderful collection of songs.  While I do wish he had placed songs like &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; on this LP it is still one of the better if not best collections of his music around.   Although I personally don't like the second disc nearly as much as the first I still don't believe that is any reason to keep this LP from being awarded the full five stars.  As I have said this LP is wonderful from the older songs &quot;Don't stop till you get enough&quot; to the newer songs &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;.  For any MJ fan that doesn't have his most of his songs already this is defintely worth your time and money.
B00001SIES|3.0|Showbiz is more of a showcase of Muse's roots. The influences of both Nirvana and Radiohead are quite obvious, and detract a little from the songs if you are familiar with those bands. However, the raw talent of the trio is the album's saving grace. <br />Matt Bellamy uses his voice to great effect, and although his falsetto is cause for many of the Radiohead comparisons, he produces an intensity which is quite different to Thom Yorke's subtly crafted vocals. Not a classic, but definitely an album which most bands would kill to produce.
0425180638|4.0|This book picks up where &quot;Black Notice&quot; left off. DR Kay Scarpetta and crew are working against time to find and international serial killer. It takes you through some harrowing twists and turns but was fairly predictable about halfway through.  As always there are the antics of Pete Marino.  His character always has something to say and he always offsets the refinement of Dr. Scarpetta very well.  This is proof that opposites attract.  I recommend this book if you had read Patricia Cornwall before.  If  not, read her novels in order so you will have the full feel of where the characters came from and where they are going to at this time.
0553214632|1.0|I find it difficult to be able to rate this book in the conventional manner of attributing the books quality on a scale of 1 to 5.   But I have and I've given it 'one'.<br />I wondered onto this book site via a 'greatest books of all time' reading list which linked to this page.  One of the few books on the list which I'd actually managed to read.  My earlier statement of difficulty in ranking this book lies in its historical importance verses entertainment - the former immense, the latter minuscule.<br />I'm a Zoological graduate and so the importance and reverence of Darwin's The Origin of Species have been fundamental to everything I've done in the last 3 years, however, when I actually sat down and decided to read the original text I got no more than halfway through the book before deciding I'd had enough.<br />This work being in the greatest 100 books of all time is wholly justified - it is a great book.  But the potential reader must keep in mind that Darwin wrote this book having to carefully detail the concept of evolution - decent with modification, his critics would be many and any flaws would be leapt upon to discredit his heresy.  However, now we (most of us) understand and accept his teaching and so don't need to sit through pages of him waffling on about pigeon breeders to accept what he's saying. <br />If I may be so bold to summarise Darwin (my lectures would no doubt crucify me for such defamation);  Creature is created, creature reproduces, one creature offspring  deviates from the norm which gives it a slight advantage over its rivals (slightly bigger teeth for killing, slightly longer ergo faster legs for running away), this enables the offspring's genes to spread wider then its competitors so become more common, this mutant offspring will reproduce until further useful mutations give greater advantage subsequent offspring thus spreading, the process continues indefinitely.  And so, that's basically it, an important rule but please don't bother sitting through the entire book to learn this, it really isn't worth the effort.
B0000524CY|4.0|Don't get me wrong I would give it a 5 but I want to be as honest as possible with this one. To be completely honest if you didn't get the original before the Never Before Seen one you really haven't missed much. All you really missed was her crawling down the stairs backwards although that was a very excellent scene. The rest of the never before seen footage was mostly conversasions. This movie although as a whole is a classic. The only problem with it really is the first half an hour. Some movies you have to pay attention to what goes on in the begining but most of the time they run slow and this one does. She damn near has to [urinate] on a rug to get the audiences attention but when she does that's it. This movie is a horro classic and will always be. Infact it originally hit theatre's with an x rating and was so powerfull that it almost cause two Miscarriages at the time of it's release. Very good film and highly recommended.
0425180638|2.0|I found this book so tedious and such a departure from Ms. Cornwell's previous work that I was quite disappointed. The 1st person, present tense writing style has always driven me batty; it always feels like the story is being told AT you rather than told TO you. Some authors may believe that it's a more &quot;personal&quot; style of writing, but I think it's a poor attempt on the authors part to give the reader a deeper sense of being part of the characters life, when in reality it feels more like a cheap trick or a cop out.<br />I would really like to see Ms. Cornwell branch out with these characters. How about a book where Kay is a supporting character but Lucy is the main character? That could be interesting, as long as she ditches the present tense writing style, and lets the characters get back to basics, with her normally strong, willful and energized women.
0525945636|3.0|The plot synopsis that I read interested me enough that I decided to read the book myself after the person I bought it for had finished the book.  I'm not usually a spy/thriller fan, and have never before read any of Ken Follett's books - but I did enjoy this one.  I found it entertaining, and was interested enough in the story and the characters to want to know what was going to happen next.  I was particularly intrigued by the use of the U.S. space program as a major part of the story.  I was too young to remember any of the major history that was a part of this story, but did follow the later NASA flights.  And, I do very much remember the Apollo 11 flight.
B00003CXA4|5.0|'Gandhi' is the most authentic movie I have seen on a political figure's life. The storyline from the beginnings in South Africa right thorugh the independence struggle to the final dramatic moments are all shown in a grandeour rarely seen in movies. The movie keeps the storyline on Gandhi throughout and it makes for more realistic and gripping viewing. Its shows the independence struggle in its full glory. The acting is very realistic, specially by Ben Kingsley and Rohini Hattangadi. The number of Oscars for the movie in most of the categories are a testament to the accuracy and vision of the director in bringing the life and times of Gandhi to the big screen accurately and truthfully.
B00005J9M1|5.0|WOW!  I have the original &quot;Very&quot; in the fab orange plastic box, so for me, disc one of this particular dual set is redundant, but OH - DISC TWO!!  With three previously unreleased versions of PSB songs, a couple of demos, some really great remixes and a few of the less air-played singles, this new set is simply beautiful.  I've had it in hand now for three days and I've already almost worn out cut 9 &quot;Falling&quot; and cut 3 &quot;Confidential&quot; on disc two.<br />If you've even been a &quot;sort-of&quot; PSB fan over the years, you HAVE to have this two disc set.  If you're a hard core Boy, you've already got it!<br />Go, Go Neil and Chris...!
0792841859|5.0|&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; is one of the great American crime movies. It's alive, provocative, intelligent and filled with incredible realism seldom seen in typical crime pictures. It is also one of the best portraits of the racial climate in America, especially in the South, in the 60s. Director Alan Parker (Midnight Express, Evita) does not direct a chicken-job here and indeed shows an unrestrained look at the realities of the story. He also has a great, gritty visual style here in the photography that gives the movie a better sense of the atmosphere in the story. The screenplay is gripping because of the suspense in scenes of dialogue between characters, and the tension in the mystery. The performances are also great. Willem Dafoe has an authoritative edge and Gene Hackman comes off as a guy who's seen it all. The characters are also sharply drawn and feel real, the entire movie feels real and has some scenes that could have come out of a documentary. &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; also reveals truths about the air-headedness of racism and how ugly and violent racist views can become, in a way it shows how racism can cause decay in a society. But this is not just a historical lesson, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; is a red-blooded, gritty police drama that also dissects the workings of crime and the people who conspire in crime. You get your money's worth because Parker has made an important film about racism in the 60s, yes, but also has packaged it as an entertaining, gut-wrenching thriller with unpredicatble twists and turns, hateful villains and driven men trying to solve a crime. This is a great movie that deserves more than one viewing.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Almost certainly you'll find the plot a little hard to follow, but that's not what's important here.  Snatch is a terrific movie broken down into bite size chucks.  Think of Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail (except remove the slapstick and insert London gangsters) and you'll have the right idea.  Even though everything hangs together, each scene is enjoyable by itself.  You could start this movie at almost any point and just start laughing your head off.<br />What amused me most about \\"Snatch\\" was Guy Ritchie's use of incredibly brief flashbacks and cut scenes as a means of characterization.  Franky \\"Four Fingers\\", a gangster who also happens to be a compulsive gambler, is a perfect example.  Every time somebody mentions gambling around Franky, we a treated to a quick scene of Franky's eyes glazing over, followed by pictures of him ridiculously drunk in a Las Vegas casino all set to the tune of \\"Viva Las Vegas\\".  Very funny!  As always Brad Pitt is hilarious.  You should defiantly check this movie out.
1881273156|3.0|After reading this book, I'm not sure the author actually accomplished what he set out to do. Yes, there are different forms of communicating, anyone who has been in a long term relationship knows that (or should). But the real difficulty is in learning how to speak (or to listen) in one of the other languages. I'm not sure if this book really addresses the &quot;How to express&quot; aspect of the problem in a very usefull way.
6301161572|5.0|I probably have 15 different videos of Don G. and this is just about the best available..., and even though Sir Thomas Allen has always been my favorite Don, Raimondi is comparable! Kiri is perfection and Berganza a joy. The production is just first rate!! If you can have only one Don G., make it this one!  It is now May, 2002 and this is on DVD which I haven't seen yet as I have laser disc version.  There is a new DVD of Cologne production with Allen, Vaness, James, etc. which is really terrific!  The 4 I recommend are Raimondi's, Ramey's and both Allen's.  I did not like the DG production with Siepi from 1954 now on DVD.  I haven't changed my mind on this version, either, as I loved the look of the film and thought the performances fine although Raimondi still isn't as good as Allen as the Don in my opinion.
0440180295|5.0|I reread this in one sitting the other night as I have periodically for some 20 years. Slaughterhouse-Five was the first book to really make me think as a young teenager. After all that time and at least six or seven reads I still laugh out loud at jokes I can see coming for pages, and I'm still moved for days or weeks after. Billy Pilgrim's innocence and sadness and Vonnegut's humanity are still astonishingly pure and beautiful.<br />Don't let the fragmented timeline of Billy's tale put anybody off; it's there to juxtapose disconnected events and thereby create illustrations that are creative and funny and satirical and moving. When available fictional devices cannot make his point, Vonngut puts one or another fantastic tale in the pen of alter ego Kilgore Trout, or brings in the Tralfamadorians for a few life lessons.<br />Vonnegut is an unparalleled storyteller with a style that is at once easy and deep, like a wonderful aunt or uncle with biting humor and years of wisdom quietly regaling late into the evening. The tale he tells in Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the great stories of all time for it's unbelievable creativity and it's quiet, gentle and powerful sense of humanity. A masterpiece.
078062999X|5.0|I loved this production and all the wonderful actors in it except for poor Jack Lemmon, who just can't deliver Shakespeare.  Billy Crystal was surprisingly good and of course, Kenneth and Derek were perfect!!  This didn't get very good reviews when it came out but I saw it and immediately bought the LD.  The setting and photography were excellent as well.  Suspensful and the best available on video, including, LO's version in black/white.  If you love this play, buy this! Kenneth should make more like this and &quot;Much ado..&quot;.
B00004U28G|4.0|I saw this movie when I was 11 years old and thought it was great back then. I watched it again recently and thought it was still funny and the cars where still cool. The story isn't the greatest in the world, but the actors and actresses looked like they had a great time making the movie, especially when you watch the credits at the end! The Black Lamborghini in this movie still looks fanantasic - I forgot how much I liked that car! The movie is pretty short and there are laughs throughout! This isn't your Oscar winning movie, but it is a movie that seemed like it would be a lot of fun to make and be in. The DVD looks very good and the DD 5.1 sound is also good. This movie is worth the price - cheap!
0679777547|3.0|Roman Polanski's delightful film, The Ninth Gate, is based on about half of this book. Fortunately, it's the better half. The novel concerns the parallel investigations of Lucas Corso, a solitary, cynical and not over-scrupulous book dealer, into two highly desirable items. One is a manuscript chapter from The Three Musketeers; the other is a seventeenth-century grimoire for calling up Lucifer. When the two mysteries converge, the novel makes an amusing point about the contribution of the reader to a given text, although not quite amusing enough to climax nearly three hundred pages of plot. There are also several too many cute postmodernist quips of the &quot;I feel like I'm living out the plot of a novel&quot; variety for my liking, but the prose is a pleasure and the story highly original despite the many literary references. This book also features the Devil in one of his more sympathetic guises (shown in the film reading How to Win Friends and Influence People) as the spirit of freedom, intelligence, curiosity and chutzpa; and the ending is most satisfactory. The Club Dumas is quality entertainment.
B0000024W3|2.0|Dylan has produced so many albums that he is allowed a few bad ones. This is one of those. It sounds like he didn't give a damn when he made this one. Only for collectors.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for this extremely insightful treatise that dispels the prejudicial notion of racial superiority. Guns, Germs &amp; Steel is fact-based, detailed and thorough - without being overly scientific - and gives us an intellectually honest, totally plausible explanation for the uneven rates of development among the world's cultures. I consider this book a `must read' for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of human history.
0786889284|5.0|I discovered Lou Boldt and Ridley Pearson in The Angel Maker.  I am now reading the series and &quot;Beyond Recognition&quot; does not disappoint.  Pearson writes such a believable detective.  He is not just a &quot;stud&quot; or just a &quot;hard-nose&quot; or one dimmensional in any way.  He is the total package.  Not just that, but the stories themselves are so involving.  This book really has it all.  Characters.  Dialogue.  Driving plot.  Twists and turns.  Human element.  Suspense.  Surprise.  Pearson delivers the whole meal right down to the cherry on top.  I cannot wait to read the rest of the Boldt/Matthews series to see what he has in store for me next.
B00005JCA9|5.0|I bought the Notting Hill DVD when it first was released.  Love the movie.  For me it's one of those movies I can watch over and over again for various reasons.  Great cast, rich characters, etc.  HOWEVER...I can't stand when I put out ($) for a DVD and a few months later, another DVD with more features hits the shelves.  So now the dilemma is, do I spend even more money for the new DVD just so I can have the few extras I didn't get on the first one?  Just put out the best DVD in the first place!  Or make the extras available without having to buy the movie again.
B00004XPPB|5.0|I picked up this book in the library and could not put it down and decided I HAD to own this DVD. Although the movie differs from the book on a few points, it is still true to the story and tells it with such emotion. You can feel Donnie's heartbreak at betraying his friend and you can see the hurt in the &quot;wiseguys&quot; who don't want to believe Donnie was from the other side. Excellent movie, excellent book, buy them both!
6304712499|2.0|...but instead the movie version of Spawn is nothing but a disappointment.  The special effects and makeup are great, as is John Leguizamo as Clown, but there is a lot of overacting and the storyline is boggled and shameful for something out of the Spawn universe.  It gets two stars for special effects/makeup, and John Leguizamo, other than that, it goes right down the crapper.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Keith Jarrett's virtuosity in the solo piano format was previously displayed in his fully-improvised solo concert series (the Koln, La Scala concerts among others) and classical piano interpretations (Shostakovich, Bach and others). This recording is a sharp contrast to his previous records: tackling the jazz standards repertoire from the early 20th century era in a solo setting.<br />After some absence as he is afflicted with CFS, Keith Jarrett is back; more intimate, more down to earth and more approachable than his previous recordings. He intensity of his playing (and muted singing) in his trio standards recordings is directed into very thoughtful, almost wistful and dreaming solo interpretation of the classics.<br />It's evident from the first notes of &quot;I Loves You Porgy&quot; that this is Keith Jarrett's sensibilities in a way never shown before. His rendition of &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot; is very touching and introspective, in a medley with an original composition as the encore. Dedicated to his wife, this recording shows the fire of passion in him.<br />If you like his standards trio recordings or his improvised solo piano, I can't recommend this record enough. Buy it!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies ever made, and I only hope the upcoming two sequels will be just as good.  If you love The Matrix, check out the movie Dark City, it came out the year before and its ever better than The Matrix.
B00003CXCS|5.0|This is one of my favorites movies, it's so great and i love it.  I can't stop watching it over and over.  The songs are very good and the storyline is very nice.  This is what i call a real good classic that you must have in home.
B00002IJ48|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best home videos ever made, &quot;Video Bank&quot; captures Alice in Chains greatest accomplishments, their videos aren't just music clips, but forms of fantastic art.  The documentary in the beginning is pretty cool and you get to see AIC before they went big, they were just a humble bunch of guys wanting to play music.  Every one of the videos are great, but the standouts for me personally are &quot;I Stay Away&quot; and &quot;Grind&quot;.  AIC will always have a special place in my heart, and if the band is indeed gone, with this video they'll live on forever.
0140186409|5.0|I am reading this book for school and it is the only book I have ever read for school that didnt bore me to death. I found that I couldn't put this book down until I found out what happened next. Since this book is over 600 pages I thought I would finish it in a month or two....but I finished this one in less than a week!! Thats how good it was.<br /> Unfortunatly I had skimmed the cliffs notes before I read the story so I knew all the big events that were gonna happen so it wasn't a big surprise to me about the baby and about Casey and other events. But even already knowing that information I still found every chapter in this book very interesting to read.<br />I strongly urged those of you who are reading this for school...dont just assume it is boring just because it is from school.
0060930187|5.0|Many times I have noticed Sylvia Plath's intimate autobiographical novel labeled as a \\"feminist novel\\" or placed in Listmania lists of feminist books. Although, \\"feminism\\" is a term that has been loosely defined, I want to say, \\"Uh-uh.\\" Do a few encounters with jerky men constitute a feminist label? I doubt it. Does its portrayal of a woman being labeled mentally ill and sent to an asylum make it a feminist book? Not if she is. Does a gifted woman writing a harrowing, interesting, well-written novel some kind of achievement for all women? No, although it many be a big step for how literary society views female writers. But that's beside the point, which is the central themes of the book.<br />To me, a feminist book or a feminist anything is something with an agenda, a central theme, calling people to stand up or portraying something preeminent as just or unjust. None of that appears in the Bell Jar's central themes: desperation, depression, pressure. You could overanalyze the book and say the themes stemmed from a male dominated society, but I truly doubt that society or the women it suppresses were a big enough part of the book to say so. The Bell Jar is, if anything, about an inward struggle to come to grips with depression and regaining an interest in life. I think feminists see the beauty of this book and want to assimilate into their agenda. Sorry, no strings attached here. Just a good, thought-provoking and, most of all, moving book.
0451196716|3.0|I'm a big fan of Richard Bachman, Stephen King's alter ego. I usually love his books, as they are very dark and atmospheric. But The Long Walk wins it! This one is King's darkest novel. It's about a group of boys who, in a near future, participate in a race where the losers are killed. These 100 boys walk together for 4 days, discussing their non-existant future and death. This, of course, makes for a very bleak read.<br />The book is short but it still felt a little repetitive to me. Sure, this is about a group of boys doing the walk (not much to do except, well, than to walk!), but it seems that King doesn't have enough to sustain the reader's attention for 350 fifty pages. As a matter of fact, the beginning of the book feels more like a short story than a novel. Did King start this one as a short story? It sure does feel like it.<br />Still, this book is exciting in that King demonstrates how wonderful he is at writing dialogue. Everything these boys say feel true and real. You can't help but care about all these characters, even the so-called mean ones. This isn't the great King at work, but it's still a very good read nonetheless!
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I really liked the movie and decided to get the soundtrack.  In the movie I was thoroughly surprised by and equally enjoyed both Kidman and McGregor's voices and thought the musical arrangements were wonderful.  I expected the soundtrack to reflect what was offered in the movie.  Not so.  First of all they left out some great stuff while opting to include songs that were not even in the movie.  Second, the arrangements they put into the cd were the 'perfectly rehearsed and recorded' versions not the movie performances(I didn't care for the elevator pop rendition of 'Come What May'-a great song in the movie-or the greatly shortened, emasculated version of 'Roxanne').  The movie was a wonderful mixture of melo-drama, color, intensity, emotion - sensorially stunning - and the original soundtrack captured and reflected all of it.  The released, sanitized version does not.
B000000W5B|3.0|This is one of the more debated albums in their catalog following up their masterpiece and coincides with the ever increasing splintering of the band due to drugs, marriage, boredom, and geographical location.  Almost the antithesis of it's predecessor which involved a band forced to hole-up with Keith, this is an absentee recording. On this recording Mick Taylor fails to take up the slack left by Keith, demonstrating to me his own lack of value. Honestly, I think for all his jazzy influences and blues reputation, a studio player could've been hired and worked just as well as the out of place Taylor. I don't want to run him down completely because there are certainly songs wherein his contributions elevate the songs to perfection (&quot;Shine A Light,&quot; &quot;Sway,&quot; &quot;Moonlight Mile,&quot; and the live version of &quot;Love In Vain&quot;), but as a crafter of songs he is woefully inadequate.  Particulars aside, GHS has it's moments, mostly the slower songs which have Jagger and Taylor's stamps all over them.  The only serious contributions Keith seemed to donate were &quot;Angie,&quot; &quot;Star Star&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Coming Down Again.&quot;  The latter gives you a good feel for the whole album - a hung over, bleary eyed collection of songs.  The rockers seem somewhat contrived albeit amusing (whether intentional &quot;Star Star&quot; or not &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and the embarrassing &quot;Dancing With Mr. D.&quot;).  Personally, I'd rather listen to Black and Blue than this or it's follow-up, a pair of assembly line recordings lacking focus and creativity.  This album is more for the collector than the curious because all the things they do on this album are done much better somewhere else.
B00000K19E|3.0|The first time I saw this I was blown away, the second time I watched it with a more cynical attitude. Everyone in this movie acts so cool and aloof it's hard to identify with them I mean Morpheus' team  is about as devoid of emotion as the agents they fight.The black trenchcoats the sunglasses the smooth deliberate movements...it just seems cheesy after awhile.The special effects are awesome and most of the fight scenes except for the long slow motion gun-battle when Neo storms the agents offices to free Morpheus..very boring.Still it stands head and shoulders above most of the sci-fi efforts in recent history.
B000000W5H|3.0|Despite the popular opinion that Mick Taylor was the best thing to ever happen to this band, in my opinion he had a rather large part in two of their least satisfactory albums, this one and it's predecessor Goat's Head Soup. The biggest thing missing from these two efforts is Keith and despite Jagger's game attempts to fashion quality out of the chaotic self-destruction all around him, the result is sub-par. It has that same dense compressed sound of the previous effort which I'm guessing was an unsuccessful attempt to re-create the Exile sound resulting from the confined conditions in Keith's basement.  The good stuff is &quot;Fingerprint File&quot; which is just danceable enough to work, &quot;If You Can't Rock Me,&quot; and &quot;Till The Next Goodbye,&quot; which stands out as a very pretty number.  The rest seems like paint-by-number Stones, especially the over-played title track, &quot;Dance Little Sister,&quot; the ridiculous &quot;Short and Curlies,&quot; and &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg,&quot; which serves as co-evidence (along with &quot;Just My Imagination&quot;) that these guys shouldn't try to cover the Temptations because they add nothing new or original to the song (unlike their inspired takes on Robert Johnson).  I'll never be able to figure out why rock stations seem content to air ad nauseum second-rate efforts from this album when there are scores of songs that you couldn't hope to hear on the airwaves.  Either way, there are some moments when they try for a new sound, particularly &quot;If You Really Want To Be My Friend&quot; and &quot;Luxury&quot; which foreshadow Black and Blue. The latter suffering from a bit too much sincerity particularly Mick's usage of the word &quot;tink&quot; instead of &quot;think.&quot; That corn-ball Jamaican accent schtick works for Miss Cleo on the Psychic Network but not here. As I mentioned, too much of this album is Mick Taylor heavy, perhaps the most obvious offender being &quot;Time Waits For No One&quot; withone of his trademark pointless meandering solos, and to further underscore my point, I prefer the &quot;Love You Live&quot; versions of &quot;It's Only Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Fingerprint File&quot; because they have much tighter concise riffing and more funk courtesy of Ron Wood. In the end, what you witness with this album and Goat's Head Soup is a group in a rut, winding down the lauded Mick Taylor years with seemingly little interest, little creativity, and, most noticeably, little Keith. I give it three stars because despite my disappointment given this is only two years removed from the brilliance of Exile, I do agree with one reviewer who stated that many groups would sell their souls to be able to write even average Stones songs, of which this album has plenty.
B0000028W9|4.0|It's great to compare his mature bass voice on this most recent CD to his 1960s-70s more puerile sound.  But I love all his voices--the early voice to me is Berkeley and my grad student buddy putting his LP on in the morning (\\"Songs of...) and it would drone all day.  There is something about immersion in Leonard's voice that, well...both eases and increases the pain of love.  And for the ones like us oppressed by the figures of beauty (in other words, happily married with children but who nevertheless have the wind going wild in the trees when a certain Beatrician beauty comes into the room--nevermind that it could be the minister('s wife), your massage therapist, the barristo/a) well, forget your perfect offering and this ain't no cure. Remember, just because there is a crack in everything doesnt mean we have to try to fill it up. This CD's social commentary nicely balances the love angst. \\"Anthem,\\" like the famous lines in \\"Suzanne,\\" knows love will redeem us but only as we are drowning. It is not news that selfishness disguised as love causes both acute social and personal hurt.  The little jew who wrote the bible told us that--but we're too smart and stylish to care...
6300183211|1.0|The film's plot is absurd: Al Pacino goes from being a homeless political refugee with no connections to being a filthy rich drug czar in... LESS THAN ONE YEAR!  It's hard to tell exactly how long it takes, because the film jumps haphazardly forward in time, making the timeline very difficult to determine, follow, or understand.  <br />The characters and acting are inconsistent: one second Pacino is a cunning, dangerous, ambitious, and even intelligent criminal, while the next second he appears to be a mentally retarded person (this is not explained away by the drug use that goes on).  It's downhill from there with regard to the other characters, who are given practically nothing to work with in terms of development. <br />The violence is absurd and inconsistent: Does the idea of a small army (seemingly innumerable) of guerilla warriors swinging in on ropes and attacking Pacino's Miami mansion, sound reasonable to you?  How about Pacino then killing 20-30 of them single handedly with his \\"big gun\\"?  That formidable paramilitary force of Bolivian enforcers portrayed in the movie, btw, had only about 12 hours notice to prepare for their assault and travel to Miami (according to the convoluted plot of the film).  The same cartel that could mobilize these hundreds of para-military enforcers in less than twelve hours, was earlier forced to enlist the help of Pacino and his six man gang of (seemingly) retarded people to help them carry out a single small-time assassination in the USA.<br />The film's portrayal of drug addiction is ridiculous and inane.  Pfeiffer lays out the fattest strings of coke that i have ever seen portrayed on a film, and vacuums them down in one quick snort.  At other times she just keeps snorting coke continually for what seems like minutes... \\"sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff,\\" ... and it goes on like that.  Later in the film, Pacino shoves his head into a gallon sized pile of coke and snorts for all he is worth.<br />There are so many bad things about this movie, that i think an \\"etc\\" will suffice to end this section of the review.<br />Basically, this film is one long ...-fest.  It does have some scenes that are nice if they are isolated from the rest of the movie, and all the mediocrity and and inconsistency in every aspect of the film (characters, plot, music, cinematography, etc.) blends together into a sometimes compelling whole.  The film's single bonus is Michelle Pfeiffer's remarkable portayal of cold statuesque beauty (everything else about her character, however, is just more mediocrity).
B000002TQB|5.0|Everyone talks about Parklife and refers to the singles cut from it like Girls and Boys, Parklife and End of a Century. But the one thing that makes this album great and on a par with the later 'self titled' blur album is the strength in depth. Some of my favourite songs of all time are the &quot;filler&quot; tracks from this album such as Tracy Jacks, Bank Holiday, London Loves and Magic America. Their dabbles with experimentation also become clear with The Debt Collector and Parklife, and both in my opinion are highly succesful. This is the album which cemented blur as my favourite band and it also contains one of my favourite songs; Trouble in the Message Center.
B00005BIIP|5.0|Porcupine Tree are fast becoming my favourite band. In an era where almost every band I've ever respected try to &quot;re-invent&quot; themselves, Steve Wilson and the rest of Porcupine Tree manages to remain as uncompromising as ever. Marillion, PLEASE take note!<br />Anyway, this album, a collection of b-sides from the last two albums and including two new numbers, is probably meant as a stop-gap whilst Porcupine Tree are in the studio cooking up their next masterpiece.<br />Even so, &quot;b-sides&quot;, this is material any self-respecting melodic rock band would kill for. The new track, &quot;Buying new Soul&quot;, is just wonderful, and the inclusion of the complete &quot;Even Less&quot;, is, at 15 minutes, nothing short of masterful. Hard riffs, catchy tunes, floating keyboards and a no-nonsense drummer is what it takes to rid the world of the ghost of Yes.<br />Excellent.
0451196716|3.0|It's a long walk, no finish line and the last one walking wins.  If you think that sounds like it might be a better short story than a novel over 300 pages, it probably would have.  It's a very dark novel and most of the real content occurs within the minds of the main characters.  They're just walking.  For three hundred pages.  Walking.  I enjoyed it, but when I read it I had too much time on my hands.  I wouldn't exactly call it a great book.
0345350499|5.0|This was the first Marion Zimmer Bradley novel that I read.  I loaned it out so many times that I've had to replace it twice ... once due to wear and tear and once when it was not returned!  I have also read the book several times.  Bradley relates the familiar Arthurian legends from a completely different perspective -- that of Morgaine la Fey.  Morgaine is portrayed in a far more sympathetic light thanks to Bradley's somewhat pagan leanings; she represents the Old Religion in England.  This is a fresh and interesting take on a classic favorite, and belongs in a place of honor on any Arthurian's bookshelf.
6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 is the conclusion the the hugely popular Scream Trilogy. While Scream 3 outdoes the original Scream, it is equal to Scream 2. The film was directed by Was Craven, but it wasn't wrotten by Kevin Williamson who wrote the first two. That's okay, because sometimes by the third installment you need someone new to bring something fresh to the trilogy. The film stars Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette, Parker Posey, and Omar Epps. The movie basically follows the same story as the first two, but is an excellent conclusion to an excellent horror trilogy.<br />When Cotton Wheary is murdered, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) seems to think the killings have something to do with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell.) Sidney has relocated herself to colorado where she hopes to forget the Woodsborow murders. she is also a grief councelor. Gale visits the set of Stab 3:Back To Woodsborow which is the conclusion to the Stab trilogy. There she once again meets Dewey Riley (David Arquette.) Later on, Gale finds out that this killer is a copy cat killer who is killing memebrs of the Stab cast in the order that they die in the movie. After recieving a terrible phone call, Sidney decides to visit the Stab movie set to help Gale &amp; Dewey find out who the killer is. We later find out that the killer may have secret family ties to Sidney....<br />Overall Grade: A+ (10+++)
0399146253|5.0|My boyfriend's eye noticed Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novel, &quot;The Last Precinct,&quot; on the shelf in our town's bookstore, and he told me what an interesting story it was. I love Cornwell's images and genius, and like all the other great reads, I bought &quot;Precinct.&quot; The plot was far more interesting and haunting than &quot;Black Notice.&quot; And Cornwell has raised new heights and crossed dangerous territory in this hard-boiled crime novel. I can't understand, however, how people who read her novels rate them so badly. Kudos to Patricia Cornwell for her inexplicable genius.
B00005BF9Z|3.0|IF U HAVE NOT LISTENED TO CLANDESTINO:  do yourself a favor and head straight for clandestino.  i bought esperanza and clandestino at the same time, and listened to clandestino for 3 weeks straight before I even popped esperanza into my CD player.  after just a couple of listenings, i went back to clandestino (still playing).  don't get me wrong, esperanza lets you know manu chao is one of the freshest, most authentic musicians of out time, but it lacks the depth, intelligence, innovation, risk-taking and heart (i hate saying things have 'heart', but really does apply here) of clandestino. the sound is recycled, so you might as well go for the original. IF U HAVE CLANDESTINO: esperanza is a disappointment after the absolute sheer perfection that is clandestino. get this if your a die hard chao fan and can't live with the idea of not having listened to everything this man has produced. the record is missing the things that made clandestino great (even thought it tries by borrowing clandestino tracks here).  go get something from maldita or el gran silencio first.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|As a die-hard beatles fan, I found this CD quite a letdown. I don't understand how such a great opportunity to rejuvenate beatles popularity was so horribly abused. Comprised mainly of the annoying teeny bopper poppy songs like \\"I Want to Hold your Hand\\" and \\"We Can Work it Out\\" that make up the [rear] end of their music, this album largely bypasses their excellent serious songs, and even the good songs on the CD are mostly upbeat, mindless, lighthearted songs like \\"Yellow submarine\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\" Let alone depth, there is not even a trace of the Beatles' trademark psychedelia in the entire CD. To anyone who is trying to get introduced in the enormously talented Beatles' music, I strongly urge you not to but this CD, but rather listen to albums such as \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"1967-1970,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" and \\"Let it Be.\\"
0062502182|1.0|The Alchemist though highly recommended by a friend did nothing but disappoint.  A healty attitude towards life is rigourosly drug threw a mire of close-minded fatalistic views.

B000002UZ1|5.0|An excellent showcase of the Beatles' wide-ranging talent, 1967-1970 is a great introduction to the Beatles for the uninitiated as well as a great addition to any veteran Beatles' fan's collection. From the thrashing metal guitar of &quot;Revolution&quot; to the sonorous organ work of &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; this CD has it all.  Included on the CD are slow and melodious songs such as &quot;Something,&quot; Hey Jude,&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; fast and upbeat songs like &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; and &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; as well as the Fab Four's trademark Psychedelia in songs such &quot;I am The Walrus,&quot; &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot; Other great songs to note are  &quot;While my Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Ob-La-di, Ob-La-da,&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot; Guaranteed to Please.
B000002J1X|4.0|The second Yes album begins with the song &quot;No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Required,&quot; written by Richie Havens. It features the band with an orchestra, which is used many times throughout the ablum. This orchestrail sound helps to break bands like Yes, ELP, the Moody Blues, etc. away from the standard rock sound of the time. The strings are used effectively in this song.<BR> &quot;Then,&quot; written by Anderson, also has strings and used them in a polyphonic manner that really works well. The lyrics also are typial of Anderson, being pro-love and peace. A Steven Stills song, &quot;Everydays,&quot; also uses the orchestra as a question and answer during Bank's guitar solo, which also quotes that Bach song I can never remember the name of. &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; written by Anderson and David Foster, doesn't have the strings, but the organ-led song still holds up.<BR> &quot;The Prophet,&quot; by Anderson and Squire, really foreshadows the prog-rock songs to come from the band. The instrumental introduction is typical of Yes later songs, and the constant organ is also characteristic. The strings return in this piece and add much depth to the piece. Anderson's &quot;Clear Days&quot; is the album's ballad and uses the strings nicely as a background. &quot;Astral Traveller&quot; is another Anderson piece that also foreshadows the prog songs of later albums. &quot;Time and a Word&quot; is my favorite song on the album. Again written by Anderson and Foster, the use of accoustic guitar and strings at the end just works in every way. The lyrics are very good as well. The canon-esque ending is just great.
0380788624|4.0|I have a confession to make. I never liked Snow Crash. I thought it was poorly written at times and the author too obsessed with his own cleverness.<br />But people grow and change especially, one hopes, writers. The Diamond Age was wildly inventive and enjoyable but flawed. Crytonomicon is another massive step forward for Stephenson, but it still has its irritating aspects. <br />A novel of this sort - multiple plot lines, multiple times and places, linking real and fictional characters through time and space - is very difficult to handle effectively, to organise so that it all hangs together. It is a real tribute to Stephenson's growing skill that Cryptonomicon does manage this task. His writing can be superb. He has mastered an ironic, faux-pulp style that mixed with the cryptography and various language-styles of the characters, makes for both entertaining and challenging reading. <br />Some of Crytonomicon's characters are memorable and sensitively-handled, both those invented, like Randy, Lawrence Waterhouse and Bobby Shaftoe, and real, particularly his portrayal of Alan Turing, revealed properly as eccentric, brilliant and thoroughly queer. He also manages the very rare feat of using characters as representatives, as symbolic figures, and also as real and sympathetic people.<br />However...<br />Stephenson seems to be willfuly irritating in some regards. He sometimes appears to find it hard to differentiate between an in-joke or very personal humour and things that a wider audience will find amusing, and can sometimes appear overly impressed with his own wit and wisdom. Sometimes he lays on the farcical and eccentric aspects of particular situations too thick: the overly bizarre Scottish island communities featured on which Lawrence and Unit 2702 are imposed, is a case in point. Stephenson is clearly not a very good editor of his own work - very few authors are - he badly needs a sympathetic editor. <br />He also has a real problem writing believable female characters. This is a book about men and about very male communities (soldiers, scientists, computer hackers etc.) - but even when female characters do appear they do so as symbols or as one-dimensional people. Even Amy Shaftoe is there in the end purely so that the Geek can get the Girl. <br />Overall, Crytonomicon is a valiant but failed attempt to write a truly great novel. Personally, I have no doubt that Stephenson can do it. He's getting closer with every book. But, he needs to get a bit of outside editing help, stop letting his own belief in his undoubted cleverness get in the way of his writing, and learn a bit more about women! You should certainly read it, but also expect better in the future from this talented author.
630522577X|5.0|Audrey Hepburn performance in this movie is fantastic and the music is even better....  I love it more each time I watch it.  The clothes, the music, the people, everything is just right.  I highly recommend this if you love musicals.  This is my favorite of all.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is most likely the finest thrash metal album ever produced. Its short, its quick, its rapid, and most importantly its &quot;to the point&quot; metal, no fooling around. Its got 8-and-the-half (Dawn Patrol) straight killers. There are no better or worse tracks on here cause they all rule, there are simply the more accessible or known ones. The guitar solos are out of this world (especially the dual friedman-mustaine killers), the riffs are excellent, and even Mustaine's terrible voice blends very well with the rest. The drumming is great as well (is that Nick Menza? I am not too sure). The lyrics are also heavy metal classics dealing with all sorts of things from drugs to sorcery. I said there are no highlights on this one, because every song is a highlight but I just cannot go on without telling you what a great masterpieces songs such as Hanger 18, Tornado of Souls and Take no Prisoners serve. The shorter Lucretia and Poison Was The Cure are also no less than stunning, and Five Magics is a lesson to any metal guitarist. The opening Holy Wars and closing Rust In Peace are also top notch. <br />All in all this is a perfect thrash metal album, and undoubtedly Megadeth's best - too bad they haven't done anything close to this in recent years. A MUST BUY FOR ANY METAL FAN!
0451160916|5.0|I had read this book at the worst possible time. In the winter right in the middle of a snow storm that come off Lake Erie. As the Torence family was snow bound. I was held up in a drafty house with the wind blowing. The book gave me the chills. After reading it, I looked around the corners of my old house. It just feels like a good old fashioned ghost story. Where the Overlook Hotel is the meanest Ghost of them all.

B0000025ZF|4.0|If you have ever tried to write down a dream after waking, you'll appreciate this album.  The premise is simple; a man has a long, twisting dream, alternatively pleasurable and painful.  The sometimes smooth and sometimes jarring transitions between songs reflects the mental state of the dreamer and translates well musically, giving the album an edge that many may not like.  For sheer horsepower, this album lines up Waters with Eric Clapton, David Sanborn, and Michael Kamen, among others.  The voice cameo by Jack Palance is also pretty trippy. A great album, but not one for the faint of heart expecting trite singles.
B00005B36H|5.0|Before Lateralus was released, I had already read many reviews in magazines and on the internet. These reviews only hightened my need to hear Tool's new work. As a past fan, I have to say that I was very curious about how Lateralus would compare to Tool's past releases. Both Opiate and Undertow seemed to be on the heavier side while nema was a bit more intelectual. The first time I heard the music on Lateralus, I was stunned. The art on this record is what all of the other bands in the world wish that they could produce. One thing that caught my attention was in the opening of The Grudge. After Maynard lets his voice go, Danny Carey does a steadily increasing beat on his bass drums. As a guy who knows how difficult the drums are, I was blown away. Danny also lets out an amazing groove in the middle of the title track &quot; Lateralus.&quot;While we're talking about Danny, lets not forget the intro to &quot; Ticks and Leeches.&quot; That just shows that no one out there is even close to Danny's understanding of the drums. Justin's bass playing on Lateralus is also nothing short of spectacular. From &quot; Parabola&quot; to &quot; The Grugde&quot; to &quot; Reflection,&quot; his grace is also noted. Now for the guitar. Adam Jones is a genius and an artist and it all shows on Lateralus. He also directed the &quot; Schism&quot; video which is visually awesome. Last, but not least, Maynards lyrics and vocal ability are above and beyond anything I've ever heard. Just listening to this record drives me to want to figure out how I can become this creative. Tool, if you ever read this, never lose the magic that you all pocess.

0743420373|5.0|I thought that I was prodigious accumulator of wealth (at 25yrs old), having a good deal of investments and income, but I realized after reading this great book that I wasn't living that well below my means, or how do you say it.<br />Get this:<br />Today I put an ad out to one magazine that I'm selling my quite recently acquired new BMW. Think I'll buy a cheapo mountain-bike and get a bus when it rains. In Helsinki, Finland you really can come and go without having an own car. The public transportation in general, like trams are convinient and fast. And the real joke is that the distance to my work is like 4kilometers, and thats like nothing! I drive that with a bike in ten minutes, compared to travelling with a car; usually its the traffic-hour and its so frustrating..and talking about where to put the car and the price to park...!<br />The thing is that I want to become financially independent one day. It means that if it would be true today I could quit working and I'd live the rest of my life fine (at the same consumption-level) without working.<br />I'm planning to make a budjet for this year very soon, and these rough calculations show that I'd be able to save so much money that its amazing. People always look at figures on monthly-basis, now take a look at those figures on yearly-basis (1-5yrs) what a difference one little thing can save in the long term..<br />Hope to receive mail from you all! All the best, Henkka<br />...
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This is an epic tale of man vs. himself.  It all starts off when Tetsuo Shima gets in a bike accident with a strange young boy while riding with his bike gang.  This boy has increadable power.  In the movie Tetsuo gets picked up by the military police and is taken off to be tested in a laboratory.  The doctors find out that Tetsuo has a similar wave length to the legendary Akira.  If this is true then the scientist might be able to harness the power and use it for the benefit of man.  Kaneda, Tetsuo's best friend is on the search for his friend when he gets mixed up with a revolution terrorist group.  This is where he meets a young girl by the name of Kay.  (She is later used to help the little psychic kids out).  But all goes to hell when Tetsuo catches wind that there is a more powerfull person out there.  Tetsuo is determined to find Akira and sets out to the olympic stadium to find this thing called Akira.  You watch Tetsuo plow his way through neo-tokyo only to find that Akira is no more.  When Kaneda finally catches up with Tetsuo they engage in an epic battle.  At the end, Tetsuo's powers metamorphasize his body into this hunk of flesh and Akira is awakend.  When Akira is awakened, neo-tokyo pays the price.  Akira's powers engulf the city and it's surroundings only to leave rubble in it's wake.  Though it sounds mind boggling, you must buy or rent the movie to understand and appreciate such a masterpiece.
B000009HF2|5.0|Hi, you may think this 70's rock and roll could only be appreciated by older people, but thats not true! Im only 15 and this is my favorite CD. I bought the whole CD just for the song &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot;, but what I discovered was an amazing CD full of energy and power. And only adding to the excitement is the crowd! At first I wasnt too fond of the songs, &quot;wind of change&quot;, &quot;penny for your thoughts&quot;, or &quot;lines on my face&quot; but these songs grow on you over time, I often listen to this CD and never have to press the &quot;skip track&quot; button. I would reccomend this version instead of the new 25th aniversary version only because in the 25th anniversary version the crowds volume has been lowered considerably, taking away what makes the CD so powerful.  I have to say that you will fall in love with songs like &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot; and &quot;(I'll give you) Money&quot;. This is a great CD and I encourage any fan of Rock and Roll and talking guitars to buy this CD!!
B00005IBGQ|4.0|Whereas Rufus Wainwright was a theatre record - all Sondheim and Gershwin and overreaching because he had the talent to do it - Poses is a California record to rank with the best of them:  the Mamas and Papas spending an afternoon on the back porch with Randy Newman and Brian Wilson.  In his mid-20's, he's a melodist without peer (his closest competition is Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields), and he's learned a  lyrical craft in record time.  On the first release, the autobiography was green, at times embarrassing.  Here, he adds the right fictional distance to characterize these poignant vignettes, all of which may or may not be based on Wainwright himself:  the dangerous hedonist (\\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\"), the vicious gigolo (\\"The Consort\\"), the  pragmatic narcissist (\\"One Man Guy\\"), the mooning lover (\\"Greek Song\\"), etc.  His California record comes complete with what great California records require:  the love/hate song.  Wainwright's is called simply \\"California\\", and it outranks the Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\" for sheer vitriol:  \\"California,\\" Wainwright sings to the state like a lover, \\"you're such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed.\\"
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Baz Luhrmann's visually invigorating film is brought to life with the incorporation of the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.  By  combining refreshing and energizing tracks by top artists such as Fatboy Slim and Bono with original remixes of classics sung by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, Luhrmann presents his audience with an unforgettable soundtrack to accompany an unforgattable film.  Any fan of great music will appreciate the entertaining and diverse sounds of Moulin Rouge.  I highly reccomend this soundtrack, as the music never grows old and the songs never fail to thrill.
B00005KFUM|3.0|In 1999, I overrated Muse's debut CD Showbiz with the hyperbole of a rabid fan.  Sucked in by a surface sheen that faded with repeat listenings, their art rock turned into too much pomp-and-circumstances.  In the end, they seemed like Styx with a more powerful, though just as preening, lead singer.  Origin of Symmetry does nothing to change my mind now, but this is the best Queen rip I've ever heard - and I'm not talking commercial Queen here, more like Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack - pretentious and campy and riotously enjoyable.  Let Radiohead turn into Pink Floyd; Muse is the new king of cheese, whether he knows it or not.  (Most likely not, which is why this is such a hoot.)
B00004XMTJ|5.0|&quot;Cats&quot; is pure entertainment. One shouldn't look for flaws, unless they look in their own mirror..  The DVD is super clear, and brings out all the 'meows'...(or 'purr's)...  &quot;Cats&quot; is a delight to be enjoyed by the whole family.  <br />Take your pick, Andrew Lloyd Webber or Puff Daddy...  The choice is simple.
B00005LB9O|3.0|Like R.E.M.'s Reckoning, Travis's The Invisible Band comes on like a pale copy of its predecessor:  The Man Who Part II.  After the initial follow-up letdown, however, these 12 tracks (plus the by now annoying \\"hidden tracks\\") make themselves felt.  More of the same, but that's not so bad at this point in their young career.  Fran Healy hasn't met a clich he doesn't like - there are many trite moments here - yet he writes unparalleled melodies that he sings with true conviction.  With a bit of melancholy as a lubricant, they soar, and their arena goals are at least humanist, not megalomaniacal.  If they stick to the formula on CD 4, then we can worry.  For now, sing along and enjoy.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is great! Every song on it will have you singing it along...!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I am a huge fan of Blur and I have herd Del and Automater dozens of times from my brother (I am also a fan of the girl and her group, which I am really mad to say that I cant remeber her name, sorry). When I found out they were going to do an album, I thought it was not going to be that good at all. Boy was I so wroung. This is one of the best albums of the year. It combines hip-hop, rock (manly the sond of Blur), and all other kinds of music together to create a really fun and well polished album. If you are looking for some relief from the shallow sound of pop music today, this CD is your medicine. (PS. Sorry about my spelling)
B00004XMSN|4.0|That's the enjoinment to make to Episcopalian Bishop David Niven, who has prayed for help in raising the funds necessary from a frigid controlling widow to finish building his dream cathedral. Angel Cary Grant appears in answer to Niven's prayers and raises the money--and the interest of Niven's wife, Loretta Young, too!  Just saw it again on Christmas Day, along with my sister and sister-in-law. Both were besides themselves with laughter at the comedic talents of David Niven, in particular. Loretta Young is simply luminous and Cary Grant suave as ever. Supporting actress Gladys Cooper (the cold nun in &quot;Song of Bernardette&quot; and the cold mom in &quot;Now Voyager&quot;) turns in a solid performance as the rich widow, who has shocking secret motives behind her imperious actions, as Cary Grant reveals in a very good scene.  A good comedy about an interesting triangle, perfect for Christmas viewing.
0425173739|3.0|On board the &quot;Karnak&quot;, a colourful group of tourists assemble for a memorable trip up the Nile River. Among them is Hercule Poirot, the ex-Belgian detective; a British spy hunting a foreign spy; an eccentric writer; an American millionairess and her husband; his disgruntled ex-fiancee and a number of equally strange little people. When the millionairess is murdered and her husband wounded, the spy and Poirot team up to solve the murder.<br />An interesting scenario. Not exactly equal to Poirot's &quot;Orient Express&quot; vacation, but passable. I was surprised as to who the murderer was. But then, that's why I enjoy Dame Agatha's books!
B000051VWW|5.0|I normally don't listen to R&B for it usually sounds too much alike or outcomes to the point of yawning, but one day as I lay sick in bed, just watching my VH1, I was filled with aghast as I beheld a video called By Your Side unfold before my tired eyes. The video and song were both haunting and mysterious and at that very instant I knew that I had to own it. So when I listened to Lover's Rock all the way through for the first time ever I knew that it was a golden keeper. I simply feel in love with Sade's deep, sensuous voice. It's soothing and very laid back--not at all forceful like some singers today. She's like an angel gliding you along on her wings, wings of talent which are spread far and wide. Her lyrics (which she writes all herself) are both romantic yet meaningful. On Flow she sweetly sings: See me (within the light), Flowing (take me to you), Like the river to the sea. But on a more somber note she also sings about the cruelty of slavery as she painfully evokes the memory of her ancestors on (my personal favorite) Slave Song: I see them gathered, see them on the shore. I turn to look once more. And he who knows me not takes me to the belly of darkness.... This is not your standard poppish garbage that is strewn all over mainstream radio but is something that is guaranteed to spring a leak in your eye.... I was very fortunate to stumble upon Sade's unique blend of mature pop and R&B influenced in with African and reggae. So if you're browsing [...] right now, contemplating to whether or not you should buy this, the answer is a capatilized YES! Don't let this pass you by.
6302973724|5.0|Being that I went to 2 Devotional concerts, this video really measures up to just how great they were.  <br />To those who don't know, the laserdisc version of Devotional includes 4 additional songs (Behind The Wheel, Mercy In You, Fly On The Windscreen, &amp; Everything Counts), but even with those songs added, the film is still 3 songs shy of a complete concert (Policy Of Truth &amp; Halo are missing and Death's Door is only present during the end credits, when it actually was performed right after Judas).  I sometimes wonder why Devotional was not released in Compact Disc form?  Instead what we got was Songs Of Faith &amp; Devotion LIVE, which just gives us live versions of all the songs from SOFAD and nothing else.  <br />To Warner Brothers, please release this masterpiece on DVD, as well as all the other DM films.  Fans are hungry for better picture and sound quality, and considering that depeche mode are more popular than ever, now is the perfect time to make these DVD versions available to us.  <br />Stay Devoted!<br />Track Listing-1.Higher Love 2.World In My Eyes 3.Walking In My Shoes 4.Behind The Wheel** 5.Stripped 6.Condemnation 7.Judas 8.Mercy In You** 9.I Feel You 10.Never Let Me Down Again 11.Rush 12.In Your Room 13.Personal Jesus 14.

B00003CY5K|4.0|Legally Blonde was a good movie in my opinion. It showed that you should not judge people because if they are really determined they can accomplish their goal. It also had alot of hunor and funny lines. I really enjoyed this movie want to see again!

B00004X0Q0|5.0|While musing the most appropriate description of the band, I crafted this epigram for the band: What modern punk music would sound like if Green Day hadn't corrupted it.  They have foregone all of the punk cliches (Morbid songs, banal jocundity, same tempos, etc.) and created 2000's most original sound.  They have they inane lyrics of The Ramones, brillant guitars superceding Fugazi, sound effect of Radiohead quality, and the energy of the hungriest punk band!
B000005PRX|4.0|As much as I like this film, while wathching it I can't help but feel increasingly aggravated because of the embarassing sequels which followed. They turned the dark streets of GOTHam City into Vegas, and turned Batman into a guy who wore a heavy suit complete with nipples. Here is what Batman should be remembered as, a chracter who is the hero yet also the victim, a dark and tragic figure thrust into a life of vengence because of his parent's death. This is Tim Burton, THIS IS BATMAN. It's really a 3 1/2 though, but I just gave it a 4 anyway.
B000002U8G|5.0|It very well could be.  This Album contains the famous 23 min marathon known as Echoes.  This is an eerie soundscape with great guitaring by Gilmour, and brilliant sound effects.  The first half of the album, while it isn't as good as the second, contains some great songs such as the opener, One of These Days, and lyrical masterpieces, Fearless and A Pillow of Winds.  This album deserves the recognition of the Darkside of the Moon.  It still has its roots to PF's earlier albums but Gilmour begins to create his own style, other than Syd Barrets.
B000059XXZ|3.0|This of may of beeen the first of the modern &quot;Batman&quot; films, but it was the 2nd best. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; shows the true dark genius of a man named Tim Burton, it represented everything which the following &quot;Batman&quot; films destroyed and I love it for that. As for this film, I must say that the final showdown between Batman and the Joker + henchman is significantly better than the one in the sequel. The scene is which Batman flies up his plane in front of the film is priceless Burton cinema. Jack Nicholson is his usual crazy self, and Michael Keaton will always be &quot;Batman&quot; for me. 3/5 stars.
B000002NHN|5.0|I first purchased this album because I discovered that the beautiful song at the beginning of a short lived television series called &quot;Legacy&quot; was in fact the some &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; on this album.  I fell in love with the song watching the show, and so purchased this album for that exclusive reason, however, what I found was an album packed with beautiful and mystical music, and I came to fall in love with every song on the album.  It's a wonderful album and I recommend it to everyone!
B00003CY5K|5.0|.... ...my friend Joyce and I went ...and had a grand time. The number one reason to see the movie is Reese Witherspoon.  I've been watching her since her first film, \\"Man In the Moon,\\" a solid dramatic movie. She showed incredible talent in that film, that continued to show itself in every film of hers to date. This is Witherspoon acting on the entire other end of the spectrum, in very broad comedy, and she pulls it off. She plays Elle, a beauty queen, sorority president and blonde Bel Aire, CA, girl who everyone assumes is a dumb blonde.  However, she has a 4.00, albeit in fashion merchandising. When her boyfirend dumps her because she doesn't fit his image for his girlfriend while he's going to Harvard Law School, she applies to the same school and gets in with her 4.0 and high LSATs.  She shows up with all of her sorority sensibility and frou frou clothing and accessories and becomes the butt of all the intellectuals' (everyone elses') jokes.  How can she get her former boyfriend to see her as an equal at Harvard and will she want him when she does?  This is the jist of the movie and it stretches credibility greatly.  However, it is a great comic vehicle for Witherspoon and she milks it for all it is worth.  When we saw it, it was the #1 movie in the USA and I was so glad that all of her solid work over the years had finally paid off in an enormous hit for her.
089381525X|5.0|Skin covered with goosebumps, I slowly turned each page of Workers while my lower lip trembled. I couldn't believe the power that those images had. <br />It's a big heavy volume worth every cent I paid for it. To be honest I was a little cautious when I saw the price, but my gamble paid off. The pages hold the detail and tone beautifully. Salgado drags you into the lives of these people from vast mines of thousands of workers to the effort of an individual. Looking into their eyes will appreciate not only what they go through, but how photography can take you anywhere.
B0000542DJ|5.0|A lot of viewers do not like Oliver Stone's films because they have had the misfortune of seeing and hearing Oliver Stone on television in real life.  It is wise to keep the two totally separate.  Oliver Stone the filmmaker is a great artist with a masterful hand at cutting edge story telling and \\"JFK\\" shows that talent at its peak.  Oliver Stone the real life person can be grating, obnoxious and offensive to just about everyone and would do himself a big favor by not making personal appearances.  This is his personal, artistic version of JFK's assassination.  He makes a compelling case for the proposition that JFK was murdered as part of a conspiracy by powerful forces in our own government rather than Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.  JFK was obviously a hero of Stone's and Stone even believes that JFK would have prevented the escalation of the Vietnam War.  In fact, he believes that the Vietnam War was made possible only by getting rid of JFK.<br /><br />I buy more into Stone's  conspiracy theory than I do this lofty, ultra hero view of JFK.  However, this is his vision and he certainly can put on quite a case, which he does through Kevin Costner, acting as District Attorney Jim Garrison of New Orleans prosecuting Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for conspiring to murder JFK.  Costner shows his full leading man appeal plus the intensity, earnestness and idealism that had become the trademark for a Costner leading role.  Stone is known for getting fabulous male performances and that is true of every male performance in \\"JFK.\\"  For example, Gary Oldman is fabulous as Oswald as is Jones as Shaw and Joe Pesci as David Ferry.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek is reduced to a wife as wallpaper role, which is also typical of Stone, but you don't go to an Oliver Stone film to see great roles for women.  This is a long movie that seemingly is over too fast since Stone really knows how to keep things moving.  If you see this film back to back with \\"Thirteen Days,\\" also with Costner and about JFK, you will see an incredible difference in both film making ability and acting deliveries.

B000003BF1|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST STONE'S ALBUMS PRODUCED!  SIMPLY GREAT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IT WILL ENDURE TIME. CRANK MONKEY MAN UNTIL THE GLASS SHATERS!!!!
079075116X|4.0|What's so amazing is the insight and forward thinking that went into this film. Yes the first portion of the film is slow, but so is about 99% of espionage and air combat. I've said it before and I'll say it again: When Hollywood actually shows this stuff realistically, the audience gets bored or sleepy because they do not appreciate authenticity. Back to the insightfulness... Well, over here on the Nellis Test Range, and yes I'm specifically talking about Area 51, they fly very special &quot;aggressor&quot; squadrons that use actual Soviet aircraft. Guess where they got them. Some were defected and some...drum roll...were stolen with the help of U.S. clandestine services. Furthermore, information on U.S. stealth programs was not public when Firefox was made. A Russian scientist is actually the guy who developed the equations that predicted &quot;low observability&quot;, and his government spent a while looking into the concept, though not until recently very seriously. The Russians also had a weird preoccupation with the paranormal, telekinesis, and, yes, biofeedback. These uncanny pseudo-recreations in Firefox, combined with the believable depiction of the closed nature of Soviet society and their &quot;secret bases&quot; where R&amp;D took place makes for a sci-fi/spy film with an air of authenticity, in spite of its fictional traits. I also like the great repertoire between Gant and the Sub captain. It strikes me as being very true to life with its representation of automatic camaraderie and unspoken understanding between the two characters. I look forward to this film's release on DVD.
B00000IO4I|4.0|Another small, scene stealer film from England, Little Voice is loaded with three  tour de force performance s by Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, and  Blenda Blethyn.  Horrocks is &quot;Little Voice,&quot; the shyest of the shy daughter of a dead record store owner who is overshadowed by the obnoxious mother of mother's (Blethyn).  Caine is a small time promoter who hears LV singing to her old 33 LP collection and realizes she is a golden opportunity for him to make it to the big time.  LV sings to avoid the reality of her mother and her mother's lovers, but mostly, she sings to remember her father, the only kindness in her wretched life.  Ewan McGregor in a small bit part befriends LV, but it is Horrocks stunning singing voice that captures the film and attention.  Reprising her stage role, Horrock's dead on immitations of Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe are superb.<br />This film is a gem and should be a part of every film library both for it's story and the music.
B000002KDS|5.0|This fourth album from the original Alice Cooper band probably sent numerous &quot;peace and love&quot; hippies running for cover in its day.  Despite being eclipsed in the shock department by the works of such current ghouls as Marilyn Manson and Slipknot, KILLER is still a pretty scary listening experience.  Many have overlooked the irony of such songs as &quot;Under My Wheels&quot;, &quot;Desperado,&quot; and &quot;Dead Babies&quot; and accused Alice of celebrating violence and death.  However, that is not the case.  A deeper look into the matter reveals that oftentimes Alice's tongue is placed firmly in his makeup streaked cheek.   This is a fantastic album full of horror filled and hard rocking tunes, the best of which is &quot;Halo of Flies&quot; a tribute to the spy movie genre.  It all culminates in the theatrical &quot;Killer,&quot; in which Alice gets his comeuppance.  Brilliant, bold and downright scary, KILLER is a claasic Alice Cooper album!
6305603847|5.0|this is by far one of the best movies of all time. i first watched this movie over 15 years ago and didnt understand it, but loved the music so watched again and again if only for that. after about the 4th viewing, i completely got the movie and since then, its been more about the movie itself than the music. granted, they go hand and hand and these days, when i listen to the music, im able to understand the story that goes with it and i absolutely LOVE THAT!<br />&quot;pink&quot; is a character that none of us want to know, but i do believe that we all have seen some of him in ourselves, whether its thur self doubt, feeling left out and alone, or simply misunderstood. his father dying when he was just a boy, his mother smothering him beyond belief, his teacher abusing him verbally, becomming very ill and then the loss of his one true love, vera lynn.....these are all of the things that create the wall. in the beginning, its a protection and a very much needed instrument, but eventually, it becomes a burden and its only thru his realization of that burden that he is able to break free of it.<br />for anyone that has seen this movie once and loved the music, but didnt understand the movie, watch it again. if nothing more, you'll enjoy the music, but maybe....just maybe you'll understand more than before about that fine line between the sane and insanity.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and let me tell you, the whole thing was just, so magical. My favorite thing about the movie, was how wonderful whoville was. The sets for the movie were very great. The new ideas for the newer grinch movie added to the creativity of the original. I loved the fact that the film makers of the grinch were able to change the story a little, and add on to it , without changing it into something too different. the story is cute,touching,and magical. if you loved the original, you'll love the new touch of this one.
B000056VIY|2.0|i bought this cd at a music store.  i should have visited amazon.com first to read the ratings. i see a lot of people agree with me.  i can't believe people actually gave this a 4 or 5.  i really like j-lo and am a big fan of all kinds of music, but this cd was a waste of money...
B000050XEI|3.0|If you are filling out a collection of music, this is a fine album.  However, Enya's &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepard Moons&quot; are, in my opinion, stronger performances, and more listenable.
B000056VIY|2.0|i really like jennifer lopez, but maybe she should stick to acting.  it's my first J-Lo CD i've purchased and i'll definitly think twice about buying any of her CDs in the future.  only one or two decent songs on the cd. i wasted my money.  i should've just listened to them on the radio.
0767830555|5.0|&quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; Paul Schraeder's brilliant character study of a certain type of alienated white male that emerged in the post Vietnam 70's, remains as distrubing today as it did 25 years ago.<br />&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; established Schraeder as a major screenwriting talent, Robert De Niro as a star and Martin Scorsese as the pre-eminent filmmaker of his generation.<br />The acting is flawless (was the ever a BAD performance in a Scorcese film)?...even Cybil Shepherd gives the illusion she can act....Scorsese himself, playing a jealous husband who's gone over the edge, is simply stunning.<br />&quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; is a mixture of Urban Gothic horror and a psychological case study of the terror that can be wrought by loneliness and alientation, scored beautifully by the late Bernard Herrmann (can anyone watch the film without going around humming that haunting saxophone passage?)<br />This new special edition DVD is superb, containing a 90 minute documentary on the making of the film that includes interviews with many of the cast and crew ( Scorsese, De Niro, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Paul Schraeder, makeup man Dick Smith, and Elmer Bernstein, standing in for Herrmann).<br />The only element sorely lacking in the DVD is the commentary Scorsese did for the Criterion laserdisc edition.<br />&quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; a film that could never be made today in the era of &quot;Scream 2&quot;,&quot; where 12-18 years make up the bulk of the ticket buying public, remains a contemporary classic and this special edition DVD is a filmlover's delight.
B00005B4GU|1.0|What has happened to radiohead that is the question.I think compared to the old radiohead(well compared to anyone actually)this is absolutely pathetic and i am disappointed in them
B00003CX5P|4.0|I just bought one yesterday and I think it's good. Action, action and action.... if you are for it then just buy it.
1563890119|4.0|Many people describe the Sandman books as Gaiman's greatest work. I have to agree with that assessment.  Over the course of the series, Gaiman brings together a wealth of his interests, from Jewish mysticism to Shakespeare.  The sheer scope makes it one of the most ambitious group of books ever written.  Indeed, like the best of fantasy, the author creates an entire new world for us to explore and enjoy.<br />I agree with those who say that this is the weakest of the long series.  That said, it is the first and sets the stage for what comes after.  For those who have not read the series and want to, I suggest reading season of the mist first (book four) and then read from Preludes forward.  Alternatively, you can start here.  The important thing is to not simply read this, get confused and stop.<br />Remember, Gaiman builds on his work towards the end of the story.  Each book adds important characters and facts that recur later.  What seems minor may play a crucial role later in the story.  The series is a must for serious fantasy fans.  If you have never read a graphic novel, here is a great place to start.
0790749815|5.0|I must say I saw this movie the other day and was astonished at how well the acting was and how good the suspense factor was, if your one of those people searching for Hitchcock in this movie, I'll tell you where he is if you watch the opening credits, look for a man getting on to a bus that is HITCHCOCK! I must say if you love suspense if you love spy novels I suggest you pick up this movie and watch it trust me you will definitely like it, I loved every second of it, it's very very good and you will love it.
B000056VIY|5.0|this alblum was for sure jenn's best, the music is so entertaning, the first time i heard love dont cost a thing, i knew right there while watching mtv, that i had to get that cd.  AND I WANNA  SAY SOMETHING TO THIS GIRL NAMED ANGEL, SHE TOTALLY INSULTED SPANISH MUSIC, THERE IS NOTHIN WRONG WITH  IT, AND IT IS NOT CHEESY AND CORNY!  ANYWAYS AS I WAS SAYING, my favorite tracks are im real and dame, dame is a beautiful song, and i  love the spanish music in it, thanks for your time!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Once again, Tom Hanks gives his most powerful and pivotal performance in this well-directed movie! It's like watching Braveheart, but with a softer side and a different theme. I was amazed at how this film was made. This movie gives us a sense of inspiration and hope. At the end of this movie, or the climax I should say, I was in tears knowing that Chuck Noland had lost his one and only girl. Even my girlfriend has to calm me down! Ridiculeous, isn't it? And after the movie was over, I left the theater in a state of speechless. From the director who gave you the Back To The Future Trilogy, this is one damn &quot;bloody-marvellous&quot; movie not to be missed again and again. Kudos and two thumbs up for this film, which was directed by, none other than, Robert Zemeckis.
B000002ACR|5.0|The eternal question: Which is the best Byrds album? Mr. Tambourine Man, Younger Than Yesterday or The Notorious Byrd Brothers. It's very difficult to say, but this one certainly deserves to be acclaimed as one of their best. The songwriting of McGuinn, Hillman and Crosby is tops here. The Byrds prove that they don't need Gene Clark or even Bob Dylan to make great songs. &quot;So You Want To Be A Rock N Roll Star&quot;, &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot;, &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Been Burned&quot; and the single &quot;Lady Friend&quot; are among the Byrds' best songs. The only weaker moments on the album are &quot;CTA-102&quot; and &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;. They're not bad, they're just not up to the great stuff on the rest of the album. If only Crosby had shortened &quot;Mind Gardens&quot; by about a minute and lengthened &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot; by a minute, the album would be even better. The Byrds also deliver another great, classic rendition of a Bob Dylan song with &quot;My Back Pages&quot;. Younger Than Yesterday is essential for Byrds fans. After buying this one, be sure to pick up the excellent Notorious Byrd Brothers also, which is vastly different, but great in its own right.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I read some of the customer reviews of this movie and had to write my two-cents worth. The reviews only show that the old adage, \\"In matters of taste, there can be no argument\\" is all too true. I loved this movie!! It has stayed with me for days and is a work of art, that all involved in making it, can be proud of.  Full of warmth, humor, compassion, intelligence, and wonderful music, it works on many levels to produce a beautiful film. I am amazed at all the subtle details that were put into the film, like little treasures, for the audience. The acting, across the board, is masterful, and all aspects of the film are presented with clarity and loving care.<br />I'm not a blue grass or country and western music follower, but I loved the music in this film. I hope more movies of this quality are made, and that the director and cast are not put off by those who didnt tune into what they so beautifully did. Believe me, many did and said, \\"Wow.\\" It made my day and my week. Thanks for a wonderful movie. It is one I will go to when I need to refresh my spirits.
B000002AHC|5.0|The Notorious Byrd Brothers came in January 1968, only 11 months after the release of The Byrds' pop masterpiece, Younger Than Yesterday. However, the difference between the two albums is staggering. Whereas Younger Than Yesterday consisted of concise, tightly-arranged, catchy rock songs, Notorious is a whirlwind of sonic experimentation. The opener, Artificial Energy, with its phased brass and vocals, sets the tone for the album. There are hardly any sounds on the album that haven't been tinkered with or filtered in some way. The result is an album that is a feast for the ears. It's a psychedelic album, no doubt, but contains traces of jazz, country and folk as well. This is truly The Byrds' Sgt. Pepper. <br />It's too bad that David Crosby was fired before the album's completion. His contributions to Younger Than Yesterday were so great, and Notorious Byrd Brothers would be even stronger if his Triad were included. Goin' Back is a great song, a beautiful song, but there's no reason that the Byrds couldn't have put both Triad and Goin' Back on the album. The album is too short as it is. That's my only complaint with this great album. It's over far too soon. You won't want it to end. It's really amazing that in the midst of such internal turmoil, The Byrds were able to create such a masterpiece.<br />Notorious was a major turn for The Byrds, and it really sounds like never they ever did before. With their next album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, they would make another major turn as well. The Notorious Byrd Brothers is an essential purchase for anyone who likes The Byrds, psychedelia, or just great music.
0679879269|1.0|Although touted as a new children's series in the tradition of Tolkein, Philip Pullman's enchanting read is just that, enchanting.  The reader is drawn into this exciting and mystery-filled fantasy by the adventures and exploits of Lyra and her companion Will.  Though a discerning adult can perceive Pullman's underlying message, children are unable to separate truth and reality from the story. The trilogy (&quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;) begins innocently enough as the reader is encouraged to seek for truth, but when the truth is revealed to be a &quot;lie,&quot;  innocence is lost.  &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; causes us to question the Church, her teachings and God Himself.  (From the book page 445: &quot;And I took the crucifx from around my neck and threw it into the sea.  That was it.  All over.  Gone &quot;  - spoken by the character Mary, an adult, an authority figure.)  Any parent who chooses to bring their child up in the &quot;nurture and admonition of the Lord,&quot; should be cautioned about Pullman's trilogy.  Enchanting it is. . . &quot;Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.&quot;  Isaiah 5:20
B00004W50Z|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED STAGEFRIGHT EVEN THOUGH MUSIC FROM THE BIG PINK AND THE BAND CD USUALLY GOT MORE ACCOLADES FROM THE CRITICS.  WHILE IT DOESN'T CONTAIN THE HUGE HITS THE OTHER ONES DO THIS IS NO DRAWBACK.  THIS CD CONTAINS SONGS YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH, LIKE &quot;TIME TO KILL,&quot; AND &quot; A LA GLORY,&quot; JUST TO NAME TWO.  RECENTLY I PURCHASED THE DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION WITH BONUS TRACKS AND IT IS SUPERB.  THE SOUND IS MAGNIFICENT.  TODD RUNGREN WAS THE ENGINEER ON THE ALBUM AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM HIS OWN MATERIAL THE PRODUCTION IS FIRST RATE.  EVEN IF YOU ALREADY OWN STAGEFRIGHT, I'D GET THIS.  IF YOU LOVE THE BAND AS I DO YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.  THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT IT ENDS.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I dont know too much about music history and all the music snob stuff that the critics wrote, but I do know that I liked what I heard on the samples (I want to buy this album). It seems to be about brooding, dark love and I like that....I dont know who they sound like they are copying (ive never heard jesus and mary chain) but I still like it anyways.....forget the snob critics and form your own opinion :) if you like it, try it, if not then dont give them your $$$   easy enough...
B00003CXSP|4.0|After ten years, the good Dr. is in. This time he resides in Venice, Italy. While he enjoys the view he so wanted from the first movie: Clarice is under fire from the F.B.I. and especially from Paul Kreibler, who is an authority type figure of Clarice's and is a real sexiest pig. Her one big break comes when she receives a letter from Hannibal himself, which then brings her back on the case, trying to track Lecter down. With that add a cop whose career is going down the flusher, because he messed up on solving the Il Monstro case: a serial killer in Venice. So this inspector agreed to help capture Lecter for a certain sum of money, paid by Mason Verger. Mr. Verger is only one of two of Hannibal's victims to survive. And the only thing in is mind is vengenace.  This was a good sequel to Silence, but this one focused more on gore, than Silence of the Lambs; which focused on our mind, telling us but never showing us for most parts. Hannibal is a must buy, and I would recommend the book. Reading Hannibal and watching the it, reveal that the book goes into much more details which make the story even more delicious!
B0000057C5|5.0|Of all the 73 CDs I own, this own is my absolute favourite. Rammstein has been getting softer with each consecutive album. They hit the mark with Sehnsucht, though. This is a must in the collection of any true soft metal fan.
B000002TQV|5.0|As an avid fan of alternative rock music, if I had a list of my all time favorite top 5 albums, this would be there.  This album does have the well known song high and dry, but also has other quality songs such as Iron lung, the bends, planet telex, and my all time favorite song, period, fake plastic Trees.  radiohead may quite possibly be the world's greatest band throughout the years, and this cd is indicative of that.  I do not know of anyone who owns this cd who dislikes it.  I still, even today, can not get over the beauty and excellence of their music.
6305426651|5.0|I cannot recommend any movie more highly; subtitles and all.  The first time I rented this movie, I did so without knowing it had subtitles.  Upon beginning to watch it, I was disappointed in the subtitles and thought it was hokey and boring.  I stopped it at the bicycle ride and introduction of the wife-to-be and sent it back.  Then, when reading about it a second time, I thought I would try it again.<br />I intend to purchase the movie with the subtitles instead of dubbing to keep the integrity and &quot;feel&quot; of it pure.  (I believe that adds to the impact, story and message.)  You would be doing yourself a disservice by not viewing this movie; especially if you enjoy historical reality and the encouragement toward love, persistence, creativity, courage and the ultimate love of self-sacrifice, which are all portrayed ingeniously in &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;<br />How the hero won his lady's heart, his at first irritating, but then totally winning personality, his devotion to his son, his instinct and humble genious toward the circumstances of life dished out to him were all richly portrayed, not only by the actor, but the writer as well.<br />A must see movie full of hope for a hurting generation.
B000007OY0|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite all time. It's absolutely beautiful, and the fact that it's based on an original story by Stephen King just blows the mind. I just love everything about it, the story, the music, the superb acting, the direction, everything. Morgan Freemans protrayal as Red is pure genious. ...  The music throughout the movie is also done very well, complimenting the scenes perfectly, especially in this last scene. I don't know why critics rag on the length, it's the perfect length. The story is developed perfectly, and without the long length of the movie the relationship between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins characters would not have been developed well enough to have the effect that it does at the end. This movie is absolutely amazing. It's the only movie to have made me cry from watching it numerous times. Usually movies might lose some effect after the first watching, but I find that this one has the same effect with every viewing. It's perfect, and is definately my favorite movie of all time!!
0783228317|5.0|This is an excellent movie despite of what you may have read in the editorial, and despite of what you may think. To most viewers this movie will seem to be a non-stop &quot;drug frenzy of some sort&quot;. But this is simply the surface theme of the movie, the true theme is the main characters view of comteporary USA in the early 70s, and how the &quot;hippie&quot; movement died off and left off a generation of apathetic drug users. He is most amazed on how quickly this happened (in a period of 5 years), how the spirit of a generation that was so pure and strong could simply succum to a society of indifferent &quot;stoners&quot; in a period of half a decade. Being that the main character is really intelligent (if you get past the misconception that antic enciting, heavy drug users are buffoons), his view on America can be rewarding (but u must REALLY pay attention to his seeminlgy chaotic jibberish of thoughts and mumbling). If you can stomach the histeria raidated by the duos drug binges, you could also get a comedic value. But I guess you must have something to relate to....
B000001EG6|5.0|Well, after the failure of his debut, LP, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, Elton returned to do this one.  The result was something much better than &quot;Empty Sky&quot; because this one was looked after much better than the debut LP.  For one thing, experience producer Gus Dudgeon looked after this one.  Another thing is that Paul Buckmaster was hired to do the arrangements of the orchestras that would become so definitive in this album.  Elton John performed live with the London Symphony Orchestra and started something that, according to John Lennon, was the first new thing since the Beatles happened.   This album is definitely one of the Top 5 albums Elton John has ever done in his career, and certainly worthy of a five-star rating, by my books.  It kicks off with &quot;Your Song&quot;, which is one of his best-known songs, and there you see what most of the album is.  It's a slow song backed by an orchestra which was very popular in 1970 and 1971.  Another highlight is &quot;The First Episode At Hienton&quot;, a HEAVILY orchestrated song with Elton playing a very romantic piano and singing very melodically.  Another highlight is &quot;Sixty Years On&quot;, which is the most orchestrated song on this whole album, where Elton is singing about not wanting to grow old.  &quot;I Need You To Turn To&quot; is somewhat different, Elton playing harpsichord and the orchestra still backing him.  &quot;Border Song&quot; is one of his more familiar song, spreading a message of hope for peace in a gospel-flavor.  BUt, not all the album is slow with orchestras.  Elton also has rocky songs with orchestras backing.  Both &quot;Take Me To the Pilot&quot; and &quot;The Cage&quot; (the former very incomprehensible - even by Elton and Bernie Taupin - and the other one is the cold world he is isolated in.)  &quot;The King Must Die&quot; finishes the album, and is probably my favorite song on the album.  It is epic-like, and sounds like a fantasy, actually.   The bonus tracks are worthy of listening to.  &quot;Bad Side of the Moon&quot; is a good song (one of his first singles), &quot;Grey Seal&quot; (which is redone on &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; LP in a better way), and &quot;Rock and Roll Madonna&quot; which is a nice rock number.  <br />This album is very much worth checking out for Elton fans or people wanting to become Elton fans.  Slows songs and rocky songs, but they all have one common thread:  orchestral backing.
B00004VVNB|4.0|This is a thought-provoking film that stands on it's own 25 years later.  This film has much less of the &quot;duh&quot; factor that I associate with a movie such as Star Wars.  This is sci-fi for grown-ups, with a few &quot;gee-whiz&quot; concepts thrown in to keep everybody interested.<br />While it is based on Nolan's work, I found that there are many parallels to Ayn Rand's book, Anthem.  The dangers of closed society egilalitarianism was a popular subject in the mid-70s.  Books like Logan's Run and Anthem (though written many years before) inspired this movie.  Rush's rock masterpiece 2112 was also a punctuation mark of the social atmosphere and concerns of 1976.
B000056V73|4.0|this Film Works Because the Pacing alone is really cool.it doesn't Lag&amp;it's easy to follow with.it takes folks back to a Time When &quot;ROlling Stone&quot; Magazine was still a Important Cover&amp;the Music&amp;Subject was Something else to get there Cover.after the 80's&amp;early 90's just like MTV it went down the Tubes but back in it's Glory it was something else.I Dug the Plane Scenes that was something Else.I Respect Cameron Crowe's WOrk Very Interesting youth&amp;Fantasy Takes that SHow the Realitys Sooner than Many are wanting to Know.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Many reviewers have said that this album is over-the-top, overdone, and too &quot;frilly&quot;. But on the contrary, I found this album very pleasing to the Pop/R&amp;B Department, as well as Christmas. True, I'm writing this in July, but even now, I pop it in the cd player, and just listen to how powerful Christina's awesome voice is. I think it is perfect to set the mood for Christmas gift-opening. It's true that it's not good for a soft, quiet Christmas party, but for dancing on New Year's Eve, it's an awesome buy. And any time of the year, if you don't listen intently to the Christmas lyrics, you will easily be entranced in her vocal roller coaster ride. So I urge anyone who likes the Whitney, Mariah, etc. scene to buy this awesome album. You WILL NOT be disappointed.
B000007MVD|5.0|I really love this collection.  Not only is it a real treat for the ears, it is also a nod to the pioneers of rock and roll.  It is a history lesson contained on 2 delightful CDs.<br />Inveterate Beatle fans will love this collection; for folks just getting familiar with the Beatles or who prefer the more well known songs, e.g. &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; will certainly appreciate all the fine music these CDs have to offer.<br />Each Beatle is individual, unique and distinct and it is that individuality that shines through like a beacon during their performances and interviews.  Their musical blends &quot;Come Together&quot; nicely; George demonstrates excellent, strong lead guitar playing on early rock and roll hits such as &quot;Young Blood,&quot; &quot;Lucille&quot; and &quot;Nothin' Shakin.&quot;  Indeed, it is George Harrison's treatment of such early classics that add to the appeal of this collection; he demonstrated a real flair for rockabilly style.<br />Ringo maintained a steady beat and provided humorous insights into the Beatle banter of the day; John regaled his listening audience with his gift for natural expression and Paul remained, in a sense, the spokesman.  Paul, also could hold his own during a light hearted exchange.  However, it is McCartney who provided the most serious answers and insights into Beatle exchanges and issues related to the group.  One could regard Paul as the Ambassador; he provides a strong voice of reason and background into the world's most successful band.<br />Timeless classics such as &quot;Things We Said Today,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; are included in this collection.  Interviews with the Beatles are interspersed throughout the collection; the wide range of songs from early rock classics of the 1950s to their own then current hits make for an enjoyable listening experience.  It is truly a lesson in the early days of rock and roll; one listens to the Beatles' interpretations and opinions of the early rock pioneers and one gets a real sense of how these early rockers influenced the Beatles to the extent that they did.<br />Previously unrecorded Lennon-McCartney tunes such as the haunting &quot;I'll Be On My Way&quot; are included on these CDs.

B00004Y7SF|5.0|Many reviewers have said that this album is over-the-top, overdone, and too \\"frilly\\". But on the contrary, I found this album very pleasing to the Pop/R&B Department, as well as Christmas. True, I'm writing this in July, but even now, I pop it in the cd player, and just listen to how powerful Christina's awesome voice is. I think it is perfect to set the mood for Christmas gift-opening. It's true that it's not good for a soft, quiet Christmas party, but for dancing on New Year's Eve, it's an awesome buy. And any time of the year, if you don't listen intently to the Christmas lyrics, you will easily be entranced in her vocal roller coaster ride. So I urge anyone who likes the Whitney, Mariah, etc. scene to buy this awesome album. You WILL NOT be disappointed.
B00003CY5H|5.0|That is the only reason why I saw this film. My first time of seeing Marlon Brando on the big screen! .... And, boy, what a treat! But I'll be honest, THE SCORE, despite it's generic title, was truly a suspenseful and satisfying film. ....<br />Robert De Niro plays Nick Wells, an aging thief who wants to get out of the business and settle down with his flight attendent girlfriend Diane, played by Angela Bassett. Ed Norton plays upstart thief Jackie Teller, who sometimes masquerades as retarded janitor Brian. And my favorite actor in the world, Marlon Brando, plays Nick's fence and mentor Max Baron.<br />The film has Nick drawn back once more for a final steal, a royal specter hidden in Montreal, Canada. He teams up with Jackie in order to steal the scepter and make their fortunes. Of course, there is conflict. Nick doesn't want to team up with Jackie; he has never worked with a partner before. ....Unfortunately, things go awry and there is some backstabbing towards the end. ....<br />This film was definitely a good way to reissue the faded genre of thief films. ....But this film, aided and abetted by the masterful Brando, charmismatic De Niro, and, ...Ed Norton.... Frank Oz, known for directing many Muppets films for Jim Henson, does an excellent job in putting us along for the ride. <br />And what a ride it is!
0793509602|5.0|Don't let the title of this book mislead you.  This is more than just Metal guitar...a lot more!  It's Metal plus any style of rock lead guitar from the late sixties to the present.  Basically, if you have an electric guitar, an amp, some form of overdive/distortion and you want to play rock lead, then you need this book.<br />Troy's method is unique in that he has developed a notation system that combines guitar TAB with rhythm notation, which makes it very easy to learn what is being shown.  All of the material is presented in bite sized pieces along with some pretty cool licks to practice it with. Everything that is in the book is demonstrated on the CD.  Each chapter concludes with a complete original song with full band backing.  It's played on the CD first with the lead part and then without, so that you can hear how it should sound and then jam along with the band.  So at the end of the first chapter you're already playing lead guitar!  However, I would not recommend this book to someone who is just starting to learn how to play.  If you're a newbie I'd recommend Troy's &quot;Metal Lead Guitar Primer&quot; to learn all of the basics first (written in the same format with licks and songs).<br />Troy also mixes in a little bit of music theory, speed exercises and improvisational technique, thus helping you to develop your own sound and style.<br />It's very simple: IF YOU WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY ROCK LEAD GUITAR BUY THIS BOOK!
630281474X|5.0|I rented this movie because I have recently become a fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee.  Terence Fisher's &quot;The Horror Of Dracula&quot; is a must-see for all horror fans.<br />Vampire hunter Jonathan Harker attempts to destroy Count Dracula(Christopher Lee) but fails and becomes a vampire himself.  Dracula then sets his sights on Harker's fiancee and her family.  Harker's friend and fellow vampire hunter, Doctor Van Helsing(Peter Cushing), sets out to stop Dracula without failure.<br />Christopher Lee played Dracula in more than half-a-dozen films but &quot;The Horror of Dracula&quot; features his first and best outing as this character.  The movie is very suspenseful and exciting.  Jimmy Sangster's screenplay for this picture is perhaps the best of all the Christopher Lee-Dracula movies; &quot;The Horror Of Dracula&quot; has none of the logic and continuity problems that would plague many of the later movies.  Peter Cushing is a great Van Helsing.  The special effects at the end of the movie are awesome, particularly considering that this movie was made long before the era of computer-generated special effects.<br />If you only see one Christopher Lee-Dracula movie, make it Terence Fisher's &quot;The Horror Of Dracula.&quot;
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica is simply amazing.  They have conquered thrash metal, are slowly gaining ground in alternative metal, if there is such a thing, and now have totally conquered orchestral metal.  Now I know that orchestral metal sounds like an oxymoron, but after hearing S&amp;M, I know that it exists.  This cd is breathtaking.    Plain and simple.  Metallica takes the listener on a journey through, to quote Jason from the video/dvd, melancholy dementia.  Never has a harpsichord sounded so heavy.  Buy these cd's, and prepare to be blown away.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie, though comical at some times, is another Star Wars triumph.  The fact that it is part of the Star Wars saga gives it that right.  Everyone complains..Jar Jar had a huge role in this movie.  The Ewoks were the same.  I thought the movie was powerful. The movies have changed my life..
B000002U8G|5.0|If you like Floyd and dont have this CD, buy it right now. I guarantee you will not be dissappointed. I have listened to the last song on this cd, Echoes, (23 minutes long), about 1,000 times and never tire of it. Either its a classic piece of floyd (and a classic of modern music/modern art)  or i am crazy. Starting with a primordial beep, it progresses through a sort of jurassic pterodactyl birth-of-the-earth kinda groove. Complex and expansive, its the best thing floyd has ever done.......        If you like art museums, put this one on some headphones when you go. It is a great backdrop for the imagination.      [....]
B0000024SI|5.0|It's just the very first disc I'd suggest to anyone starting to listen to &quot;real&quot; rock of the sixties.
B000000WA2|5.0|As you can tell from my user name, I am a Blur fan indeed. I have purchased all my Blur CD's completely out of order which may give me a better perspective on this than fans who have followed them throughout the years in sequence.  <br />The Great Escape is a far cry from the catchy light pop of Parklife and nowhere near as experimental as 13 or blur (w/Song 2).  The songs have the catchy hooks that most Blur songs have and you find yourself humming along right away.<br />Get pass the gloss and delve into the lyrics. You will find that life in the suburbs are not your typical stiff-upper lip, rather seedy and in some cases downright disturbing, which is exactly why I adore this CD.  I like to refer to this as their &quot;Nick Cave CD&quot;. The lyrics are undeniably witty and if you close your eyes you can almost envision a Monty-Python skit.  Wife-swapping, (Stereotypes) respectable men in &quot;french knickers&quot; (Mr. Robinson's Quango), country gentelmen popping psych meds (Country House) and an upper class educated twit who knows the difference between &quot; his claret and beaujolais&quot; and often gets nosebleeds (Charmless Man).  Quite a cast of characters told in a manner that is oh so respectable and British.<br />Most of the songs on this you can get on The Best of Blur, but you would be missing out on some classic Blur material that examines the UK society with tounge in cheek. <br />Again, if you are new to Blur and are expecting experimental and super lo-fi, this may not be your cup of tea. But if you like catchy tunes and melodies with sarcasm oozing from the lyrical end, pick this one up!
B00004TDRD|5.0|You simply have got to admire Steven Spielberg's tenacity while mired in this seemingly endless project.  He just wouldn't quit until he had created the classic known as \\"Jaws\\".  And he pulled it off.  We hear in the making-of documentaries of how the mechanical shark would always be on the fritz!  And of the actors waiting for hours, or days, to complete a given scene!  It must have been hell!  Especially considering the locales!  But this, in the final analysis of this landmark picture, actually proved to ADD to the suspense of the final cut!  Because the darn maneater refused to eat, Steven was forced to shoot many a scene (intended to include the predator) without the shark...proving once more the theory: the scariest things are the things we CAN'T see!  And when we finally see those huge jaws opened for the first time....WOW! What an impact!  I still jump when I see it!<br /><br />This film has all elements that make up a classic thriller: tension beyond belief, suspense, great acting, and the occasional \\"Oh Jesus!\\" surprise shocks.  I wonder how many people who have seen this movie were scared to death at the very end when the camera follows Brody & Hooper toward the shore...thinking, just maybe, another \\"bite\\" was coming!  (I know I did!) Ever wonder what Jaws would look like if made today featuring all the advanced computer imaging??  Might have been interesting. But it certainly would NOT have had as much suspense as the 1975 Jaws, because no doubt the shark would have popped his head out of the water much earlier in the film.  Nah....You can't improve on a Classic anyway!  And Jaws is definitely that!<br /><br />The Universal Home Video DVD has some very nice Bonus Features on it too -- a great \\"Making-Of\\" feature, some deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers, and more.<br /><br />The Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer on the \\"25th Anniversary\\" DVD Edition is first-rate as well. Rock solid. The Dolby 5.1 audio is of high quality too.<br /><br />DVD Recommendation Of The First Order!<br /><br />\\"Hooper!! Ya idiot!!\\"\\"Hooper!! Ya idiot!!\\"
B00004KD1L|4.0|Probably most famous for the Sex And The City Theme, this UK duo is made by London DJs Tom Findlay and Andy Cato.<br /> They can sometimes sound as French duo AIR or Daft Punk. But their sound has disco music looping, loaded with overdubs taken from old songs, and they are willing to openly flirt with jazz, some tunes even having flugelhorn, trumpet and/or trombone in them.<br /> I think this quote I read in a UK Web site about them describes their work farily well: &quot;In the world of electronica, about as organically sublime as it gets.&quot;
6305307261|5.0|This is simply the finest vampire film I think was ever made. Nothing else comes close. There is no &quot;Hollywood&quot; in this film. This is just stark romantic horror at its finest...and bleakest. The cinematography is incredible which is to be expected since Herzog is a master of creating a mood on film. Nothing really needs to be said about Kinski. The man was totally mad. You can actually find yourself feeling a little concerned about what his mental stability was like when he made films like this (Especially the films he made with Herzog). Any serious fan of film should own this DVD.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is an incredibly good CD,i picked it randomly looking for new artists.Its definately the most unique music ive heard in a long time.Its the perfect blend of hip hop,pop,punk,rock,and almost everything else.It has its own genre,everybody who likes music at all should add this to their collection.
6305908648|4.0|I have always loved the Concert for Group and Orchestra. The new version is excellent (sound, image and direction); however, the old one excels. Why? First, in the new one there is a feeling of something already accomplished. Lord and company do not have to show anything: everybody in the public and even in the orchestra know the concert works and is good. The uncertainty, the encounter with the unknown, is missing here, while it was the great sensation on the first version. Second, the great selfindulgence of the past is also missing. The solos, particularly the guitar ones, are reduced, in order to adapt to an economy prone musical industry (do not bore the audience with long experiments, seems to be the order). Third, times are not the same. Sixties audience was the perfect frame for this kind of music: adventurous, innovative, iconoclast. Those are the reasons for not giving five stars to this DVD. Everything is OK, but, unfortunately for rating, there is an exceptional precedent. Get it for image, sound and extra songs; however, do not forget that there is a better one. By the way, I do not belong to the sixties generation, so my appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I, like most of the other reviewers was introduced to Gorillaz by the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; video on MTV.  I knew this was not your ordinary trip-hop combo right away and thought that I could hear something familiar.  On a whim, I bought it and was suprised that Damon from Blur was involved (as you can tell by my  user name, I was gleeful to say the least).  The added bonus was Miho Hatori (Cibo Matto) with her familiar sampling skills and quirky, if not charming voice.  This CD is packed with every combination of music you can think of ! It has everything that a Cibo Matto and Blur fan could hope for, incredible lo-fi sound with brilliant synth samples! I have listened to it non-stop since I bought it and I am constantly hearing different nuances and suprises! I am not familiar with Da Funky Homosapien, but now inclined to explore that territory!<br />It is difficult to pick one track over the other but with if you like experimental blending of all types of music, such as Beck, wry wit, samples you have never heard and what I consider an intelligent style of rapping (a la Beastie Boys) this CD has your name written all over it!<br />My one piece of advice is that you don't buy it solely on the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; track, it gives a slightly skewed perspective on the rest of the CD.  If you are looking for more songs like that you may be dissapointed.  <br />This is perhaps the most exciting CD I have purchased in a couple of years. The entire package is fabulous and creative including the &quot;cartoon band&quot; with thier alter egos.  I hope for more collaborations soon.  Be sure and check out he website as well, that is full of many suprises!  <br />Cheers!
6300216268|5.0|My favorite movie of all time and one that still gets better every time i see it. Humor, drama, love, loss are all poignently brought across from both Bud Cort's and Ruth Gorden's portrayals of their brilliantly scripted characters. I saw it first in the theater, but now as a full-grown adult some of the nuances and lessons of love i now understand so much more. Using Cat Stevens as the soundtrack deserves whatever award goes to who made that decision! (I often judge new friends by if they've seen it, and liked it, or if they haven't, and i show them that they &quot;understand&quot; when to laugh.)
0783117388|4.0|Looking for some mindless fun? &quot;Sex&quot; is hard to beat. Just as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; captured the lives of four characters with no apparent sources of income, more time and friends than most people could expect, and an extended childhood lifestyle, &quot;Sex and the city&quot; offers four attractive women, little evidence of fully engaging employment, and full access to the excesses of New York. The four female leads are very attractive, each in her own partially peculiar way. Their tastes differ yet converge on men, clothes and sex, but not necessarily in that order. Are they sexy? You bet? Are they looking for husbands? It would appear so. Are they good marital prospects? I doubt it.<br />For any woman who dreamed of living his or her post-college days in Manhattan, this -- I can only imagine -- is the fantasy on screen. Eighteen thirty-minute episodes. Watch them all an pass on the tapes to your married friends who can't follow the schedule on HBO.
0446677450|4.0|But of course, even after reading the book, we find those that focused on the &quot;words&quot; and not the &quot;story&quot; behind it.  There is a very simplistic yet valuable lesson to be learned here which is priceless - do yourself a favor, keep an open mind, read the book, learn the lesson.  If you are not ready to challenge your financial way of thinking, then skip this book since it will not help you. It has definitely impacted my approach to money.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I purchased this cd two weeks ago and it hasn't been taken from my cd player yet!  This is the type of music that you just appreciate more and more every time you listen - it takes you away from what country music has become today to what country/blugrass music is supposed to be!  A thoroughly enjoyable soundtrack that has become my absolute favorite cd in my collection.
0767819446|3.0|This movie was nothing spectacular, simply looking at it as a movie.  But from another perspective it was very appreciable.  Only if you look at the theme philosophically can it really be a clever idea.  If you can relate the data structures that are the simulated characters, and relate it to our situation and biological reductionism, i.e. if vitalism is false,  then you will see what I mean.  It also reminded me that The Matrix is not as unique as thought by the general public.  Since the general public is the unphilosophical majority of men, I can see why this movie was not nearly as successful.
1572523166|5.0|Bowie's active &quot;habit&quot; during the filming of this movie only enhanced the film's brilliance and our empathy for the character's clear existential dilemma coupled with his palpable disorientation in our world so far from his home. I saw it in the theater in its original release, and then again as a full-grown adult. It gave me different perspectives, but no less fascination. I've been a Bowie fan since my first album purchase of Images (1967-72) with five bucks my parents gave me to spend at the record store. The songs on that particular album were equally accessible to a five-year old (me) or someone rather happily stoned (my parents), so... This film gets into you, but only if you're capable of being open to its brilliance!
6304504012|5.0|I own the VHS of this movie and I enjoyed it very much (seen it about 4 times already). I usually don't care for musicals very much, but when I watched this movie, I enjoyed it and learned alot about Evita at the same time (even though it wasn't exactly correct). I enjoyed the music too...two of my favorites in this movie is &quot;A New Argentina&quot; and &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot;. I already know Madonna's singing (ever since I was a teen in the 1980s), but Antonio Bandaras' singing is surprising....he is great in it! If you enjoy musicials, or Madonna, Antonio, or Jonathan Pryce, you will love this movie! :) I enjoyed it alot myself.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have never been a big Tool fan.  Then I heard APC and it was an interesting sound.  After listening to APC alot I learned that it was the voice of Maynard that interested me.  Don't get me wrong, APC's musicianship is excellent and they play well on their CD.<br />Then I decided to buy Lateralus.  Wow, it really gave me a completely different understanding about Tool.  I never knew how deep and complex a band Tool was.  The music drew me in and was just beyond what I have ever heard.  The feeling was complete in it's all encompassing range of every emotion imaginable.<br />I liked Lateralus so much I decided to buy Aenima.  Aenima is the best recording I've ever experienced.  Aenima is a better overall experience then Lateralus.  Lateralus is magnificent, but Aenima is personal.  It digs very deep.  The music is compelling.  It's perfect music in that every note seems to fit just right.<br />Get Aenima if Lateralus is the first Tool CD you bought.  Compare the two without judging either.  You'll appreciate the differences and the unique feeling of each.<br />But I'm telling you, Aenima is much more personal.  In my opinion, this makes it a better CD.<br />The bottom line is Tool is a band that you cherish.  They have a gift.
B00003CY5K|5.0|this was actually a pretty funny movie. dont make the previews think this looks like a dumb movie. the beginning is sort of dumb but it getts better much better. its all about a girl that goes to harvard to impress her ex boyfriend and turns out her ex boyfriend is engaged to another women. its just got an awesome way of making a movie good.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Appauling is one way to describe this album, but that wouldn't nearly be harsh enough. The repetative formula throughout the whole album gets boring and makes you feel like a right saddo if you actually listen to his lyrics. The rest could prevail without Fred as he can't write and that squeky voice is just annoying. He is 35 for god's sake! Listen to &quot;My Generation&quot; with this in mind and you'll understand all of what i've just said.     The only condolence is the fact that the MI2 tune is okay. &quot;MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY&quot;, yeah, okay then Fred.
B000001DZM|5.0|Yes, all the songs i grew up skating to at the local rink! Yes, i had tennis shoe rollerskates then! This just brings it all back in a tremendously fun package. And remembering the movie while doing so makes it even more campy!
B000051VWW|4.0|I've always enjoyed Sade's music....so soothing and relaxing. I found Lover's Rock to be no exception. Her smooth vocals blend so nicely with the &quot;Pop-R&amp;B-touch of reggae&quot; styled music, it is sure to please your ears. The mood of this cd scales through many emotions, but isn't that synonymous with life anyway!? I really dig this one and think it makes for some good road trippin' music. My two fave songs are By Your Side and King of Sorrow...both of which I can relate to. Really looked forward to this release, as it's been awhile since her last one. Overall, it's a really good cd.
0679720200|4.0|growing up, my last name was frequently misspelled as the author's last name.  after 31yrs (no age jokes please), i figured it was time to read a piece penned by a man with whom i share many consonants and a vowel.  i was not disappointed. mr. camus' story is easy to read and moves quickly (it's only 123 pages).  mr. meursault is a man who seems to live his life on an even keel.  he rarely feels or shows any emotion and other people find this odd.  he seems indifferent when: his mother dies; his neighbor beats a woman in the apartment downstairs; his other neighbor abuses his dog; the woman in his life proclaims her love; the incident which lands him in trouble; and the subsequent debt he owes to society.  the lack of passion and compassion in his psyche makes it impossible for people to understand his actions in the incident which lead to his trial.  there is more to this but i won't spoil the ending for you.
B00004Z459|3.0|When I first listened to this album I was blown away as they were the most original thing for a while, but after about 2 months I found myself skipping tracks half-way through.The point is,is that this album gets VERY boring. When they release a single it just gets over-played and wrecks the song. &quot;A cure for the Itch&quot; is still original and gives you a plesent breather from all the screaming, but don't over-play it, or you'll find that it sinks to the bottom of your CD rack very quickly.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Although this movie keeps you on the edge when it needs to, the bad computer editing reduces the enjoyability in some of the faster moving fighting scenes.<br />The setup and panning of the camera's is great, but due to poor lighting and extra (blood) effects, some of the computer editing has reduced the quality of the end product. In some of the scenes, the movie looks like a low bandwidth video stream, in others the lighting (or background enhancements) make the picture look too artificial.<br />The continuity, set and screenplay are definitely great and eventhough the editing lacks some quality here and there, the whole looks very believeable and true.<br />The quality of the this movie makes it a classic in it's genre. <br />:O)
0671004107|5.0|Definitely the most thought-provoking science-fiction novel I can remember. No, the movie was OK, but don't read this book because of the movie. <br />Sure, if you like Matrix or Star Trek, just the sci-fi aspect of the story would blow you away. But here is more:<br />If you want to know how to reconcile between Religion and Science, Carl Sagan offers such a good view on this ever-controversial topic, I can't help but feeling a subtle shift in my own fundamental philosophy after reading this book.<br />Why are there so many Christians, Catholics, Islamics, Buddhists, or even athiests? You would find such distinction a bit ironic once you read &quot;Contact.&quot;<br />Bravo, Carl Sagan!
B000000H57|4.0|I purchased this album without ever hearing any of Type O Negative's music, so I had no idea whatsoever what I was in for.  It starts out with this very moody piano playing that slowly builds up to a creepy balad, add that deep voice courtesy of Peter Steele and you got a great album opener :Love you to Death, that leaves you wanting more.  Some call it it goth metal, others alternative, whatever it is it's the perfect album for Halloween.  I mean this album brought up those autumn woods at night under a full moon straight outta my mind.  This album is very sexual, lyric wise that is, yet Peter doesn't over do it, wich I like.  My favorite track is Die with me, when Peter sings about dying in the arms of his lover :&quot;If this time, were the last time, let me hold you, hold you, hold you all life long&quot;.  The band is great too, I think the guitar playing is pretty good on this one, just liste to Wolf Moon or in praise of Bacchus : sensational.  Though this album really did do trick for me, I then bought Bloody Kisses, wich I though was better by far, (it's heavier than this one) it blew October away.  Still this is a great album, very consistant and a great listen even if the pumpkins aren't ripe yet and the leaves are still green.
0679879269|1.0|I loved the Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, but was very disappointed in The Amber Spyglass. Those original characters with believable motivations suddenly turn into trite cliches. Then the book deteriorates into a transparent anti-christian polemic. The loose ends abound. This is particularly inappropriate for the young adult readership it is aimed at. The world is saved in part because the two young people discover love(sex).  wow, what a revelation!! Lest you think I am a fanatic, I love Harry Potter and have highly recommended the first two books of this series to students. What a let down.
B000000WA4|5.0|I try and figure out what to label this album all the time.<br />Two discs of the burning elements of rock that won't stop spinning in your CD player, I tell you. The Pumpkins are one of the greatest bands ever - at least they are my favorite - and while this was their last real &quot;rock effort&quot; (say hello to Adore and Machina, dear fans!), it was the key way for them to go out. People criticized Billy Corgan for doing a double release as a third album, but ha, this album was mammothly successful selling well over 10 million albums worldwide. <br />Mellon Collie, disc 1 begins with a piano piece any blind person would vouch for as something out of the 1920s silent film scene, then moving on to &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, one of the several hits spawned by this album and fitting so nicely and shapely to the mold the first track has built. Breaking the mold follows a string of heavy metal hits that Corgan bred himself on, and they are not just your average hard rockin' - no, this is REAL music!<br />Disc 2 is almost what I would refer to as the collection of misfit tunes that end the album with all the confusion it deserves.  Including &quot;1979&quot;! I won't describe much more, because this is an album that is intended to surprise, and its best to leave gaps for the individual mind to fill in.
6305428425|5.0|Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is the most fun movie I have ever seen in my life.  It's a movie to watch more then once and you never get sick of it.  I am a male and just by seeing this movie about these two women, Romy ( Mira Sorvino ) and Michele ( Lisa Kudrow ,) going sarcasm crazy and just having a fun time in life.  <br />    Romy and Michele weren't losers in high school, but they definitely weren't the popular girls.  They were just there.  The \\" A \\" group, made up of a few girls, were the popular group and really made their life hell.  Kristy Masters, I don't know the actresses name, was a total, well, female dog and was mean to Romy and Michele.  Romy and Michele were like best friends and they only did stuff with each other.<br />   Now it's 10 years later, and the girls are about 27.  They still have their sarcasm and everything, and they live together in California.  Romy bumps into Toby, Janeane Garafolo, at the place she works, the Jaguar Car Dealership.  Toby says how the 10 year reunion is coming up and Romy was puzzled ... she never got an invitation.  So the girls decide to go to the reunion, but one problem ... they want to look successful.  They want to show everyone how good they look, how they act, how proud they are that they live in California while everyone else is stuck in Tuscon, Arizona, where the reunion is.  I will stop here, as I don't want to tell the whole movie.<br />    Anyways, just see this movie.  It is so excellent ... you will start making sarcasm a part of your language....
B00003CX8V|5.0|Whenever you hear the name of the late, great Jack Lemon, it is invariably followed by &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;, being named his best film. I must disagree, because I feel the film, &quot;The Apartment&quot;, is his masterpiece. In fact all three principles in the making of this film (Billy Wilder, Shirley Maclaine, and Lemon himself) are at the top of their game.This is the story of a mild mannered, white collar, office worker, who is trying to get ahead at a large IBM like corporation, by loaning out the key to his apartment to various married, corporate executives, for an array of infidilties.Along the way he falls in love and must decide,what is more important,love or getting ahead at the office? This is a very touching film that mixes it's humor with pathos. It is also a bit of a time capsule, which shows us what the 1950s, button down, corporate life must have been like, before the days of feminism and casual Fridays. Also, special mention should be made of the wonderful supporting characters played by Fred MacMurray and Ray Walston. MacMurray is a wonderful villan as the big boss and Walston is a hoot with his &quot;buddy boy&quot; lingo.This film is a wonderful way to spend an evening.
0140544518|1.0|I thought this was a cute concept and was looking forward to giving it to my grandchildren. However, I was horrified when the wolf ate the pigs. The book was very funny except for this part so if eating the pigs doesn't bother you I would recommend it. However, I will be returning it.
B00005A0Q7|5.0|I remember when I read the book The Catcher in the Rye, Holden's sister (ol' Pheobe) loved The 39 Steps. I knew I just had to get it and see what was so great. Of course, Amazon.com was the first place I looked, and of course, after 2 seconds of searching, they had it!
B000023VR6|5.0|ummm...ummmm...WOW!!!! Dre, possibly on of the best rappers EVER. Everybody always says that The Chronic was soo bad, and nasty, but this proves them wrong.  There is only one thing I didn't really like about the CD though. The music is great, and I like the beat, that's why I gave it 5 stars, but I think he has too many guests on the CD. It's not really Dr. Dre., but it more like a Combo of Rappers, like &quot;The Tunnel.&quot;
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is one of THE BEST films I have seen in my life. It is completely mesmerizing, to the point where you lose your self in it, and at the end you feel nothing less than complete shock. Requiem for a Dream involves you like very few other films do. Completely mind-blowing, amazingly acted, totally real.
B0000025F7|4.0|This is a great album.  If you are going to buy a MJ album, this is the one to get--for all of the reasons stated previously.  What bothers me is that the cover has changed from the old LP days.  There used to be a picture of Michael with a big afro from the waist up on one side and the current cover on the other.  What happened to the waist up side??  It is not even in the insert!!!!  Did Michael have it removed because he didn't want people comparing his face then with the covers of his post-surgery albums??  I guess celebrity does screw with your head. Otherwise, a classic album.
0783229011|5.0|I've seen this film several times since I bought it several years ago.  The only bad thing about it is that it's not in letterbox format, which I have always preferred to the pan-and-scan method. There are some TV shows these days that are in widescreen, so why is it that so many movies have never been released this way?  I'm getting off the subject, though.<br />I never really thought I'd like this movie.  The first thing I thought of when I heard it was out in theaters was, &quot;It's 'Charlotte's Web' in a different form&quot;.  Well, in a way this was accurate, but in other ways it was dead wrong.  Yes, the animals do talk, but this is defintely not &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot;!  I suppose I still have an image of the animated version of that book.  Babe proves himself to be a much more capable pig, even if he is a little young and in need of some help sometimes, but I would have to say that I found this film much more endearing.  It's got heart and feeling to it, but it also isn't overly-sentimental or sappy.  The animatronics are done very well.  I've seen films that use puppets or animatronics (think of them as mechanical puppets, like what the Henson people use) before and after I saw this film, and I think this film still has some of the best work in it.  It's very hard to tell which are the real animals and which are the mechanical.  <br />It's also hard to tell where this film takes place.  It looks as if it could be in Scotland or the USA.  The landscape has a very timeless feel to it, too--even though a fax machine is present in the film, I couldn't help but feel that most of the film took place in a time before telephones.<br />This is one of those films that adults wouldn't mind taking their kids to.  Heck, I don't even have any kids, but once I finally saw a copy of this movie at my friend's house (he's way older than me, and also has no kids), I no longer thought he was a lunatic for owning a copy of a kid's film.  The opening credit sequences are some of my favorites, and I also enjoy the song the farmer sings to Babe (though one of the first things my friend did was buy a copy of the classical piece it was based on for me :).<br />This film will be in my collection for a very long time.
B000002MNR|5.0|I read listeners reviews on this CD and went out and purchased. What an incredible sound.  I listen to Pink Floyd to Sarah Brightman and this is now one of my favorites .  Everyone who listens to it , of all ages , wants it.  Thanks to those who reviewed before me.
B000059T5O|5.0|The tracks on this CD are so alive I can't help dancing and moving when it is playing.  Hammond has a strong voice that was made for the blues, and the musicianship of all the participants is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
0393317552|1.0|Why did European civilization become dominant? The author thinks it has to do with animals, plants, trees, dirt, and rocks. It's because of the environment he believes. As if it was only the Europeans who lived in a suitable environment. How does this explain then the ancient civilization of Mohenjo-daro in the Indus River valley, which had underground plumbing and was a highly advanced society more than 4000 years ago? What about the Inca empire? The Incas developed their own highly advanced culture despite their climate. They also created such marvels as Macchu Picchu and Cuzco. Also, what about China? China invented countless number of things (right now I cannot remember which though). Moreover, when the Aztecs were at their prime Europe was in the dark ages-- the church was ruling Europe with an iron hand and burning people at the stake who didn't accept holy doctrines. (Look up the word &quot;Inquisition&quot; for further information). There were plenty of civiliztions who had scientific know-how back then. Why, then, does the author believe that it was only the European CLIMATE which had anything to do with their technology or culture? Well, obviously he's not looking at the whole picture.<br />During the Renaissance, people in Europe continued what the philosophers of Athens started over a thousand years earlier: SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY and DEMOCRACY! The author believes that since people in Europe had domesticated animals they should be masters of the univerivse! I guess domesticated animals equal Roman Empire or something! During the middle ages though we had domesticated animals, however, they didn't seem to help us any, because we were still toiling in the fields of our feudal lords! Now, are you gonna tell me it was the livestock's idea for the Renaissance? It couldn't have been. Thus, it must've been something else! Could it not have been that people were curious about their world?<br />The Greek physician Hippocrates laid the foundations of scientific medicine by freeing medical study from the constraints of philosophical speculation and superstition. Aristotle, the pupil of Plato, and the tutor of Alexander the Great, and the author of works on logic, metaphysics, ethics, natural sciences, politics, and poetics, profoundly influenced Western thought.

B000001FS3|5.0|A very good album from U2. I mean A CLASSIC one. How many albums do you know that have no bad moments. Not many, right? Well this is one of those albums that start hard and end the same way. The first three songs on the JT may as well be the greatest beginning of an album. But the following minutes of music are as good as the first three songs that were major hits all over the world for U2. Good second half, and i sometimes think it's a better one. This album has so many emotions that it looks like U2 put their souls into making this masterpiece. Well, get it and see for your self. You won't be disappointed.
0780631684|2.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and saw it again (not by choice)  on DVD.  Both times I felt that the film was more of a comedy than anything else.  Anyone with any sense could predict what was going to happen next.<br />And that's the good part, because at least it was funny!  The acting was terrible, the special effects stunk, and it was just an overall bad film.
B00005JG6R|5.0|...I have one complaint... they redid all the voices... and practically rewrote alot of the lines.  I've seen the original english translation several times, and when watching this, it just seems like the lines dont fit the characters.  Minor thing I know, but I also believe it will dissapoint hardcore Akira fans.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I have quite the obsession with Slipknot.  In my opinion, Slipknot is the greatest band in the world.  Most people think i'm crazy, but i know i am.  Slipknot is the bomb.  nobody can f*** with them.  anybody who doesn't have a taste for hardcore music, don't come around whining about how scary they are.  they scared the shit out of you. they completed a goal.  slipknot is for the people who want to hear pain and suffering and thoroughly enjoy it.  if you don't want anything too heavy, don't grab this.  but if you like hardcore, this is going to blow you away.  give it a listen.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I have listened Iron Maiden albums since 1981. The first heavy metal vinyl album I bought was The Number of the Beast (I still have it). I grew up with a diet based on AC/DC, Judas Priest, Motorhead and Iron :-). That said, I almost cried listening to this album. All the epic guitars and lyrics of Powerslave, Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time, are here. Bruce is a heavy metal hero. And my sons are wondering why his daddy has that big smile. UP THE IRONS!
B00003CY5K|5.0|This movie is very well written and acted and is not just a bunch of dumb blonde jokes. It shows a smart blonde who, on the surface, acts dumb. But she is just a person who keeps things simple so long as those arounf her do the same. <br />Inwardly she is quite independent and refuses to conform to the smug intellectualism of  the eastern elite. She reaches out  across class structure and sterotypes and helps people that others will not.<br />.... All of this wrapped is a lot of great humor that had the theater audience laughing loud and often. <br />Only negative are some really off-color lines about male genitals that did nothing for the plot or character development - just there to get the PG-13 rating for the teen audience.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a LONG time.  Hysterical, a must see.  One that you HAVE to buy for the simple pleasure of seeing it again.  The more you see it the better it gets.  The music is good too!
0671024256|5.0|I was not a reader of Stephen King before I read this superb book.  Frankly, I am not fond of the horror-suspense genre.  Like many I know, I pretty much wrote off Mr King's work (a decision based more in prejudice than anything else).  But something led me to pick up a copy of this book.  Perhaps it was the fact that I know I have often liked film versions of his work.  Perhaps it is because I now live in New England, and I have an increasing sense of connection to the 'stories' of this place (and hence, potentially, its storytellers).  Whatever the motivation, I picked up the book -- and I did not want to put it down until I had finished it.<br />What most struck me about Stephen King's book on writing is how well it conveys insight into the Soul of the man and the passion of the writer.  There is a down to earth sense of reality to the encounter one finds in these pages.  King manages to work the magic of giving the reader an opening into his world -- the world within.  The book intrigues me.<br />This book is part personal memoir and part commentary on the craft.  Both parts of the book are priceless and compliment one another perfectly.  King does a lot to make clear to the reader that it is real people who write.  And his comments on writing are no-nonsense and practical.  The book is a wonderful source of advice.<br />More than this, perhaps, it is a source of encouragement.  Stephen King is inviting others into the waters of the craft of writing.  He is helping them to see past misconceptions of what life writing is like and into the reality of hard work and inspired 'magic.'  This book is a very loving work, in a lot of ways.  It is an invitation to storytellers to share their gift.<br />This is an excellent book.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B00000BKDX|5.0|YES!  Iron Maiden songs are that intricate, that beautiful, that intelligently written that I dare compare them to classical music!  When this album first came out, I was already a long-time fan of theirs. I bought the double album, the cassette and the CD, which is a 70 minute thing without side 2.  I just learned today that the CD is available as a double and now I can have ALL the songs on the original album and play them on my computer.  Life is good... :-)<br />The best live heavy metal album ever. And I cannot recommend Hallowed Be Thy Name highly enough...
6305291500|5.0|SPLASH- from 1984- directed superbly by Ron Howard is absolutely the best movie of all time. It offers one of the best love stories ever brought to the screen.The performances were top notch by Daryl Hannah, Tom Hanks and John Candy. This film makes you wonder what it would be like to be in love with a fish. It plays at times like a comedy, and at other times like a fairy tale. I have always had a curiosity about mermaids and I see them as mystical beautiful creatures. Daryl Hannah was absolutely beautiful in this 1984 film which jump-started her career. It was the first movie released by Touchstone Films- a subsidairy of Disney. I am a collector of this film and it's related memorabilia. It is the best film of 1984 and the best film of all time. I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie!!!!  If you haven't seen it- I recommend that you do!! It will forever live in your mind once you do!! We need more movies like this today because we seldom see them anymore. This movie is truly a masterpiece from beginning to end and is my all-time favorite movie!!!!!
B00003CY5K|5.0|It was a better movie than I thought it would be. At first I believed it to be another &quot;Clueless,&quot; which was fine by me, but turned out to be much more than that. It has really good themes and values, such as sticking to what you believe in, following your heart, and building a bridge of trust among those around you. It is a laugh out loud movie that will have you saying, &quot;This is MUCH better than I expected.&quot;
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This is an amazing soundtrack.  I absolutely loved the movie, and the songs contained on this soundtrack are phenomenal.  But there is a slight problem.  Where have the rest of the songs gone?  Where are &quot;Harry Zidler's Rap,&quot; &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular,&quot; &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; &quot;The Show Must Go On,&quot; and variations on &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot;  Fortunately, talk of a second soundtrack has been going around, and is a strong possibility.  So, for the music that this CD contains, I was pleased with the composition and its amazing artists.
6304293321|5.0|I've probably seen this movie somewhere between 15 to 20 times since I was a kid. (I also read the book many moons ago.) It never ceases to entertain and is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes by the time the song &quot;Born Free&quot; resounds at the end. Born Free is the wonderful true story of the raising of Elsa, the lioness, by Joy and George Adamson (sorry to correct another reviewer, but Virgina McKenna was the actress who played Joy Adamson, so it's not the story of Elsa and the McKenna's). The story is heart warming, can be seen by the whole family, &amp; will make you want to book a trip to Kenya when it's all said and done.  No question, this is one of my favorites of all time!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|BRUTAL!!! Nobody even comes close to the ugly, seething rage that this album produces, this is flat-out insanity. These 9 masked metallers combine to create a complex sound, the drumming is wicked, the guitars are downtuned, throbbing weapons of destruction, the screaming is unbeatable, even the scratching by DJ Sid is great, everything meshes together to create an ordered chaos that nobody has yet matched. Top tracks: Wait And Bleed (Who says Corey can't sing?), (sic) (What an opener! Sets the mood for the whole album!), and Surfacing (Captures the live feel like nothing else).<br />If you're into ANY sort of heavy music, you'd better be ready for some kick-your-teeth-in heavy METAL music, it doesn't GET any better than this.
0790744759|5.0|Judy Garland gives one of her finest performances in the delightful period musical MEET ME IN ST LOUIS, still one of the best-loved movies of all time.<br />Esther Smith (Garland) is in love with &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;, and when she discovers that the Worlds Fair is coming to her town, everyone in St Louis is thrilled.<br />Her enchantment only grows when she discovers the feeling of love is mutual, but when her father announces that the family is moving to New York, the romance could be finished before it even began...<br />Margaret O'Brien steals every scene she's in as Esther's little sister Tootie, while the supporting cast, led by Lucille Bremer, Mary Astor and Leon Ames is first-rate.<br />Initially more popular at the box-office than THE WIZARD OF OZ, the evergreen MEET ME IN ST LOUIS continues to be loved by generations of movie-lovers.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I have to start out by saying that Baz Luhrmann is now one of my favorite directors, next to Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick. I loved this movie because it was DIFFERENT. Studios have been making remakes and sequels and it's just getting boring. Even though this movie was a remake, it had a different feeling to it. It is my favorite musical, next to The Sound Of Music.<br />Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should seriously get into singing. They brought out the most beautiful singing voices you could ever imagine. I own the CD and I love the songs that they compiled onto it, even though they forgot a lot of songs from the movie.  They need to come out with a 2nd Volume of the soundtrack.  I am hoping that the DVD will not only have the music video of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, but a commentary by Baz.
0679879269|5.0|This is not only a review of The Amber Spyglass, but a review of the whole series (Amazon.com really should have this) His Dark Materials. Philip Pullman, in this series, has given us a new view on things, a startling view, but one with truth in it, and I think that he deserves credit for that. He also deserves credit for writing the story in such a beautiful way. For me, Philip Pullman has given his view on religion and how it's impacted people and I appreciate that, unlike some people. I like seeing things a different way and if some people can't, then they are keeping their mind closed and unable to experience new things. Not only has Philip Pullman told an amazing and exciting story but he has done it with a deeper purpose than just entertainment as some writers do. I hope people can realize this.
6301966015|5.0|&quot;Blow Up&quot; is about questioning reality. The other reviews mention the ending but neither recognized the critical sounds in the last 30 seconds that bring together the message of &quot;what is reality?&quot; You have to listen carefully at the end! It's a great movie because you find yourself interpreting it in several different ways. It hinges on whether the photographer buys into the mime's game, whether the mimes believe there is a tennis ball, and whether or not the murder actually took place. Watch it over again because there's lots of new things to find in every scene. Definitely good for thought/debate. :)
B000002KBU|1.0|I can't really believe that [anyone] who gave this album 5 stars are telling the truth.  This voice (nauseating) actually gave me a headache.  Asprin is essential.
B00003CY5K|5.0|Legally Blonde, in my opinion, was very good.  Even though there were stupid people in the movie, the movie in itself was entertaining. Reese Witherspoon was a wonderful comedian, and I recommend seeing this movie-there's lots of laughs.
B00003CXN3|5.0|Directed by Steven Soderbergh of Erin Brochovich fame, this high-speed intense film delves deeply into the contradictions, absurdities, cruelties and realities of the war on drugs.  Loosely based on a British mini-series and now set in a North American locale, it packs a strong punch.  One of the story lines takes place in Mexico, filmed in hues of deep yellow and brown, in Spanish with English subtitles.  Benicio Del Toro plays a Mexican cop who must constantly make hard choices as he walks a thin line between degrees of corruption.  He's a fine actor and I was surprised to discover that he is only 34 years old;  he looks much older with his expressive brooding eyes surrounded by dark circles. Michael Douglas is cast as a conservative Ohio judge who is appointed  to lead the fight against drugs in Washington while unaware that his 16-year old daughter, played by Erika Christenen, has a drug problem of her own. And then there is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a 31-year old dazzling beauty whose role becomes more complex as her innocence changes when she realizes that her young family is being supported in their upscale San Diego lifestyle by drug money.  Two San Diego drug enforcement cops played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman provide comic relief.<br />The film is a full 147 minutes but is never boring as there is tension throughout.  It moves fast and skips from story to story, revealing new details which add to its complexity.  I found the developments almost impossible to follow, but it soon became apparent that this was by design and actually a mirror of the realities of the situation.  With the exception of one small part, the film doesn't preach.  Instead it just watches and observes and lets the action and the movement of the characters make its powerful impact.  This is a video that I'd like to see again.  Now that I've been exposed to the general themes, I'd like to watch it more carefully to follow exactly how, by the end, even the well-meaning people all seemed to contribute to the drug mess which thrives within our culture today.  The official tagline says it all.  &quot;No one gets away clean.&quot;  That says it all.o contribute to the drug mess which thrives within our culture today.

B00003CXSP|2.0|This film should have never been made in the first place.  It didn't take the plot of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; any further.  I would have really like to have seen Hannibal eat Clarice.  It would have been a nice and tidy ending.  It would have made the whole thing worth while.  Instead they had to keep Clarice alive so that they could do another sequel.  The whole film is just random acts of violence.  It left something to be desired.  The reason I gave this 2 stars and not 1 is because of the great acting.  Oh and one more thing, if you liked this film, you really have bad taste.
0790736039|1.0|i am so disappointed by this movie. this is nothing like the book. the casting was done horribly. i think the only people who were even cast correctly as thier discription in the book was Richie (played by seth green) and bill (the kid from the never ending story). everybody else didn't even look the the way they should. like stanely uris' mom. she shouldn't been fat in the movie she was an skinny old lady. damn't kids can't we just do what the book says...
B00003CY5K|4.0|Legally Blonde isn't the best film out this summer but it's not the worse. Reese Witherspoon does a fantastic job, she is adorable in this movie. The plot is out there and has a high predicitability rate. But generally it's a fun to watch movie. Yes, it wasn't as funny was I expected but it had it's moments.  Reese's character Elle was the only one which was dynamic. There is a lack of characterization. Sometimes everyone is so stock and stereotypical. But it adds to the humour and the fun.<br />It's a feel good movie, the songs are upbeat and the plot deals with finding what you do best. Why don't you just hang out with the girls and watch this quirky movie?
B000001FO4|5.0|Yes you can call me crazy but please keep reading. This is the greatest album of the pop music era. This cannot be called an album the damn thing is an oratorio the best collection of art since Handel's immortal &quot;The Messiah&quot;. How Keifer got away with this religous message on a major label is beyond me. This album puts accross so much heart and soul it would make Otis Redding smile and cry. I would love to see what Keifer went through to write these songs and what the release looked like when he put them on paper. The album must be listened to from first song to last and you should probably sit down and read the lyrics as the record plays as it will tell you a story of life, love, heartache,strength,hope, and acceptance. Please forget about image when you listen even though theirs was over the top it did not effect the music like it may have with some other bands of this genre. When it comes to hairbands no one could play the blues like these guys.<br />Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart At The Seams- Great mood swings starts out with a Robert Johnson influence and winds up hard rock.<br />Gypsy Road-A rock anthem, should be a classic<br />Don't Know What You Got(Till It's Gone)-The slow song, the hit, but aside from that it tells an honest soulful story<br />The Last Mile-cool riff, great lyrics,good vocal arrangements.<br />Second Wind-Makes a simple but nessacary statement to the albums story<br />Long Cold Winter-A 12 bar blues in a minor key played with metal distortion.My favorite song on the record. It is my opinion that this is currently the highest evolution of the blues as the current artists rehash the same old thing. Includes the most soulful singing and guitar playing you can hear. A Keifer Masterpiece<br />If You Don't Like It-Every piece of work will have parts of it you like better or worse, but the songs statement is again useful to the story<br />Coming Home-great guitar arrangements, great lyrics, maybe the best song on the record<br />Fire and Ice-I like the music and the words again need to be there<br />Take Me Back-The title says it all. Fun song,great lyrics and slide guitar.<br />This album is a must have for ANYONE. People need to hear this band and pay no mind to the bad rap. Tom Keifer is one of the most gifted and underrated songwriters of all time. Any artist throwin' it down from their heart and soul should not be denied.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard their first single, one step closer, I thought that linkin park would be another limp bizkit (which i also like). I decided to let this album go and spend my money on something more original. Then I went to my cousins house. She forced me to hear the album and it was one of the most well produced and well harmonized cds of the genre. I went home, got the album, and played the hell out of it. Papercut is perhaps one of the most catchy songs ever, and crawling, pushing me away, with you, and points of authority are all great songs. But I must say, this album features one of the best songs of all time, which is entitled &quot;The End&quot;. This song blends all the bands talents, and meshes them into one hell of a song. Overall, a must buy for anyone who likes this genre, and i even recomend listening to the end and giving this group a try even if you dont like rap/rock.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I can't believe I like the ballads. I HATED ballads before I bought this. Britney does ballads right. And the fast songs are so danceable. I just think the Titanic Interlude is SO corny in \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" and she says \\"Baby\\" too much. ....
B00004VXF2|5.0|Whether you consider &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; to be groundbreaking art that was years ahead of its time or a major bird-flip to everyone in sight, the fact is: it works. As art, as a statement, as a genuine piece of Lou Reed mischief. Sixty minutes of pure amplifier feedback and nothing else, complete with stream of consciousness liner notes and even a chemical equation on the album jacket. And this reissue has been remastered, numbered and presented in a groovy-cool 3-D slipcase that you can stare at in endless fascination while listening! <br />&quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; is not unlike the ambient stylings of today's avant garde electronic artists (turntablist DJ Spooky comes to mind), or even a raw version of early Eno. Reed insisted (in an interview with Lester Bangs) that there were melodies from Beethoven's &quot;Eroica&quot; and other classical pieces embedded in the harmonic structure (in fact, RCA almost released the album on their classical label!). Reed later admitted the classical angle was nonsense. <br />It seems a safe bet to view this album as Reed's cynical anti-art statement to a fawning public, prompted by the popularity of &quot;Rock n Roll Animal&quot; and &quot;Sally Can't Dance&quot; - two commercial successes that preceded &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, and both of which Reed has since disowned. <br />The fact that this album exists is one of the most delicious pieces of absurdity in the history of music. Who among us is too humorless to take a practical joke? Everyone should own this, if only as a reminder to not take life so seriously. Listen to it while folding the laundry, or while contemplating the meaning of life - it's all the same thing anyway, right?
0694013889|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't crazy about this book at first.  I was a bit uncomfortable with the author's use of euphemisms for body parts and functions, for example.  Soon I realized that this book spoke exactly to my 2-year-old daughter's level and she LOVES both the book and video.  (I think I can recite it word for word by now!)  The video is somewhat updated from the book in terms of the quality of illustration, the depiction of the potty, and the inclusion of Mom AND Dad in the storyline.  She is not yet fully potty trained, but we're definitely making some progress.
0671004107|4.0|I've never read a fiction novel so thought-provoking and based on actual science than Contact. It is extemely well-written and interesting. It satires nationalism, sexism, religious fanaticism, and government in a funny way we can all relate to from personal experience. The plot itself is original, a big &quot;what if?&quot;. Few works of fiction are on such an epic scale, few are as intelligent, and few inspire such a sense of awe and wonder. It goes very deep into the issues of religious philosophy, faith versus skepticism, and the possiblity of extraterrestrial life. These are the many good qualities of Contact.<br />   There are some bad qualities, too. The basic theme of the book, that you can have faith in something even when there is only evidence to the contrary and when everyone else ridicules the idea, seems to be pretty stupid. A Christian fundamentalist-scientist-preacher who rejects evolution and the age of the universe, and rants about messages from God and Satan and the immorality of scientists is made into a hero. And the thing about Pi (as in 3.14....) at the very end is absolutely ridiculous. <br />    Conclusion: a well-written, interesting read that has a stupid theme and is sometimes ridiculous.
6304457391|5.0|John Frankenheimer followed up his 1962 cult classic THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE with SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, a very sobering but nevertheless gripping Cold War political thriller that remains interesting from start to finish.<br />The president (Frederic March) is about to sign a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union in order to ease tensions between the superpowers.  But the Soviets have had a history of renegging, and this prompts March's poll numbers to go through the floor.  It also opens the door for General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to plan a coup d'etat against March.<br />The only problem is, though, that a dedicated underling (Kirk Douglas) has gotten wind of the attempt.  At the moment, Douglas has no hard proof on him, only whisperings of a secret base or operation known as ECOMCON.  But it is enough to get March to consider the possibility, and he gets his closest friends, including a congenial but inebriated Georgia senator (Edmond O'Brien) to investigate.<br />When the proof is presented to March, he realizes that this coup is not just being caused by Lancaster's men, it is caused by the age in which we live--a nuclear age.  The superbly mounted confrontation between March and Lancaster in the Oval Office in which March reveals his hand is one of the great dramatic moments of 1960s cinema.<br />All the performances in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY are brilliant, and Frankenheimer's direction is appropriately suspenseful in the best Hitchcock tradition.  The Charles Bailey/Fletcher Knebel novel upon which this film is based was excellently adapted to the screen by Rod Serling; and while there is a moral tone to the film, it is never heavy-handed.  Jerry Goldsmith's fine score tops everything off.<br />Next to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, and FAIL SAFE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is an essential Cold War drama that, despite the fact that the Cold War acutally ended over a decade ago, has lost none of itspunch.
B00003CY5H|5.0|Just when I thought there were no movies worth seeing this summer, along came The Score.  I wasn't sure what the story line was but felt the price of admission would be worth it just to see DeNiro and Brando together again.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was absolutely wonderful.  It is so unusual to see a movie that is not full of ... sex and violence, but just sheer entertainment.  This is it!  The ending left me feeling so good. Very much a surprise ending.  Loved the computer hacker also.  Very entertaining, indeed.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Her song &quot;Video&quot; is so long overdue, I can't even articulate it!  I only hope the young sistahs out there are listening, and I mean really listening to it!  Girl, where have you been!!!  We have needed this song for sooooo long!  The rest of the CD is just as thought provoking.  I love this CD.  It has so many messages of self-affirmation and positivity on it, that is is always a pleasure to listen to.  I first learned about it when a friend called saying &quot;I love you girl!&quot;  At first I thought she was just trippin' but then she told me that she had listened to this CD and was just so full that it almost moved her to tears.  I had to get it then.  And I'm so glad I did. It makes you take stock of friendships, relationships and self-love.  This sistah is BAD!!!  This is a MUST HAVE CD for any collection.
B000002H6C|4.0|AJFA is the third and final chapter of Metallica's great Trilogy. The lyrics revolve around the theme of injustice and its consequences.  The injustices can come from many different sources such as corrupt judges, war, or your own parents.  It is their strongest album intellectually, and one of their weakest albums emotionally.  Out of all three albums, this is the weakest even though it has brilliant material.<br />What makes this album inferior to the other two is that it seemed like Metallica was getting a little tired of the overly technical arrangements.  The enthusiasm just isn't as easily noticed.  While many fans would like to have seen Metallica keep progressing in this direction, the band may have felt it was straying to far from its roots.  I hate saying this but if you had to find a point where Metallica's decline started, it was on this album.  Also, it seems that the person responsible for the bass tracks fell asleep on the job.<br />Yet this is still an awesome album, especially for 1988.  Hetfield's vocals improved steadily.  He no longer screamed constantly like he did on KILL'EM ALL.  Plus Hetfield is also criminally underrated as a lead guitatist.  Just listen to his solos on &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot;.  His acoustic and softer electric playing is incredible as well.  Hammett's lead playing displayed the correct proportion of speed, innovation, unpreditability, and most importantly feeling.  Ulrich, whose drumming is more about aggression than technique, was the right drummer for the job.  But sadly I really can't say anything about Newsted since you can't hear him anywhere on this album.  Who knows, one day in the near future they may rerelease this album with a bass track.  That version might actually be better than MASTER OF PUPPETS.<br />Overall rating: 4.75 stars.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|Disney has restored this all-time classic to its original brilliance. The universal themes of love, family, friendship and good vs. evil make this educational and enjoyable. Yes, there are some quite scary scenes and evil is shown for what it is. However, just as in most fairy tales, good triumphs over evil in the end.<br /><br />The story is told by Jiminy Cricket and the start of the movie is peaceful. He arrives at Geppetto's home where there are music boxes, toys, amazing clocks and a puppet who is just \\"all strings and joints.\\" Geppetto is just painting on the finishing touches before he heads off to bed. The \\"cutest\\" black and white cat named Figaro adds warmth and amusement to the story. The sassy fish Cleo is a visual delight.<br /><br />As the woodcarver drifts off to sleep, he says: \\"Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?\\" He then sends Figaro to open the window and sees a wishing star. He makes a wish and while he sleeps, the Blue Fairy brings the Marionette Pinocchio to life. He then must learn to have a conscience, so it is decided that Jiminy Cricket will be his guide so he will know what is good and what is evil.<br /><br />Pinocchio begins his journey to become a \\"real boy,\\" but first he has to learn to be brave, loyal and honest. He is kidnapped after he joins a traveling show so he can become a famous actor, but escapes with the help of the Blue Fairy. She is the most beautiful animated fairy I have ever seen. Pinocchio then must learn to survive on his own. He takes a trip to Pleasure Island. This is a place where children go and they are allowed to play and never work, but the sinister truth is that they are all changed into donkeys and end up being shipped off to the salt mines. While he seems to keep making the wrong choices, once he realizes he will be turned into a donkey (his ears and tail already have grown), he goes back home. (Not unlike the prodigal son in a way, yet he is so young.)<br /><br />When he arrives home, he finds cobwebs and the house has been empty for some time. A note arrives that tells him where he can find his father, so he jumps into the ocean to find Monstro the whale, where his father, Geppetto is trapped. Once under the sea, things get a bit scary and the whale is quite evil, not unlike other creatures from the sea in Disney's movies. Will he find his father? I won't give the ending away.<br /><br />This is about the magical power of believing in your dreams and also will teach children to be moral and choose the good in life. I have to wonder if some politicians forgot to watch this movie as children. It teaches that lying is wrong and that a lie keeps growing and growing once it is told.<br /><br />There are messages that reading is good and education is something you should strive for. The illiterate Red Fox is hilarious as he tries to read the ABC book upside down! The fox tries to tell Pinocchio that education is not good for him. I also noticed that because Pinocchio could not read (because he didn't go to school!), he could not read the note about his father and therefore, Jiminy Cricket had to read it for him. See a similar scene in \\"Mulan\\" where the lucky cricket in that movie types out the letter like a typewritter, which is also a beautifully animated movie with snow scenes similar to the wave scenes in this classic. I could see many details in this animation which have carried over into other movies.<br /><br />There are many messages for adults in this movie....I doubt children will pick up on (Note the song that talks about \\"There are no strings on me!.\\" This seems to be talking about our responsibility to others.)<br /><br />As an adult, you will find them amusing and thought provoking. I had to laugh when I heard the Cricket say: \\"What does an actor want with a conscience anyway.\\" That hit the mark! I would like to see more actors develop a conscience.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes by Jiminy Cricket is: \\"A cricket can't be too careful you know.\\" It islaugh out loud funny when he says it.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is hilarious, the middle is a big adventure and the ending is a wonderful surprise for children. There are a few politically incorrect items, but they are almost tongue-in-cheek and you have to think about when this movie was made!<br /><br />If you have ever wished upon a star, or a falling star, this is for you! I agree, this is a masterpiece of animation....unlike anything you will find today. It is so detailed and moves at a pace where it is comfortable to watch. This is a thoughtful movie, unlike some of the more fast paced extravaganzas you see today.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewmovie is hilarious, the middle is a big adventure and the ending is a wonderful surprise for children.

B000001FTD|5.0|Most speed metal fans were initiated by way of either Metallica or Megadeth.  Anthrax was my introduction.  Albums like this speak to the fifteen year-old in us that gets tired of turning on the radio and hearing only prefabricated crap. 13 years after first hearing this album, and owning it both as cassette and CD, I'm proud to say I still enjoy it.<br />What isn't to like about it?  Out of The Big Four ( Anthrax, Magadeth, Metallica, and Slayer), Anthrax possibly had the best singer.  Joey Belladonna, silly hairdo and all, had a tremendous voice.  The guitar team of Scott Ian and Dan Spitz was bulletproof.  Spitz was possibly the most underrated lead guitarist in all of heavy metal.  He sounded like nobody else.  Ian deserves a place in the pantheon of great rhythm guitarists. The uncle-nephew rhythm section of Charlie Benante and Frank Bello is unforgettable.  Benante had to have been hiding two or three extra arms somewhere.  And last but not least, Bello played without a pick like all real bassists.  Plus he played FAST.<br />And finally, Anthrax showed the greatest imagination and diversity with their lyrics on this album.  &quot;I Am the Law&quot; is about Judge Dredd.  &quot;Among the Living&quot; and &quot;A Skeleton in the Closet&quot; are based on Stephen King's work.  &quot;N.F.L.&quot; is about a fallen comedian, either Lenny Bruce or John Belushi I think.  The arms race, particularly under Reagan, was attacked in &quot;One World&quot;.  And who can forget the anti-racism classic &quot;Indians&quot;?  The lyrics were written by juveniles on ATL.  Smart juveniles.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This show is funny,hilarious,compelling,interesting,extraordinary,sad,pensive,impressive,wistful&amp; one of THE BEST shows on television.  Don't miss one second of it!
B000009QO6|4.0|Being an avid Misfits listener, I had never listened to Samhain or Danzig until a few years ago when I discovered this album.  After hearing the songs on here I must say that this is great metal with a bluesy groove, or like a nasty dirty Black Sabbath.  I can see why he's called the Evil Elvis, this is a must buy.
0060392886|3.0|I think the information contained in this book is all great - except that the chapters &amp; timelines seem jumbled and hard to keep track of.
B00002E285|5.0|I have listened to The Wall's sound track many, many times while I've been working on the computer and wondered what the full film would be like. I came to Amazon looking first off for the sound track on CD so I could hear all the track but found the DVD was actually less. I live in the UK so having it mailed here would take time and cost more, in total the film was a bit over ... I think. I was worried I wouldn't like it and I'd be wasting my money. It arrived 6 !days! before it was meant to, to my suprise. Initially I couldn't get it working because I was using a player on my computer that didn't support the US region on the disc. I watched the film the morning I got it in bed and thought it was one of the best I've seen, my number one film being Blade Runner. It is FAR from being a normal film, it follows no real obvious plot apart from how Pink is driven mad. I had no problems with the music sound levels at all. My only complaint is that it's not long enough, even though it's about as long as a normal film. The film is not really about Fashism or the Nazi's. You will need to be able to think to understand some of the points in it which are not made bluntly like in other movies. Pink is driven mad as he remembers how he's been treated and what people do to each other over time and what happens to people who try to care. The Wall is the wall he builds against people remembering all these things until he eventually turns into the steriotypical Nazi who doesn't care anymore. This film made me think quite hard and it's well worth spending your money on. It is not a happy film at all, it's not meant to be. It's full of weird bits of animations which really do look like they've just come direct from someone's imagination. I suppose it's a bit more like a musical than a film as there are very few parts of it which are not backed by music. The CD has interviews with Roger Waters and the rest of the people who produced the film as well as video clips of the promotional video and things. It's good to see a film of this quality coming from the UK as I've become very used to every film coming from the US. Move back up the page and click buy.
B000053VAF|4.0|Kevin Smith has a wonderful and twisted brain. He uses his amazing ability to turn things on their head making you think about them as view them from the skewed angle. Dogma pushes the buttons of organized religion while giving the agnostics something to contemplate. This is a trip worth repeating.
B00000DR5W|5.0|I'm a music lover , of all sorts of music , and this is one of the best albums i've ever heard. I bought when I was in high-school at a swiss boarding house , and soon ALL of my roomates bought themselves a copy...why : cuase &quot;all colors&quot; bleed into one on this album , it has everything !
B00003CWMI|4.0|Bicentennial Man runs 2 hours and 12 minutes long. And your eyes may feel tired after watching this very long film. How would your eyes feel if 48 more minutes were added. In fact, since Robin Williams started in What Dreams May Come, he has some pretty long films that include Patch Adams, Jakob The Liar and this one. And it is out runing the film I have metion before this one. In fact after this one, Robin Williams seemed to have taken a year off. And now here has another one called A.I which he has a short part.<br />As the movie opens a man named Richard Martin (Sam Neill) has bought his family a robot and names it Andrew (Robin Williams) after his daughter named Adamda askes &quot;What's an Andrew?&quot; His other daughter named Grace (Lindze Letherman). They are both children as the movie opens. Andrew calls them Little Miss, Miss, and Ricard &quot;Sir&quot;. And his wife (Wendy Crewson) &quot;Ma'am. Little Miss as a girl is played Hallie Kate Eisenberg who grows up to be played Embeth Davidtz.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|When I heard that Akira was coming out on DVD I jumped for joy! I've watched my VHS tape of Akira so many times it's no good anymore. Now to hear that it's coming out on DVD AND remastered is too good to be true. In my opinion, no anime has come close to matching the brilliance of this movie. I would even say this movie tops anything out of Hollywood. It is just amazing. I'll be first in line to buy this DVD on the 24th.
B000002LND|5.0|This cd contains many of her hits plus two new tracks but be warned, the songs are redone.  I liked the original version of \\"Like a Prayer\\" better however I liked the new version of \\"Express Yourself\\" better.  I wish that \\"True Blue\\", \\"Dress You Up&quot;, &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot;, \\"Oh Father\\" and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; were included.  This is a great cd for someone who is just getting into Madonna because it includes almost all of her hits prior to 1990.  For the Madonna fan, the cd is good because it contains almost all her singles but because it contains different versions of the songs, you might end up purchasing the original albums to get the original versions of the songs.  But overall, it's a very good buy.
6300214753|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my favorite movies. The \\"one liners\\" are classic and unforgetable. I was upset that there was never a SOUNDTRACK put together. So I bought the DVD and searched high and low for the original music and put a CD together. It has all of the music and about 20 classic soundbites. All in all it has thirty tracks, sounds great and is always a hit when I put in my car CD player... .
B0000026WD|5.0|I bought this cd in 91 because we did \\"Heal the World\\" for my 5th grade graduation and I'm in college now and I still listen to this cd occasionally.  The lyrics aren't that well-written but it's pop music (if an album uses \\"baby\\" a lot, you can be pretty sure it's pop) at it's finest.  Not counting \\"heal the world,&quot; \\"keep the faith\\" and &quot;gone too soon&quot;, and \\"will you be there?\\" all the tracks are very danceable. How many popular cds promote helping others, (heal the world) and racial equality (Black or White)?  My favorite songs on the cd are \\"Remember the Time\\" and \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" but this album has all good tracks.
0792839730|5.0|In complete disagreement with Mr. Maltin,<br />I remember the days when you could catch a &quot;good&quot; war movie on TV when it rained on Sunday afternoon.  Whether it was, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, or &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, or countless others, it was great!  Those days are long gone now.  To me, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; brings back some of those great memories.  This movie is simply a well acted and historically accurate depiction of the Aliies' Operation Market Garden campaign during WWII.  It forgoes the realism of blood and gore shown in &quot;modern&quot; WWII's &quot;Private Ryan&quot; or &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot;, and gets into the operational efforts of war.  The planning, the miscues, the massive loss and embarrassment behind losing a battle.   This movie is not about the harsh realism of war and death, as it is about true conflict in the face of a combined effort of nations, backed  by good acting and respect for the effort of the Allies.  We know what went on over there and I've heard countless stories from Grandfathers, Uncles, and the like.  The movie does not point fingers and make either side look better than the other.  It just shows the outright stupidity of war.  It helps us understand the overconfidence involved and what happens when something that is &quot;a guaranteed success&quot; or &quot;the word of Monty is a sure win&quot; fails.  In the opening scene, the head-strong Britsh General speaks with his staff of three Allied Generals concerning the &quot;great plan&quot; conjured up by General Montgomery. The obvious shock, disbelief and lack of confidence in their faces about this massive operation forshadows the events that lie ahead.  <br />Packed with a plethora of big names, &quot;ABTF&quot; gives you these great scenes...<br />Elliot Gould's run at the Son Bridge.   Anthony Hopkins and the first meeting with the Germans at Arnhem. Sean Connery's life threatening return to HQ. Robert Redford's Hail Mary river crossing under fire. Gene Hackman and the Poles' airborne jump under fire. James Cann's pistol request to save his Lieutentant. Michael Caine's armor battles with the Germans along the road.<br />There are countless and I means countless others.  If you are anything of a true war movie fan, then this title deservers a place in your library!  You won't be disappointed.<br />Technically, the movie was very well remastered in letterbox format.  Visually it is both clear and crisp while the audio remains at theater level quality.  The letterbox format does great justice to the scenes as there is a lot of action happening in the background.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Man, this is incredible. I only hear two songs of them (Tomorrow comes today and Clint Eastwood, because their videoclip) and inmediatly I bought the CD and it's more than I was expecting of it. The Cd has excelents songs including a spanish and a japanese. Their music is very difficult to explain. It's a mix of hip hop, balad, jazz, and a lot of rock. It's somethig that you have to hear with your own ears. Trust me you won't be defraud of it. This CD I have to bought [online] because in my country they are not very popular but you can meet with people that like their music and also bought the cd like me
0688170528|5.0|I thought that this book was absolutely breathtaking. I couldn't put it down, it just drew me into the story. The love between the two main characters just seemed perfect and fairy-tale like until you get further into the book. It was such a good book. I highly recommend it.
B00005LB9O|5.0|All of Travis' albums have been instantly likeable.  Each song touches your heart, and you never get tired of hearing them.  With The Invisible Band, Travis stick to what they do best, using simple folk-rock music to express singer Fran Healy's beautiful lyrics.  I think Travis love music, and you can hear it in every note they play.  They are doing something musically that is quite different from what is popular in America today.  They actually have something positive to say, and they don't have to use good looks or violent stunts to get noticed.  <br />If you love music and miss the wonderful alternative music of the 1990s, buy this album along with The Man Who and Good Feeling.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  And, if you ever get the chance to see them live, GO!!  They are an incredible live band.
B00005ATQ9|2.0|Ever so often one discovers a movie that, although not well known, has a credible pedigree and an enthusiastic fan base. Barry Lyndon is not one of those movies. And, unlike many of these hidden treasures that I have found throughout the years, BL was the diamond in the rough that I had hoped (and so many had said it was).<br />It is a VERY pretty movie. The sets, costumes, scenery, music, and horses are all breathtaking; if gazing at beautiful but inanimate objects is your idea of a good film, this is your Citizen Kane. I applaud the rigorous use of only period music and costumes for an authentic look, but superficial beauty cannot carry a film alone. The music, though, can stand by itself, and is more worth the price than the movie itself is. Revel in it...<br />I am sure that Kubrick was very aware of the awe-inspiring authenticity and prettiness of this picture, and unfortunately, this comes across very strongly. It seems that the idea was something along the lines of &quot;heck, even if the actors can't act, who cares? The audience will just be looking at the scenery anyway.&quot; This leaves the driving force of the film, the actors, as merely icing on a frivolous cake.<br />A good actor can make even the most gratituous role into a stunner; Ryan O'Neal is not that kind of actor. When in the role of Redmond Barry, a cad and social climber, O'Neal is asked to be devious, calculating, and grief-stricken - all the audience sees is a face devoid of emotion. A vacant stare does not a thespian make. I feel that Kubrick cast O'Neal to attract viewers with his star power, much like Jean Jaques Annaud did with Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet. It is a pity that such a great director failed to elict a competitive performance out of his star.<br />The rest of the cast aquits themselves very nicely, though, with the exception of the man who plays Barry's step-son, who overacts most egregiously. <br />The script. Ah, the fans and the critics are already queueing up, readyto give their opinions. Is it a deep psychological rendering of society and it's follies, or is it a tedious too-literal adaptation of a classic novel? I think it is a mish-mash of both, with the master of psychological movies fighting the bonds that come with adapting someone else's thoughts. My only large complaint is with the epilogue. The message of the movie itself seemed to be that one will get one's just desserts, but the epilogue's message is that it does not matter what one does in life, for all will be equal after death. These two ideas seem to conflict strongly - heightening my feeling that two minds were in opposition here - Thackeray and Kubrick.<br />The editing also leaves something to be desired. Yes, as was already stated, the views are pretty, but many of the scenes could have been drastically cut without damaging the movie or the aesthetic pleasure of viewing it. See especially the card game at the beginning, and the endless shots of Ryan O'Neal looking blankly into space.<br />All in all, this is a gorgeous movie with some very rousing battle scenes (albeit bloodless), but not much in the way of acting, drama, or substance.
0790738074|5.0|I hate musicals. If a movie doesn't have anything to do with explosions, hi-jackings, car chases, guys fighting, extortion, nazis, armageddon, aliens, sports, then it is, IMHO, worthless. But there are a handful of exceptions. The Music Man is one of them. Who doesn't like GREASE, or WEST SIDE STORY? Like these other ROMEO &amp; JULIET knock-offs, The Music Man captures the most ubiquitous theme the filmworld has to offer, and does so with a passion rarely realized. Think of Harold Hill as Romeo, and Marian as Juliet. The thought of them co-mingling disgusts everyone from the mayor, to the anvil salesman. That is, ALMOST everyone. A few River City denizens root for the union. Even encouraging it in their own subtle ways. In this great telling, they don't even die!There is so much to say. The dance routine in the library is stunning. People jumping over tables, twisting and turning in staggering unison. Even a line dance! Infact, nearly every scene is dance. These gifted players can't walk down a dirt street without dancing. Even when their not dancing, their dancing! So, chalk one up for the choreographers as well as the players.Meredith Wilson's score (he also penned), is as cool today as it must've been in 1960. Top tunes include &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;76 Trombones&quot;, &quot;Madame Librian&quot;, &quot;Gary Indiana&quot;, and &quot;til There Was You&quot;. Another customer commenter brlliantly noted that &quot;til There Was You&quot;, was actually recorded by the Beatles on one of their early albums. How cool is that! The songs and music are simply awesome.Tiled with talented character actors, this fascinating and highly entertaining film is an absolute must see for anyone who loves musicals, and especially for those, like myself, who can barely tolerate them. One of the best of the best.But back to Romeo and Juliet. Shirley Jones, as Juliet, seems to approach her role as a seasoned pro giving it her usual all. Robert Preston, as Romeo, seems to realize this is the role of alifetime. He'd won a Tony for his stage rendition of Professor Harold Hill, and sinks his teeth into the film adaptation with a superb alacrity. It is often said he became hopelessly typecast because of his sunny performance, but after looking him up in film books, that appears to be part of the MUSIC MAN mythology. He was never without work. Hermione Gingold appears as the Mayor's wife and is best remembered for her portrayal as a wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz. Paul Ford is at his bumblng best as the tongue-tied mayor. A young Ronnie Howard displays his gifts as the kid who wants to believe in Hill, but can't decide if he should. Many others round out the powerhouse cast, and all contribute to this triumphant tale of the turn of the century heartland. &quot;Just think....&quot;.
B00000AFHM|5.0|After only hearing B&S's newest CD, Fold Your Hands, Child... I was a bit surprised at the differences between these two albums. Where Fold Your Hands is spare, The Boy is lush.  Think of Boy as a meadow in summer, while Fold is its fall reincarnation...  Still the same beautiful place, just with different trappings.  As B&S got more mature, their sound also seems to have abandoned much of the experimentation that defines their earlier work.  <br />Arab Strap is definitely the stronger, using deep melodies and interesting istruments (bagpipes, bells, accordians, recorders?) to bring a shimmer to the songs.  My only complaint at all with the instrumentation is that it sometimes sounds overproduced, like they were trying too hard for the lush effect.  Once you are inside the music, though, this gripe is soon forgotten.<br />The lyrics, as well, are astonishingly original and fresh... even the old favorites, love and loss, take on their own distinctive forms.  I applaud to no end a band who doesn't feel that it is imperative to appeal to all the fans all the time (see Backstreet Boys and other popsters).  On many of the songs, one feels that the singer is singing only for himself or that the lyrics contain in-jokes, aimed at only a few.  This personal feel gives a depth to the music because it brings the songs down to your heart level, rather than to mass culture's pocketbook.  Yeah, I know, the band probably is in it only for the money of saps like me, but I can feel a heart beating under the music that I can't feel in most, if not all, commercial pop.  ....<br />One of the reasons that I continue to keep B&S playing in my stereo is that there are always new things to hear, and to interpret.  Whether you listen to the base line, the back-up instruments, or to the words, there is always something new.<br />Finally, almost every review of Arab Strap includes a message against \\"A Space Boy's Dream\\" - not deserved, I say.  Yes, its techno sound doesn't go with the rest ofthe album's modern folk tone, but it is an interesting and listenable track.  Its spoken word story is probably the most personal on the whole track - this was not designed for mass consumption or radioplay.  Plus, the speaker's voice is very cute, enhancing the pleasure of this original track (see \\"A Century of Elvis\\" on Lazy Line Painter Jane for more of the same type of song).<br />Enjoy this CD... you will not be disappointed.<br />....
0780626966|5.0|&quot;The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection&quot;<br />This is perhaps as good as DVD collections get. The box set is very nicely packaged, with all seven films from the series presented in their original aspect ratios with clean, crisp transfers on each. While most of the sequels lack any special features, the first film has been given better attention. One minor quibble is that the commentary included is simply the one recorded for the 1995 Laserdisc version, although given that this was just post-New Nightmare, it is current enough.<br />One major plus in this collection is the bonus disc, the Nightmare Encyclopedia. Packed with interview segments with all six directors (Craven directed two) and a few other industry figures (including Clive Barker), the bonus material is offered either by a film-by-film index or as part of an interesting labyrinth puzzle game. You must explore the maze, picking up certain objects while avoiding Freddy, and occasionally unlock extra bonus material you can't find any other way (the first time I did this I found the Dokken music video from Nightmare 3 which was cool).<br />Also included for the completists are two pairs of 3D glasses for viewing the 3D sequence at the end of Freddy's Dead. But don't worry if the glasses don't seem to work for the whole sequence because it never worked to begin with. Some of it is great - mostly the stuff shot the old-fashioned way with a two camera set-up - while a lot of it will give you a headache - most of this was simulated 3D done in the computer and it doesn't work. Never mind, it's still a fun addition to an otherwise great box set.<br />Of the seven films, most fans tend to agree that the 1st, 3rd and 7th films are the strongest - incidentally the ones written and/or directed by Craven and starring Heather Langenkamp as Nancy - but it's still nice to have the whole series here together.
B00005BJPO|4.0|This is a great movie. Definitely revolutionary for itz time. Those who compare it to anime of today may see it as &quot;just average&quot;, but it is by far the greatest breakthrough in anime. While the manga is so much better, this movie does an above average job of converting manga to animation. To those who rate this movie low because of the bad dubbing I say,&quot;Why would you watch the dubbed version when you have the original japanese track?&quot; Anyone who knows anything about anime knows that if you have the option to watch the subbed version you must. I own a very extensive DVD anime collection and I have never watched one movie, OVA, or series in the english version. If you are unable to read I would recommend dubs, but obviously you can if you are reading this right now. Oh well, Akira is great.Why?<br />Great Animation, Converted Well, Revolutionary, Human Characters(character that have flaws), Psychic Powers(always a great feature), Nice mixture of drama and action.
B00002NDB1|5.0|Metal Fans, this album is an absolute recommendation! In this album we see Maiden is their most mature form! This album has it all: Melodies, Riffs, Great Vocal Lines, Synthesisers, Great Distortion. To me this could possibly be one of the greatest metal albums of all time!<br />Dont have this album?? I suggest you go buy it right now!
B00003CXSM|5.0|As a guy I usually don't like romantic comedies.  They're either too sappy or not  really funny or just to predictable. But damn, if this movie didn't blow me away.  It's funny, it's fun (to steal from Billy Crystal) it holds your attention and it keeps you guessing as to what's going to happen until the very end!!! Jennifer and Matthew have awesome chemistry together and you really root for them to get together. On the other hand, all the supporting players are really well written and funny.  The top of my list is the guy who played Massimo. That character was totally funny (I wouldn't mind seeing a movie about that guy) and by the end you kind of really care about him.  And the fourth part of the puzzle is Pete Sampras's wife, Bridgette Wilson, who's not only a hottie from Billy Madison (she was the teacher) but she's really funny too. To be honest, I had no idea this movie was going to be so good. So for all you guys out there --- take a chance, you'll be totally surprised.<br />Also, the DVD has got some great extras.  The commentary by the Director and the writers is really funny.  The writers used to be a couple and that adds a new layer to watching the film.  And if you keep listening, you'll hear how all three of them sort of get on each other's nerves.  Also, the deleted scenes are all really interesting and help give the film a little more weight, you kind of wish they would have left all the scenes in. But that's what a great DVD does, makes you want more.  TWO THUMBS UP!!!  WAY UPPPPP!!!!
B0000009TT|5.0|there is much to say. sgt. pepper, electric ladyland, the wall, and lather. zappa being not as commercial could never be in the same category but the genius is not only comparible but surpassing in this and most other albums. in otherwords this in my opinion is the greatest album ever released. ever!
0064407667|4.0|this book was relly well writen and soo funny, although when you think about it you shouldent be laughing. i recommend theas books for children and adults alike!!!!! The only reason I gave the book 4 *stars was becaus I've read the whole series so far and after a while the storie is a little predictibul.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Man, I didn't realize pop music has gotten this bad.  This is the worse drivel I've heard in a long time - tacky lyrics and poor singing by Spears mars this release.  The production sounds like it was artificially produced.  Not recommended.
B00003CX5P|4.0|hopefully most movies including this one will have DTS edition. It will be a shame if they didn't. DTS sounds better than regular dolby digital and the experts will agree with me. Regular dolby digital does not take full advantage of a 5.1 speaker set up as much as a DTS processor can. Try it!!! you will see the difference. Another thing, most receivers are equipped with DTS encoding and rarely THX. So if you have a regular receiver with no THX processor, You cannot take advantage of the audio from a THX DVD.
B000001FKY|5.0|Simply put, the best album of the 80's.  Over 10 million copies sold and 7 hit singles.  If you like power pop metal, then this is a must have in any one's collection.  The song-writing strength of the group is at it's peak with all songs wrote by Clark/Collen/Elliott/Lange/Savage.  Mutt Lange is one of the greatest producers of all time and this is simply a masterpiece.  Most of the singles today are regulars on any classic rock radio station.  There is no weak song or filler on the album.
B00000J6AG|1.0|So I finally downloaded this entire album because of all I heard about it.  Yet another shining example of why I should never trust mass opinion when it comes to music.  Firstly, this is not techno.  If you want techno, go listen to Underworld or Juno Reactor.  This is ambient / electronic with soul / R&amp;B samples.  A rather intresting idea, but it comes off as remarkably cheesy and not very catchy either.<br />If self-help books came with musical accompinaments, this is what they would sound like.  Nice non-thought provoking, non-challenging background music for the masses to lap up.  Yum!
0920236251|5.0|My girls love this book. I like it because of the strong female character. They like the princess because she is crative and smart. They both like the size of the book (2 inches square) although my older daughter age seven thought the book should be really big lke the princess's heart. They like the moral also they know they need to not judge a person by the way they look and this really reinforces that standard.
B00004U8P3|4.0|When young Steven Spielberg was first offered the screenplay for \\"Jaws,\\" he said he would direct the movie on one condition: That he didn't have to show the shark for the first hour. By slowly building the audience's apprehension, he felt, the shark would be much more impressive when it finally arrived. He was right. I wish he had remembered that lesson when he was preparing \\"Jurassic Park,\\" his new thriller set in a remote island theme park where real dinosaurs have been grown from long-dormant DNA molecules. The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values. It's clear, seeing this long-awaited project, that Spielberg devoted most of his effort to creating the dinosaurs. The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters. Richard Attenborough, as the millionaire who builds the park, is given a few small dimensions - he loves his grandchildren, he's basically a good soul, he realizes the error of tampering with nature. But there was an opportunity here to make his character grand and original, colorful and oversize, and instead he comes across as unfocused and benign. As the film opens, two dinosaur experts (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) arrive at the park, along with a mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum whose function in the story is to lounge about uttering vague philosophical imprecations. Also along are Attenborough's grandchildren, and a lawyer, who is the first to be eaten by a dinosaur.  Attenborough wants the visitors to have a preview of his new park, where actual living prehistoric animals live in enclosures behind tall steel fences, helpfully labeled \\"10,000 volts.\\" The visitors set off on a tour in remote-controlled utility vehicles, which stall when an unscrupulous employee (Wayne Knight) shuts down the park's computer program so he can smuggle out some dinosaur embryos. Meanwhile, a tropical storm hits the island, the beasts knock over the fences, and Neill is left to shepherd the kids back to safety while they're hunted by towering meat-eaters. The plot to steal the embryos is handled on the level of a TV sitcom. The Knight character, an overwritten and overplayed blubbering fool, drives his Jeep madly through the storm and thrashes about in the forest. If this subplot had been handled cleverly - with skill and subtlety, as in a caper movie - it might have added to the film's effect. Instead, it's as if one of the Three Stooges wandered into the story.  The subsequent events - after the creatures get loose - follow an absolutely standard outline, similar in bits and pieces to all the earlier films in this genre, from \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"King Kong\\" right up to the upcoming \\"Carnosaur.\\" True, because the director is Spielberg, there is a high technical level to the execution of the cliches. Two set-pieces are especially effective: A scene where a beast mauls a car with screaming kids inside, and another where the kids play hide and seek with two creatures in the park's kitchen.    But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs. Think back to another ambitious special effects picture from Spielberg, \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" (1977). That was a movie about the \\"idea\\" of visitors from outer space. It inspired us to think what an awesome thing it would be, if earth were visited by living alien beings. You left that movie shaken and a little transformed. It was a movie that had faith in the intelligence and curiosity of its audience. In the 16 years since it was made, however, big-budget Hollywood seems to have lost its confidence that audiences can share big dreams. \\"Jurassic Park\\" throws a lot of dinosaurs at us, and because they look terrific (and indeed they do), we're supposed to be grateful. I have the uneasy feeling that if Spielberg had made \\"Close Encounters\\" today, we would have seen the aliens in the first 10 minutes, and by the halfway mark they'd be attacking Manhattan with death rays. Because the movie delivers on the bottom line, I'm giving it four stars. You want great dinosaurs, you got great dinosaurs. Spielberg enlivens the action with lots of nice little touches; I especially liked a sequence where a smaller creature leaps suicidally on a larger one, and they battle to the death. On the monster movie level, the movie works and is entertaining. But with its profligate resources, it could have been so much more.
B000002699|5.0|The most beautiful music you'll ever hear.  'Nuff said.  This is one of those albums you want to put the headphones on, close your eyes and listen intently to the stunning texture and movement in this amazing music.  I could go on and on, but I don't want to waste your time when you could be spending it listening to this! :)
B00004T1C8|3.0|My son got this a year ago for his 2nd birthday.  At first he loved the noises it made when the trains went through the tunnel.  After the novelty wore off, he told us HE thought it was too loud(IT IS), so we took the batteries out of it.  He enjoys playing with it, but it is tricky to incorporate into the track design because it is pretty wide (actual track is several inches from edge of table).  For the money, I would purchase something that is more versatile.  We do love our BRIO, though!
B00000ILE7|3.0|alien 3 is alright and a good sequel.but i still think it all ends at ALIENS.since there are no more facehuggers!!!!
B000056V73|5.0|This movie has it all: Ups, Downs, heart, &amp; humor. Cameron Crowe does a phenomenal job at capturing an era when sex, drugs, and rock n' roll had an element of purity to it. It brings the very concept of &quot;rock star&quot; down to earth allowing the viewer to experience the ever lusted journey to stardom with the humorously cliche though anything but dull band: Still Water. Crowe tells the story with such fluidity and precision that it almost seems like a documentary. Quite frankly, this movie is one that you simply can't afford not to own, let alone miss out on. It's a masterpiece.
6300214435|5.0|THIS HAS TO BE INDY'S BEST MOVIE.ITS LOADED WITH NON-STOP ACTION.RAIDERS AND CRUSADE WERE GREAT BUT BOTH LACKS OF ACTION.THIS IS INDY'S TOUGHEST ADVENTURE EVER!!!VERY RECOMMENDED..... A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!
0553212737|4.0|I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth continues to amaze me, I was not expecting much with this release, but boy was I wrong! It is impossible to top Orchid IMO, so this comes in a close 2nd. As one reviewer said, this album has a 'sleepy' feel to it, and that is a perfect description. Somber, depressing atmospheres, yet technically brilliant.<br />The standout track for me is 'The Drapery Falls' - I just love that song, and what a great song title. One of the best albums I have heard in a long time.<br />PS also checkout Spiral Architect and Pain of Salvation.
B00000IIXH|5.0|18 Tracks is an excellent compilation of songs the Boss recorded primarily during his golden era between 1973-83, with a couple songs from the 90's thrown in. Some of the tunes such as HEARTS OF STONE, THE FEVER, and RENDEZVOUS were familiar to me because of being covered first by other artists such as Southside Johnny and Gary U.S. Bonds. In the hands of the Boss though, these songs sound even better. PINK CADILLAC was a b-side single from his Born in the USA days, which was also covered by Aretha Franklin. The version of BORN IN THE USA he does on here is a cool acoustic version. A refreshing departure from the rocked up album cut. The songs that really made a big impression on me are I WANNA BE WITH YOU, from the Darkness On The Edge Of Town period. I'm surprised this song didn't make it on any vinyl. I think if it had been released during this time it could have been a hit single for him. Same thing goes for JANEY DON'T YOU LOSE HEART, from the Born In The USA period. I'm surprised this song didn't at least make it on the album. Also of note here is the bouncy party tune SEASIDE BAR SONG from 1973 when this was a very hot and hungry band. It's a nice funky song with a neat farfisa organ that drives it along. LION'S DEN is another jumpy Boss tune with a nice heavy swinging toe tappin' horn section. I'm surprised he hasn't released this one somewhere down the road. BROTHERS ON THE BRIDGE and THE PROMISE are a couple later and slower 90's tunes that I feel like are a little out of place on here with his older more energetic material. All in all though, this is a very good consolidation of music off his much more expensive box set &quot;Tracks&quot;. If you like the 70's to early 80's version of the Boss as much as I do, this is a must have album. If your a new fan, this is an excellent album to start out with.
B00004U30D|1.0|What is this crap?  If you're into artsy-fartsy movies you'll like this.  I say, leave symbolism to the symbol-minded!<br />The Oscars are smoking something.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd has a lot of bad reviews, many reviews say that this music is just profanity and hate filled noise. Thats what it is supposed to be. Real music has emotion, you can feel it. Not the cheap so called emotion called love, hate is the strongest feeling, even people that cant feel anything(like me) can feel hate. And not all of the songs are filled with screaming, in my opinion the best songs on the cd are the ones without screaming all the way through, like No Life, Diluted, and Scissors. When I first listened to this cd i didnt really like it, but then I listened to it again and again and it all made sense. The same thing happened to me with Cradle of Filth and Deicide.
0517123207|5.0|Creationists often state categorically that &quot;there are no transitional fossils&quot;. This is simply not true. In fact, ALL fossils are transitional. One of Darwins main points was that evolution is an on-going process.  It may speed up and slow down, but on it goes. This book is a must read.  Even after 120 years it's still selling and still being read.<br />Darwins point in The Origin of Species has been overwhelmingly proven over and over. There are abundant transitional fossils of both the &quot;chain of genera&quot; type and the &quot;species-to-species transition&quot; type. There are documented speciations that cross genus lines and family lines. You cannot simply say that there are no transitional fossils, because there are.   As Gould said (1994): &quot;The supposed lack of intermediary forms in the fossil record remains the fundamental canard of current antievolutionists. Such transitional forms are scarce, to be sure, and for two sets of reasons - geological (the gappiness of the fossil record) and biological (the episodic nature of evolutionary change, including patterns of punctuated equilibrium and transition within small populations of limited geological extenet). But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical geneology.&quot; <br />Darwin has been vindicated by the remarkable temporal pattern of fossil morphology, with &quot;an obvious tendency for successively higher and more recent fossil assemblages to resemble modern floras and faunas ever more closely&quot; (Gingerich, 1985) and with animal groups appearing in a certain unmistakable order. For example, primitive fish appear first, amphibians later, then reptiles, then primitive mammals, then (for example) legged whales, then legless whales. This temporal- morphological correlation is very striking, and appears to point overwhelmingly toward an origin ofall vertebrates from a common ancestor. Creationist can say whatever they want to and practice all the deceit they want, but the clear evidence in the geological record is not in dispute by any one except fundamentalists.<br />Numerous &quot;chains of genera&quot; that appear to link early, primitive genera with much more recent, radically different genera (e.g. reptile- mammal transition, hyenids, horses, elephants), and through which major morphological changes can be traced. Even for the spottiest gaps, there are a few isolated intermediates that show how two apparently very different groups could, in fact, be related to each other (ex. Archeopteryx, linking reptiles to birds). <br />Many known species-to-species transitions (primarily known for the relatively recent Cenozoic mammals), often crossing genus lines and occasionally family lines, and often resulting in substantial adaptive changes. <br />Even the gaps are easy to explain, since for stratigraphic reasons alone there must always be gaps. In fact, no current evolutionary model predicts or requires a complete fossil record, and no one expects that the fossil record will ever be even close to complete. As a rule of thumb, however, creationists think the gaps show fundamental biological discontinuities, while anyne who has studied the evidence knows they are the inevitable result of chance fossilizations, chance discoveries, and immigration events. <br />Darwins revolution will continue, even if there are a few setbacks, because the evidence is real and overwhelming.
B000001F9E|5.0|Uno de mis discos preferidos de todos los tiempos. Una auténtica obra maestra del rock. Si no conoces a Thin Lizzy, este álbum te enamorará, y si los conoces pues poco puedo decirte. Rock setentero del mejor, riff impresionantes, imaginativos solos de guitarra doblados, grandes melodías, mejores armonías, con un líder carismático y unos músicos cojonudos. Una auténtica JOYA del rock contemporáneo. Mi preferida es &quot;Cowboy song&quot;, pero vaya que el álbum entero no tiene desperdicio. <br />Para mi, junto Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, etc.. Thin Lizzy es de las mejores bandas de la historia. Cuando uno descubre a Thin Lizzy no puede dejar de sentir un cariño especial hacia este grupo olvídado por la mayoría de la gente (y en España ni te cuento, pero casi mejor así).<br />Esto es música y no lo que hacen los payasos de los dj´s de hoy en dia.
0767824571|5.0|The grand opus of Monty Python, a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world. Rather than a series of individual spoofs, this movie is a long spoof based on Arthurian legend; specifically, the legend of the Holy Grail. Somehow, these six guys not only produced a low-budget movie, but cast themselves in multiple (many multiple) roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result!<br />Rather than a real story, this is a series of vignettes concerning the long-suffering King Arthur and his loyal knights of the Round Table (&quot;We eat ham and jam and Spam-a-lot!&quot;) Among them are:<br />*The encounter with the Communist peasants in their autonamous collective (&quot;HELP! HELP! I'M BEING REPRESSED!&quot;)<br />*The Tale of Sir Robin, the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield.<br />*The king's encounter with the loony black knight, in which a ridiculous series of blood-spurtings will have you guffawing. (&quot;You've got no arms left!&quot; &quot;Yes I have!&quot; &quot;LOOK!&quot; &quot;It's just a flesh wound.&quot;)<br />*Sir Lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle, but is the person sending it what he expects?<br />*The French attack.... verbally. (&quot;Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!&quot;)<br />*Sir Galahad is waylaid in the temptation-laden Castle of the Maidens (interestingly enough, in traditional legends Sir Galahad did go to the Castle of the Maidens, though in very different circumstances *leer*)<br />*The Keepers of the Sacred Word, the Knights Who Say &quot;NI!&quot;<br />*The rabbit of death, Tim the Enchanter, and so much more.<br />The sheer off-the-wallness is what sells this movie, and Monty Python was in rare form. Graham Chapman's primary role is King Arthur, who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy. John Cleese of &quot;Fish&quot; and &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; fame stars as Sir Lancelot/Tim the Wizard/The Rude Frenchman, and is amazing in each role. Eric Idle plays lily-livered Sir Robin/Roger the Shrubber (don't ask)/Brother Maynard. Terry Gilliam is lower-key as Sir Gawain/Patsy; Terry Jones is also pretty low key as Sir Bedivere/Prince Herbert. Michael Palin has a hilarious series of roles including the King os Swamp Castle/Sir Galahad/Leader of the Knights Who Say Ni.<br />Shoring up the cast is Cleese's now-ex-wife Connie Booth as The Witch, John Young as the Historian/Dead Body, Neil Innes as the annoying Minstrel/Page Killed by Rabbit.<br />Perhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations, with the coconut shells and so forth. The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier, such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded. The script is typically hilarious, full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes.<br />Frankly, it's hard to think of Camelot now without rhyming it with &quot;I have to push the PRAM-A-LOT&quot; and the line of tap-dancing knights. This movie is lodged in the American brain, and it ain't budging soon...<br />A small note: You may want to check out the Veggie Tales ep &quot;Josh and the Big Wall,&quot; in which a respectful (yet kooky!) homage is paid to this film!n, and is amazing in each role.

B000001FSR|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's too; but I don't know if it makes sense to compare it to other Tom Waits, or any other album for that matter.  While it -- and Waits -- owes much to many musical genre's, Frank's Wild Years is an original.  Nothing I've ever listened to prepared me for the haunting surrealism, and yet many of the songs are heartbreakingly sentimal.  And no two songs are alike.  I must say that for me it was definitely an acquired taste.  I can appreciate one reviewer's comment &quot;it gave me the willies&quot;.
