B00E1CI2W6|5|This set is great for new parents. You get 4 bottles - two 4 oz bottles and two 9 oz bottles, 2 soothie pacifiers, a bottle brush, and a microwave sterilizer. The bottles are BPA free which is really important. There are two types of nipples which one has a slower flow for your newborn. The bottle brush makes it really quick and easy to clean your bottles and the nipples. The microwave sterilizer is large enough to fit up to 4 bottles at a time and it sterilizes in two minutes. The pacifiers are newborn pacifiers for age 0-3 months and they are made of hospital grade silicon. For the price this is a great set for new parents
B00E3RKC72|4|I received the Bright Start Swing free of charge to review. All opinions are 100% my own.<br /><br />I like that the swing uses batteries but can also be plugged in. Since this swing is large and takes up a significant amount of space it is not likely to be moved very much. It will save money on batteries by being able to plug it in and there is no worry about it not working if the batteries wear out.<br /><br />The swing can rock both back and forth and side to side. This is great because not every baby is soothed by a normal back and forth motion.<br /><br />It was hard to put together as some of the pieces do not easily line up.<br /><br />I am giving this to my friend for her baby who is due in a few months but tried it out on my nephew. He is 20 lbs and the swing says it can hold up to 25 lbs but I would not recommend a baby that large in the swing. We were worried the swing would not hold up to its weight.<br /><br />Overall the swing is decent for the price and if you are looking for a swing to use when your baby is little. The music and toys help to keep the baby occupied and mom's hands free.
B008X6XRH6|5|My daughter loves this thing.  She loves that she can cuddle with it in bed
B0007A2JFC|2|I have looked at all of the factory-made shopping cart seats, and though out of all of them the Buggy Bagg seems the best, I believe that the handsewn Chubby Seats, which have all the features (and then some) of the BB, are much better.  I even requested extras, like additional bungies and an extra pocket (they already come with two), for each seat, plus a free matching pillow for each seat for making a multiple order, and even with all that, AND sending my own fabric, I saved A LOT of money. [...]In fact, if you want to get a couple for gifts as well as one for yourself, or get together with friends/family and make a multiple order, Ange, the lady who sews these wonderful seats herself, will give you a discount.  She has lots of great fabric patterns to choose from, but you also have the option of picking out and sending her your own fabric for the seats to be made from, and she gives a discount for that as well. Buggy Baggs have only a few, not so attractive (IMHO) fabric pattern choices.  As a parent, one should at least consider the Chubby Seat before running out and buying an expensive Buggy Bagg.
B001I463GM|5|I searched extensively to find something big enough for our toddler to sleep in for traveling when he outgrew his pack n play. I wish I had bought this to begin with!! Our kiddo is a typical sized 18 mth old and super active. He loves it and doesnt want to get out! There's tons of room for sleeping - he's a roly poly sleeper and is all over the place.<br />It is a little heavier than a average pack n play but not that much more. Definitely not enough to make me not recommend it to all my friends. Its super sturdy, has a well padded mattress, easy to set up/take down and is plently tall. There's no way our kiddo could flip it over or<br />crawl out.<br />We travel and camp alot and this serves as a great bed away from home - or even a great bed a home too!<br />Don't be gun shy about buying this for a toddler!!!<br />Oh, and ours didn't have any funky smells.
B006ZISW74|5|Beautiful excellent
B00BNQEVXW|5|love this so much better than the medela pump i bought
B00009X3Y7|5|I originally had another carrier when I had my son, I hated it. I was a pain to put on and it gave me a back ache, when I was pregnant with my second child I bought this one and I love it!! I wair it every time that I go grocery shopping and it is wonderful. I can safely take my daughter in and out and carry her around without feeling like I'm going to drop her. Since it adjusts in severel different places I can adjust it correctly and I don't get a back ache. It's a must have for any mother who wants to hold her baby and still be hands free!!
B001CWVYMI|4|We used this on our flight to store our Recaro Performance Booster.  It fit with more than enough room.  It has an already attached rubbery handle that is very sturdy, and also extra strap that you attach on.  The extra strap is complete junk - the fabric was fine, but the plastic attachment piece broke the first leg of the trip it was used as it was being carried, and the seat we were carrying is NOT a heavy seat compared to our Recaro Performance Sport.  I do like that is also has a small zippered pocket on the outside, which is great for putting in a couple extra little items.  We didn't have to pay to check the seat, so we threw in diapers and extra travel wipes in with the seat and into the zipper compartment to save on our carry on's.  By and large, the bag itself is super sturdy and I would say it completely saved our seat - I can't imagine putting that seat under the plane without protection, it would've gotten destroyed between dirt and getting tossed around.  Despite the short comings of the shoulder strap, I'm glad we have it.
B003O95UIQ|5|Great Stroller<br />Great one hand-handling, very light-weight, easy to assemble and disassemble. Love that I can add accessories to modify it to my kids' needs.
B001MTELJY|5|i highly recommend this tub. so soft and makes easy to bath baby by laying their head on edge of the tub and fill the tub with water so babies can enjoy their bath.
B00GS1GXMY|5|Great product for the price compared to those selling for $150. This one was about $40 and felt like best baby related purchase ever made.
B0067MHGOI|2|The colors in the picture above and the color in the actual pictures are not the same. Above it looks like bright greaan and blue, but in real life its nothing like it, just an headsup. On the up side, they are bigger than i thought they would be, and for the price and think its a good product. The colors how ever wont work for me, since i though it was bright.
B0044VUXGW|1|My 3 year old got out of it before I could get back in to the driver's seat....
B004FN0Z2G|5|I like the bright red color for my 3 year old boy, it's also easy to recognize when you go to Theme parks. Stroller is light and easy to open/close
B000096M2Z|4|These dishes work great and are really durable through the dishwasher and long term use. Have noticed that little crumbs from cereal, etc leak out into our bag, which is frustrating. I also would have loved to have been able to pick the colors, but ended up with some girly ones :)
B00GDKEK1Q|5|This is so awesome. I wish they'd had these when my daughter was little, or that I'd known about them when all 3 of our granddaughters were born. They take very little practice, and are so nice. I had bought a different brand, but it wasn't wide enough to do a cradle carry. I'm VERY large (size 30), and this one comes back around to the front to tie. I bought it as a gift for someone, & she LOVES it.
B006PB2CT0|5|I bought these for my twin girls, who are just big enought for these seats. the main reason I chose this one was that it will keep them in a full harness type seat longer (for safety), and they will break down to a booster as my girls grow; Keeping me from having to buy yet another set of car seats later.
B000F78UAU|5|Reading all the reviews I decided to purchase it and looking forward to liking it... It arrived but when we tried to assemble it the handle wouldn't fit it. I was disappointed but amazon graciously processed my return with shipping included and sent a replacement. It worked like a charm ! Very comfortable and I love it.. I would recommend it for the price paid. I still need to see how long it will last though.. It looks very pretty decent to me !
B002WLGV08|5|I got this product after someone I know lost her 6 month old son to SIDS.  I had a 6 month old son at the time.  SIDS is one of my biggest fears.  Before using the Snuza I would wake constantly to make sure he was still breathing.  Whenever he was sick I would stay up all night holding him to make sure he was okay.<br /><br />The Snuza gave me piece of mind and I was finally able to sleep during the night while he was asleep.  I have had a few false alarms and one real scare, where it took me a moment to get him aroused.<br /><br />I found out many months lately that he had sleep apnea and his anroids were blocking 85-90% of his airway.  I am so grateful for the Snuza because I knew if he had stopped breathing the Snuza alarm would go off and alert me.<br /><br />The Snuza is worn somewhat like a 90's pager.  There is a clip that attaches to the diaper.  You then dress your baby like you normally would for bed.  The Snuza detacts the belly moving as the baby inhales and exhales.  If the baby was to stop for whatever reason the alarm will go off alerting you.
B008X732O8|5|Omg!!!  Love it fit perfect in my caboose.
B000056OUX|5|This was exactly what I was looking for.  We live in an apt complex and have a water table out on our patio, my little guy was tossing toys through the railings, this get's the job done.
B00849L3QO|3|This was a great straw until the lid clasp broke off about 6 weeks after I bought it.  At this price, there's no way I can afford to replace it every 6 weeks.
B006OJIK44|5|I think, because I read over and over how bad the instructions are, I was preparing myself for a big headache. I was pleasantly surprised when we were able to install the gate with very little trouble. Our staircase is awkward so we were able to install this gate at an angle that completely blocks off the top of the stairs. My favorite feature is that the gate can open 180 degrees and rest open against the wall when we don't need it closed, so it's not in the way. I am a little nervous that the plastic hardware won't last but we'll see.
B0030XN6PU|3|I ordered this hamper in light natural color because it was so inexpensive. It's going in the bottom of my daughter's closet, so the color is not a huge concern. Overall, it's a basic hamper. For what I paid, it will do. The construction has a lot more plastic to it than I realized. the frame is plastic, the underside of the lid is clear-ish plastic, and the bottom is plastic slats, not closed. If I were putting this somewhere visible, it would be an issue, but for a closet hamper it's fine.     It does seem to hold a lot despite having fairly slim lines, so that's a plus! It easily fit about 1 1/2 loads of child sized-clothing in it when we filled it the first time, which was a pleasant surprise. Upon recieving the box I was a little concerned that it seemed to small but it does accomodate a lot of laundry.     Overall, if you pay what I did then this is a great buy. Don't expect anything fancy-looking but this is a very servicable hamper for what it is.
B00AJSISAC|4|My daughter-in-law thinks the baby looks like a queen in her beautiful pink car seat!  It is very sturdy and has a lot of cushioning. Very happy with it. It was not so easy to install, however.
B000VXAJTI|2|Since our son loves remote controls (anything with lights and buttons), and I want to expose him to different languages, this seemed like a great idea.  In reality--not so much.  First, here's what this toy does.  You can select a language (English, French, or Spanish) using the \\"Hello\\", \\"Bonjour\\" and \\"Hola\\" buttons.  The \\"?\\" key makes several animal noises and the \\"!\\" button makes some cartoonish sound effects.  When you spin the wheel at the bottom you get one of 3 musical nursery rhymes, \\"what a nice day\\" in one of the 3 languages, or the soccer/futbol \\"Goooooaaaaaal\\".  Because of the poor sound quality though, my dislikes far outweigh my likes.  Likes: adjustable volume control, cute noises from the \\"!\\" button, and cute musical clips from the spinning wheel at the bottom. Dislikes: the clarity of the words spoken by the remote is borderline awful - I know my numbers in English/French/Spanish and I had a hard time understanding them - so how is this going to help a small child learn them? There is the same problem with the animal noises from the \\"?\\" button and the sentences spoken when you spin the bottom wheel.  Additional dislikes: the dog sound effect is a mean growl+bark (vs. a happy bark), you can adjust the volume using the up/down key but the default setting is the loudest, and there is no \\"off\\" switch for the sound.  (The Sesame Street remote control stays at the last volume setting and the sound can be turned off so baby can play with the buttons quietly.)  Overall, this is a great toy concept, but poorly executed.  Until they improve the sound quality, it's just another toy that makes annoying noises and lights up when you push the buttons.
B000WG42N8|5|I love the table toppers. I have been using them for 4yrs now. I started using them with my daughter and now I using them with my 1yr old son. I use them every time we go out to eat to prevent them from eating on the dirty tables or highchairs. With the sticky tabs they stay on the table, so your child doesn't just pull it right off. I would recommend these to anyone with young kids.
B000RHJT6M|1|The measurements are inaccurate and it leaks. When you get down to the last bit of medicine it would shoot out and scare our daughter. I eventually gave up and just tossed it in the garbage.
B00EOWLLEY|5|I bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend.  I see her using it all of the time, and it works great for her needs.
B000YDDF6O|5|someone gave this to us as part of a gift package (there were other baby einstein toys in it).  my son absolutely LOVES this toy! if he's ever fussing we just need to press the button and he's instantly mesmerized by the lights. i'm adding it to my \\"must have\\" list that i pass on to new moms :-)
B00BHW7KD0|1|Overpriced and SMALL!! cute but very small was hoping they might have been just a little bit bigger you can fit a couple peices of fruit but thats about it
B002YLMIJE|3|I bought this for my son's room.  At first glance it looks to be a quality product, but after some short use we found that It is easily broken, and is maybe not a good lamp to have in a young boy's room.  We still use the lamp in his room and have since glued the broken pieces back on.
B001JHSTS8|1|Stinks.  Don't stay on. Sent back.
B00IZULWCC|1|I love my Dekor from the first 2 babies so when the 3rd was on her way, we were excited to see the cloth bags as we were switching from disposable to cloth diapers. I found the bag is smaller than the plastic liners. When I use the disposable plastic liner, a two day supply of cloth diapers fit. When using this bag, I get 1.5 days of diapers. Also, when you pull this bag out, the drawstring does not work - it sticks on the waterproof material. Without the ability to close it, the smell is not contained so well.
B00KI02IRA|5|It seemed a bit strange and a bit like a straight jacket at first.... BUT after a few days our daughter LOVES being put into it for nap and sleep times! IT is really a terrific product! I highly recommend it.
B001NAAQQO|5|GREAT FOR HEAVY WETTERS!!! No more leaks!!
B000GK5XY2|4|These mesh feeders are great for a little one learning to eat solids. We put fresh fruit in, as well as beans, and cooked carrots. It would be nice if they came with clips for attaching them to bibs--our son threw them a lot, and once on the ground, they were covered in floor bits, and dog hair. If you plan on using these, put down a tarp/tablecloth and be prepared for a sticky kid. Messiness aside, these are still great for worry-free feeding!
B00PTC4RB2|3|The top of the lid is ripping already...
B00I05855Y|2|I bought these for my twin 20 month olds who love to chew on the soft sippy cups and throw them from their high chairs.  I like that these have a hard spout so they haven't been able to chew holes through them.  However, these do still emit some milk when thrown or dropped.  My biggest issue with these cups is that there are parts that can't be taken apart & so I wonder what sour milk or mildew is building up inside.  I used these cups to feed my babies a smoothie & I there were little bits of green smoothie stuck inside the stopper that prevents spills.  It took me a good 15 minutes of picking inside these to get them clean.  I will not buy again.
B001UFD2ZO|4|WE are on our second one.  The 1st one lost suction after about a year.  However when we bought it, it was about $20 and that was totally worth it during that year.  So much better than those disgusting manual bulbs.  I tried the nose frieda, but I hated that the pieces didn't snap together and I had to use my free hand to hold it and thus couldn't hold my thrashing daughter still.  This one allows me to have a free hand to comfort and hold her head while using it.
B007R56YEC|5|Gorgeous bright waves on the ceiling....great wave sound and ethereal music options. Matches any sea creature themed nursery. Love it!!!
B00B2KVA3I|5|Love this thing. Better than bijour on my back and for baby.
B00CXH2M2W|3|Didn't quite fit our diaper genie, although we made it work.
B004AHMCKA|1|We tried to wet the suction cup and we dried it as well... all to no avail. This toy simply does not stick.  It didn't hurt our daughter when it fell on her but it could have.  I was going to return it and Amazon was, as always, super helpful.  The only reason I didn't is because I simply forgot.  I ended up giving the toy to my cousin for her 15 month old son.  He's old enough to hold the toy and spin the wheel.<br /><br />Simply put, this toy does NOT work as a high chair toy.  Try again Sassy.
B002SW3EZQ|4|I bought these for my 8 month old to wear while mowing the lawn.  The fit good, stay on his ears, and have a good amount of padding so they seem very comfortable.
B004J69U98|5|I had previously ordered one for one granddaugher and the other granddaughter<br />is now expecting in about 10 weeks so I had to get her one,the first grand<br />daughter has a 2 1/2 yr old and loves having a gyro bowl for the 2 1/2 yr old.<br />The 2nd grand daughter tried out the gyro bowl with skittles as soon as she<br />got it and thinks it's the greatest. Too bad there wasn't a product like this<br />when my kids we young and spilling stuff every where.
B006GX7EWW|5|Good product.  Just what I was looking for.
B0047RI5YU|5|Works as expected. Portable, easy do clean, make the bottle warm in a few seconds. Can use other bottles than Tomme Tippee.
B00295MQLU|5|Awesome bra if you're looking to double pump for return-to-work or simply to build your supply. My baby is three months old and my feeding supply is established. When I started pumping to have some backup in the fridge when I go back to work, I realized I have to double pump to get anything substantial (ie. More than a half ounce).  Enter the Simple Wishes Hands Free pumping bra. My hands aren't cramping and after ten minutes, I have about 3 ounces and I'm not stressing because the bottles stay upright, I'm comfortable and not watching the clock. So worth the money!
B000BD6M1M|3|Could be a little softer, but it does catch food. Then our boy can lift it up and poor all the food that fell in it back on his face. Hooray!
B007PDI7JG|5|Love these sleeps sacks. They are easy to zip, fit well, and are very soft. Not too bulky but definitely warm enough for winter.
B00FM5LK2K|4|Both Levana monitors feature the pricey Oma sensor, which clips onto the diaper, monitors baby's movements, and is not necessarily wanted by everyone nor compensates for a lack of Wi-Fi, but is unique and fills a market niche. However, the Oma would doubtfully prevent sudden infant death syndrome, which cause is unknown, whereas remote viewing through Wi-Fi may certainly show an abuse sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS due to a lack of evidence.  The simple & cheaper Lila has a 2.4\\" display & a static camera, while the Stella has a 4.3\\" display & a pan/tilt camera.    Levana Lila without considering the Oma is inferior not only to much cheaper Lorex BB2411, LW2425, which additionally plays lullabies/monitors temperature & does sound activated recording, but also to similarly priced Lorex BB3521 and LW2400, LW2401, LW241 (playing lullabies and monitoring temperature + sound-activated recording respectively), which has the display larger by 1.1\\", the available optional cameras with mechanical pan/tilt (BB351AC1 or LW2451AC1) and outdoor LW2401AC2 (LWs only), and which unlike the Lila allow to connect to the Internet for remote viewing on smartphones and tablets using Skype.  However, remote viewing on BB3521, LB311 requires Lorex ACCWIFI1 WiFi Remote Connection Cradle (charging monitor) sold separately God knows where.  The Lila is solid, its limited and simple functions work properly, the camera supports two-way talk with the child, but its & the handheld's speakers face back.    Levana Stella without considering the Oma is inferior to cheaper Lorex BB4325X and LW3451X (playing lullabies and monitoring temperature + allowing sound-activated recording & outdoor camera LW2401AC2 respectively), which unlike the Stella allow to connect to the Internet for remote viewing on smartphones and tablets using Skype through included Lorex ACCWIFI1 WiFi Remote Connection Cradle (charging monitor).  The Stella is solid, its functions work well, the camera supports two-way talk, but the handheld's speaker faces back.
B0081SDU1Y|4|I gave this to a friend for her first baby and she loves it. Not sure how well it works because I don't use it, but was perfect for a shower gift.
B00IVNEGOO|4|As far as bouncers go this is a pretty good one.  It has a nice built-in vibration feature which is great for naps when the baby has a cold (along with keeping them upright so the have fewer post-nasal drip issues).  The toy bar is good for a few minutes of entertainment, though in my experience your mileage on those things will vary between babies.  I had it on about a week before I pulled it off because my daughter just ended up getting agitated.<br /><br />It's super easy to get the cover off and wash (something I find true of most Fisher-Price baby gear) and the fabric is good quality.  I like the angle it keeps the baby at: not too high, not too low.  Overall it's a pretty nice bouncer.<br /><br />However at the end of the day, after four kids, I think I prefer a rocker over a bouncer (in particular this Fisher-Price portable rocker) which turns into a fun little toddler seat: [[ASIN:B00CWN3HSU Fisher-Price Newborn-to-Toddler Portable Rocker]].  I just find I get more use out of the rocker (though if you've got a really active baby they may prefer a bouncer).  To be clear I generally use these for feeding when the baby is old enough to hold a bottle, or to entertain them while I'm getting ready in the morning.  If I'm looking for help to sooth a wired baby I'm more likely to put them in a swing than a bouncer.  If it's play time I'd rather have them on the floor getting exercise than playing in a chair.<br /><br />So if you know what you want is a bouncer, I think this is a great choice.  If you aren't sure, my advice is: you need a good swing (and Fisher Price makes the best swings) and you need either a rocker or bouncer you can easily move to the kitchen or bathroom when you need some quick baby entertainment.  You really don't need both, so pick the one you think will work best for your baby.  As I mentioned it seems like more \\"active\\" babies I've known tend to go for bouncers.  My kids were all fairly mellow and took more to rockers.  Go with what works for you.r you.
B00FFJ3YGS|5|Exactly what I expected. Are perfect in the nursery.
B009IVKY7Q|5|This is the perfect item if you are a parent looking to make your own baby food. It also helps with quick snacks for those parents on the go. I made baby food and squeezed it in these and also put yogurt in them as snacks too. Love this Infantino Squeeze Station.
B0000DEW8N|5|We use this as a normal booster seat and love it.  It's easy to clean, no annoying nooks and crannies to dig muck out of, top tier is perfect for pushing right up to the table if you're brave enough ;)  When my daughter wants to play with messy activities like playdoh we just plop her in this with the bare blue tray.
B003TFZ184|5|We use this to wash our dogs and it works great. You just have to make sure it is suctioned down before putting the dog on it.
B000I5UEA8|5|I love this product as I am an expert at swaddling but this makes it so much easier and I feel more secure for when baby is sleeping at night. I know the velcro tabs will not loosen or come off so baby will not (until much older) wiggle out of the wrap and possibly suffocate in the swaddle.
B002UD65XQ|3|I wouldn't say its waterproof...I expected a bit of vinyl in it. My baby daughter vomited a few times and it still seeped through :/ so I would still buy the vinyl fitted ones!
B0010PW3A4|5|I was debating whether to get the Ergo or the bjorn so I did my research on both and went with the Ergo.  I couldn't have made a better chose.  This carrier is comfortable for not only me, but my child as well.  It worked so well I bought one for my friend who just had her baby, and she returned her bjorn the next day.  I will suggest that if you are going to use this product with your infant, to get the infant holder as well.  You can put your infant in the carrier without the holder, but it makes it that much more comfortable.
B00JANUVUM|5|This is our second Recaro convertible booster. This thing is massive, heavy, and built to last. The trade off is that it is not easy to move from car to car.  It is fairly easy to install and is simple to buckle in your twerp. The long term durability appears to be pretty good.
B005NPTNDM|5|I LOVE THIS!!!<br />My baby stays nice and cozy in here. I pair it with a body muff, and her winter coat, and she naps during my long runs.<br />Especilly on windy days (30mph gusts), this is very helpful, as she is not bothered by it.<br />I keep the 'hood' all the way down, and the weather shield still fits over it. It is a little tight, but it works.<br />The weather shield by itself allows too much sun into my baby's eyes.
B00GULAQ1G|4|Worth the money.  Looks very nice.
B0009JB3A8|5|Soft, colorful, great value changing table cover!
B005AV03BA|4|These washcloths have beautiful colors. They are not terry cloth and are rather thin, but will do for wiping dirty faces, hands and runny noses. They are small enough to fit several in your diaper bag with no problem.
B00AKAE6AK|5|This is nice crib! It did not take too much time to assemble it (make sure you read labels on crib parts)  It was packed really well and almost impossible to damage.
B00TD0AH4M|5|beautiful
B00YB0OKMO|1|Barely blocks sun and falls off when you took down windows even a crack. Wish I had got pull down kind
B0070767DU|3|These didn't stay as cold as long as I would have liked for them to. But they did relieve some of the heat when my breasts were tender.
B008HPP672|5|This pillow is just the right size for a toddler head and offers very comfortable support for a young child.  My son takes this pillow to preschool and loves it.
B00DUFC8P2|1|Was no where near slow flow
B0038JE5S8|4|I hated this mill at first.  I pour cooked veggies and hoped that they would produce pureed veggies but what I ended up with was very little pureed veggies but lots of waste.  But then my mother told me that I might need to use a blender before I pour all the veggies into the mill.  She was right.  If I use a blender or food processor to puree veggies and then use this mill, it will separate veggies from its skin and other debris.  For example, I make cream of corn with this mill.  It would not work well if I just pour cooked corns into this but if I chop corns with blender or fp, then this mill separate corn skin very well and end result is a very silky cream of corn!  The same is true for peas and fruits such as berries.  I wish I don't have to add this extra step but all in all, I found this mill very useful to make baby foods as well as soup.
B00A2HUH72|5|We have two of the older model Boulevards and we just got two of the newer one's for my younger child.  I feel they are very safe and work well.
B003OGTJHC|2|So far as I can tell after one use, the quality of the material used for this mosquito net is adequate.  However, the construction is very, very shoddy.  Brand new, right out of the box, the seams were misaligned and coming apart.  Most troubling is the following. The mosquito net has four elastic bands, two on each side, that are designed to hold the net in place as the stroller is used.  However, the bands were not tacked down properly.  Pulling on them with very minor force (to attach to the stroller) caused two of the bands to detach completely.  The net was never used before I had to have a seamstress repair it.  (Under normal circumstances I would have returned it but we needed something to protect our infant from biting insects and the repair was the quickest option.)
B0054TFT62|5|My husband & I just put our crib n changer together. It took us quite a while - about 3.5 hrs to get it done. I really wish the pieces were labeled with letters/#'s & such to make assembly easier but we finished & it looks great. I'm very pleased with the wood color and style. We love it and cannot wait for our little girl to sleep in it when she gets here in July.
B007D1SHUY|5|Cute drying rack
B008MVOVB8|2|These diapers are super cute, I fell in love with the fox and elephant patterns!  I love the pocket style, the quality of materials- the velour inner lining is so soft... BUT they leak, every time, and I change him regularly so it's not like hours of peeing.  I would never even try to use these overnight.  If I am using these in my rotation I make sure to bring extra pants.  Worse then leaking, is that possible!?, they are very hard to snap- my husband and our sitter are not fans of them when they're in rotation.  The snaps on the rise pop off when you try to snap at the waist, it's almost easier to snap the rise after the waist but that just adds more time when you have a squirmy baby!  We have a peanut, he's been in the 5th-20th percentile, so I was so excited about the &#34;trim&#34; diaper, but honestly there is so much bunching and bulk in the front that they aren't really trim.  I do use these without the inserts for the pool- cute little baby speedos.  And because I invested in 6 of these, I use them when my AIO's are on a wash day, but rarely send to the sitter, and I check often for wetness!
B00HY0NXJ4|5|I absolutely love this product! for my wife
B0052ZGRYQ|5|I love this contraption, for many of the same reasons cited below. It is simple and brilliant in it's design and function. The flanges stay in place, my world need not stop to pump, and my hands are free to type this review. The investment is well worth it, The features I like the most are the hook and eye closure with multiple levels (much like a bra) so you can keep wearing it snugly even as the elastic goes slowly over time (just like with bras). I also like that this slips easily over the existing nursing bra, so when I need to use this at work, I won't have to strip down halfway to pump every time.  Be sure you follow the sizing chart, though! I nearly bought this assuming that L meant something similar to a L shirt size. I was glad I caught that and changed my size to a M. These need to fit snugly, almost like an ACE bandage, in order for the flanges and gear to stay in place and not droop.  All in all, I am glad I bought this, and think you should too.
B0000798L0|5|This product is great. I have had back problems in the past and bathing my babies would be painful at times. This has eliminated any back issues caused by bathing the kids. My 20 month old now uses it as a step stool to wash her hands. The only drawback is that it can take up a lot of floor space in a small bathroom. I would definitely buy again.
B00792KR8W|5|My baby doesn't like this hat much. But she likes water in her face a lot less. I'm actually able to rinse the shampoo out of her hair now without drowning her. Overall, a win! I like the quality and design of this hat and would buy another one as needed. The elastic around the head is very soft, stretchy, and yet firm. Recommended.
B00GEF7CJW|5|Not for newborns even though it states it is
B000VZKGYY|5|My daughter loves this adorable lady bug and goes to bed with it every night. It is so fun to look at the stars together.
B002V92XRQ|5|I have an 18 month old picky eater who was very slow to get off the mushy baby food.  I was in search of a container I could send with him when he started \\"school\\".  This fit exactly what I was looking for.  We love it.  It's a pretty sturdy container, the lid fits well, and the compartments are just the right size for little bits of the day's special for his lunch.  He's trying some new foods and best of all, he's eating!  I plan on buying at least one more because we use it all the time.
B001FBM4RU|2|I ordered this for my sons nursery & when i received it still in the packaging it had bleach stains all over the side and bottom of it!
B00A6EWH8S|4|When I first bought these, my son was between sizes on their sizing chart.  I bought a M and a L to find out which would work better.  When they arrived, he tried both on.  The M fit best.  I followed the directions for washing and drying them several times before the first use to increase absorbency.  They worked better than disposables (which use to literally fell apart from the amount of pee my son put into them.)  They still leaked, but I enjoyed not having to clean up the soaked gel-like insides of a disposable, and my son was no longer sopping wet in the morning, just a little wet.  After a week or so of washing though, the M shrank even more and no longer fit him. I was very pleased that I had also bought the L.  I've since started folding up a wash cloth and putting it inside the pocket for added absorbency.  It helps, but he is still a bit damp in the morning.  Since my son is a very heavy wetter at night, I'm purchasing some hemp liners (that I've been told by cloth diapering mommas are very absorbent) to try adding to the pocket.  If the liners don't keep him dry, I'll just have to start waking him once at night to go pee and change out the pull up.  I still say these are WAY better than disposables, less expensive in the long run and would recommend them to anyone with a young bedwetter.  For older kids though, I'd have to recommend a Malem alarm.  I've had great success with this betwetting alarm on my older 2 kiddos;  However you shouldn't start them till they are about 6 y/o.
B0038JDV42|5|Good size, comfortable to hold, look nice, no complaints from me or my two-year old son who can feed himself with these utensils.
B0025YWL4W|4|These work really well for us.  We started out small and have graduated to large and found for just wet diapers they can be hand washed and used as wipes for messy poops or for another diaper.  Through the wash and they might work as a flushable wipe. I love that they can be flushed or re-used once to be gentler on our septic- no concerns related to that thus far and after seeing them come out of the washing machine, it seems they do break down fairly easily.<br />The only thing that I don't love about these is if they extend past the diaper cover they do seem to irritate my kido's thighs- like a paper liner so it's no surprise, but remember they're not cotton and although soft they are vericose/ paper-y.<br />We'll be moving back to all washable liners as teething takes a break but for this phase, I'm happy with these Bummis liners & will use them for our next baby.
B00DJPKA76|5|Great quality!
B000HLYMQ0|5|THIS TOY WAS A FAVORITE OF OUR SON'S SO I ORDERED IT FOR OUR NEW GREAT GRANDSON WHEN I SAW  ON AMAZON.  IT IS STILL AS MUCH FUN AS IT WAS 50 YEARS AGO.
B004QZBEAK|5|It is so well designed that even if the food is hot and I am waiting for it to cool, I don't feel the heat as I hold it. Nothing spills out and non-skid base is awesome. I can simply add more food by taking off the top tray/lid and fitting the ring directly to the bowl. Small and compact. It is pretty tight. Must have!!!!
B008VWXQ3M|5|Best halo sleeper that I have bought yet. The cable knit isn't too warm, but nice and heavy.
B001N4LO1G|5|I had seen one of these baby slings and was excited I could get one on Amazon! The future Mama loved it and can't wait to wear her baby!
B00118ZOVU|4|Thes pants are soft and confortable.  It is for warm weather though. Not thick pants.
B00KPEAFTC|5|If you have had a teething child than you know it is one of the worst things to have to deal with - for you and your little one! Teething causes all sorts of things like runny noses, drooling, loss of sleep (for both of you!), and not to mention pain to your little one! My oldest daughter started the drooling part when she was young, like 4 months old probably. We had just started researching teething and came across amber necklaces. We figured we would try it out and WOW! Within 2 days she was no longer a &#34;drool monster&#34;. We were not having to change her shirt three or four times a day like we were before. After that, she had NO teething symptoms. I am not exaggerating at all here - no drooling, no crying, no runny noses, no sleep loss - nothing! Now, my husband is the scientific type. Maybe she was just lucky? Maybe she was never going to have other teething symptoms at all? But I will tell you, he was not willing to take off the necklace to find out! And by the time our second child came around, he had one waiting for her almost from birth. There was no risking a horrible teething experience in our house! My youngest is now 20 months (I know, I hate the month thing too, let's say almost 2!) and again, no symptoms. I will say that around a year and a half we thought she was past it and took off her necklace. A couple weeks ago, she seemed miserable - runny nose, puffy cheeks, always sucking on her hand and rubbing the back of her mouth. This Toogli baltic amber necklace could not have come at a more perfect time. We put it on her and again, within two days, she was back to her normal, happy-go-lucky self! Now, if I was a betting girl, I would bet on the amber necklace helping out my little one! Amber has a natural analgesic called succinic acid in it which is released when the beads are warmed up against your child's skin. In ancient times, this was used for its healing properties. It was mainly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. As a matter of fact, my mom has severe arthritis in her hand and she wears an amber bead bracelet to help ease the pain. She was a skeptic, and let my niece borrow it, but she claims within a couple of days her hand was in horrible pain, and she had to take the bracelet back. Even if you are a skeptic, I say this is worth a shot, right?! I received this free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.om has severe arthritis in her hand and she wears an amber bead bracelet to help ease the pain.

B000HK6BCE|5|It took a little bit of time to assemble this, but once the task was completed we were very pleased. My husband and I both felt that it would keep our grandson safe and secure when he sleeps at our house.
B0026R445M|1|Wasn't high quality and didn't really like it.  Didn't put off much light anyway.  Removed it from my son's room.
B000UZLL08|5|This frame is really beautiful!  It has made a nice addition to our picture collection in our home, as well as a beautiful Christmas present for my mom.  The interchangable sayings below the picture are so cute, and come in boy, girl and neutral colors.  We really love this frame, and it's so nice to wake up every morning and see our little babe that we can't wait to welcome into our life!
B00MXBLOSG|4|Great Child lock because you don't have to worry about the kids getting to it.  The plastic is a little thin so I am not sure how long they will last but have worked well for about 6 months so far.
B00GD0YNU4|5|Our five month old LOVES this toy. It's a fantastic design that allows her to easily hold it and chew/suck on the finger nubs and the rattle in the handle is an added bonus. Even at $10 a pop, I'm considering ordering a backup (or two, or three); I would hate for her to lose hers an go without.
B004CJ9D44|5|Love this monitor! I have had no issues with it at all and it works really well. I love the cordless handset! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and if you have issues the customer service department is very helpful. Mine came with a defective power cord and they replaced it at no charge.
B003MUA5IC|5|Wonderful product! I have five and I leave one in every diaper bag I have. I don't understand why others are giving this two stars, its wonderful and does not leak,  and is very easy to open. It's very sturdy and well made unlike its predecessors. This also can have more than one use, I use one for my jewelry and I use one for hair accessorizes for my daughter.
B000MEB3GE|5|I wish I would have had this from Day 1, but I got it a couple of weeks after my daughter was born.  It was SO helpful with late night feedings and overall not knowing what day it was, much less when the last time the baby ate.  It was just one more thing that I didn't have to think about!  I wish I would have had this the first week or so when I was on painkillers from my c-section, that would have been amazing!  Don't miss out on this one!!
B00BEVF1XU|5|It's easy to install.And my baby loves it.He falls asleep quickly in the seat
B003VNKLHK|5|Great buy!  My toddler has yet to figure out how to open the gate and get out.  Waaaaay better than that stupid shock collar......What good is it if they can simply pry open the lock and take it off?  And you would have thought 400,000 volts would be somewhat of a deterrent.  Nope.
B004HO5866|5|I'm happy with this stroller, it's better then the graco one I had before.Just one thing, the cup holder in front doesn't fit most sippy cups!
B0013P53YE|4|This works well but I had to get 2 of them. The only hold the parts to 3 bottles and then you put the actual bottles in he top rack, separately. For those people saying it takes up too much room.. you don't lay it flat, you stand it up a little. I can put 2 of these in my  top rack and still put 6 bottles and several glasses too.
B0072FRENC|5|One of my favorite purchases. My baby will probably outgrow them soon as he is a chunky breastfed 18 lbs at 3 months old... I was considering cloth diapering at 6 months, but probably won't be able to for that reason alone. These free time ones are nice to use once in a while.
B00O3GVSZI|5|What an incredible time saver! It is hard to believe no one had thought about creating something like this years ago. I actually gifted this to my next door neighbor who has a five month and she absolutely loves it. She did have a large plastic happy face on the floor where her baby ate, now this bib catches all the food. There is even no more cheerios left in the diaper. If you want something that is cute and an efficient time saver - these are the bibs to get!
B00IOUD186|5|so easy to install.  Works great !  Keeps the little fingers from shutting off our lights!
B00IAKQM7C|1|These did not come in newborn size like it suggests they will.  She probably won't be able to wear these until she's over a year old.  Very disappointed. They also took forever to arrive.
B00Y76VLY2|5|Great product. Fits all my son's bath toys and they're dry by the next bath time. Easy to use and clean!
B007C52ZEA|5|I love these pads, they are super soft, very absorbent and not bulky at all.  I shamefully used to use disposables with my first and switched to these with baby #2 and absolutely loooove them!
B009CASF1K|5|Best pasifiers on the market I believe. When she's not using it, she can chew on it as a teether. I love the flexibility of it!
B003ZK5O4Y|4|functional roll up with good storage.  not made for cheap plastic either.  sown well together, though it has stretched from over stuffing it.  easy to clean too.
B004IZWQYQ|4|Pros: no batteries needed, does not make noise.  My 17m old loves it.  At first I thought it was too small/short, but it really is the perfect height.  We had a similar ball ramp toy with an older child, and since it was taller/bigger he had to keep squatting and standing to pick up the balls and put them in the top.  The earlyears ball ramp is short enough so they can sit the whole time.  Cons: well, you have to line up the holes just right so the balls go down the ramps as intended.  Which is difficult because each color is a separate part and is easily separated from the rest.  That is great for putting the toy away, not-so-great if they pull it over and apart.  I do, however, recommend the toy considering how much my child loves it and how inexpensive it was!
B000QIJ020|2|I thought this was worth a try because it is so different than other bath products out there.  It does work, however, it is hard to wash the baby's bottom and get in between all the leg creases, etc.  You also can't really get the area soapy since all the soap washes off the wash cloth because the baby's bottom is submerged in water.  This makes it hard to wash off diaper cream, etc.  My babies did like sitting in it after their initial surprise.  Might be good for brief dips where heavy duty cleansing is not needed, but otherwise, it doesn't really work so great.
B005UND3B0|5|Great quality. Bought this for a 2 year old birthday gift. Mom loved it especially with the matching drink bottle, utensil set & bib.
B00AHVR7Z8|5|I love this car seat...Oh and I think my daughter does too. Well for one its really cute, and it sits up really tall so I can see her good. When she falls asleep her head doesn't fall forward, It is tilted back enough and the head cushion makes it nice for her. It also has a little butt cushion for her that make it nice and comphy!
B002NGNF60|5|Happy with this purchase as my 18 month old toddler loves it, more functional that other cups and does not leak as other brands with flexible spouts.
B00ESFZISC|5|excellent
B000G6BZJI|5|I was wondering about this product because another reviewer said it was difficult to use.  I took it out of the box and adjusted and installed it in a doorway in about 1 minute.  I really didn't find it hard to figure out at all.  There are two pieces of wood that slide past each other to make the gate ends get closer together or farther apart.One of the wood pieces has grooves in the top which hold the metal pin from the other wood piece.  Once you find the right groove for the gate width you want - you slide a retaining clip over the end of the wood strips and it is locked at that size.  We are using it to keep our dog in the bedroom at night and out of the bedroom during the day.  I'd rate this as a very good value.
B007PT41S6|5|Product works perfectly - and I'm glad to pay less than the other brand.  My daughter loves that she can now wash her hands by herself without jamming her ribs on the sink.
B000BUOS2K|4|My daughter fell in love with this doll when she was just a few weeks old and it has held up well over the first year and we just got two more (as insurance).  My only complaint, my daughter was drawn to the yarn at the top of the head and chewed on it, so we had to cut that off.  It has held up well to repeated washings, the filler just got a little bunched up, so she is not as full and soft as she was for the first few months.
B002CVTL46|1|Ordered this to use for twins as they grow because it was the largest play yard I could find.  Reviews indicated it was easy to use.  I unpacked it and attempted to set it up.  Broke out into a sweat trying to get the sides to lock into place.  One side would not lock into place at all! I wanted a play yard that could be easily set up and taken down as needed by me - not one that you would have to call in the troops for assistance. Needless to say, I'm returning it.
B0033WRTA6|5|With each of my four kids, I have gone to the store before baby arrived, and bought several brands of pacifiers.  Doing so, has proved to be pointless, as they all enjoy MAM.  There are a lot of fun styles and colors, but when it all comes down to it, baby likes MAM, so I LOVE MAM.
B002SW3AZK|4|Personally, these did not work for us as swaddle wraps. My son would break out and it was a bit too warm for our weather. We now use SwaddleMe's and moving into Halo Sleep Sacks. This is the only reason I give this product a 4-star. For others it may work well for swaddling. I'm just disappointed because that was the main reason I got these.<br /><br />On the plus side, I still love these and use it for tummy time and to cover the car seat from the sun. I have to fold it in half though because otherwise it's too thin and the sun will still shine through pretty bright. I've also used it as a blanket as needed when out and about or an emergency burp cloth. They are soft, easy to wash, very thin and lightweight yet still able to provide warmth when folded. I like the simple, cute but classy prints.
B000RLB6MS|5|Superb price, great product - been using for 6m now & no signs of stress yet!
B00DBXOXTM|5|I love this bag.  Great quality and a lot of different pockets to organize.  If you like to carry a lot, I would for the bigger version of this bag.
B0037AZLPE|5|These are my toddler's favorite binky.  She only takes one at bedtime, and she sleeps the best when using one of these.  Plus, they look pretty darn cool!
B00JU4ZJGM|5|These look great and absolutely never fall off. Awesome assortment of patterns. A must have for newborns with razor sharp fingernails!
B00G34TJZ4|4|Pros: Well built. Seems comfortable, looks great.<br />cons: price (although it is quality), you can't remove the seat from the base, no cup holder.<br />  Overall I would buy another one.
B00GDLZPG4|5|These are greeting cards, not postcards. Still great through!
B00BZAMLNI|1|Big letters on the box side says it works with iPod.  The truth is you need an older android phone to operate it.  Once you get the right phone, then you are able to play songs from the iPod.  Very deceptive, never buy erector again, got my first set 50 years ago.
B005ZBFM34|5|Purchased this as a gift for my daughter in law, at her request.  This is an innovative item, both pretty and functional.  It was very easy to get the idea of how to put the baby in and both mother and baby seemed satisfied by the secure fit. My DIL says it doesn't hurt her back like some other carriers she's used in the past.
B007KHPX1C|5|Super Box meet my expectations and more. The greatest toy box.
B0080D59XM|5|I bought this swing because it was the same brand as my sister-in-laws (which we had borrowed and loved).  It is VERY easy to put together (should be able to assemble without the instructions really...took me 15 minutes).  It has many music options, many speed levels on it and a cushy padding that the baby sits on.  I LOVE the plug in option!!  If you are going to purchase a swing, look no further!!  This is the one!!
B006ZVV0NO|5|It is my third order for this set for family and friends.
B0000649E3|1|loved cloth,nice patterns, cost good, leaked urine. The fit was fine but found them to leak urine onto cloyhing and bedding even after short periods of wearing. Felt like they still needed rubber pants.
B00A2HUFG0|5|This is a good convertible car seat that I bought for my son.  Easy to install in the car and nicely cushioned to keep him snug.  The best part is it can recline or sit straight.  It has good side safety protection.
B00E879WW8|5|purchased as a gift and hope she enjoys it
B000FXW24O|5|I bought this and a standard bar lock when my daughter was 2  She is now 5yo, can open the patio lock that came with the door and lift the bar  But she cannot reach this lock at all, her 6yo friend got outsmarted as well    Very good keeps lock out of reach, when she's old enoguh to reach this we won't need safety locks anymore    Very good take your time to install, dry install it before drilling holes  well worth it
B0006PU798|4|Cute.
B008KSPY0U|5|Very sturdy and super cute!  This item definitely met my expectations.  I bought the bedding set as well, and I am very please with it!
B00913CZY6|5|Daughter loves! High quality
B003SZUTVO|5|I have the Midori travel system for my daughter. We just now moved up to convertible seat so I feel like having 8 months of using it, I can finally write a review on it.<br /><br />Car seat- This is an excellent car seat. It is so easy to install with either latch or seat belt. I love how the base reclines so easy so it takes a few seconds to get the seat level. There is a bubble leveler on the seat. Now that I switched to Evenflo Symphony all-in-one seat, I realize how easy this Chicco seat was. I really wish they made a Chicco convertible :) This seat is easy to clean, it will come clean with just wiping it. The material is not too hot. Just remember you are only supposed to use the infant insert up to 11 lbs. I did not realize that I ended up not going back to read the manual until she was 13 lbs. This seat would have lasted us another 6 months but I was just ready to get the convertible seat since we leave this seat in our car now due to her being able to sit in high chairs at restuarants and ride in the shopping cart at stores. You do have to rethread this to adjust the harness height but I only did it once in the first 7 months of using it. It is not hard but just takes a few minutes.<br /><br />Stroller- I still use this stroller and I keep it in the back of my small SUV. I admit, this thing is HUGE. It takes up the whole back end of my Equinox...but it is very smooth riding and my daughter seems to love it. It is truly one hand fold out and one hand fold up. You just need to practice a few times to get the hang of it. I love the cup holder and little storage compartment on the handles. I keep a drink, cell phone, and keys. The basket underneat is very accessible as long as you do not snap the car seat in. If you snap the car seat in, you have to put the diaper bag in the basket before you snap it in and you have to lift the car seat out in order to get the diaper bag. Once, baby can ride in stroller alone without carseat, it is no problem. The stroller alsoreclines all the way back flat so I started letting my daughter ride in it at 2 months old. This flat feature is also nice since you can change the baby in the stroller, rather than on a nasty changing table.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this travel system. We will definitly use this for our next child, and that is why we chose this super cute gender neutral color (midori). I do admit that a lot of people just assume she is a boy due to the green car seat but I put pink toys on it to clear up any confusion. :)
B002ZYNTO8|5|I love my pumpease and I tell everybody about it.  I don't know how I managed to pump for almost a year the first time without it.  Using the pumpease I could make phone calls, use the computer, send emails, etc and not worry about the flanges falling off of me.    I like that it has several sets of hook and eyes and your size changes throughout your nursing cycle as well as throughout the day!
B0002E7DIQ|5|it's awesome, but get a cover because it gets dirty real fast
B00Q3FGUY6|5|Happy with product needed it for a shower gift. Nice packaging good instruction
B000IDSLOG|5|Every baby loves this toy..easy for them to hold..soft to the touch..very pleasant to look at..it's got it all!
B0033B9CZ2|5|I was losing suction in my medela pump (the bookbag one). After calling the help line I was looking at all the parts and realized my tubes had stretched out where you insert them into the pump. I bought these and my pump is back to 100%.
B002ISZL8S|5|Perfect for your Ju-Ju-be bag
B001VET70S|4|The 30 x 40 size is perfect for swaddling our newborn twins. I especially love the elephant pattern in the Turquise set.<br /><br />They do show some wear after a wash or two, but they are otherwise great!
B003VTZKOI|3|I bring this to my mom when she watches my daughter and it's very easy to close and travel with. Toys are exactly as described, very simple and easy to clean. The only problem I have is that it is very hard to remove the toys to clean. I have to always ask for help from my husband. I'm not sure if it is because my daughter is just tall, but she can easily reach the floor and walks around in it within 2 weeks of ordering it and she was only 6+ months! Can't adjust the height of it higher though.
B00GRY0ZYE|4|Works as advertised, but wish the mats were a little thicker
B003I867US|4|I love this, so don't get me wrong, but I'm waiting for my son to get a little more chunky before he goes in here for a bit. His legs were not fitting to the most comfortable setting, which mad him mad. But it's a good and easy to use carrier. I can't wait to use it in the spring.
B000056OWC|1|this tub is the worst,i received it as a shower gift.i takes two peole to give the baby a bath.if you try it by your self the baby slides down into the water almost dronwig.i had to put a towel in the bottom.he caught his little feet under that bar after the second time i threw it out.i wouldnt give that tub to anybody with a baby.i would be to afraid somthing would happen to there baby
B00DEXVL6W|5|Everything seems like it will work great. Arrived on time.
B008N1K8VE|4|Good quality, I use it for wet clothes etc after swimming class, however it is very large!! much larger than I anticipated.
B004D07ZEM|5|These fit great and we're still using them at 4 months old. Almost 12 lbs. the girly set could have had more girly colors to it but overall it's a great buy.
B0012LZD5I|5|Buy it
B00L18N2D2|2|I didn't like them because the rubber part would slide when you tightened the lid which would make it leak. I went with a different product.
B0028MCZF6|5|I gave birth to a 27 week Preemie in February, so maintaining my supply was of the essence. I was able to borrow a Medela Symphony until My daughter was 34 weeks and was about to pay monthly to rent until another mom at the hospital raved about the Hygeia. She even brought it in to show me. Yes, it is by far much louder than the Symphony and I agree that the sound recording is quite silly, but this pump's performance is right up there with the Symphony! I used the Pump in Style with my first child, but I felt like it took forever to completely empty both breasts. I can empty both in less than 10 minutes with the Hygaeia. I didn't find the manual setting for letdown too annoying, in my opinion its almost better because you can switch at your pace just as your baby would. I'm very pleased with this pump, as my supply is still great after 4 weeks of use and it saved me lots of money that would be wasted on renting! You can also resell the pump which is fabulous!!
B00L40QMV6|4|Very happy with purchase! It is so cute! I bought for my daughter who just had her first baby, she loves it as well.
B00B49IQPM|5|Keeps her out of trouble and is easy to reconfigure and move around. the suction cups work great on hardwood floors so it does not slide around.
B00AU30GDS|5|Love this clutch. Ive been looking for this product for a year now, i just didn't know anyone made it. I thought, \\"there has got to be a small cute diaper bag purse combo\\" and then finally while reviewing my pampers rewards i saw it. I couldn't wait the 4-6 weeks to get it so i jumped on Amazon and had it in 2 days.<br />My favorite feature, hard to pick one, is the no slip rash ointment slot. I put a sunscreen stick and my daughters epipen in it. It hasn't moved an inch. Its always handy and such a relief to know if there were a peanut emergency I'm ready in a flash.<br />This is truly something that every mom really needs. This is my only baby shower gift from now on!<br />Also the customer service of this company rocks!
B004GB5UO0|5|I LOVE this baby carrier! Its like the ergo but better! The best part is that you get extra support around your hips which takes the weight off of your back. There are multiple carrying positions and it even allows you to put the baby forward facing unlike the Ergo. It costs less and does more! Why would you not buy this?
B004S8MGGQ|5|LOVE this bra.  This makes pumping so much easier and actually holds the bottles in a position that allows the milk to drain the right way and you to use your hands.  Seriously, best purchase related to feeding I've made yet.  I love the adjustable strap, too, to accommodate size changes.
B0053ZD2IY|2|i purchased girl color, but its boy color of blue, and it was dirty with spots. It`s shipped in Mongolia from Los Angeles .I`cant return it... too bad can't believe :(
B008TAAHSS|5|I like this brush. With heavy use, it needs to be replaced at least monthly because the sponge starts to fall apart. The stand isn't very sturdy either. It definitely seems to make the bottles squeaky clean.
B0083FQFMQ|5|I absolutely love Halo brand sleep sacks. They are a great quality and look great. I will use this brand from now on.
B0052QYLUM|4|I love these cameras. I have two of them now, one for each child's room. It is very handy to be able to check in on them in the night without having to get up. Prior to getting the Infant Optics system, my wife would sneak into our son's room to check on him and inevitably she would wake him up. These are pretty durable too. Our monitor has been dropped and hit with balls and Frisbees among other accidents and it has help up surprisingly well. The monitors have taken some abuse from our children too. The only problem I have with these cameras is that they interfere with my wireless network. It only seems to happen if I am next to the monitor while using a wireless device. I usually will just move the device to the other side of the room and I'm usually fine after that. I believe switching to a 5GHz wireless router will fix the issue, but it has really not been that big of a deal. Other than that issue, these have been great and I would recommend them to anyone with kids.
B003BIFNYQ|3|Like another reviewer, we wanted something mostly organic in a reasonable price range. This mattress is not 100% organic, it has been treated with fire retardant chemicals (I believe boric acid, from what I've read from other people who have contacted their customer service), but for the price and being \\"mostly\\" organic, it's a pretty good deal.    My biggest complaint is that I also feel like the mattress is not very firm. The toddler vs. infant side on our mattress were not obviously labeled (though we figured it out- the label is there but it's not very obvious), but really I can't feel a difference in firmness between the two sides. In fact, when we were trying to decide which side was firmer by feel before we noticed the label, we were certain that the toddler side was more firm. I've decided it's not so concerning that I'm going to send it back (especially since our baby won't be in his crib until he's older anyway), but in hindsight, if I had seen this mattress in person before buying it, I would have went with something else.
B000JWSO9I|2|I love the idea of this, bought one for my son. He hated it.
B00568MNCO|5|This changing pad is really big, perfect to throw down on our cream couch without having to worry. It washes really well. I haven't had any problems with shrinkage but I dry all my baby items on low.
B00HSR0BTI|4|There are other brands coming out with very similar cups, and they are about half the price, so it will be interesting to see how they stack up against the original WOW cup.  It's a very sturdy cup.  It leaks very little, BUT the silicone pieces will wear out over time and then you will see more leaks.  You can buy replacement parts but the reviews on those indicate they are too stiff, so not sure if that's a production issue that will get better over time.  My kid at about 14 months, went from a sippy cup to this cup overnight.  It took maybe 5 minutes for her to figure it out and it's been smooth sailing since.  Our pediatrician was very clear he wanted her off spout cups and didn't want us to introduce straws and recommended this.  It's a big cup but she holds it easily.  I wish there were markings inside for ounces but that's a minor detail.  The only problem I've had is that the caps can be hard to screw on and without tipping it all over you can't be sure it's on tight.  I developed tenosynovisits in my wrist after having my kid (yay for being a geriatric mom, more likely to get this stuff) and sometimes I just can't get the lid off without pain, or even at all, especially after my husband puts it on.  He's no muscle man, but screws the lid on tighter than I do.  Overall it's a really good cup, easily washed in the dishwasher, easy to assemble, so we'll see how it goes over time.  It will easily transition into a regular cup when it's time for that, just take the lid off.  I did just order a competitor's cup to compare.  And don't bother buying the extra lids.  One comes with the cup and you'll find you rarely use it.  By the time you are using the cup the germaphobia has died down and you'll just wipe it off when needed.
B003AVQFI2|4|This bottle truly is closet to mama's breast.  I'm breastfeeding my baby and need to transition her to a bottle so I could go back to work.  Although she doesn't love the bottle yet, she's taking onto the mimijumi nipple better than the Coddlelife bottles I was using before.  This nipple is really the next best thing to breast and the design of the bottle is beautiful.  I just wish that it was made of glass instead of plastic.  A bottle this well designed would only be better if it were glass.  The cap is also cheap and useless.  It doesn't snap securely into place.  It actually doesn't snap at all. It's just on top of the bottle, pretty much.  If I were carrying it with the cap on in my diaper bag without it being in a bottle holder, it would definitely fall off and leak everywhere....guaranteed.  Other than the issue with the cap, this bottle is great.  I just hate that it's not a glass bottle.
B00CWN3FNW|5|Our daughter likes it .. Will ask her why when she grows up a bit
B00L8921O0|5|good quality and comfortable
B00CKSU82K|5|Product worked perfectly!
B000XPWXK2|4|Good for the price. My baby pull it out of her so I had to buy a different kind that has a button and not velcro
B003IHVHM2|5|Keeps bugs and bees out. Wish it would work to keep sun out. Very good material, well made. I use it on stroller. So glad to have on walks.
B002ITOC7S|5|THIS IS NOT A TOY.............A very importent medical device to help prevent SIDS. Gives parents a piece of mind and protects baby from harmful events.
B00A9YW6F4|4|This is a great play area. I like it because it doesn't feel like a baby jail. We have it free standing and it wraps around the living room (using the couch as the other walls. I took the advice of others and didn't put the stickers on since can come off. I'm thinking of buying a second one to have more flexibility to expand the area.
B000YDDF6O|5|Really cute toy for my 3 month old grandson this Christmas. This toy had great reviews and that must have been why my daughter ended up with 3 of them as gifts.
B006JV4HC6|5|This seat brings my grand daughter right up to the table with the rest of us and makes her feel like she's part of the family instead of segregated a few feet away in an isolated high chair. She loves being right there with all of us and bounces happily in her secure seat.  It's so practical, fun and easily portable so that she can share in family meals wherever we eat...home, restaurant, friend's homes, etc!
B00SZ09QUW|5|love this product
B005E0Q0R8|5|Love the size!  Perfect for travel and I am using it for protein powder and it works for four servings
B00I3VHAGK|5|My baby LOVES this blanket and so do I! It is so soft and snuggly I wish they made one for adults! I just purchased a second one just in case ( God forbid) something happens to the other one he will have a back up. I think he would have a meltdown for days if we lost it or it got destroyed somehow.
B00IK3428U|5|This is incredibly soft.  I actually bought the set for my pug puppy to sleep with in her crate and she loves it and seems to find it soothing.  The company also went above and beyond in the service area to get this to me so I must recommend them as well.
B002WN2C0E|5|This seat is really nice. Adjusting the back is a little difficult, but not impossible. Will probably move easier with use.
B001L61286|5|I would highly recommend this toy net as a great buy. My grandson just loves to put his toys in it.
B009S2GRDA|5|An absolute lifesaver for a colicky baby.  It didn't work miracles, but it was nice to give my arms a break every now and then. For my first son, I ordered an Extra Small. I am 5' 10&#34; and weighed from 145 right after birth to 130 at three months. He was 7.9lbs. By the 3 month mark it seemed too tight, so I ordered another size up for this baby, in hopes of getting more use out of it.
B002UXQRES|1|Being that I already have low milk production, my body was being extra productive and pumped a good 6 ounces.  BUT these bags leaked and I lost half the bag!!!!!!  So far the only bags that are convenient and sturdy are the Medela ones.  Don't be cheap because you get what you pay for.  I tried these because it was free so that serves me right.  Just save yourself the frustration and don't use them!!
B004VQF95U|5|3+ months of use and still on original batteries.  I haven't used the star projector yet, but it seems a little dim on my lemon coloured walls.
B007D1NKK6|4|It was exactly what I needed. I have a king size bed with a pretty deep mattress. This was my 2nd attempt at making a rail work. The first one I bought was the kind that flips down. The problem was the side boards on my bed didn't allow room for the joints. The other problem was that it was not tall enough to make it worthwhile. I found this after quite an effort. I made it work with my slats by taking the box that it was shipped in and flattening it out. I laid it down in top of the slats. Then I had a solid foundation to keep the bars from falling through. It works well. It's tall enough to keep from rolling over and it's snug...not flimsy at all. I'm giving 4 stars because it was I little pricey in my opinion. But it works so it was money well spent. I sleep better knowing the bed is safe.
B00506R2GO|2|This was not the right stroller for me...     Pros:   1. Heavy duty - extremely resistant.  2. Really easy to the fold.  3. Great suspension - baby doesn't feel bumpy terrains.  4. I found the basket easy to access and use, and it is really big.    5. Canopy is huge and keeps my baby protected from the sun (and rain).  6. Loved the color!    Cons:   1. It is heavy.   2. Not very easy to maneuver in small spaces due to its size.  3. The baby has no angle to look around when seated to its sides. My baby didn't like this at all!  4. It is not very comfortable. Maybe best for older babies (possibly toddlers). My son never napped while on it! 1. 5. I seem to always need to retighten my son's harness, I don't know how but it is always loosening.     Overall, my son didn't adapt to it and I sold it and bought a Peg-Perego Pliko P3 which he simply loves.
B00903H3R6|4|The &#34;3&#34; is a little big, but my son liked it and looked cute wearing it on his birthday. Kind of expensive, though.
B00O8RQSKM|5|Very easy to set up.
B00HUCV0JQ|5|I really love this carseat canopy! It is more pretty in person, the colors are very vibrant and &#34;happy&#34;!
B00BU7404Y|4|The Snuggle Stars TM Bear Constellation Night Light is like a mini pillow pet that projects stars and a moon onto the ceiling. The moon and stars can be changed from blue to green to orange or you can set it to change between those three colors every 8 seconds or so. The colored lights seem to vary in brightness blue being the brightest and orange being the least. To change from one color to another or to turn off the nightlight all you do is press the dome that's on the back of the bear making it super simple for young children to use. I love that this night light projects decent sized stars. I've tried other star projection toys where the stars were so tiny they just looked like dots. These projected  stars are probably a good 8 inches or so and the moon is over a foot it seems making the room a starry paradise. The Snuggle Stars bear is soft and can either be folded up with Velcro or laid flat out like a pillow.I love this product overall. The only I wish was a little different was the battery concealer cover. The battery compartment is just covered by Velcro so it will be easy for children to change the timer from off to on. You how kids love buttons and switches. It might of been better if it was zippered or had more Velcro. Also, the velcro that keeps the bear folded in half could be a little bigger. It almost doesn't want to hold the bear in that position but it does.
B000KJBFC8|5|We purchased this tray for our 18 month old grandchild. It works very well for us.  We were not sure about it strapping around the child, rather than the seat, but it doesn't seem to bother our grandaughter.  She likes to empty out her snacks and \\"examine\\" them, but they ended up on the floor or in her seat.  Now she can empty them into the tray, she doesn't get as frustrated and it makes mother's life easier, too.  It has been very helpful for any car travel - may work in other situations, too, as it straps on the child.
B006YBG1WA|5|This mobile is amazing!  I know, it only spins round and round, but it really takes the attention of my baby!  And the classical music is wonderful!  She loves it!
B0014J0W8G|3|I won't say these are the best locks but it sure beats a shoestring. The lock can be difficult to slide as you have to jiggle it to move it. I wish they also had more of a blunt end instead of the point. The point itself is not sharp but it can be nerve racking if you kids eye is at the same level as the lock.
B006ZISPIA|5|Simple analog baby monitor. 4 channels are easy to use with two toggles to find the clearest for your house or run multiples. Nice soft glow night light. Can run on batteries. Good deal for a no frills monitor.
B002ZB8298|5|The Angelcare Baby Movement sensor monitor has given me a great amount of peace of mind since day one.  We put our daughter in her own room/crib the second night home from the hospital.  This monitor has pretty much worked flawlessly for us since the day we set it up.  Our first daughter is now 2.5 and although we don't use the motion sensor feature, we still use it as a basic monitor.  It is getting ready to go into baby #2's room and I'm so thankful we have it.  I will honestly say the alarm went off falsely a few times as our daughter had moved too far off the sensor pad area....but we would still rather have a couple false alarms than nothing.  When my daughter was about 3 months old the alarm DID go off while she was in a pack and play, directly in the middle, and I was sleeping in a bed in the same room while we were away from home.  It took me a few seconds to rouse her to get her to move....in the back of my head I always wonder if that was the precise moment the Angelcare monitor was doing what it's meant to do!  Would recommend this monitor to anyone and everyone!!!
B002W5VDHK|5|I love my kokopax city carrier. I am a mom of 3. My two youngest are 2 and 5 months. I have a couple of pouch slings, but those aren't practical for cooking, housework, or other things that require both arms to be free. We have multiple strollers, one of which includes a double side by side stroller that we love, however, it's not always practical to use a stroller. Take for example, the trips I was making to the grocery store prior to getting the Kokopax. My older son would be on the seat in the cart and my infant would be in his car seat taking up the entire cart space. I'd have to pile groceries underneath the cart. Or, trips to the park with my 2 year old who wants to run everywhere. Dragging a stroller through the sand/tanbark was horrible, and holding the baby in my arms or in the sling wasn't practical because I often need my hands/arms to help my son around the playground and getting in and out of those bucket swings. I really didn't want a hiking backpack because I just don't need all of those darn straps, pockets, zippers, etc. The things I love the Kokopax City Carrier are:<br />baby loves being able to look around<br />lightweight<br />no waist strap<br />minimal pockets (just one that the straps feed into. Also good for maybe 1 diaper, keys)<br />looks good<br />baby is comfortable<br />I've had many mothers either looking at it or coming up to me asking where I got it. I use it nearly every day.<br />My only complaint is that the fabric covering the padding on the lumbar support seems to be rubbing on my clothing and it is wrecking some of my clothing. This happened the very first time I used it. My daughter came up and asked what was all over the lumbar padding. I have one of those nylon, super stretchy tank tops that I wear under some t-shirts because I like the length and the layered look, but it really messed that tank top up in the spot where it rests against the Kokopax. It is pilling nearly all of my clothing. The padding now has multiple colors of pills from the various shirts that I have worn with it. If I didn't LOVE this carrier so much, that would have turned me away from the product. There has got to be a different fabric that can be used that won't do this to clothing when there is friction. Because I love the carrier, I am going to try and find a way to cover that pad with another material. Maybe one that is less coarse.ts that I have worn with it.

B00G4TDAY4|5|Helpful.
B008PTTNFG|5|I got a medium, large and XL because I wasn't sure about the sizing, and I have a 35lb slender son, a 25lb heftier daughter, and an 18 lb infant.  My son can actually wear all three because he has lean legs, they just get a bit bulkier-looking in the XL.  The Large fits him and my 25 lb daughter best, and I use the medium on my infant.  I love how durable they are, and the fact that they don't smell horribly of ammonia after wetting or even sweating.  They wipe clean, and wash well, and overall are quite durable.  I love them as much as my BumGenius diapers and Thirsties covers.
B002SG76YC|1|Absolute crap.  These bibs might fit a baby a few weeks old but other than that won't fit at all.  Not worth a penny.  Sought to return but were denied.  Don't waste your money.
B00EDMZLPU|5|My baby loves this toothbrush, I love that it is durable and nontoxic.<br /><br />My little girl can't get enough of her toothbrush. The one end soothes her sore gums. The bristle end cleans between teeth. She really pulls and bites this. I thought she would rip the bristles off but its held up.<br /><br />I love that it's made of food grade silicone which is much safer for babies then plastic teethers.
B009QD53TA|5|Excellent price compared to the original and its the same in every way except color. My 15 month old put all the shapes in correctly at 12 months after practicing heavily with a traditional shape sorter. He loves this one. Great for a kid that has mastered the traditional kind of shape sorter and needs a challenge.
B00F2MQ294|5|I purchased this when my little one couldn't exactly hold her head up. (Shes stubborn and wanted to sit up already) I used a boppy pillow behind and it worked great. Now that she's finally able to hold her head up I love it even more. She's a chubby baby and I like the fact that her legs fit . The back support is great as well. I would deff recommend it. They get to see the world from an upright position. I get to read and play with her as she sits upright.
B000J3IW0S|5|I have the small and large microfleece SwaddleMes and I think they are fabulous!  My daughter sleeps like a dream in them!  She could get out of a regular recieving blanket, but rarely gets out of these!  I'm ordering a cotton one in large for spring.   <br /> <br />I got a Boppy brand swaddler (flannel-ish material) from Target and she could almost immediately get out of that one.  She out grew it quickly. <br />
B000S9RF4M|5|I bought this for my little man for Christmas.  He loves it and I love it!  He started using it when he was 4 months old and is now 1 year and he still plays with it!  It clips onto EVERYTHING! It's my new baby shower gift.  Buy it!
B00213KN0G|1|I dont like this playpen. The bottom keeps popping up and it is unstable. I set it up correctly and then when i put the baby in the bassinet, the bottom pops up. I finally gave up and bought a new one. I hope this was only a lemon, but I would NOT recommend this product.
B000HVC1FO|5|My wife bought a bedroom set for our new nuesery that included one of these in it.  The problem was that the window was too large and we needed an additional valance.  This product was easy to find and matches exactly with the one we already had.  Looks great.
B00BJRGKY8|4|It's perfect!!! It's compact!! And I take it anywhere and the most the baby loves it!
B004P1IVOM|5|Very soft, appears to be well made and completely adorable.
B004O7F3HK|4|MAM is the only brand my daughter likes. Although in this picture you can clearly see that they are purple. I received pink ones. Pink ones that she already has. So that was a minor let down. But all in all, she still loves them. My favorite part is the glowing in the dark capability.
B0052IERHM|3|It barely fits by Britax Pavillion. I debated between this and a cheaper generic one. Decided on this one because I thought being Britax it would fit better.
B00005BSM0|2|I BOUGHT THIS TUB FOR MY NEWBORN SON, HE IS NOW ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD AND ALREADY I HAD TO GO SHOPPING FOR A NEW TUB. THIS TUB STARTED OFF AS A WONDERFUL IDEA. IDEAL FOR NEWBORNS BUT SOON MY SON DIDN'T FIT COMFORTABLY IN IT.  I ALSO FOUND THAT AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS OF USE AND FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURERS CLEANING DIRECTIONS...THE CLOTH LINING STARTED TO DEVELOP VERY SMALL BLACK DOTS (MOLD - I THINK). I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST THIS TUB IF YOU HAVE A  SMALL BABY AND DON'T PLAN ON USING IT FOR TOO LONG. I SUGGEST GETTING ONE OF THE PLASTIC TUBS WITH A SPONGE INDERT...MY SON ABSOLUTELY LOVES HIS NEW TUB AND FITS IN IT MUCH BETTER.
B004IYHKNO|4|I have had this stroller for several months now. My son is 2. I also own the uppababy vista which I highly recommend with 5 stars. Maybei was expecting a little too much since I absolutely would never trade my vista for any other stroller on the planet. Not even the bugaboo! Not even close. I feel some parts were built quite shoddy. The \\"one handed\\" fold up is not nearly as one handed as they should advertise. In fact this is not a selling point as I've never been able to complete this task with one hand. The reason I bought it was easy transportation (LIGHT) on the subway and with a recline position which was difficult to find at the time. I'm constantly stepping on the brakes as I walk--sometimes in the middle of the street as the light is about to change. It happens rather frequently and is a nuisance to have to slow my pace an correct the problem.<br /><br />For what it's worth it serves its purpose. It's not an $800 stroller.<br /><br />I'm slightly disappointed in uppababy for the several faults it has but am sure this is just a template for what's to come.<br /><br />Ps. The rain guard sucks for this. It does not protect belongings in the basket.
B00HXDVNW6|5|Still giving it a 5 star review because I contacted the company to see why it wasn't fitting my glass bottles and they are sending me 2 plastic ones to pump into. Kind of defeats the purpose of glass, but as my son gets older I may need it (when he starts throwing things). They did right by me.
B00FNJ7FRO|2|-It could have gotten 5 stars if the vibrating thing on the side didnt go off by itself. & the light is to lose. But other than that my baby sleeps in it since a newborn now shes 2 weeks old.
B0029DPGFK|4|Velcro is a low quality, laundry tabs don't work in the wash, always come undone. Also they fit super weird on my sons bum he looks really funny wearing this but the the absorbency is good
B00005YYE4|4|I had gotten 2 different nursing pillows when I was pregnant with my first daughter. The Boppy (about $20) and the My Breast Friend (about $35). The Boppy was awesome for my first daughter and the My Breast Friend one did not work out. Funny, how the second kid/time around, it was the EXACT opposite. The one thing I didn't like about the Boppy was the cover was not removable and the whole thing would have to be thrown in the washer. Mine got small holes in it from one washing even using the Delicate cycle! It was near the end of nursing my first daughter so I couldn't complain (I nursed for 18 months) but had I had to wash it earlier and it still turned out like that from the wash, I would have been very disappointed. The Boppy people came out with covers you can buy, but I thought they were pretty pricey. In comparison, the My Breast Friend nursing pillow has a removable cover, and the cover also has pockets to put things in (i.e. a pacifier, baby bottle, tv remote, etc.). It also has a wrap around feature that provided me with great lower back support. With the Boppy, I'd have to put a small pillow underneath it to hold the baby up high enough and a pillow behind my back for support. If you don't go with the Boppy or the My Breast Friend, I would definitely get a nursing pillow of some kind.
B0006HBS1M|5|Great product, does the job very well. I was worried about had getting tired while pumping but it is not as hard. Super light and great to throw into the purse with you if you are away from the little one for a few feedings.Fast shipping.
B000S8O9ME|2|It would not stick on my shower wall which is tile.
B00K6ZQWKQ|5|excelent like always!
B004E9SW7G|3|I got this pump because it was less expensive than the Medela. The buttons are misleading on the base - makes it look like it has infinite suction/speed settings when it does not. The goal of pumping (besides getting milk out :P ) is to mimic what your baby does naturally to get a let-down. Unless your baby nurses where you can't feel it at all (which is no one I know), or is a toothed barracuda, finding that &#34;happy medium&#34; of suction/speed was a challenge, if not impossible, with this pump. I like how the tubes never get wet and therefore don't have to be cleaned - cleaning is fairly simple.
B000M48DTO|5|I bought this when my baby turned 5 months old. He is learning to hold his bottle and this chicken helps. It is so cute. He loves playing with the chicken too. It is great for long car trips when I can't hold his bottle or when I am cooking dinner and he needs his bottle.
B001I463G2|5|I love this crib.  We bought our Joovy room2 over 4 years ago and have been thrilled with it since the day we received it.  We tried some sort of \\"industrial strength crib\\" just before, but had to return it as it was disappointing.  This Joovy looks as good today (3 daughters later) as it did the day we bought it.  My 5 year old will climb in it sometimes to retrieve toys, and causes no damage whatsoever.  It's large, comfortable, bright, and cheerful to have around (unlike my dark Graco Pack N' Play.)  I called customer service this week with a random problem with my crib sheet and they were amazingly helpful (and they knew it was 5 years old!) So much more room in this than other cribs.  Terrific crib, you won't be disappointed!
B000LBETOQ|4|I like the weight of this alot and I think I did a really great job chosing this stroller.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because the baskets underneath are not functional.  I never use it.  And when I do manage to stick things in it, I always end up either having a hard time pulling it back out.  The other thing is the peek window on top of the shade.  You can open it up to peek in at your littles, but I wish it had a velcro to keep it open.  I find myself constantly ripping it open, and it gets old after a while.  The biggest peeve that I had with this is the brake on this stroller.  It is a foot brake so to lock it, you just step on it, but to unlock, you have to kick it up with your foot.  Well, if you are wearing nice shoes, or sandals or thongs, you can either say goodbye to those nice shoes, or to your toes, or your toenails because it hurts!!  I always have to bend down and unlock it with my hand.  I wish they thought to make it a hand brake instead...   <br /> <br />On the positive note- <br />This is SOOOOOO light!!  They are each 20#s now, but I barely feel the added weight of this stroller.  I don't feel like I am carting a barrel around.   <br />Folds up really easy and stands on its own and toteable.  I can just fold it  up and dump it in the back of the van in 2 seconds flat.  ok, so I have gotten overzealous a few times and folded the whole thing up right onto the ground a few times, but that was just me being stupid. It is THAT easy- no real struggle... or you will end up throwing it to the ground like me.  (But you Do need both hands to release the lever). <br /> <br />It also fits through all doors.  I have yet to come across one that it does not go through.  I think it meets the accessible standards or something.  The only time I have trouble with it is when I am at a store and they stack things in the aisles.  I either have to move it out of the way, or go around the other aisles to get past it.  But that it not the stroller's fault.
B008BRQ24W|5|Came as shown fits great!!! It is soft and durable my daughter loved this blanket very much!! Price was great to!!
B00BEVF1XU|5|We love Britax and my son outgrew his Convertible seat. This is a great option for ages 4 and up. Lots of growing room and more roomy than his old seat! Would buy this product again. So easy to assemble and install!
B00CLAZLN8|5|In my opinion this product is of good quality and size and I am very pleased with it.<br />It arrived promptly with good packaging; It is light and easy to carry and above all waterproof as stated. It will get a lot of use through the summer.
B005OI8OCE|5|These have held up well.  My 22 mo olds still plays with it and chews on it.  Easy to wash and even wear as a bracelet when  baby is really teething.  Love the colors.
B00ENUQP2A|5|Best idea ever! Very convenient to keep toys close by. I have used them on strollers, highchair, carseat, the list goes on... I buy them for all expecting parents around me.
B000ROMFCU|1|Specifications did not list the measurements of the sheet only the measurements of the packaging. The sheet did not fit my play yard, so the purchase was a waste. I will end up donating the sheet to the local womens shelter. For further reference, the sheet measures 20x30 inches and no depth measurement (totally flat fit). It does not have any elastic to help it fit. The play yard mat would need to be in a folded position to start it into the envelope type sheet. I think the fabric would be fine after a wash but I am donating it so cannot accurately state if it will.
B00BEVF2NY|5|Yes, this is it! This is the best toddler seat out there!! I have a Graco Nautilus - which I also like - but this one is by far a better choice because of the crotch strap. While the grace wins extra points for being able to take it apart as your child grows, using the crotch strap is not easy. This is super easy to install, there is a lot more room inside the seat and it VERY comfortable for kids! My daughter who is 4 simply LOVES it!!
B004GXA6RY|5|After reading TNPHINFAN'S review, I almost passed on this wonderful highchair... Boy, am I glad I listened to the other reviews and went ahead and purchased it!! With last minute Thanksgiving plans (at our home), I needed a highchair for my 5 month old quickly! I checked out our local \\"Babies R Us\\" and \\"Target\\" but had no luck finding one that I really liked. I had my eye on this particular chair on AMAZON for about a week and really liked the modern look and price. Like TNPHINFAN, I don't mind spending the extra $$ to make sure my little one is comfortable but did want to stay within our $175.00 budget. Amazon had this highchair delivered to us within 2 days and It was all positive from the moment we opened the box..  Here are some of the things I really liked about the Evenflo Right Height:  (1)Assembly was a snap! Took my husband all but 15 minutes to put together.  (2)The ease of adjusting the seat up or down took no effort at all with all parts sliding very smoothly.  (3)The backrest with the back reclining option was a huge plus for my younger baby and was very easy to use. Many of the highchairs in this price range did not have this option.  (4)Asthetically beautiful, due to its modern look/design. The internet   pictures do no justice for this highchair!! Not to mention it's reasonable price! Without a doubt, I would have paid more money if I saw this chair  the store.  (5)The fabric cover of the seat and plastic tray easily come off to make cleaning a breeze!     Here's what I thought could be better but deffinately were NOT deal breakers for me:  (1)The chair was a bit bigger than what I had expected, but the option to fold it flat was deffinately a plus.  (2)The seat could use a TINY bit more cushion, but I tend to put a folded blanket under the seat of her gadgets anyway.. Never the less, this chair is far from feeling hard or uncomfortable without that extra padding.  **Overall, We are extremly happy with this highchair and would have paid alot more $$$for it!** Please don't let the reasonable price tag of this high chair deter you from purchasing it! My only regret was not buying it sooner! In my opinion, you will not be disappointed!!!
B00803AQIU|5|great!
B0007CS4EU|5|These are fantastic. The molds are study and do not stain (i've done carrots, dark cherries, and plums to name a few). Frozen cubes easily pop out with a little warm water running over the back.
B004DFO57M|5|Love the baby nail scissors. Easy to trim my little one's nails with and no risk hurting her. Easy to do when she is sleeping and not impossible to do when she is awake!
B0011BK598|4|This is a very nice dresser.  The price was a little high but once I put it together I was happy I purchased it.  Positives---great look and finish.  Negatives- the instuctions had only a few pics to follow and it really wasn't easy to put it together.  It took the help of my father in law and took us about 4 hours.  We spent most of our time trying to figure out how everything was suppose to be placed.  Overall ...I am happy with it.  4 stars because of the minimal instructions.  They could  have included more pics and text.
B009XFDBEU|5|Soft, cute, and a hit with my four year old. That's all that matters. :)
B00821FLT4|5|We have had this in the nursery for 5 months and have found it does exactly what it was designed to do, keep the stinky diapers stink in the pail.  I really like the fact that I can put any old trash bag in and not have to order silly refill bags. The amount of $$ is saves is so worth the little extra at the beginning.  The only downside I have found to date is when removing a full bag from the pail you need to be careful that the bag does not get caught on the plastic tabs that are part of the seal.  If it gets caught it can tear the bag.  To avoid this I usually put a hand on the said of the bag so it doesn't get caught, a minor adjustment by the manufacturer to round the edges of these clips would be great.  Based on the other solutions out there and how well this one works in comparison with no long term investment I give this the full 5 stars
B002RNQKV6|1|3 of 4   sucktion does not work, it does not stay   I send it back  bad product  Amazon should not sale like this product...!
B00MHIJPOU|1|Waited forever for this to arrive! Was not impressed when it finally came! Was damaged and not smooth! I do not recommend this to anyone!!!
B00GKF71Y2|4|Good !
B002U41OKE|4|So, I had a hard time deciding between this and the regular Sit N Stand. I went with this for a few reasons, thought the tray didn't need to be adjusted to fold, liked the color combo and thought the step was a bit larger and that perhaps the step wheels were a decent idea. I bought this stroller mainly for Disneyland trips since we live close by. We currently have a 2-1/2 year old and a 7 month old. I will give my pros and cons -     Pros:  Folds easily, one handed  Can see baby easily as opposed to an umbrella stroller that convers him completely  Seems to be pretty well built  My extremely active toddler LOVES it and sits on his bench about 80-90% of the time vs. when we brought a regular stroller to Disney he walked the majority of the time.  Basket is large and can be easily accessed on the sides  Lots of cup holders    Cons:  Step with wheels is really noisy! Sounds like you are pushing a shopping cart and is really annoying. This alone would have gotten me to buy the regular version had I been able to compare them in person.  The wheels do need to be straighted out to fold it - no big deal.  The tray needs to be adjusted down before folding - not such a big deal but I always have the baby in my arms or in the Bjorn and it's one extra step I could do without.  The shade does not come down far enough to keep the sun out of baby's face - this is a big con to me but maybe I can get one of those adapters  It's long but that's the breaks with a double. I had a side by side Maclaren and this works out so much better!  It's heavy too but there again, it's a double!    Overall, this is a great stroller and works great for trips to an amusement park, zoo, etc. I shouldn't have to mention this but many people seem to give it negative remarks for not allowing the rider in back to sleep, to that I say - Duh! This is not for people who have stroller sleepers. The front seat does recline but only about half way. This works fine for us. Neither of my kids are stroller sleepers nor was this ever intended to be used as such.
B00HX43K94|5|Absolutely gorgeous!  I even had to remove it a few times and begin again because I wanted it positioned differently and had no problem doing so (but take your time if you need to do that).  The vinyl is nice and thick - definitely quality.  It looks so nice in our preschool room.  Our walls are standard 8 feet and it is just about 8 feet tall.
B0071DOTGK|3|This bag is gorgeous to look at – I love the colorful print.  The inside is nicely lined and fits everything I need. However I do have some issues with the bag that ultimately led to me replacing it.  It is very heavy, even when empty.  This makes it challenging to carry around when loaded with baby essentials.  I am constantly trying to shove it under the stroller so I don’t have to carry it (where it doesn't really fit because it’s an odd size).  The bag has two strap options – a shoulder strap or a backpack strap.  Unfortunately, neither is removable, so you're left with tucking the extra set into the bag or letting it dangle.  Carrying around an extra set of straps all the time definitely doesn't help the weight issue.  After a year of light use the material on the bag has held up well, but the straps have pilling on them.  I expected more based on the reviews and price.  I don’t think I’d buy another bag by this maker.
B003XMWF28|5|Adorable set I purchased for my granddaughter.  She loves it.
B00A3F3RN4|4|It definitely helps, no question about it. It takes little time to get used to the comfort of the pillow.
B004DC9TEY|5|After having it for a while it's a great stroller. I just wish I'd gotten the one wish the swivel wheel. We use it mostly as a jogging stroller but when we do ANYTHING else with it I hate it. I have to lift the wheel to move two inches to the side. It's the same with jogging. I don't enjoy the triceps workout when I want to go to the doctors office.
B005UV0UEA|5|Perfect size and works great. Amazing price and could not ask for anything more
B00834D5PC|5|This was a perfect choice after a frustrating search. We have a small car (Subaru Impreza<br />2013) and were having trouble finding anything that fit. I was staying away from Britax because in my mind they were overpriced and it was just because they were trendy. This seat is much less Expensive than te other britax model and I love te details, from the Velcro to hold te straps in place while you out te baby in the seat, to te pad over the bottom buckle to protect te baby's crotch, to the the super padded shoulder straps. Most importantly, it fits securely and it is very very sturdy. We're very pleased. The ONLY downside is that it is kind I difficult to pull the straps tight. Overall it was an excellent choice for us.
B001V67RM6|5|Great item
B000056C86|5|I purchased this playpen after my sister recommended it. The pros: it is spacious (at 38\\" x 38\\" it is larger than the average pack and play), it is sturdy, it is easy to set up and take down (I did need some help the first time to make sure I was pressing the right buttons to collapse it, but I'm glad they are there to make it more sturdy), and it packs up to a convenient size for travel. I love that it has a handle, and the noisemakers inside are a nice addition...except for when they distract baby at naptime!
B001IYB2HW|5|I got this a few days ago and I am loving it!<br /><br />I spent so much time looking for sit and stand stroller and I debated whether to purchase Caboose ultralight or not..I bought this product Open Box for about 95 dollars and I don't regret it.  With my older one already passed four years of age and judging from her height/weight, we will probably have less than three years of use, I just couldn't justify to purchase Ultralight for $229...I would have purchased Ultralight or Ultralight Too if I had found this before my older daughter was born.  I totally recommend this product to parents with their kids already kind of outgrowing this kind of stroller and do not wish to make an investment on expensive stroller.  It is totally worth it. Enjoy your walks :)
B006BHSAB2|5|My daughter loves her wubanub! So easy to find in the crib in the middle of the night.
B00E8Y9MZS|5|Absolutely adorable! My nephew loved this backpack. It's the perfect size for a toddler and is made just like big kid backpacks.
B00B8CT4G0|5|Made a diaper cake and this cute bear topped it. It was so soft and fit the theme perfect.
B0073GJEY2|5|Love it!  I was interested in purchasing a Taggies toy and this one is even cuter in person.  It's also a good size - definitely larger than a Beanie Baby.
B00893JQ14|5|Worked great!  The seller was even faster than prime!
B002C01ND4|3|Caps, are nice<br /><br />I find myself waking up in the middle of the night and grabbing my wide mouth nalgene bottle.<br />when I attempt to re-hydrate myself I end up spilling all over myself so I got this cap, and it is radical to say the least.<br /><br />Sometimes when I take it out to fill it up it falls in, which could be a metaphor about my life... I will let you be the judge.
B00N1YQ88U|5|I absolutely adore Violet! The interaction between child and toy is a huge reason why I am a fan of the LeapFrog company. Violet can be programmed with the child's name as well as several other favorites. The songs and games that she does are very sweet. I can't wait to see how helpful the lullabies are. Thankfully, there are quite a few available to pick from. I may invest in the Scout version of this toy as well!
B00CD9JFIE|5|Fits great and so comfortable for my little guy! Thank you!
B004201GHK|5|This is a nice small size so I can stick a Sophie in my purse.  It's also a lot easier for my 4-month-old to grip and hold on to.  He is wanting to stick everything in his mouth but can't really navigate the full-sized Sophie as well yet, although he loves that one, too.  As the previous reviewer noted, the non-squeaking is good because of the dog.  Also good for a dog-owner:  the rubber doesn't attract dog hair the way the silicone teething rings do.  Good addition to the Vulli Sophie line.
B008R6KFBI|5|This is simply adorable! Bright colors and the little musical flower is cute too! I bought one for a friends baby shower and she loved it too! Sturdy and easy to clean material that is a good enough cushion for baby to lay on when on the floor. I totally recommend this &#60;3
B00JXN54DI|5|Hands down the best baby item I bought.  I love the convenience of it sliding half way into my bed, the 360 degree swivel so at any time my infant is facing me, the safety of the mesh sides, and the music and night light features.  My only complaint is that my baby will grow out of it sooner than I would like.  I wish they made a bigger version, I would buy that next.  My one suggestion to Halo would be to make the buttons glow in the dark and maybe make them slightly easier to push....but sincerely this is a fantastic product that exceeds every safety regulation.  Super happy with this purchase.  I would have been happy paying twice the price.
B002H9WR26|5|I haven't used this yet, for baby, yet. Since I am not due until April.<br />But, I have plenty of experience with diaper bags, since I have already had 3 kids that grew out of the diaper bag stage.<br />Starting over with number 4, I knew what I wanted in a diaper bag. This bag is a little bigger than I thought, but not too oversized, that it will be inconvenient.<br />I got this at a super bargain price of, $27.00. That makes me even happier. I actually had my eye on a different color, but couldn't pass up the bargain.<br />It's not as orange as the picture shows, which it am happy about.<br />The outside pocket is a large open pouch, and will mainly be used for quick grab items, like my keys and a burp cloth.<br />The interior is split in 2. Each has lots of pockets, in a variety.<br /> One side has 2 pockets sized for bottles(if you use them, which I don't) or cups, a mesh zipper pouch to small sized lotion/powder/diaper cream/baby Tylenol. The zipper pocket<br />The other section has dividers for packing diapers, wipes, blankets, or an extra outfit. There's are a couple of pouch pockets, and another zipper pocket on this side.<br />It even came with a changing pad.<br />Overall I am very happy!<br />I even think the bag will provide space for a few items my older kids(6, 8 & 11 yr. olds) always ask me to hold: DSi, iPods, Lip balm, mints, hair brush, etc.
B005EGXHU0|3|Fits my mini-crib mattress perfectly. Fabric was very tough when received but has softened with a few washes.<br />Color choices are hit-or-miss.
B009YDCN8G|2|It doesn't fit very well on any high chairs in restaurants. It may be better on shopping carts, but I don't need it for that, so it was a bit disappointing.
B0031E1GEG|1|I was hoping to get a great sippy straw cup and chose this one based on an article I read. My son does not like it at all. It is not a good transition sippy straw for us. I will keep looking for one.
B0006B4BVW|5|My husband and I used this in the hospital from the very start. It was absolutely wonderful. The baby slept so soundly. We were unable to wrap our son like the nurses do in those blankets, so we used the swaddle instead. The nurses were even going on and on about how nice it was. The fleece material makes the baby very cozy for the cool hospital environment.  <br /> <br />We continued to use it at home every night. My son is just over 5 months and is just now outgrowing it to the point where he can \\"escape\\" it after a short time. I now give this gift to all my friends having babies. My mom gives it as a gift as well. We all witnessed how great it worked. My son was able to wear the small the whole time because he is fairly thin weighing only 15 lbs as of 22 weeks. There is a big jump between the small and the large. The large still swallows him whole like the small did him as a newborn. You must have this swaddle. It creates a peaceful sleeping baby! It also prevents the baby from rolling over when you prefer them to sleep on their back.  <br /> <br />
B0081C9UOQ|5|CUTE CUTE CUTE!!!! Works as expected. Opening nice and soft but keeps snacks inside. There's Youtube videos out there if your really interested about it.
B0098RE4H6|4|It's great looking and I know my daughter isn't putting anything toxic in her mouth.  I just wish they cost less so I could get a bunch more colors and styles to compliment my wardrobe. :)
B00HOX5ZWO|4|Small kit; but served it's purpose with same day shipping!
B002QYW8LW|5|My grandson loved this
B0018JWAF0|2|Baby is still gaseous.  There is no noticeable different between the other baby bottles we have been using. Been using the bottles for about a month.
B00M2UF0DS|5|These are really nice -- wish they were around when I had my kiddos! I just received my order and will be giving this as a gift. I used to use ice trays and it was such a pain! These cups are bigger, the  lid keeps the food fresh, and the material feels like it will release a heck of a lot easier!
B000324Y7U|2|my active baby love lights n sounds this one is just not exciting enough for her, but its too loud for naptime so she just glares at it for 5 minutes then fusses <br />i wish i had bought the kick n play
B0035JL92Q|5|Again, a bit mislead by reviewers who said this ran big.<br />this is a bit snug for my now 20 month old boys. works well though.
B000P007FI|5|I purchased this gate to keep the dog from creeping downstairs and scratching endlessly on my door in the mother-daughter house I share with my daughter. I love my grand-dog but when we were both at work she would scratch at my door trying to get into see \\"grandma\\" and she pretty much destroyed the wood on my doorjamb. SO, before I got the doorjamb replaced, I needed a top of the stairs gate to deter her from doing it again! This gate, along with the installation kit to fit it onto the wrought iron railing, did the trick! It was easy to install and a breeze to operate and has made my life much more pleasant! Thank you.
B00G0KPM48|3|the only problem i have faced is that i have ordered a yellow bathrobe for my baby girl but i received a blue one.
B000I2MRMY|4|We've only had the toy a couple of days and I don't know who likes it more - me or my 4 month old.  He can't squeeze the tentacles yet.  The are pretty hard, and even make my hand hurt after awhile.  But, my son has a huge smile on his face while I play.  I didn't buy it for him myself because I thought it was too big.  But, he doesn't seem to mind.  Only comes with two songs.  I'm musical, so that's not a problem.  But my sister-in-law has asked me to write a little songbook for her for her son and his Octotunes.
B005JKI2S8|5|These are absolutely wonderful and I love that I can move them from teether toy, to pacifier, to a toy. The cloth hoop, instead of a clip, makes the options endless. Also like that the main part is rubber... makes it very easy to clean, and my baby actually enjoys chewing on that part as well.
B002D3XEKA|5|I dressed my son up in this for halloween.  Everyone loved the costume and wanted to know where I got it from.  My son is 13.5 pounds and it fit him perfectly!  I am a Dr, so I put on my green scrubs and we had pictures taken.  Everyone loved it!! The outfit is of good quality, easy on/off.  The only criticism I have it the booties would not stay on his feet for more than a few seconds.
B003D3O8C2|5|These are so soft and my 9 month old loves to put his head on these when he goes to sleep. Highly recommend!
B00JWBTU7M|5|works well in the crib, love it!
B003VM8S6W|5|very cute!
B001NAAQPU|3|The picture is very misleading because it makes you think that a DIAPER FASTENER is included and IT IS NOT. So make sure to purchase a package of those also :/
B00G34TJRC|5|This is a great carseat!  My daughter looks very comfortable in it. She is still rear facing at 15 months, 22lbs. And 31 inches. There is still plenty of leg room and I can say that she will be able to rear face for longer than the recommended 2 yrs! She still has plenty of leg room. It is very sturdy and heavy and I feel safe putting my child in it. Britax is the best!
B00JX0Q9EY|5|Love all the pockets.
B004K1CELI|1|The dresser was rendered useless when we tried to put it together and was short 3 pieces that help hold the drawers in place. What a disappointment!
B00913DCO8|4|LOVE THESE and GREAT VALUE
B007E2E706|5|Works amazing for stripping cloth diapers!
B003Y5U4D6|4|An important thing to remember is to read the description of the item and know it's not a teething necklace for them to chew. It's a teething necklace with some science behind it.<br /><br />The product itself is very well crafted and sized perfectly for baby. Not long enough at all to get twisted or tangled, not small enough to be concerned about comfort. He pretty much ignores it, too.<br /><br />The effectiveness of the necklace still to be determined. The first week was amazing! He was a different baby entirely. Needed no teething medication whatsoever. We typically use Hyland's tablets & teething gel & if its still bad, a dose of ibuprofen.<br /><br />It's probably been almost a month & the effectiveness seems to be wearing off or not strong enough for night use? If amber warms & emits the succinic acid as claimed, it would make sense that after a time the effectiveness would decline. I have taken it off a few times to test & he seems more restless & cranky about going to sleep. Once back on, is fast asleep in less than 20 min. He also drools a lot less.<br /><br />Works or not, is inexpensive enough to give it a try and if it doesn't seem to work for you, it's still very adorable necklace on baby or can be twisted 2x as a bracelet for parent. And if all else fails, take it off and let baby chew on it.
B003AJHDQW|5|I use these folded inside of my diaper cover and it is perfect.  It's not to thick but lots of layers so it hold a lot. Great for nap time with a fleece liner to keep baby dry. It is also the perfect size for my daughter. I have a econobum system and she is too big for the short fold and to small for the long so these have been great substitutes till she gets a little bigger. Plus great for stuffing inside my pocket diapers with a doubler at night...no leaks and the doubler helps keep baby dry.
B00OVJHQR6|5|This bag keeps our little one toasty warm on cold nights. The size medium is much longer than the small, but fits well in the armpits. It fits our kiddo well after she got too big for the size small.
B00ED2EHBE|5|Perfect!
B004DFO57M|5|You will not regret getting this!! Read all the other reviews! They convinced me to get it and I'm so glad I did! Lifesaver!!!!<br /><br />I've heard of too many horror stories of parents accidentally cutting a piece of their baby's skin but not with this! I tell everyone with a baby about this!
B002DQQWXI|5|The \\"Snack Trap\\" is a good alternative for a young toddler, but this is a GREAT alternative for an older one.  It keeps the snack clean and secure.
B000J4FJIA|3|I like to think I'm pretty darn handy, I'm a DIYer and have done many home renovations and built plenty of furniture. This piece was one of the worst I've seen when it came to instructions and quality of parts. It took me approximately 5 hours to put the thing together. There was a section of the instructions that were just plain wrong, and if I didn't have the sense to question it the feet of the dresser would have been installed INSIDE where the drawers go. The pieces alone weren't great quality, two pieces (interior support pieces) arrived broken but I was able to use wood glue and clamps to repair.<br /><br />However, when it was all said and done and everything was put together, it looks great and feels solid. It looks great in the nursery and I think will hold up to the test of time, just be forewarned about the instructions and frustrations of putting it together!
B0075T2EOO|5|We bought one of these for our boy, It's light weight and a good fit, and I'm sure it's stopped some of the bumps they usually get around the home. It helped us most when he first started to walk, would recommend it.
B00014PLAO|1|Didn't stick horrible product
B00D4LFDYA|5|Best diaper bag ever!!!
B005LVMF5G|2|Didn't work! Too big, it's HUGE!!!!
B00A646M66|5|This was a gift, but I was told that it worked perfectly
B008BGNTJ4|5|We bought this for my son to double as a walker and as a mini back up high chair. It's pretty big so not ideal for tight spaces, but big size makes for a huge tray for meals and/or truck play! Put it in the kitchen and he can really move. Put it on the carpet and he's pretty stationary & he can have lunch on his tray (which is removeable for washing). Also, colapses flat so we were able to throw it in the trunk and take it to Grandma's where we don't have a high chair! Delivery was super quick, no complaints in that area!
B0078R6JSK|5|After a lot of research I had decided on the diaper bag I wanted but it was pretty pricey. There were still plenty of things that I needed to buy after the baby shower with the diaper bag being one of them and I decided to look for a less expensive alternative. I came across the Vera Bradley Make a Change bag and decided to try it even though there weren't a whole lot of reviews on it. After using it for three months with the baby, I absolutely love it. The inside has plenty of pockets and opens wide so that I can see everything at a glance and a lot of the time, I don't even have to look to be able to grab what I need (as long as my husband put it back in the right spot). There's enough room inside for all the baby stuff plus the stuff that I would normally carry in my purse. Inside of the bag wipes down easily and l use the outer bottle pockets all the time. I love the changing pad that unfolds from the side as it makes diaper changes on those restroom changing tables much less worrisome. A friend of mine, also pregnant, was with me when I bought the bag. A couple weeks later she went back and bought one for herself and now that she has her baby, she loves it just as much as I do. Overall, great design and concept. If I could change anything it would be to make the straps adjustable and the changing pad a little thicker.
B0077L3QDI|5|I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter.  Right now she's  only 6  months old but I was able to adjust it to fit her wrist. Seems like it will adjust to fit her for at least a few years as long as it's taken care of and used on special occasions only. It is a beautiful bracelet with a beautiful sentiment to share with a beautiful child.
B000XT30G4|4|Easy to put together and looks really nice in the doorway. Keeps our escape artist of a dog contained too!
B00L3UKTAW|5|Kind of a project to put together but great looking furniture for the price point. I would recommend this furniture with no reservations.
B0070WGV9K|3|Works well, but not on our particular bed. We have a crib that was converted to a toddler bed, and it frequently gets in the way when not in the up position. In addition, it does not strap on as well as it would to a regular bed.
B00H4RF6X8|5|Such a great investment
B005MPASEG|1|My baby hated it. The neck part it too tight and it was causing a neck rash. Also she was still able to get her hand in her mouth and suck it through the cloth.
B00SCG4PFA|5|I really like these wipes. The material is so much softer and absorbent than others I've tried. That, in addition to being free of harmful chemicals and additives, etc., makes these great for daily use on sensitive skin.
B000067EH7|5|I had preemie twins that were both under 5 lbs when I got them home from the hospital. I was very nervous about bathing them, but the sling feature of this tub made it safe and easy. As they grew, I still found this tub to be great. Now they are 25lbs and I have recently moved them into the big tub. My back sure misses using this in the kitchen. <br />
B00D20OBCS|5|This is a must have for twins! In terms of its visual appeal it is very modern and attractive and fits in perfectly with our living room furniture. It is easy to assembly, and has two  cushioned mattress pads and sheet covers.  I love that the is movement front to back and so gentle. My two boys love it!!!
B00LP7V2KY|4|super cute and so far its holding up to my 1st grader. I wish it was a bit bigger because kids have soooo much supplies to stick in their boxes, but it works and my kid loves the robot print
B00PRU225E|5|I own three other WF-502b (UltraFire branded) flashlights as well as this one, now. This one is very similar in appearance to the other ones (generic). It is slightly longer compared to the UltraFires. Although I like the UltraFires, this one has a couple of features that I like better. First, the light seems to be a little brighter. The color temperature looks to be a bit warmer and has a yellow hue to it, where the UltraFires are cooler (almost a white colored light). Second, the tailcap switch only has 3 brightness modes and no strobe or S.O.S. modes. The last two I don't really need.<br />The flashlight arrived in a sealed box, came with printed instructions and an extra 'O' ring. I do like my UltraFires a lot, but I think I like the ThorFire just a little bit better. It seems to be a very good quality product and works well.
B002SW3EZQ|5|We take a pair of these ear muffs with us when we take our son to things like fireworks or large parties etc.  My son has oversensitive hearing and in loud situations he will first put his hands over his ears, then if it doesn't stop he will start to fidget and do disrupting things without listening.  When he is overwhelmed with sound his body seems to go on auto pilot and his ability to reason is completely compromised.  It takes a long time to calm him down after he has become overwhelmed.  When things get loud he will actually ask for his muffs now.  He is 5 and these muffs seem to fit him well and he never complains of them being uncomfortable like he does with a different brand my parent's bought for him when he is with them so usually they just request I send this with him.  My niece is always in plays and is in the band so my parent's take my son to all kinds of very noisy shows which he enjoys and behaves at as long as he has his muffs to muffle the sound.
B002W21UAI|5|I was thrilled to be ordering a toy made in the USA. That is a rare find for sure. Its beautiful wood and incredibly soft to the touch. My older kids ( 10 and 12 ) have enjoyed showing their baby sister how to stack the sections. And the baby loves chewing on the wood sections. Which won't splinter, naturally.
B00FYOENMI|5|Cute cute cute designs
B002G9UTNQ|1|Items fabric is not properly stretched in the pink color. I own one of these hampers in brown for my son and his is perfect. I would not recommend anyone to order the pink as quality control is obviously poor.
B004JA1XB2|5|This item should be a prerequisite of every parent of a newborn. Very Very simple to use and 100% effective.  Baby does not mind at all and makes using it a pleasant experience. Use it for grandchild and only wish it had been available for my children!  Excellent product that does  what it's supposed to.
B0043D28B4|5|I have only had this for a few days but it's already been a hit with my four-month old. She loves the crunching sound the different pages make and she loves looking at the pages. It's well made and seems really durable--great since she's also into putting it into her mouth. I'm really happy to have found a book with which I can engage her and I would highly recommend it to others. Once she's a little older, I think it'll be a great supplement to playing peek-a-boo too.
B00171WXII|5|Seems so gross but works wonders! We love this!
B00O197EAK|5|this is the best purchase i have made for nursing and pumping!
B002BIBR9M|5|I purchased this crib for my daughter's new baby; the crib is very well made, no flaws that I could see, nicely finished. Son-in-law says it was easy to put together also, but do it in the nursery, as it is big enough to not manage some doorways.    Would recommend it to others needing a crib.  Well priced also.
B00WG9MX0S|4|Very lovely purse, arrived on time
B003E6OBMA|5|I love the swaddle blankes, that was how I got both of my children's to get to sleep when they were newborns.  Now my oldest still sleeps in the sleep sacks..blankets can cause babies to smother if they put it over their face.
B0048JJX9S|5|I love this product, i have everything i need to feed my baby from this maker, and I'm truly recommend this product, i breastfeed and formula feed my baby since he was born , he never have suffered any colic or other problem related to feeding, he is today 5 month old .[...]
B00003TL7P|5|I chose the Diaper Champ over the DIFFICULT to use Diper Genie!<BR>Diaper Champ is easy to use.  One handed disposal, no need to purchase \\"special\\" bags or deordorants.  The smell refered to by others is really no worse than when you change a full diaper. It is the safest pail I've seen.  NO RISK OF DROWNING HERE!  The latch is \\"childproof\\" so it takes a little practice but its well worth it
B0006GUY18|5|Unfortunately for my kid, the dog likes this too. So far she's only chewed up one block, leaving a decent amount of blocks for the kid to still learn her ABC's and 123's. Hopefully, the kid will learn these before the dog gets to the rest of the alphabet!<br /><br />Truly, this is a great toy. My daughter loves pulling the wagon along and tossing blocks everywhere, like she's digging in minecraft.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has hard-soled boots and/or likes watching their kid play happily.
B00LGGJKJE|1|I was in need of a WiFi monitor because our home is spread out and our room is on the opposite side of the house from the baby's room. The camera connects to WiFi, but the monitor does not; it connects to the camera. Consequently, we were unable to use the monitor while sleeping at night because the camera signal was not strong enough to make it across the house to the monitor. If the entire system were wireless as indicated, this would not have been an issue. I tried using the app in place of the monitor, but it times out after 10 minutes (which is how it's designed to function per the manufacturer). I returned this purchase after attempting to use it for two nights. The third-party seller was very difficult to work with. From a delayed shipment to no responses to return/refund emails, their lack of assistance drug the process out for over a month. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service was able to serve as a liaison and resolve the return fiasco. I would not recommend this product or purchasing from this seller. From here on out, I'm sticking with Prime.
B0000645D7|5|I bought this pump because of this price.  I had problems breastfeeding and hoped to pump exclusively.  I bought this one to try pumping because of the price.  I thought if pumping worked, I would invest in a more expensive model such as medela.  After using for a few days, I loved it!  I can express 4 to 6 ounces of milk in 10 minutes or less.   Now I'm able to give my baby breastmilk without the pain of breastfeeding.  I've been using the pump for 2 months now and have had no problems.
B004G7TMS4|5|These are so easy for on the go. Especially for my husband who is a stay at home dad. Just shake and pop a nipple on.
B004X8GJPA|5|I'm glad I bought the big pack! I have extras everywhere I know I'll need them. Even in the bathroom where my extra seat is.
B001DVTDY4|4|Love this snuggler.  Very cute and quality material/workmanship.  Too bad I can't use it often since I live in Hawaii and my baby gets too hot in it.  Of note, the suit I got was LARGE.  Though the tag said 0-3 months, my baby couldn't fit in it properly until she was wearing 6-9mo clothes in other brands.  I had hoped to use it as the \\"take home from hospital\\" outfit but she was lost in this thing (8 lbs 4 oz at birth).  If the sizing was accurate, I would've given this 5 stars.
B00OTVF96G|5|These are absolutely awesome. They are a lot thicker than I thought really easy to clean up and was to put up
B009YY4PBI|5|My son loves his wubbanub! As a mom I love it also no more lost nuks!!! I ordered 2 I have the turtle and the elephant!!!
B004K38FNM|5|We bought this because our newborn was sleeping in our room in his Graco Pack n Play and was not sleeping well (we noticed he slept better in our bed & thought that the hardness of the Graco bassinet might be the cause) - we bought this with an American Baby Company Fitted Pack N Play sheet and it worked WONDERS - not too soft for a newborn but perfect for giving him comfort.  Had no issues with smell as was reported by a few other reviewers. LOVED it and have recommended it to many others.
B00GR4SXRA|4|This is very cute, but it was smaller in person than I was expecting. We had a different one for one of my other kids and it was slightly larger for the baby to get a good grasp on it. Overall this is made very well.
B00BZO1PEA|2|Looks fabulous, obviously -and the large tray is great and easy to clean, but unfortunately that's where the pros end.<br /><br />The chair cover has a rough finish which makes it very hard to wipe clean.  You can throw it in the dishwasher, but the soft material means it always comes out a little pock marked from the wire rack it sits on.  Also, once you take the chair cover off, the base is a nightmare to clean.  It has lots of tight deep ridges that food gets mushed into and it's really hard to get it out.<br /><br />As others have said; the straps are a pain in the butt and cheaply/badly designed.  They are a pest to fasten and once you've finally got them on your now hangry baby, they slide off the shoulders very easily.  They also get covered in food and have to be UNSCREWED from the base with a damn screwdriver to throw them in the wash.  Ridiculous!<br /><br />I always like choosing products that can &#34;grow&#34; with my child and was sold on the fact this can be turned into a kiddie chair later on.  I'm now realizing that by the time that happens it will be so disgusting and ruined by the dishwasher, that a better option will be burning it.  Even if it does make it that far, without the straps, there are holes in the chair cover which will no doubt collect all manner of awfulness in the base and continue to require regular, dis-assembly and cleaning.  Just not worth it.<br /><br />Wish I'd gone with a different chair.
B00N2CT02W|5|So convenient and easy to use.  Great way to ensure your baby eats healthy, homemade food.
B0087OT674|5|I HAVEN'T REALLY OPENED IT  UP BUT AM SURE MY GREAT GRAND SON WILL LOVE IT . AM SURE GLAD YOU HAD IT
B000067K0L|1|This product is poorly made and unsafe.  One of the arches snapped in two after less than six months of use. When I contacted the company for a replacement part they indicated that they were out of the arches and there was nothing they would do without a receipt. I explained to the representative that I received the item as a gift and did not have a receipt.  Still, nothing.  Poor product, poor customer service, not something I would recommend.
B001OC62ZK|5|I bought this mostly for myself. My baby has the foam letters so I was stacking them on the side of the tub every night. Now I can just quickly toss them in this holder along with her other bath toys. It hasn't let me down yet.. it sticks very well and is now rounded up with toys
B007BTOXLA|5|We've dressed our little one in this tux bib in several restaurants and it's a hit!  Also, the quality and workmanship for this bib is one of the best, out of the many different bigs and brands that we have bought.  We highly recommend!
B004L2JWZC|2|We haven't had this chair but for 2 weeks and the ottoman is cracked.  The packaging on this product was beyond aweful.  The box came busted and I was surprised more of the chair wasn't broken when it came.  I am definitely returning it.  Don't like it.  Don't like the way the cushion fits either.
B0057L8UP4|5|My two month old loves it. She loves falling asleep in it.  Money well spent. I would recommend this to all moms.
B005JCPKVI|5|Excellent, very light weight, chick stroller. The car seat is big and not able to fix well in my SUV...the front seat have to be moved forward in order to install the car set.
B00C6CS8R2|4|My sons bed looks great only wish the price was a little more reasonable other than that no complaints
B00CYSB70I|1|This rug's colors are not as vibrant as in photo.
B000I2Q0C2|3|I figured it was worth a try for the price, but my infant wasn't really interested. Every baby is different tho. There isn't anything wrong with this item as far as I can tell. It seems to be made well.
B00000ISE2|5|This is exactly the type of toy I would want to design and play with.  It is a great way to keep kids interest in a classical piece of music and sturdy enough to allow them to play with.  The quality of sound and  construction is excellent as well.  My 4 yr old and my 2 yr old both spend  time playing with it, together and apart.  Ok, so do their Mom and I.  We  all have our favorite combinations.  Highly recomended.
B00OC0TSGQ|5|Always the best brand for waterproof flannel! Too bad they have discontinued many of the sizes!!
B007QC82IW|5|I absolutely love these! Its just like in the picture. Fit perfectly on my little girl.  Bought the M instead of S as another reviewer mentioned they do run small. She is 23&#34; long and about 13 lbs.
B00HBYOE3W|5|We love this bag it is so cute and works great! I was under the impression that it was as large as a typical hamper/laundry basket and it is not, it is smaller.  But it holds quite a few diapers and is adorable.  Thanks!
B001CWBMO8|5|This sheet is very soft and washes well thus far (we've only washed it twice so far but it's still wonderfully soft and smooth).  I also love the color.
B009PQZIIE|5|I bought this for my grandson. I like the fact that you can adjust the size. I saw this one at Babies R Us, this was cheaper. Thank for a great transaction.
B003UXGTC2|2|We had two of the Aden + Anais one layer sleeping bags that lasted our twins for several months.  We have always had a little trouble with the zippers being finicky and difficult to put in place without coming apart, and after about 5 months of constant wear, one of those began deteriorating at the top of the zipper and eventually wore holes on both sides of the zippers.  I figured it was just the amount of use it was getting.  I ordered two of these Cozy bags for the winter after having a fairly decent experience with the others.  Within a week, the zipper has started to separate from the cloth at the top.  It is going to be almost unusable now, which seems unacceptable for a rather expensive item.  I would have expected this to last at least through the winter.  Such a disappointment from a company and concept that I so want to love.
B000YZCFWW|5|Most amazing chair,  I can't see my princess having her meals any other way. Top quality and real value for your money. It's exactly as the pictures.
B00AZWDLHM|5|As a parent in a \\"complex parenting scenario\\", I have limited interaction with my six month old daughter. If she is upset for any significant length of time our weekly play time is cut short. As such, it is very important to have a happy baby girl when we play... Right now she is very painfully teething, and it was very difficult to sooth her enough to be able to spend quality time together. Nothing seemed to work for any period of time. I picked up pair of these pacifiers (They had no pink ones, so she got blue, the Others take your gender stereotypes), and it makes our play time one hundred percent more enjoyable. She will start to fuss, and when given one of these pacifiers she will happily suck for a few seconds before discovering that the outside edges it are a hard enough silicone to soothe her sore gums without being too hard and hurting her mouth, as many other teething toys are for her. She then proceeds to contently chew on the outer rim of what I suppose is the \\"guard\\" portion of the pacifier, until she becomes distracted and begins moving on to other toys. But before long, her gums start to hurt again, and she begins searching for it. Once found it is snatched up and back in her maw being chewed with a ferocity that is rarely seen in Kodiak Grizzly bears. I am extremely happy with this product. I am sure it works well as a traditional pacifier too. . .
B00D4XZO2E|4|This is a nice lightweight stroller that fits easily into our car or truck. Getting around is pretty easy and we take it to shop, parks, strolls with boys. Easy clean and easy packing. There is less storage area than other ones but still pretty decent for short trips.<br />The fabric has frayed at one of the aluminum pole ends but that was after a good year of heavy use. Probably could return and have it fixed or sewed up but overall it is sturdy and useful for the price.
B000FGG8TG|5|Bought this back in 2012 when we were looking to take snacks and drinks out and about and didn't care if they got lost or if they were dropped in dirt we could just toss.  However after using them for the first time, my attitude quickly changed and there was new rule that these are to NEVER be thrown away.  As the product description states, these are both dishwasher and microwave safe and I can confirm those are facts.<br /><br />My Favorite Points:<br />1. Big enough to hold enough, but small enough to be very convenient<br />2. Thin and light, but very strong and excellent quality.<br />3. The lids SNAP into place firmly and there is no question if the bowls or cups are closed<br />4. Even with the firmly snapped into place lids, they are not difficult to remove<br /><br />Here's an embarrassing anecdote.  I left one of these bowls sealed with those Gerber dissolvable wagon wheels for over a year and probably close to two years in the trunk of my car (embarrassing that I don't clean my car often enough).  I found it last month and through multiple seasons, temperatures over 100, and extremely high humidity, I opened it up and those snacks looked just like the day I put them in the bowl.  I obviously cannot speak to how fresh they tasted as they went straight to the trash, but they were still crispy as I broke them in half to see.<br /><br />I see rave reviews about these dating back to 2007.  5 years later when I purchased, still the same quality as reviewed initially.  In todays market place, companies start cutting corners and quality to maximize their profits.  The First Years did not do that and it speaks volumes for the company.<br /><br />Fast forward 2 more years and now we have another one on the way.  We still have multiple cups, bowls and forks/spoons, but have lost some lids, etc so purchasing this again.  For the same price as a formula dispenser, we can get this set and use the small containers for formula.  Then have larger bowls, cups, etc for when the child gets older basically for free.<br /><br />If there are any quality changes from our initial purchase 2 years ago, I will update accordingly.the child gets older basically for free.<br /><br />If there are any quality changes from our initial purchase 2 years ago, I will update accordingly.
B005WPPT54|5|I love this diaper bag. It is super cute and not too bulky. Lots of space and different pockets. Love the straps to attach to a stroller or cart.
B000096OG1|5|The sheets are easy to use and very washable. I just cannot use them with my new Pack 'n Play.
B00DQED5YA|5|The Poopoose is great! It keeps my newborn still during changes and I love how soft it is.
B000GEDOB2|5|I was looking for a gift for my daughter in law's birthday and I saw the comfort wedge. She is expecting her first baby and I knew she was feeling uncomfortable. I had one sent to her, and she loved it! She started using it right away even though she's only a few months along. I would recommend this for anyone who is expecting.
B000CSCHQK|4|I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for.  I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it.  I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up).  However, this advertised as \\"no tip over\\" which is another reason I bought it.  I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere.  Other than that, so far it's good.
B001F0RAB6|1|These liners are an old model with perforated tabs you have to tear off after you twist the ring/nipple part onto the bottle. They leak horribly and do not hold a significant volume. Returning ASAP. Stick to the latest model of the drop-in liners.<br /><br />The product you're probably looking for is here: [[ASIN:B0006FHB9C Playtex Bottle Liners Drop-Ins, 4 Ounce, 100-Count (Packaging may vary)]]
B008BGNT4E|5|I love this walker! It serves as a high chair for us. It's perfect. I feed my baby and I put toys on her tray so she can play and she loves it. It's very easy too clean up too
B0042Y3A98|5|I love the colors and the inserts are sooo soft! I wish I hadn't stocked up on so many pastel BGs. I like these better!
B00EU76CCY|1|Terrible product.. Actually looked great after spending 30 minutes making it perfect. Then the very next day the whole tree was on the floor...  Would not stick at all. Asked for a refund and they offered 50%!!!! Are you serious? For one day?
B002W1K032|5|Baby and I LOVE these sleep sacks!  They're so soft that she cuddles and pets it like a lovie when she's falling asleep and sleeps better with it than any other one we have.  I had to order a lovie from the company for the days when it's too warm to have this on bc she loves the fabric so much.  I've ordered one in each size.  They're cut a little more narrow in the legs than Halo, but they're a little stretchy so she can still kick her legs up and move around etc. with no problem.<br /><br />The design is simple and quality is great - the zipper is well made and it's great that it's a double.  I have never had a problem with these zippers, while I have had trouble with multiple Halo sleep sack zippers and even the GroBag zipper.
B00HAZSHVC|5|Great clip - need to use it more - HA!
B002ZSP72G|5|Easy to assemble and take off when you don't need it. We tried another brand and returned it before using this one- it was impossible to install and then once installed it would tip the stroller over when my son stepped on.<br /> We have a Bob stroller and this works really well for our 3.5 year old. It is easy to walk with when the kid is riding and also easy to put in the storage positions when he doesn't want to ride. Rides pretty smoothly over bumps.
B001GS8F8E|4|I bought this cause right now I live in a small townhouse with my mom. I have a full size crib but there is just not enough room. This is perfect. I can roll it through the door with out having to take it down and put it back up. It's higher than some of the other pack and plays with the bassinet attachment I looked at. I was very happy that the sheets were even less expensive than the regular crib sheets specially since I get the get the free shipping deal. Although the baby is not yet born. I feel after delivery getting him in and out of this will be a bit easier. It can fit along side my bed like the expensive cosleeper I was looking at but about $100 less. The assembly was also very easy and only took me about 5 minutes.
B009SXIM5A|5|Great Wall border, it stays on the wall. A little Bit hard to apply since you need to wet the back to make it pasty for ut to stick on the wAll but overall! it's okay and nice wall border.
B008PODPZK|3|This bag is cute, but I thought it would be larger.
B00MEIXZF8|3|This works great for my baby monitor! I have the monitor in the corner and this little piece of plastic works great; however, the sticky stuff it comes with is a joke.  We had to screw/nail it onto the wall, so that was an unwanted hole in my wall. Once the mounting issue was resolved, it does what it needs to do.
B00AY83U0A|5|I can highly recommend the Fareskind Double O Cozy stroller bag. The sheepskin is wonderfully soft and my son falls asleep in it almost immediately. I particularly like that you can unzip the bag in the middle which makes it easy to let some air in when going into a heated store from the cold. You can also convert it into a small, soft play mat which comes in handy when traveling. It is a pleasure to use, looks fantastic and was definitely worth the investment.<br /><br />But what really made the difference for me was the Fareskind's customer service in New York. I had a small problem with the string that tightens the hood. Fareskind not only exchanged the bag (after the exchange deadline), but - as I was traveling to Europe the same week - dropped off the new bag at my apartment! Thank you Lilly!
B0043C5XYY|3|Better than disposables.  Very large. Velour sticks to wet nipples.
B00FTQINMW|5|Love this wallet. Perfect size. Light weight.<br />Lovely leather.
B0032G9E0G|5|Absolutely love this rack...My baby uses Dr. Brown bottles and this is perfect for all the little parts. We just just introduced her to solid foods, and love this rack for the little spoons, We also use a glass bowl, which fits perfectly. I love drying all her teether and little toys that fall on the floor all the time and need a quick wash.   would definitely recommend it, not only is it convenient it also happens to be very pretty and modern and clean looking.
B000Y1RQ0C|2|I bought this pump bra first and was disappointed.  I researched the sizing extensively and still did not get a bra that fit well.  There is nothing to cover your nipple when you're done pumping so if you want to leave it on for a little bit or for the next pumping, it is very uncomfortable as your nipple rubs against the shirt you put on.  I guess this is uncomfortable because my chest was squished so much by this bra even though I measured multiple times and purchased the right size.  The bottom line is after having a baby your milk supply and body weight will fluctuate.  This bra would be much better if it was adjustable in sizing.  I ended up with the Simple Wishes bra which is adjustable and has a cover over your nipple for when you're not pumping (this way you don't look like a fembot haha).  I am happy with the Simples Wishes bra.
B00BOGX1AU|4|very good
B000O7SR36|4|I used this on my Dream on Me 3&#34; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress and it fits super tight. Other than that, It's very soft and feels smooth.
B004DAIEQA|5|I was trying to ditch plastic, but I couldn't find a stainless steel bottle WITH a sports cap. Klean Kanteen is perfect. Beautiful vibrant color, no funny odors, perfect for kids!
B00JE8EIJS|5|Just the pillow I wanted. Works great and very comfortable. I wish it came in different colors..
B00AKHKTVI|5|Love the viewing capabilities and that I can watch my daughter from anywhere I go. I have spread the word to friends and family about this camera. My motorola baby monitor is no comparison to this. The only problem I had was during set-up, the company was great and had it up and going in less than 2 minutes after telling them my issue.<br />Great product and wonderful support team.
B00PVDG2QM|5|Exactly what we needed! Quick delivery
B002A9IZ0Q|5|I LOVE THIS CRIB! It's beautiful and the color is just what we were looking for! I was a little nervous when the box arrived because it was so beat up, but the crib looks great and is for the most part untouched! There was one small area that was scratched but other then that it was fine! It is very sturdy. It only took my husband and I a little under an hour to assemble. Can't wait to use it within the next few months! :)
B007AKGBU6|4|It is great if you live in an open single story home. The musical aspects of the walker are a real positive.
B00IF1K6Z0|4|happy
B005DOS2EE|5|the decor metal gate exceeds our wildest expectations. It is great. It is more than we expected.
B003KTLYHQ|5|Simply I just couldn't handle my stroller life without this!
B00REHKZ3E|5|Good
B007SI0DNQ|5|This blanket is very soft but smaller than I expected.  It was my fault for not reading the measurements more closely.  Just make sure you check that out before you purchase.  But besides that, it is VERY soft and very cute. I would recommend.
B000V9A2S0|5|Nice and fun in the bath
B00029T4D8|5|I love, love, love this booster! I had a style that strapped to the chair for my preschooler and hated it because it was so hard to clean.  I purchased two of these when my twins grew out of their highchairs and loved them so much I threw away my preschooler's old chair and bought him one of these.  They don't slip, they clean up so nicely, and can easily be removed and stashed away. The only negative is that they're a little low for my two-year-olds, but it's not that bad and they do fine.
B00IR4F3LM|5|our daughter loves this, keeps her busy during car rides.
B0051CSL7Q|4|Small scratch/crack on rail. Otherwise great item. Looks great!
B007NG5UEU|1|Electric power went off for 3 hours. Now the units will not sync. Tried all the suggestions.<br /><br />It doesn't matter that it worked great when it worked.<br /><br />No more V-Tech products for me.
B00440CZPU|5|These are the greatest little storage containers for baby's food. Easy to get the blocks of frozen food out of thanks to the soft bottom, and safe for microwave and dishwasher. Nice size - good for the new little eater, and you just use more than one as they get a little bigger and want more in a sitting. Love that these don't have a bunch of the bad chemicals such as BPA, etc. Highly recommend.
B003VQRJAO|5|Saw these in a local store and had to have them.  Amazons price was the best.  We can't wait for our little girl to be able to play with them (she's 7 weeks old now).  Until then they're cute decorations in her room!
B005HI20HQ|5|Fits perfectly in my graco mini pack and play. Nice added cushioning for baby to sleep on.
B00EVRT5ZO|5|Works better than the 2K medical version.  My wife swears by it and I paid for it so I am more than happy.
B001V9EVCM|5|Good Product
B004OR1DSS|5|This spoon is fabulous! I love the no hassle, no clean up! It is easy to use and she eats in 5 min.  My daughter gets very distracted (especially with her 2 year old sister) and would not focus to eat... I wish I would have found this spoon sooner!! It holds about 5 oz of food and is super soft on her gums! Great purchase.<br />Another bonus is when we are not home and I have to feed her at a family members house or in her stroller... very convenient!
B009JV34RC|4|This is a great little pillow - perfect for my son as he is transitioning into this big boy bed!!
B000C22J2S|5|Greatly recommend for ppl with boys having aiming problems.  My son just stood at it the first time waiting to pee for like 10min.  lol!  Also good for potty training. My younger child has started using it!
B008MU9VAK|4|Ahhhh Amazon or Carter's please get this back in stock! My son can't sleep without his &#34;Elly&#34; and no one has this darn animal in stock. He carries it everywhere and chews on the trunk, she is his partner in crime. And now that she's lost I'm getting sleepless nights &#62;=/
B001EJH1VC|4|I love this frame it looks nice and my wife loves it, the only problem that I found is trying to find a place that produces 3.5 x 5\\" pictures  anymore which the frame holds.
B00018XCS8|5|Very safe and sturdy. No spills at all!
B0009OLSY4|5|Perfect ...just what I needed and what my 7-yr old needs.
B000EX0DFA|5|Purchased this for my granddaughter's 1 year birthday. She loves it! It has lots of sounds and although I am very sound sensitive I do not find it too loud as other reviewers did, perhaps it has been toned down. It has a keyboard and it did not take long for her to make the connection. She loves to honk the horn. She raises the seat and places toys inside. It took a few weeks for her to master getting on and off due to her size. I think this toy will be enjoyed for a very long time.
B00CEJFO24|5|I love the precious moments collection & when I seen the pillow it completed my baby gift to give to my niece.
B001O3OKYO|3|I tend to agree with other reviewers here.  I bought this item assuming it was identical to the blue \\"Classic\\" version, aside from the fact that it uses batteries rather than a cord and has no additional digital readout on the face, as the \\"Classic\\" does, and of course features a sheep rather than a bunny.  Mainly I was assuming that the \\"Product Dimensions\\" as conveyed by Amazon on the details page were correct, but they are not.  Both descriptions claim dimensions of 9 x 2.5 x 7.5 inches, which may be the case for the \\"Classic\\" blue, but in fact, the green \\"Globetrotter\\" is quite a bit smaller.  So, if you're looking for a portable, travel version of the clock, and/or don't want to deal with an electrical cord (and/or prefer the sheep icon to the bunny icon), and don't mind the smaller size, then \\"Globetrotter\\" is your clock.  But if you prefer a larger face that can be read from across the room, and don't mind that it plugs into an outlet, go for the \\"Classic.\\"  I initially bought the \\"Globetrotter,\\" realized it was too small to be read from across the room, returned it, bought the \\"Classic\\" and all is well.  I must credit Amazon's easy return policy for enabling me to do this with no penalty.  As for the clock itself, it does take some training to teach your child that when the bunny is asleep, the child stays in bed, and then the bunny wakes up, the child can get up.  This is easier said than done, but it's not the clock's fault if it doesn't work perfectly!  It's sometimes just tough to teach an excited little kid to stay in bed.  But in terms of a fun ornament for a kid's bedroom with some element of time training and/or sleep training, this clocks does the job.
B000BH79R4|5|This a fun way to reinforce letters. My 19 month old now knows all of his letters and enjoys dumping that in the tub and naming them as he pulls them out.
B00005BTNA|4|Ok, first time Dad here. We went through dozens of nipples to find the right ones.  Spend the extra money and get better nipples.  These are the ones to buy.  Not for the crooked bottle because that is more for show but more for the nipple.  My son has a hard time collapsing these puppies and they seem to allow him more control of the flow. <br />However, be careful a slight misalignment can cause a big spill.  I found that if I wiggled the bottle off to one side or the other just slightly it let him drool the formula all over himself.  So just line it up and you will love them. I put all the other nipples away and bought a dozen more.  Also the smaller versions of these same bottles are just as good. <br />Cheaper nipples have to be constantly adjusted to make sure the baby can eat.  I like these and recommend to all.   <br />
B004GXA6RE|1|I bought these highchairs for my twins based on The reviews for it. these are by far the cheapest things I've ever seen!  It's so old and very plasticy. Everything about them just screams cheap! While unpacking it to assemble it, a piece actually chipped off!   Once we assembled it, we put our son In it and it seemed so unstable and frimsy! It didn't even look sturdy enough to support him and he was only 6 months old!   I would never keep my growing baby in this chair! It seemed very unsafe and just really cheap! Very disappointed!!!  We shipped them back immediately and bought the chicco polly high chair! It is simply the best chair out there!   Who ever is thinking of gettg this evenflo, please save yourself the trouble and don't even bother!! Literally it's a piece of junk!  However, I will say that amazon was amazing about the whole return process! Was fast simple and easy!
B006SFUDT4|5|My son loves playing with this as much as I love hanging up his toys in it.
B009IWNPXK|5|Makes life so much easier! I just ask for a cup of water and thaw out the frozen pouches.
B006MVHCN4|3|This is a good changing pad, just wish it was water proof.
B00318CM8Q|2|With an 18 month old and a 2 month old, we reluctantly retired our Bugaboo and began the search for a double stroller.  After much research we, like so many others, eagerly anticipated the release of the Baby Jogger City Select.  We bought it 3 weeks ago and have since sold it as it just didn't fit our needs.  The stroller is so superior on so many levels that I tried to overlook the flaws as much as I could, but to no avail.      Living in Manhattan, the two deal breakers for me were:    1) as others have mentioned, the stroller is very heavy, esp with 2 kids loaded on.  This made for difficult maneuvering.  To be specific, if I was pushing it on a nearly perfect flat surface, it worked like a dream.  However, anything with even the slightest angle to it caused the stroller to veer sharply to one side which made my arm/wrist very tired trying to keep it straight.  And with most city sidewalks being anything but flat, it was very hard to overlook as I was constantly trying to correct it.  I don't feel like I am a physically weak person, so I was very surprised when neither me nor my husband could easily control the stroller.    2)  Again, due to the weight, or maybe the weight distribution, the stroller is heavy.  So, it was very hard, if not impossible to lift it up over a curb.  Needless to say, going up a couple of steps here and there was a challenge I wasn't able to take on, and thus became very limited to where I could go, what stores I would enter, etc.  I had my husband also try this maneuver as well, and he had great difficutly too.  He had to stand on the lower bar under the seat to lift it off the ground and it was still very hard.  To elaborate, I had my 18 month old in the front seat, and my 2 month old in his car seat closer to me, so I didn't have it set up as the recommended weight distribution, but to be honest, that shouldn't matter.  The company boasts of its 16 configurations, so I believe for the money I paid, that I should be able to actually use all 16 configurations with ease; there shouldn't be an asterisk.  That it can serve as a double as well as accept a car seat was the appeal for us.  But, if doing that costs me the ability to walk around my neighborhood comfortably even if it was $1 it wouldn't be worth it.        3)  A few other less important complaints we had were that the seat height was rather short for my son who is only 18 months.  We did move the canopy up to its highest setting and moved the footrest down to its lowest, but it still wasn't enough.  The footrest is actually more annoying than helpful because it is so short that my son had to bend his knees to set them in there.  I can't imagine this working once he is 2 or 3 years old.  It does fold up well, however as another reader commented, it can't stand on its own so that made the fold rather pointless.  In an NYC apartment, space is everything.      Anyway, I am sorely disappointed as we had high hopes for this stroller.  I can definitely see the draw and while some may be able to overlook its flaws, I was not.  If they fix these things in v.2.0, then I very well may just entertain purchasing this stroller again.  But, until then, we will use our new Phil and Ted's Dash stroller, which pushes like a dream.
B0096AT0LU|5|We LOVE this bedding set. It fits perfectly on the old crib mattress. Washes really well and doesn't wrinkle. The comforter isn't super heavy, but I can tell that my toddler always feels warm and cozy with it. It's perfect weight for a little person. We also folded up the comforter and sheets and slipped them into a suitcase when we went on vacation and they took up very little room. Great set!
B00081J3N6|5|What can I say about these?  They were cheap (cost-wise) and they do the trick.  We've put them in all the outlets here and now no longer worry about little fingers finding their way into the sockets!
B00CZ2NYN6|5|Great product. Insulated spaces in addition to areas for cell phone, keys, snacks etc. Fits my daughter's 24&#34; wide handlebars
B000I0YYYK|4|The reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that it would be perfect if I used the skinny bottles (like the Gerber ones) but I use the Tommee Tippee line, which are a bit wider. Fitting bottles and the nipples on here is a tight squeeze. Also, the brush that it comes with isn't very high quality, which isn't surprising. I wound up throwing it away after using it a few times because I didn't like the idea of a dirty/used bottle brush living so close to the baby's clean bottles. So now the rack isn't as cute with the little orange bottle brush handle sticking up. However, removing the handle did make it shorter so now it can live on top of my microwave (that lives on the counter under a cupboard).     Overall, it serves its purpose well and is better looking than bottle drying racks that I've seen at my friends' houses.
B00KMKL78M|5|Great color, good quality. My little kiddo looks pretty cute in them!
B0009EFYJE|5|BabyPlus is amazing!  I have to say I did not know what to think when a friend recommended the product.  I did some research and thought, it can't hurt. If it does half of what the website claims, it will be worth it.  Jackson was born 1-18-07.  He was wide-eyed and alert at birth, nursed well immediately, self soothed and started sleeping through the night by 10 weeks.  He hit all his first year milestones early.  For instance he started walking at 9 1/2 months.  He is now 13 months old and loves books, entertains himself and has the most laid back personality of any little one I've ever met.  I am absolutely using BabyPlus with our next pregnancy.
B008J3UD2U|5|great
B001QBV86C|5|This product was a great fit. It is well made and washes well. The fabric creates knots after its used but the original cover did the same thing. I wish this company would use a better quality of fabric. However at least they are still in business and I can buy replacement covers that fit at an affordable price.
B000RRD7UG|5|We travel internationally 2-3x a year and this bag has survived all of our flights. Our son uses a Recaro proride seat and although the fit is tight, it covers it well. Just bought a second bag since we're expecting #2 soon
B00260GN0I|5|Good product...doesn't budge. Didn't need to screw it into the furniture. Haven't used a cover for it (yet)..easy to clean. Oh, and it fits perfectly with the davinci kalani combo dresser & hutch. Excellent price!
B000F78U9G|5|The changing table is nice for the money.  It has a contemporary look and functions well.  The picture here almost looks like it has white shelving but ours are more laminate like the natural color of the table.  Ignore the broken parts issues from shipping.  You could ship an egg in this box and it wouldn't break.  I blame the shippers for damage and not the company though ours arrived with no issue.  It DOES come with a changing pad, which is fine because it is fitted.  The buckle straps, if used, must be screwed into the bottom of the table along with a brace, the instructions don't spell that out but you can figure it out easy enough.  Assembly, fit and finish are great for a hundred dollar table or so.  I think there are a lot of too critical reviews here, people expecting heirloom furniture at this price, just doesn't happen.  I'm a realistic person and would tell you if the table isn't worth it but I believe it is.  I hope you find this useful.
B004044LD4|5|This  mattress has just the right firmness to ensure the comfort of the baby. It is reasonably priced and meets all safety standards
B00P033158|5|Hope it works
B001CKBL5A|5|The sunglasses are fun, bright colors, and flexible enough to be safe when held by a toddler or put down.
B001EU4ZF6|1|I was very disappointed with this monitor. I also bought an additional camera so that I could monitor both of my children in their rooms at the same time. There's a constant static sound in the background. You have to be looking at the receiver exactly straight on or you can't see the picture (kind of like a laptop, but much worse), the night vision is terrible, the sound is tinny, and it can't be mounted on the wall directly above the baby's crib b/c the camera doesn't swivel down far enough to see below it. Worst of all, when you have it on scan mode to watch both rooms at once, there is a loud clicking noise each time it switches. I had to go back to my old monitors because I couldn't sleep with that thing clicking every 4 seconds.   I'm returning this useless thing ASAP.
B000TDZQ5M|3|I'm satisfied about the thickness and the hardness of the mattress but it's coated with plastic and personally I don't like that. It's a good item anyway
B005KTOSQS|5|I just bought this for my granddaughter and it arrived today.  My daughter said it it works great and her daughter is very cozy and warm.  It's a bargain and will keep our little bundle warm for a very long time.
B0019QCH3C|5|Good
B002L3T9ZG|2|i got these for my birds to play with and they ended up chewing off the rubber. I know human babies don't have sharp beaks, so I'm certain for them it would be a 5 star product.
B00UB19F4U|2|For what it is and what it does your better off going with a clip on fan. All it does is blow humidified air (water soaked up in a sponge) with a weak fan. Its more bulky and cumbersome than a clip on fan and has less air flow.
B00000IZQI|5|My son has been playing with these consistently since about four months, he's now eleven months; I don't see him stopping any time soon.  He plays with them on our ceramic tile floors where they are holding up very well.  I bought them second hand for about half the price of new.
B002SW3C6C|4|I put off buying these due to the price, but I found a good deal on a lot of used sleep sacks and bit the bullet... I'm so glad I did! I had checked out the quality of the ones offered at Target and was not quite convinced to spend the money because they seemed very thin. After reading so many reviews about how much better the real ones are, I decided to give them a try. They are MUCH better quality than the cheaper version! Totally worth the extra $12. These have 2 layers of the muslin and are very soft. As I said, I purchased mine used, and they have no fraying or tears, so I take that as a great sign. My daughter sleeps comfortably in them and does not sweat during the night. They are very soft and I like the way the zipper zips from bottom to top (instead of top to bottom), though if you undo it completely in the dark, it can be a little difficult to rethread. All in all, I love them and am glad I spent the money.
B000JOT2RO|3|I was hoping that these would stay put when my 15 month old son would yank them and try to spill his food but all hope is lost. Food immediately landed where it shouldn't be once he realized how it worked. On the upside, he really likes the colors and the fact that they stack into each other so they double as toys when clean. Cute, great idea but just didn't work for us. :-(
B000UPSVPG|5|Use this on my BOB stroller to keep the bugs away and the sun off my daughter. It has great stretch and fits well. I've been really happy with it.
B00P8X30SI|5|Good pouches arrived on time
B00005C8ZO|5|These come in handy all over our house for a quick diaper change or a replacement when there is a messy diaper change. M
B0043G8OXC|3|My kids love love love their kinderglo night lights. they are cute, cuddly, and took away their nighttime fear. But the battery takes 10 hours to charge! And the battery has a memory, so you are only supposed to charge it when it's completely run down. The whole idea of the light is to comfort the child in the dark for as long as they need it, right? But if you have to wait for it to run down, and then charge for 10 hours, the light dies out on the poor kid regularly and they get to spend the rest of that night without the light. Ugh! Plus, charging with the light lit up apparently damages the battery but we only learned this through the website FAQs. None of this information comes on the instructions we received with the night light. We learned about all these quirks because my husband happened to check the FAQs. Very frustrating!
B00FNJ7D58|5|I don't write reviews on Amazon - I order too much and have a 10 month old, enough said. But this company impressed me so much, I felt compelled! Bright Starts/Kids II handled my concern with such professionalism and attention to detail, I'm floored (in a good way). They went above and beyond the call of duty to make me happy! I wish more businesses were this customer centric. And the product? My daughter loves it and plays in it every day a couple of times! Not only does it give my arms a little break, more importantly she gets plenty of exercise by practicing to stand and by turning herself to play with different toys! She can also sit and relax when something else catches her eye. I really like the fact that it doesn't wobble so it's steady for her to move freely. The firm bouncy pad she stands on is just right to absorb the impact of her movements. Between the excellent customer service and the awesome toy I say, just get it! Add to cart now!
B0013IEUJ0|1|While this seems like a great product, you are not supposed to use aftermarket products in your child safety carseats.  Do your research!
B008QSLOE4|3|If I wanted a &#34;realistic&#34; e.t. toy I wouldn't get this, but our 18 year old daughter is TERRIFIED of ET so we bought it as a welcome home gift to put in her room when she came home from college...IT worked wonderfully! and we keep doing such tactics when we have the chance...Yes we are that kind of family!
B009ERZDJ8|1|The box clearly states that a 100 count starter pack of bags is included in this package but it is not in the box! How do I get what I already purchased? Not a good start.
B000GKWA66|5|I purchased this product for my son on the way. I'm not sure if its because I'm pregnant or the sounds of the sheep but as soon as I turned it on I had to go to the restroom. It seems soothing enough to put a infant to sleep but probably not a toddler. I was expecting better sounds but there were only variations of water sounds.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I love this thing seriously.  My son is now 1 and it still puts him to sleep.  I also love that it hooks to the side of his crib...so convenient.  He even sometimes turns it on himself and fall asleep, very funny kid.  I recommend this product 100% to anyone looking for a sleep aid for their child.
B0061PIHOE|4|My mind is at peace now with baby sleeping on her tummy I needed to make sure nothing happens to her... With Angelcare its now possible as it monitors her heart rate and if baby stops breathing for more than 20 sec a huge alarm goes off! No false alarms, night vision and sound detector! Soooo great that I dare sleeping in my bed now and not beside baby!
B00190JPTW|4|This is a great relaxing seat, not an entertainment seat.  Everything about it is geared towards relaxation, (hence the \\"Soothe\\" in the name.)  That kind of goes against the \\"bouncer\\" concept.  I had a brightly colored super bouncy with crazy toys for my older child, but with the 10,000 baby toys and things, I really just wanted something less obnoxious this time around.  My daughter loves the vibrations and the sounds.  We've been using the same batteries for over 3 months now, so it's not a big battery waster and that's nice.  The reason for the 4 stars is because it was a little annoying to put together.  Graco, IMO, is terrible at instrction booklets.  Nothing is labeled, the illustrations are always too small, and there are hardly any words to walk you through. There were a couple of times that I put something in the wrong way.  Also, there are styrofoam tubes around the frame, and they LOOK like they're just packaging - as so many toys come with the same type of protective foam for shipping, so I ripped one right off when I was unpacking the pieces.  Don't do this!  They are part of the seat. Nowhere in the directions does it say anything about the styrofoam being PART of the seat itself, it wasn't until I looked at the illustration again that I realized I'd made a mistake.  Luckily, it didn't make the seat unusable.  Overall, good seat.
B000YDDF6O|5|Definitely recommend great service
B002J4U8M0|5|Baby loves this mirror. Great motivator for tummy time movement
B002DRCWWM|4|Got for my friend. She loved it but the silicone did end up becoming lose after a few months
B006PB2EFC|5|I am in love with this product. The design is the cutest out of anything I've seen in the store and the stroller is great! The wheels work perfect and it's so easy to fold and unfold. The handle has this foamy stuff around it so it is comfortable to push, as well as two cup holders and a closed off compartment. The storage underneath the stroller fits our diaper bag and purse perfectly. The carseat is easy to install, easy to take in and out and strap baby in and out. I recommend this to EVERYONE. It' amazing.
B00UWGX5LI|5|I like the single layer bamboo insert very absorbent but not bulky!
B007UYBOM2|5|Great booster!  Bought two one for Grammie's car and one for Mommy's.  Easy to move around yet still very safe for child.  Great value!!!!
B001261R7G|4|These use to be sold in packs of 3, which made much more sense because the bottles are sold in packs of 3. Product is good, just wish they would go back to the way they use to be packaged.
B0050GD2AE|5|I have owned many strollers including jogging strollers.  I saw this one at my sister's house and fell in love with it.  Its light weight, very compact and excellent handling. Perfect for my new born and 3 year old!
B003I867US|4|It is comfortable as well as fashionable
B004IZWQYQ|5|My girls are 2 now and they're still obsessed with this. Theyll watch the balls roll down over and over. I don't really like that it comes apart but it's better for storing and putting away.
B00I2W8SW0|5|I bought this for my friend's daughter and she fell in love with it, she is 3 and all she says is beautiful over and over. I bought this same style for my son, he got the TMNT themed one it was a tad troubling at the end but it was still easy to put together, the shipping was fast, although this box was damaged, and everything was fine.
B002F3M346|3|I tried to use it with my baby boy....I will wait to do it again .not easy with his little hands
B00CWN8IK2|4|Purchased Sept. 2014<br />Overall I think this is a good product for thd price.<br />It is really quiet, except when it bubbles as the base fills with water which only lasts a second and has never bothered my children or myself.<br />It is nice that you can direct the mist in different directions.<br />It is pretty basic and straightforward as far as what it does. It is definitely meant to be used in a small space.<br />The instructions for cleaning are simple and if kept up with easy to do as well.<br />BUT...<br />I wish the cord was longer.<br />On the high setting with both nozzles pointed in same direction it will soak whatever surface it is falling on in a pretty short amount of time. It doesn't make a mist that spreads throughout an area.<br />It is a little awkward to hold while filling.<br />There is no way to scrub the entire inside of the tank. If you clean it regularly though, that shouldn't be an issue.<br />The cap can be a little difficult to grip when screwed on tightly.
B00BZAGM7O|4|worked fine
B006G9F8AQ|1|Smells too rubbery lo didn't like it
B00CSE308K|5|When I first say these hooks, I wondered about them. Now I wonder no more. After having bought one, I set about using this one in earnest and putting it to the test. These hooks are beautiful. I just love the way you can use them anywhere.<br />I used it in the garage to hang a few tools and it felt good and strong on the wall. My husband loved it too. In fact, he wanted to go out and buy one more for his tool shed, what a nutball!<br /><br />These stroller hooks are great if you want to go out and have a nice day outdoors. Most of these hooks are easy to set up and use anywhere you like. They are so easy to use that even a baby could do it. Stroller hooks can be a real godsend if you have babies and want to go out shopping. They are very convenient and you need not have worries about being far away from your loved ones. These hooks are strong and sturdy.
B002L3T9YM|5|These are great for my grandson!<br />He loves to chew on them & they are sturdy.
B002N5IE8U|5|I live in Florida and my 2 1/2 month old son is hot-blooded.  All the adorable little sleeper outfits we received are too hot for him.  This lightweight and very soft sleep sack is perfect.  It's plenty long, even for tall babies.
B001IDYISI|5|My grand daughter loved her Dora seat. She love it so much ,until she started using the toilet more just to look at Dora on the seat.
B001IDBH28|3|Product has no use, the baby does not like very resist，now we always use medical cotton swab to clean up
B000H1MRJO|5|This was a better than expected item.  They are very sturdy and the cover is an easy wash and dry.  I am very happy with this item and so are the little ones who use them
B00FNJ7FRO|5|We bought this for a new father at work. He and his wife's 1st  child and 2 month early. We also order the car seat insert to hold smalller babies more secure. They were so happy with it and uses it all the time. It is so easy to fold down and take with you anywhere.Hopefully as the baby grows, he will like it also!
B000P9TK0W|5|I bought this for travel because I didn't want to take my electric pump everywhere. This pump works as well as my electric medela pump. It's a little hard to clean because there are a lot of parts.
B00AOC2IPY|4|Cute but not as plush as I expected.
B00JROOBXW|5|Adorable!!
B000MA3HDA|4|This is a great way to sell these booster seats, as a family pack!  Besides being a great safety item for my older kids,    I love the side compartment as well as the drink holders.  Both of my kids thought that the two added extras were just fantistic.  Delivery time frame was so easy and quick.      I am very pleased with my purchase in everyway!
B000AOEWP0|1|Lets be honest about something - babies are messy. They're dirty, especially when they are eating. Food gets everywhere. Strained peas go in the hair. Prunes end up, well, I can't really say where. The problem with this high chair is there are too many cracks and crevices into which little ones can deposit their unwanted dinnertime treats. After one meal, the chair is absolutely filthy and disgusting. Then, once you finally get your child unstrapped, stripped, bathed, rediapered and put to bed, you have to go back to the kitchen and face an unholy, god-awful mess that takes forever to clean, because you have to take the entire chair apart and use toothpicks to pick the strained peaches out. This is the second Peg Perego high chair we had. We didn't want this one again, but a now-disowned relative gave it to us as a baby warming gift. Trust me, buy something else.
B000H3FRA8|3|I was very disappointed to receive the crib rail cover and then realize that it does not fit on my child's crib.
B00KBGTRAC|5|If you have a baby, this is a MUST HAVE!!!!! I take it to cook outs, baseball games, and even use it in my house. It's easy to take with you anywhere. I wish I would have had one with my first child!!!!
B0011E75RK|5|This breast pump is well worth the money.  It is easy to use and transport around.  It was almost as good as the hospital grade pump I used while in the hospital.  If you are going to be pumping more than a few times, I highly recommend this.
B00M1Y57R4|5|good
B002M77N22|1|I started using this product when my twins were 3 weeks old because they had a cold and it said it was safe for babies to sleep in.  I continued to use for night time and naps because they slept well in it. At 2 months the babies were diagnosed with Torticollis. By three months They were diagnosed with Plagiocephaly.  It is so bad it affected the shape of their eyes.  It was caused because of the rock n play. Had I known earlier that this would have happened I would have never purchased it. DO NOT BUY!!!
B0009FIMPG|5|I love these cups! It makes it so easy to give my 20-month old daughter a snack and let her walk around the house. Otherwise, I have to hand feed her each piece or she just dumps it on the floor and the dog eats it.
B00N3A72SC|5|We got this for our daughter for her birthday and she loved it.  Very nice quality!
B005MAU21A|3|Although I generally liked the product, I wish they listed the height too in the sizing since I relied on the weight when ordering. When I received it, the packaging said up to 23 inches. My daughter is tall and skinny, so although the weight will fit her for a while, she had already outgrown the height and it was too small, so she barely wore it.
B00JPSSXUM|5|Perfect for my grand daughter who had her first son.
B001CFACMI|1|Did not stick to my ceramic tiles.
B000AV5LZ8|3|This is a suitable travel potty (it snaps together) - but the snap together design is not the easiest to manipulate, and although the seat fits securely when resting on the bowl with all lids up, the stairs are shaky - my 4 year old (under 30 pounds) wasn't steady when climbing up, so I never felt comfortable not assisting her.
B00BLVQIMG|5|This diaper disposal works perfectly, it handles a lot of diapers and its easy to use, clean, it mantains bad odors away.
B000F70UP8|5|This is an excellent car seat. We bought this carseat for our daughter nearly two years ago, and have been very pleased. The thing that made me decide on this car seat was Consumer Reports' review of convertible car seats. They gave the britax a slightly higher score because it's a little easier to use, but the most important factors, being infant and toddler crash safety, this one out-scored the britax every time. THAT is what's important to me, and it's why we have our children ride in a carseat. Combine that with a price tag that's AT LEAST $100 less, and I'm sold. I have to say that once you learn how to use this carseat, it's a breeze. I LOVE the easy-adjustment features for the straps. No more reaching behind to adjust; just press the tab and pull the straps; then to tighten, turn the knob. It's EASY once you learn how to use it. I give this carseat five stars, and would give it more if there were more available.
B00B2AZJH6|5|Love this idea and when I saw it, I knew I needed to get one. I don't know what to say except this is a must have for cloth diaper families. You will thank me later.  It's easy to use and and super functional.
B00KFOWKWC|2|So.. I purchased two of these to store breast milk it. I specifically got this item because they claimed to be one ounce portions. Yes, I can still measure out one ounce in each cube but it just takes a little longer. These cubes store 2 ounces! It needs to be fixed on the item description. Also, they aren't super flexible. A little difficult to get each portion out. I have to flip it upside down and push down on the bottom with my palm. The lids can be a little difficult to get off but not too bad. I'm sure I can use these later on but I'm  just a little sour about not getting what I ordered.
B002RXM9M0|5|It was just what I needed for all my daughter's toys as she has a small room. I just hung the light weight stuffed toys on it.
B002PUGG5G|1|We installed this and while it seemed to work fine for cleaning diapers, it leaked everywhere and seeped into our downstairs neighbor's bathroom. Needless to say, he is not pleased and neither are we. We will be requesting a refund.
B00EFQZZR8|1|Too small
B00BLVQIMG|5|We have two of these and loved them from day one.  Odor has never been an issue for us in our home.  And it's really easy to use.
B000IDSLOG|3|My child has not really been that entertained by this.  Everyone told me, you have to get Sophie!  But I think it is just an overpriced squeaky toy that my child has mostly ignored.
B0025YWL4W|3|Tried many types of liners, these are the softest.  They are also the most absorbent, which can be a source of trouble.  If any bit of the liner sticks out of the diaper it can wick pee into clothing.  With other liners the pee passes right through and the liner stays dry, you can actually re-use the liner on the next diaper.  With the Bummis the liner is soaked and must be tossed.<br /><br />If you're willing to be extra careful about liner placement and don't mind tossing these for every diaper change then these will be the softest liners to use.
B00B7M7CMO|5|Perfect!!!!!!!
B00A9AY0V6|5|Soft and well made!
B000YYS2WU|5|Good value! I bought this sippy cup to match the divided plate and covered bowl I'd already purchased from ORE in the same pattern. I was happy to find it available on Amazon (ORE was out of stock) and it was great to be able to complete the dinner set. I'm glad I thought to check Amazon!
B0057EEBE0|1|I did not like the design at all.  As the baby ate it created lots of noise and bubbles
B008C0R684|1|Our daughter is only two months old and this car seat has already failed.  The release mechanism jammed and we could not get the car seat removed from the base.  I took the car seat and the base out of my wife's car and using a crowbar, a hammer and a pair of vice grips I still was not able to get the seat and the base apart.  Do not purchase this item!!!!
B001EH4W6G|5|Love love love them!!!! No leaks with pre fold diapers, these are great.
B00MRZIGVG|5|I just received one of these as a gift for my one year old and we love it! He's been drinking out of open cups and straws for quite awhile now so I wanted one he can use on his own. This is the only cup we have for him that doesn't leak and it's better for his teeth because it doesn't have a spout. I got the one without handles because although it's a little big for him now, he'll grow into it and I think the handles would have been irrelevant soon.
B00B7U63GW|5|My sons favorite pacifier! Good airflow and cute designs even for boys! We got the pastel sea foam green and the dark blue with red, light blue, silver, and white designs.
B001E4VTD8|4|This washed up nice and fits the mattress well.  The description says 100% cotton, but parts of it are not.
B0072MUD9M|5|These are a staple for the kids lunch boxes. They are really cute & fit so many snacks, berries, grapes.
B00F2MQ294|5|My 3 month old daughter is to the point where she no longer likes to lie down when she's awake... she feels like she's missing all of the action! We bought this chair for her to sit up in and it is awesome! Extremely mobile and offers a wee bit of head support for younger infants. Highly recommended!
B00OUMV6R0|4|Cool hat
B001GQ2RZ8|4|We got this swing on sale for just over $50 - so my review is based on paying that price.    CONS:  - The photo of the lady carrying the swing one-handed is not accurate. This swing folds in half the long way and there are two handles, so it's not possibly to carry it one handed. Perhaps if there were a bar connecting the handles this would be possible. Nevertheless, having the two carrying handles on top make for easy moving around the house.    - The swing doesn't swing very fast even on its highest setting, but our baby still enjoys it and for travel it's better than nothing at all.    - The music volume cannot be adjusted. We can adjust the music on our large swing so we've been spoiled by that feature.    - The toy bar doesn't \\"click\\" into place. It comes out very easily - which could be dangerous if the child were able to pull it down, seeing as the toys are hard plastic. Also the toy bar swings with the swing, so the toys are constantly swinging.    PROS:  - It's an adorable swing, love the lion head on the seat.    - Our baby appears to be very comfortable in it and fits it well even at three weeks old.    - Lightweight and compact, we had no trouble bringing it on our road trip.    - Good price.
B008CH3Y38|1|I was quite upset to find out that this was a last trimester device
B006JV4HKI|5|Space saver. Very stylish yet strong/sturdy & stylish. Easy to remove seat itself to wash delicately in the washing machine.
B001N45DM2|5|I was looking for a teether that was a little less bulky than what I was finding in the stores....Vulli has made the perfect set of teethers! My baby can easily hold these and she loves to gum them, and I like that I can clip them to her carrier using a few linking rings. They smell really good and they're a great value for the price, in my opinion.
B000067QMD|1|I've used Avent bottles since my daughter was born, and a Hygeia pump, and I've never had any problems with any of them.  I got these sealing disks intending to send bottles to daycare - I'm not sure what's wrong but I can't get a seal.  Everything leaks, whether it's the 4 oz. bottle or the 9 oz.  We tried snapping the disk into the ring as tightly as possible, and also laying it in more loosely before screwing down the ring, and in both cases, milk leaks out of the bottom of the cap, where the ring meets the bottle.  I'm really disappointed, since it would have been a great solution for us.
B00AJSJFYA|5|Works perfectly at bottom o9r wide staircase.
B009R3SQXY|5|Just as described.
B00E36Y5DU|5|These work great for us! We have never had an issue with leaking with these or any other brand of cloth diaper.  For nighttime, I add an extra CBI right on top of the pocket and my boy (18 months) stays dry all night!
B000056JEI|4|The Pooh wall art looks really cute up on my little girls wall.  She seems to like it as well, and stares at it all the time.  I like that Eeyore plays music, that is a nice touch.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sticker to press to make the music play is off centered, I have to press next to the sticker instead of right on it.  It's no big deal but I think they could have gotten it right. Other than that this is a great decoration!
B00JS28L5M|5|Thanks a lot. This sling filled our expectations.
B00004T2WR|5|This was my son's favorite toy from the time he could stand until now, about a year later.  Hours and hours for months on end he would stand and push the buttons and listen to the sounds and watch the lights.  We had no problems with (...) sliding (...), but the train did come off easily and hasn't been used much.  I didn't actually know that one toy could provide so many hours of entertainment for so many months for one child.
B003LW3DMG|5|I bought this product to use in the tub when my 15 month old is bathing in it. No matter how hard I try to teach her to stay seated, she ends up on her feet. I tried 4-5 others, and some were too small; others didn't stick well. this one is just right!
B00DDT1GOO|5|This is a nice little booster seat. It's perfect for my 18 month old daughter. The seat folds and is convenient for travel when we visit family. It easily clips to any chair and my daughter enjoys sitting at the big table. It's good to have this to ensure she'll always have a safe place to sit. It's also a great space saver oppose to a high chair. She prefers this much more...we actually don't use the high chair anymore. I highly recommend this little seat.
B004L2JJ78|5|This head support is awesome. Our daughter was diagnosed with Torticollis, so we are doing physical therapy and working with her on re-positioning. This support has helped us tremendously, I cannot say enough great things about it. It is the only support I have been able to find that allows the head to lay flat and stays in position. Excellent product!
B00277SWV8|5|great item especially if your kid likes to sleep in the stroller (like mine).
B000RWP790|2|I received this border and it is really cute BUT it is only 15ft long, not 30 like the description said???  Now I don't know if I want to order another one so I have enough to do the room or if I am just going to return it. It's frustrating when you don't get what you ordered!
B004KM6LG6|4|These nipples are great. The air flow hole helps prevents so many bubbles into baby's tummy. One inconvenience I did notice with first time use (after I sterilized the nipple straight from package) was that when the baby sucked, the nipple would collapse to one side. I'd have to pop the nipple back up to correct position. After first use, this didn't happen again.
B0052QYLUM|4|Video image very clear, sound sensitivity better than many other video monitors in same price range. Great &#34;value option&#34; for video monitoring system  UPDATE 1 YEAR LATER:  We still LOVE this monitor!  After about 10 months of daily use, we started to notice the picture getting fuzzy and &#34;whited out&#34; when under night vision.  The unit also started to make a constant, subtle humming noise when it was turned on.  I contacted customer service, and I can't sing their praises enough.  They had me ship the camera and monitor back and provide them with the tracking number, and then sent me a replacement via two day shipping (didn't even have to wait for them to receive the faulty monitor!), and extended my warranty for another year, free of charge.  They always responded so quickly to my emails, and really helped to make the situation right.  Before we realized we would receive the new monitor so quickly, we went and purchased a (much more expensive) Motorola video monitor, and while the range was a little longer, the picture and sound quality DIDN'T EVEN COMPARE to our Infant Optics monitor! We took the Motorola back almost immediately!
B00440CZVY|4|I love the cup for my one year old. I only wish the straw was softer.
B005SPZG7E|3|Did not fit correctly on my Britax Marathon. As tight as I can get it on there, it can still easily be popped off. 3 stars as its a good product, but -2 stars as its not universal.
B000ROME3U|5|delivery delivered on time and satisfaction with products purchased
B0042QP5QC|5|It was actually nicer than I expected. My friend adores it and is saving it! She received a lot of compliments for it.
B006SFUD44|5|Great and easily washes off in the shower.  Kids love it!
B003JT4CQM|4|I used a feeder like this in 1985 and it was a MUST HAVE item then and now. Spoon feeding at an early stage is way too messy. The idea is to feed at the babies pace, with little or no mess, and no air introduced to their stomachs for digestion proplems. This product meets these standards. One slow-up though... the strainer inside plugs up sometimes with thicker foods. (Great for Rice Cereal). My grand daughter is 7-months old.
B0091E31IE|3|lasted about a year
B00581EWWS|4|Everything was very nice and well put together, the picture makes it look like it comes with alot more than it really does but it looks great in the nursery and helps keep everything organized!
B000LK6KOO|3|This cup works pretty well. Easy on baby's mouth, and under normal use conditions it really doesn't spill. If you shake the heck out of it and bang it around, then yes you can get it to leak a couple of drops, but for general use it doesn't spill.<br />The problem is in the cleaning of the cup. The plastic straw, the silicone spout, and the inside of the cup all get really cruddy and cannot get clean in the dishwasher. Essentially you have to take the whole thing apart, use Q-tips or pipe cleaners to get all the crud out of the straw, use a toothbrush to clean the inside of the lid, and then put it all back together again.<br />If you clean the silcone spout too vigorously, you can also damage the little membrane that makes it 'spillproof,' and voila it is no longer spillproof.<br />I have learned to live with this cup by soaking it immediately after use, and by attacking it with Q-tips when it starts to look dirty. But it is not the best design from the cleaning perspective.
B004IZWQYQ|5|My son LOVES the balls that come in this toy!!  We were given one as a gift, and lost all but one ball. I bought 2 more in order to make sure that he always has these little balls to play with. The toy is great and he loves it...my ONLY suggestion is that they sell replacement balls seperately!
B000JVVTIM|4|Great shower present friend loved it
B00C2KW3II|5|My son slept in this for 4 months and it was a life saver! We loved the vibrating feature at first. When he was really young it helped put him to sleep. I remember reading other negative reviews and I have no complains. I wash the bedding every week or so and had no problems.
B00CXH2M2W|5|Just as good as the name brand diaper genie refills, but less expensive! Great product.
B00E4BFXOY|5|Works fine, as expected. No batteries are included
B004AE6V8M|5|Love these!  I use them with the Nuna Pipa car seat and the Mamas and Papas Sola stroller.  They make my life so easy when it comes to taking a newborn and a toddler to the grocery store.  Push stroller with car seat attached , pull cart with toddler in seat.  Great product!
B0032B500O|4|For such a small swing that folds up and is portable its pretty good. Really doesn't take up much space especially when folded up. Its made well, it's not flimsy. And also plays 5 soothing tunes which my baby boy seems to really like. And it swings well with 7 settings , when the baby gets heavier put it on the higher settings. My baby is 16 lbs at 3.5 months and is on swing setting #3 . The only negative is the seat, I feel it caves in just a tad to much and could be made better and more comfortable, I put a blanket in the seat for more comfort . And sometimes I have trouble closeing the one side of the swing when I want to store It ,The other side of swing closes well. But in the end I still feel its worth buying.
B00AHVR6TK|5|When I got this is was really heavy in the box. I was surprised when I took it out it was so much lighter and easy to put together. I liked that it fit through the door way and around thing easy. It does not make any noisy when you move it from room to room. Its perfect for a newborn to sleep close to Mom and Dad and also perfect for taking on the road.
B00FF446DI|2|The Quality of the product was ok, but the service was simply abhorrent. I ordered two products, and only one arrived, and when I took it up with the seller, they blamed me for my ignorance. I think there are better places/sellers out there to buy such a product, as this product was scratched horribly after only one wear, and does look quite fake. There are more realistic &#34;dupes&#34; out there on the market. Keep doing your research, and there are easier to deal with sellers as well. I had to get amazon.com to intervene on my behalf.
B004V8VQC8|5|Our baby loves this! He started using it at 3 months and he's almost 5 months old and still loves it. It's really fun to watch his legs go crazy and kick at the piano. He also loves looking at himself at the mirror and grabbing at the hanging animals. I think it's really helped him learn to control his hands better and be able to grab at things. We have also used it for tummy time, it's a very versatile toy.
B007NG5UEU|4|We have been very happy with this monitor, but have to keep them plugged in at all times. The battery life is not very long.<br />The reception is very clear and picks up every little noise.
B00XUJOOWI|5|I bought this for my GodDaughter coming soon... it's really great material and the mom to be also fell in love with it.
B00LXT23RA|5|Amazing how easy it is to assemble and how well it works.  I bought this for my daughter-in-law's car for my granddaughter.  Her car was baking in the sun all day while she was at work and the poor little one was cooking back there in her car seat.  This product combined with a windshield screen did the ticket.  The windshield screen cut a lot of the heat out of the car and this product provided direct air to a backward facing car seat!  I don't know how i lived without it when my kids were little!
B0002PR43O|5|The SmartSteps Exersaucer was my daughter's big first Christmas present (just a few days shy of 3 months old.).  It was worth every penny.  She was able to play in it from the time she could hold her head up steadily.  At first we would stuff blankets behind her to keep her supported, and then took them away when she got better balance. She lasted a few minutes in it at first, just looking at the toys.  But, that quickly changed as she grew older.  There is enough little toys and do-dahs on this product to keep her entertained as she develops. She's six months old now and is still having a blast in it.  <br />The only complaint that I have is the volume settings on the electronic items. The softer volume is too soft  when they are older. It's ok when they are first in it though. And, the louder volume is too loud to me (although it has never seemed to bother her). <br />My daughter is a big drooler, and I haven't run into the problem with the purple dye on the flower rattle like I've read in the other reviews. But, I will keep an eye on that as she starts putting it in her mouth more.
B003HS5JTO|5|I loved these flowers for my daughter. I bought them for her when she was about 4 months old. They are activated by just touching the top of the flower. They do not need to press in a button, just tap it and the music plays or the note depending on what setting you have it on. My friend has a child who has special needs and has little control of his hand movement but when she saw this toy she mentioned it would be great for him so I just bought another one and gave it to him for his birthday. I saw the other one with the platic base at a yard sale this summer and am so glad I chose this fabric based one. It's allot cuter. I love lamaze toys. We must have atleast 5 of them for our baby. All of the e-mails you get when you are a new mom about making sure your baby plays with toys with different textures and such should just give you a link to all of the lamaze products because all of their toys are like that.
B00BNZ8XM8|4|This stroller is good, not great.  It's sturdy enough, but if you're over 5'8&#34; or so (I'm 5'11&#34;), you're going to be hunching your back when pushing it and it's not comfortable.  However, it was a good affordable solution for a secondary or tertiary stroller for bumping around town.
B005G3FOMU|5|Very cute, and so happy I was able to find it. The box was a a little beat up, but the product was perfect.
B007XL89MA|5|Born Free bottles are the best and I was really suprised to see such a great deal on these.  They are the perfect size and weight.
B000BH79YW|5|This was a fantastic investment for eating out with our toddler.
B000FIAWOG|3|It's beautifully designed and very functional.  Good height, and the storage is great.  That said, we had to retire this stool to the closet when my 21 month old son slipped going down, falling forward into the corner of a wall, and ended up in the Emergency Room with a giant bump on his forehead.  Even a few clear or small non-skid treads on this would go a long way.  Same for the bottom, which should be rubberized to prevent slippage.
B000I0TF9E|5|I tried the hospital grade medela and the pump really hurts.  This pump gradually pulls your milk down.  GREAT PUMP.
B00EUTDIC4|5|I had another body pillow for my first pregnancy and this one is far better than that. It's great because it's easy to roll over to the other side with.
B000LXQVA4|3|It get's the job done and my boys both seem to enjoy it. The problem is sometimes it puts them to sleep and their arms get STUCK (see picture). Hard to explain, but he wakes up screaming bloody murder which upsets me.
B00AWLZD4A|2|We use Nuk's bottles in this house. Until recently, though, i used the [[ASIN:B000RI8Y30 Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket]] to run the bottle caps, collars, and nipples through the dishwasher. They fit pretty badly, so when i saw that Nuk had their own version out, i bought it.<br /><br />That was a mistake.<br /><br />This thing is made of soft, flimsy plastic. The expanding rack sections slip out of their tracks more easily than they slide out. The whole thing bends and twists instead of having any stability whatsoever. The top section for nipples doesn't have a hinged base, but rather a loose piece of plastic, so you have to do slight gymnastics to load it and close it without everything falling out of alignment.<br /><br />And strangest of all, nuk bottle components don't fit very well. The slots on the lid are too close together for the relatively large nipple bases. You can fit one cap and two collars in each of the expanding sections, and even with those sections extended out as far as they can go, there's space for 2.5 more caps in between. So, fully loading this, you can have:<br />12 nipples, kinda overlapping and crammed together (6 if you want them all to have elbow room)<br />4 caps<br />8 collars<br /><br />That math just doesn't work.<br /><br />About the only GOOD part of this is that the bottom section is short enough that caps can't flip over and end the dishwasher cycle full of gritty dirty water.<br /><br />I've switched back to the munchkin dishwasher basket, because at least i can load it without swearing.
B000JHN3AS|5|Best invention ever!!!!!! Super functional and convenient for those with small kids!
B00P1P34WK|5|works great.  can switch between all cameras easily
B00IK6BI0M|5|This product is fantastic. Works like a charm. My sister was over and used it on my neice and lived It as well. She is going to buy it.
B002L8250W|2|The fleece makes my newborn very hot, if you are using this product make sure your baby is wearing light clothes, but other than the material, it did soothe my baby when she woke herself up.
B002ZPYGIA|5|This hamper is great! Very cute and matches perfect. Appears very sturdy :) I would definitely recommend this to go with the rest of the theme.
B00005QSKC|3|cups were fine, but I received girl colors, not these colors. I was hoping to use them for my boys.
B0030DG4P4|4|This is a good little organizer to put on the back of the seat. I would not recomend it to use as a bad to carry stuff in unless that is what you want the main purpose to be as it has no side snaps or closers so stuff could fall out of the sides if you fold it over.  But, I leave mine on my seat at all times and I love it!
B0078H7YN4|4|It is very cute and light weight. Yet, it is not an expensive nice material though. However, I am happy with this order.
B00318CO6G|5|At first, I was so happy with this product.<br />this is the best!!!<br />Easy to clean, and fill.<br /><br />At first, I was so happy with this product.<br />this is the best!!!<br />Easy to clean, and fill.
B00674S1Y0|4|Our daughter liked this potty seat and it fits our toilets great. It came with the scent thingy but she just plays with it and loves to sniff it.
B004OR1DTC|5|It's functional and attractive. I fill it up with bottles, breast pump parts and more. Then I tuck it away on a shelf for the items to dry as we have limited counter space. Other drying racks were too tall to fit tucked away on the shelf. Fits our needs perfectly!
B003N0JXSO|5|We have hard water and have tried every cleaner out there,  rockin green is the best one out there we have new life with what we thought were lost cloth inserts..
B0057NCI3W|5|Love it!! Absolutely amazing, protect my children from the heavy rain.
B007JBTO96|3|Plastic holders not glued in
B000MAKVE8|2|Chicco Lullaby LX Playard is nearly impossible to collapse. It is difficult to pull up the floor of the playard to a level high enough to collapse the side rails. The side rail buttons are hard to identify and push. It is unsuitable for travel or any intermittent use. There are less expensive playards that are better designed.
B00346BMY0|5|Not all babies like swings, which made me nervous spending as much as I did for this swing, but I could not be happier.  With 2 older children, I wanted a swing that was low to the floor, so IF it was knocked over, baby did not have far to fall (thankfully that has not happened).  The remote is a nice feature.  Baby is 4m old and we are still only using levels 1 and 2 (even if older sister likes to ratchet it up to level 6) to swing.  Level One is a little more than a vibrate (fantastic for when baby was a newbie) and Level Two is a sweet swing without being too much.  One of my favorite features is the 5-point harness.  The music is slightly annoying -then again, I find all kiddie electronic music to be annoying.  Not a fan of the toy attachment, but I did not buy it for that feature either.  Swing is light enough to carry from one room to another with one hand -even if the swing is kept \\"open\\"
B0047O3Y2G|5|I have had Evenflo and Graco car seats....infant carriers, convertible seats and boosters....this is by far one of the best and a VERY WELL-MADE and safe booster seat for children!  It has the latch system, which I love, to secure the seat to the car.  It is quite easy to install.  It is sleek and stylish and very convenient for the kids to get in and out of.  Currently I am using 2 of these seats in my car for my 6 year old daughter and 4 year old son, both are about 40 lbs and will have many years with this seat with the back support and then without, once it converts into the booster only!
B0017KSMCK|3|Kira is soft and has such a sweet expression. I love her floppy hat! She is smaller than I expected, but my granddaughter loved her!
B001GQ4CL0|4|This gate looks MUCH nicer than the northyard baby gate that is $59 on here, and I bought these gate on ebay for $70 with shipping new.  The gate COULD be a bit better, but I would not call it unsafe at all. This gate will attach to the wall as well, unlike most.
B002VAISOM|5|My mom bought us one for our son we loved it so much we bought extra in case we lose track of it. My son loves it he has started teething and it's great for him to chew on keep him happy. The 2 pack is a great deal.
B00HHRH07U|5|Awesome
B00483GAJU|2|I had purchased a roll of these in the past and liked them fine.  On the second roll I ordered,  the lines where they are supposed to separate was not cut correctly so it was very hard to get them apart.  I would pull as hard as I could and they would tear right down the middle..I emailed Grovia about the issue but no response.  I have now switched to bumkin, which as much softer anyways....although more expensive.
B003VNKLIE|4|Works great for keeping my 2 little ones out of our office space. However I only gave it 4 stars because its not as sturdy as I'd like it to be and I'm afraid in time my son will stand on it too much and it will come out of the walls....1 month and still standing.....time will tell.
B00AHVR7ZI|4|It is good, not 100% stable
B000056JND|5|I love these bottles! We tried to use the playtex disposables but it was to hard to monitor what my son was eating. We had received a free Avent bottle from the hospital and my son loved it! I will admit that the bottles can have a leaking problem but it usually happens if the lid is overtightened. As a good mom I decided to buy one of the Dr Brown bottles, my son hated it and for the first and only time in his 5 weeks he spit up the entire 3 ounces! We also purchased the microwave sterilizer and it is a life saver, I will buy that for every baby shower I attend!
B0018ZC7H0|1|Should've taken the reviews more seriously. Definitely not intended for boys, the opening is too narrow. Good thing I have a younger daughter who will use this in the future. The side pockets are excellent. I did stuff bags, diapers, underwear, wipes, ect. in here for easy access. This potty is a great idea but the structure needs to be fixed to accomedate boys.
B00ABB4DQK|4|Love the look. Easy to put together (I put it together on my own at 8 months pregnant). It's a little crooked, but that could have been because I couldn't get the screws as tight as they needed to be.
B0049DYC3U|5|This has been a great swaddle for my daughter.  Even though she was 10 lb. 4 oz at birth she is still able to use it at 6 weeks.  We have enjoyed it.
B000WIGDSI|5|this is a great seat.  can only be found online.  if you alread have a graco stroller this will fit it.
B001AW0TW6|1|This does not fit all models of the Ergobaby carriers, in our case specifically the Ergobaby Sport Baby Carrier - Black. The male buckle of this extension does not have enough space to buckle with the female buckle of the carrier.
B007VOOS1U|5|Our Garmin fits perfect.
B00008BR9I|5|This is a wonderful toy for babies from 3-month old and up. You can even wash in the washing machine, I washed mine at least 3 times by now and it still looks like new.
B004GEC8LU|5|I'm not too sure what some of the low star reviews are talking about.  Some mention that the seatbelt slips out of the holder that is supposed to keep it from choking the child.  Really?  What's your seatbelt made out of?  Yarn?  I had no problem with this whatsoever.  Assembly was a breeze, putting it in the car and getting it out was a snap, and getting the child into and out of the seat is just as easy.  For this price, the quality is excellent.  The seat is comfortable, with plenty of padding, and my son (5 years old, just under 4 feet tall) liked it quite a bit.  He also liked the cupholders, which was nice to put his drinks in while we were going to the zoo this past weekend.  All in all, I'd recommend this car seat to anyone who needs the high back booster seat and doesn't want to spend $100 or more on one that probably only works as well as this one does.  I have no complaints about this product at all.
B00MRZIGWA|5|This is a great cup for my 18 month old, easy to clean and I like that it has handles.<br /> I'm planning on buying another set without handles.
B00BMK0NQI|5|Perfect for holding baby's head up.
B00171WXII|2|So, everyone loves it. But I'm not sure yet. We've used it several times, and I feel like I can't get everything out.  Sometimes we have to use the bulb as well.  And those videos are funny because my baby is not that calm about it. It really takes the two of us to do this!
B0017OJQU8|1|The description of the product says that it is for 1,000 pictures. However, when I got it I noticed that it is just for 200 pictures.
B0033PRFOS|5|After much research and reading of reviews, I purchased this carseat when my son was about to outgrow his infant seat. Boy did i make the right choice!!  The easy adjusting nobs on the sides that tighten the harness straps are SUPER!!  SO many people have commented on how neat and easy and QUICK it is to tighten down the straps to a perfect fit. Plus, it's almost as easy to loosen the straps when taking out your child.  One thing i was pleasantly suprised about was the amount of padding/cushion.  Other brands like Cosco, have very hard seat bottoms...not this one!  It's a close second to Saftey 1st seats i've found.  The cover comes off easily for washing, the headrest easily adjusts and does help a bit in keeping my sons head from flopping all over. You can easily slide the harness straps up with a simple tug as your child grows.    A person can look and look and still not find the \\"perfect\\" car seat, but I think this one is close.  I call it our deluxe, BMW car seat :)  Very pleased and i think you will be also.
B00L4JKPWY|5|Great product and offered many of the features several brands in the big box baby stores did not, such as two cup holders.  Product seems well made and I really like the option of a zipper pocket and a velcro pocket.
B007H0SFZI|5|fun game
B00IJA2X30|4|I ordered this sleeping bag a couple weeks ago and i am satisfied so far. It seems to be a good quality, well manufactured, which survived the washer and dryer just fine. Baby seems warm and cozy in it.
B001BTS0YW|4|This is a decent bath toy. If I were to rate it based on my own opinion, I'd probably award it a 3 star rating. The 4 stars is because my son enjoys playing with it. The stacker toy doesn't float the greatest, but manages to stay upright. 2 of the 3 plastic pieces have openings to allow water to drain out once your kid is done playing/bathing. the 3rd, the transparent blue piece, should be sealed. Unfortunately the one we got seems to have a leak so water seeped in. My only concern is the possibility of 'skunky' water/bacteria/mildew forming in there and/or getting out since it's supposed to be sealed. Otherwise, my son seems to enjoy playing with the toy overall so if he's happy, I'm happy.
B002OOWAJO|5|I bought this for my god-daughter. The chair fit just right. I had no problem putting it together. It was quick and easy!
0448448564|5|I still remember how much I enjoyed reading this 'big' book of Dick and Jane stories during childhood. Now I am back in the market buying them for my niece, hoping she will enjoy them just as much. The beautiful, colorful pictures associated with the text spark the imagination.
B0051D768K|4|I love these containers.  They wash well and hold up well.  I have the 2 and 4 oz. containers and they have lasted through 2 children.  As other reviewers stated, I also had a problem with the lids the first time I used them.  The lid would pop off in the freezer.  However, this was due to me filling the cups too high.  I wasn't leaving room for expansion once the food was frozen.  Filling them slightly less solved the problem.  The only issue I have is that I find them to be a little expensive.  This is just due to the brand though.  All One Step Ahead products seem to be overpriced in my opinion. If you don't mind paying a little more, you will get a good product!
B000056J7L|5|I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training, he's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile. I saw that some people commented that it was small, which is what i was actually looking for, and it works great for us. The back is great, he can sit on quite comfortably, so long as I entertain him!<br /><br />He has used successfully, and it's really easy to empty. I just add some water if needed and flush it, the seat just lifts out.<br /><br />There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up, but he doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />Here's a tip: since he still pretty short and his feel don't reach the floor, I use something to put his feet on for leverage, and it really helps. The baby wipes container is perfect.
B005ZBHZDO|5|Had this in blue, loved it! Now got one in gray for the grandparents' house so we don't have to lug it back and forth.
B0093KAM9M|5|My daughter loves these pacifiers and prefers them over the other mam pacifiers.  I like them because they are extra thin and designed by orthodontists which makes me feel better giving her a pacifier in the first place.
B004K15CF8|5|Awesome crib. Super easy for my husband to set up and it looks great in the baby's room. We get lots of compliments on it from all our visitors (one friend even said it looked like &#34;the cadillac of cribs&#34;). We stored the side rail for future toddler bed conversion underneath the crib (covered by a crib skirt). Hopefully this will last us for may years to come.
B00GAFXA3I|5|My child LOVES carrying this thing around and snacking!
B004X0WBHS|5|I love this thing! This was one of the first toys my son picked up on his own. I bought it for him a little early and laid it next to him while he was on his mat on the floor. He accidently got his arm inside it (not stuck or anything) and moved the frog. He got so excited. This toy helped him start closing his fingers around small objects. He stuck his hand through a couple of the little wires and picked it up. It really gave him confidence. He was so proud.He still plays with it often.
B003X3R6TO|5|We use these as baby washcloths, not wipes. They are very soft on baby's delicate skin, especially the face. They wash and dry well.
B00005YWN0|1|I was really excited about this monitor.  My Safety First monitor broke because we are the clumsiest parents on the face of this earth and have dropped it a bunch of times.  After 18 months the thing finally broke.  We received this monitor at a baby shower for our second baby.  When I turned it on, I was so disappointed to see that it did not compare to the safety first monitor at all.  The picture is grainy and so is the sound.  There was no way I would be able to sleep with the noise.  The next day I returned it to the store and bought another Safety First monitor.  Hopefully we will be more careful with it this time.
B000FFL58Q|5|very good
B00BS777MI|4|prefect in my Dr Seuss room for the grandbabies.  I wish it was not so permanent.  Had to replace one when I changed a wall color because they come off in pieces which are not reusable.  They also can take off some of the paint so you have to peel very carefully.
B004P5O0S4|5|Given as a gift for my kids as they celebrated their anniversary and becoming new parents.  Sophie is their favorite character and will be on their keychain.  Not so small that its unrecognizable but surely not for their son to be teething.
B000S9A37I|5|I was very satisfied with this mattress. It was firm as promised and fits perfectly in the crib, no extra room at the ends or sides. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a quality product and a good bargain!
B000LXQVA4|4|If my baby were the one writing this review, he would give it 10 stars if he could! He LOVES it. No other toy or activity makes him as giddy as he is when he's in the Jumperoo. He's been using it since he was about 3.5 months, and appears to constantly discover new things about it. He will happily jump around or just sit and play with the toys sometimes up to 45 minutes. It's amazing.<br /><br />I love it too. My only complaint is that I wish there were more options for adjusting the height. We use a padded tray underneath his feet right now, and it seems to work.
B0000X01CO|3|I just want to tell yall that a duvet is made for a down comforter and you put the comforter in the duvet so that it does not get dirty because it is easy to wash the duvet rather than taking the down comforter and spending like $60.00 to get it dryed cleaned because it is not machine washable.
B000GK5XY2|5|Use when your child is about 6 months old , my son loves it , clean immediately !
B00PM360XG|5|This is a great thermometer. The infrared and forehead scanner work great. The ear reader seems to read a bit low, so that probably won't be my main way of taking a temperature. I really like the smiley/frowny face feature - cute & gives you an idea if there's a high temp detected. I also like how the screen lights up so you can take a temp in the dark without waking the baby. The beep is very minimal too; another plus for not waking a baby. Overall, it's a great product.<br /><br />Mine was deliver quickly and the seller was wonderful. Mine had a low battery upon delivery and the seller worked with me to make that right. She was very helpful & responsive. I highly recommend this product and seller.
B00DMDK00W|5|Great delivery service and beautiful product. My girls just love it ;)
B00005V6C8|5|After much research, I had it narrowed down between this and the Diaper Genie.  I got this one and I LOVE it!  My son is now 8 1/2 mo. and we keep this in our family room.  My husband thinks every baby product is a crock, but he even commented about how great this diaper system is.  This is on my short list of baby items I couldn't live without!
B0097GUCZ6|5|This makes pumping so much easier being hands free. I love that it can be easily adjusted to fit.
B0042RU2SW|4|It's the nicest looking activity gym. I just wish the bottom pad was thicker so I can lay it on a hard surface.
B00BNZ8XM8|5|Absolutely LOVE this....my nephew lights up and is ready to roll every time he sees it.
B00MUZVL5Q|5|These worked great for taking our 6 mo old to a music festival. I tried them on myself and found them very comfortable. They reduced noise considerably but did not make it silent. The music at the festival we attended wasn't loud enough to be damaging to baby's ears, but this definitely made it more comfortable for her. She was able to nap easily with the headphones on. She also nursed much better with the earphones on as it drowned out the noise, so she didn't get distracted as easily (she's in a very distractable stage!). Many, many other parents asked where we got them. I expect we'll use them many more times for music shows, fireworks, and other loud events.
B000058DN8|5|ya know how other cups promise to be spill free? only to find they are not! well look no more these are the greatest not one leak ever!
B006PB2H40|5|the best thing I have ever bought for myself, peace of mind 100% love it.easy set up and looks great
B0028MCZF6|5|i received this pump through the wic program. This electric pump is great. I've been using it for 3months now. My favorite part about the Hygeia pump is you can record your baby's hungry cry on it. Just hold the record button down next to ur baby and let go when your finished press play. The cry help stimulate me to produce more milk in order to pump more milk out. i also like the speed setting that the Hygeia Enjoye has as well, for those rush days at work. And if you do not have a power source it comes with its own battery pack to go wireless. Its light and easy to carry around but very big for a pump. The Hygeia pump can also be use as a single pump as well. Overall I will recommend this product to anyone.
B00005C6OI|5|I started out using Avent bottles, but found they didn't control the air flow as my baby ate (you could hear the air as the baby sucks). Also, not sure if it was due to the nipple, but it appeared the liquid flow was a problem (my baby would have constant dripple as he ate).  I switched to Dr. Brown's and they have been great!!  The design really controls the air flow and no drips.  My baby has had no gas or colic issues!!!
B007GNS20O|5|she loves this lovey. she has 3 of them and out of all the different designs i think this one is her favorite b/c she can pull on the ears and stuff while she's falling asleep.
B0007Q1IF8|4|I bought this for my 22-month-old niece, and she absolutely adores it. It fits her perfectly and she loves to rub the arms of the chair (the whole thing, except for the back where Elmo is pictured, is a soft, furry material). <br /> <br />She loves to flip through books and this chair is perfect for her to do her \\"reading\\" in. It seems to be very comfortable, too -- sometimes she'll just settle into it like my father does in his favorite recliner and watch TV.
B00J7OFAX2|5|Fantastic pack...I wish they made one like this for grown-ups!  Although it's intended as a dry bag for kids, I can certainly see it as useful for putting swimsuits and the like (to keep water in) as well as just a general backpack.<br /><br />This would fit a 2-3 year old up to your average 10 year old child.  Really top notch construction with well-finished edges and taped seams.  Screen printed graphics are bright and sharp.  Mesh back and straps to keep the wearer cool and comfy.  Lightweight.<br /><br />Overall, very well made with a thought-out design.  The neoprene tail has a zippered compartment (not waterproof) for keys and the like while the main compartment is your standard 3-fold dry bag with fastex buckle closure.<br /><br />They indicate that it is &#34;NOT WATERPROOF&#34; but out of the box it certainly is - I think the caution is because the material is not the most durable.  I could see this weeping water in after some wear and tear..  but hey, that's why I keep a bottle of SEAM SEAL around.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, or have questions or comments, please let me know!
B00GJ5K7BM|5|Absolutely adorable even if it was a bit on the spendy side of things.
B0035ER506|3|i bought this for my son months ago and although not the best cup...did leak, but other than the frogo one, all others including playtex have all leaked....the plastic has not fallen off. the only thing was my son bit off the straw after 1 month, but even with the shortened straw for some reason, this is his favorite cup. he always finishes his milk when i use this cup...not sure why...
B009JV34RC|5|Bought this for my 19 month hold who had been bundling a blanket under his head at night so I thought he might be ready to try a small pillow. The size is perfect. It's small enough that if he doesn't want to use it or just wants to cuddle it like a stuffed animal he can, or on nights when he feels like trying his big boy pillow he can do that too. My little guy is a tummy sleeper, so I needed something that wasn't too fluffy so that he still had plenty of breathing room and the depth of this pillow is perfect for that.
B000K1M9PS|5|With two kids I found we needed a larger and easy to carry diaper bag.  This is perfect, especially with all the the different compartments.  There is a place for everything and we are able to stay organized.
B00CSAWJPE|5|Bought this for my older son when he was training because after extensive research found this one the least likely to pinch little boys you-know-where (apparently a problem with some other training seats.)  It worked great and my son learned quickly with a reward approach (every time he used it he got to pick from a grab bag with small wrapped presents - just Matchbox/Hot Wheels cars and plastic dinosaurs but it worked and made the whole experience very positive.  M&M's were also used and well-received.)<br /><br />Now I have a younger son at that age and I didn't hesitate to get the same potty.  He sat on it enthusiastically but has yet to produce any results.  Going to buy some Matchbox/Hot Wheels cars in bulk and try that method again.
B004OADJ3M|5|We waited until 6 weeks to start introducing bottles to our bay girl to avoid any nipple confusion. Well our little girl was so obsessed with the real thing (a great problem to have) that it made traditional bottles a no go for us. We tried Avent, glass graco bottles and a few other freebies we received and she hated every one of them. This bottle is fairly close to the profile of a real boob so when she first latched on this thing we were so excited. She can still tell it's not a nice warm boob but she is starting to accept bottles regularly.<br /><br />The bottles are a single piece with a removable base. You fill these from the bottom. The design seems sturdy enough to last however you will not be able to add different nipples to these as they are all one piece. Pay attention to the flow and make sure you're getting something that you can use for a while. The nipple area is softer than most other bottles and much broader allowing for a traditional latch rather than a sucking latch.<br /><br />The price of these is a bit expensive but the freedom gained from having your newborn capable of taking a bottle makes it worth every penny.
B002UD65PE|5|Makes my son's crib soft and warm.
B000JIJPZY|5|we have the deluxe activity mat and it is much much better but decided to buy this one for travel. Kept our twin boys entertained and doing tummy time but lacked some of the things we enjoy most about the deluxe version. the music is lame and no lights. Still good for the price but not if it's the only activity mat you plan to buy.
B00B07SS3I|5|I love this seat, easy to install and comfy for either child. I have a 3 year old and 9 month old. It makes the stroller truly versatile.
B004HFQOM2|5|excelente producto
B0009MASS8|5|it's about time to buy exersaucer to my little son. i read all of exersaucer comment in the amzon. i like this one that i chose, because my little son starts to walk, he can use this one as a walker. that's an amazing!
B003HIXOTQ|5|I just love this podster! Much better than the other ones similar on the market because you can wash the cover if the baby has an accident! It's also nice because it has an adjustable strap to make pod smaller for tinier babies (mine was a premie approx 6 lbs when we got it)and the strap also acts as a handle for transporting to another room! This is a must have!
B0070U6RAA|5|Bought them again
B00OJN7L3I|2|The pull string broke on the return trip of the first trip I made- so only on the second flight. Disappointing.
B00C6CS8PE|5|Great quality, super soft and adorable. My daughter loves her &#34;doc bed&#34;. Highly recommended. The more you wash it the softer it gets!
B001BXRD82|5|Love this so many things that come with this set you really need all you need is the mobile. and the pretty butterflies
B00331A792|5|These work as expected and clean easily.  I like the colors and the quality of construction.  I definitely recommend these for a baby under 1 year.
B003XMWFBE|5|This holds a lot more than I thought it would and I love that it has a strap to fasten underneath the front seat so it doesn't swing around.  The fabric is very sturdy and stiff, so it holds its shape and it's very easy to reach back & grab things from the front seat.  Just an FYI...the bottom 2 pouches are big enough to hold books that are about magazine-size, which is awesome because a lot of other organizers have very small pockets.
B00FWUT38S|5|I ordered this thinking that (from the previous review) I was going to end up with a pink blanket.  I wanted pink.  So if that was their complaint then this was perfect:)  But sadly it was not pink... it was just like the picture shows... grey.  My daughter got a &#34;blanky&#34; when she was born and I have looked all over for a replacement/backup as it is everything to her.  I will keep the grey one because it is pretty neutral.  Get this!  It is great!
B00278WA4W|5|This is the third type of sippy cup we've tried, and it is the favorite simply because it doesn't leak.  We have two boys and ended up getting the purple ones in the mail (you can't specify which colors you get), but other than that we love them!
B000Z4RKAO|5|This measures just a little larger than 6 inches. It ended up not fitting between our walls. So we went with the 4 inch
B004S8MGGQ|5|Works great! I was so tired of holding the bottles while I was pumping. This makes pumping so much easier.
B004VL2VRO|5|This monitor is amazing, I absolutely love it!! I had a summer infant baby monitor and was always have issues with it.<br />Some of the features I love about this monitor are:<br />- Resolution is so clear<br />- The tilt/pan option is great (my little one moves around a lot in her crib)<br />- Doesn't interfere with other wireless networks, NO STATIC!!!!!!<br />- The intercom<br />- The temperature display<br />I would highly recommend this monitor. It's the best one out there!!!!
B003E6D6E4|5|Bought for the medela symphony part conversion to the medela classic.
B005IWNNK4|5|I was nervous about adding a second camera, I am not good at electronics! This was a simple thing to do....yet it took me 2 attempts to do it! All you do is plug it in, turn the camera and the monitor on and push this sync button on the camera. First time I did it nothing happened - but this is me we are talking about! I am jinxed! Second attempt worked! It is so nice, she can  nap in 2 different rooms now and I don't have to move the camera around!
B0068AGUUU|3|someone had put that it fits the pad that comes with graco changing table. It does not. I still like it and I can get the job done.
B0054WLFBW|5|I did a lot of research before I purchased this stroller.  I am a fan of Inglesina and was going with the Swift Twin.  However, after watching the stroller video, I was sold.  I have two grandchildren seven months apart.  This stroller folds easily. It moves smoothly in the mall.  The only draw back is it does not fit car seats.
B0034G60G0|5|Adorable brag book for grandmothers.  Comes in cardboard box with clear plastic cover which has a slightly dirty film...but book is clean.  Makes a fantastic gift...just take out if box and wrap on it's own
B008ESOICQ|5|We LOVE Booginhead pacigrip's. I have 5 or 6 & love every one of them. This red striped one is my favorite though, because it's just so dang cute! ;)
B0006BAJN6|4|I brought it to clean the inside of my nebulizer machine tube and the part where I put my medicine in because the holes are so small and it did a great job of cleaning it.
B000067EH7|4|Unfortunately, I didn't figure out that the hammock was a hammock until my son was graduating to the big bath, or I would have loved this tub even more.  As it is, I used the hammock as a liner in the tub so he wouldn't slip and slide to the bottom, though he did once in awhile anyway.  I am planning to use this tub with my soon to be newborn, as there is a little nook for the soap and any toys, so everything is ready for bathtime, and the hammock will definitely make bathtime easier for the first few months!
B00005BTNA|4|Ordered these bottles and am very happy with my purchase. They ar BPA Free and today that is a biggie. Will definately buy again.
B003XMWFBE|5|I have four loud, rowdy, messy children and this organizer has withstood these kids! It has not gapped down like others I have bought. I love this one and very pleased for my monies worth.
B008RJF4PC|1|DID NOT FIT MY NATURAL NIPPLE AVENT BOTTLES
B0050SIH7K|5|After reading all the reviews for other formula containers, I was excited about this one. I was looking for a container that was stackable - so it would fit in my diaper bag, that has individual spouts on each of the containers - so I wouldn't have to unscrew them all and attach a funnel to the container I'm trying to use. It was important to me to find a product that I would be able to use one-handed. When my baby needs a bottle - I don't have much time to spare. I need to be able to get it made ASAP - and with this product, I am able to!<br /><br />I love this product. I like the colors, I like that it's washable, it can hold a lot of formula, it's easy to pour (no tapping or hitting it to get the formula out), and I can easily snap off the lid to its \\"spout\\" with one-hand. I also like that fact that if I bought another 3 containers, I would be able to combine all 6 of them. I'm extremely pleased with this product.<br /><br />I was also impressed by the customer service. I received my order 2 days before my estimated delivery date. When my product arrived there was a small discrepancy with the product and what the product description was, but I emailed Quality Deals, and they were very quick to respond to my issue and we worked it all out. I am very pleased with this company's customer service and with the product they are selling. I highly recommend this snack container if you are in the market for one!
B005YI3IKM|5|Bought as a gift.  Well Made.
B00B8OB3L2|3|Cute, & it works. I wish it were longer, but the main issue is that it isn't padded all the way around, & it spins around easily so your arm isn't on the padded part, defeating the purpose.
B006VIJOPW|5|very good,so nice,i like it,Good, I like it, very good bottle, very fine glass bottles, but also to buy,so good
B003N9M6YI|3|They  arrived fine but they are too big for a baby's mouth.  Would not buy this again. The babies do not like them
B001GQ2RVC|5|my son loved this.I couldnt have got thru the first few months without this and what a cute design :-) defintly worth buying
B00M42XCPW|4|The dresser itself is really nice and matches the Stork Craft crib perfectly.<br /><br />Be prepared to have it collect dust while half-assembled in case your kit is missing a bunch of components like mine was. I am still missing all of the parts for two drawers and all of the support braces.
B00014PLAY|3|We ordered this product after our 19 month old daughter attempted to climb out of her crib. She had no problems adjusting to the tent and actually thought it was really fun when we initially installed it.   Here are the problems: the zipper on the tent is really loud and is very long (the length of the crib), so if you place a sleepy child into the crib, you either need to keep it unzipped (which defeats the purpose of the tent) OR zip it and risk waking the child with the loud zipping noise. Our daughter has been awakened on numerous occasions because of the noise. Another negative is that our daughter was able to make a hole in the mesh within the first two weeks we owned the product. This really disappointed us since we were planning on using this product for at least another 6 months to a year. We are going to try to patch it with a piece of fabric, but since it is a net, we are unsure how well that will work. The last major problem we have with this crib is the difficulty in changing the bed linens. My wife is not tall and already has difficulty reaching into the crib, so the tent does not lend itself to making this job any easier for her. Otherwise, this product has done its job in keeping our daughter safely in the crib at night and during naps. We would highly recommend it if the material was more durable and the tent was easier to remove.
B000UZNSYA|5|I love my 5 month's old Bee - we've used it a ton for the past 2 months and I do not regret paying the money for it. I waited until my child was 3 months before I bought a real stroller. Until then, we used a snap and go for our Graco car seat. In the meantime, I was furiously researching tons of strollers online.  There were only a few that met my requirements: under 20 lbs, seat is reversible to face me, folds in one piece, and comfortable for baby.  The Bee is one of the few strollers that met those criteria. Baby and I tested it at Neiman Marcus and he snuggled in it and looked so happy, that sealed the deal.    Some pros:  -Pretty lightweight - I definitely am glad I didn't buy the Stokee, Uppababy vista, Orbit, Mutsy, Toro, or any of the other strollers that do the same thing but are ENORMOUS and too heavy for me to lift into the trunk. Or needed to be broken into two pieces  -Fairly compact - takes up less than a third of my highlander trunk  -One-handed steer - very very easy to push and  maneuver. I can whizz through tight quarters in Starbucks and between clothing racks with no problem and the stroller feels very light even when loaded down. I enjoy steering around obstacles while other parents with the enormous strollers get stuck or have to take alternate routes (or wait outside a store because it's not worth the trouble).  -Ride is very smooth - shocks on all 4 wheels. It does go over grass and gravel, though not easily as I imagine the bugaboo chameleon would.  -Huge canopy - I live in Seattle and it's big enough to shelter him from drizzle so I don't have to use the rain canopy.  -With the baby cocoon (looks like a puffy sleeping bag), it must be really cushy as my baby falls asleep right away and is nice and warm.  -Handle is comfy  -Could be used for newborns as it reclines flat. Reclining flat is also great for baby to sleep - with the cocoon, it's like a rolling bed. :) Reclining flat does make the stroller bigger, but it's still maneuverable.Cons:  -Basket is fairly small. I can fit a medium-sized diaper bag and my purse in there, but it's hard to get to if the seat is reclined all the way.  -Cupholder you have to purchase separate.  I installed mine facing INWARDS near the bottom of the handle and this is definitely the way to go as you can fold the stroller easily without removing it.  - My baby's big - 95% height and weight.. so I imagine he won't be able to use it until he's 4. I would be completely happy even if he could only use it until 18 months. The joy of seeing his face and expressions while we walk around is priceless.    We did have a small issue where the stroller frame broke (one of the rivets snapped) and had to send it back to Bugaboo, but the customer service was awesome. They sent us a replacement frame right away (so we didn't have to wait) and we used that box to send the broken one back.
B004LE8U4Y|5|We've had this piggy bank going on a year now and everyone comments on it. It's smaller than I expected but that's part of what makes it a great ascent to our baby girl's theme. Colors have been steadfast, no fading, and good quality porcelain, I assume.
B006YBHE6M|5|It's the best gift for a baby, they love it, newborns as well as toddlers: I will recommend it !
B00LML9SYK|1|did not last a week
B00M5CMRNE|5|Not sure if it's working but it sure looks cute.
B00KTYXF22|4|This fun friend is a great addition to my son's toy box. the plush part is perfect for cuddling, while the selection of soft ribbon tags makes it a tactile toy he loves to hold and play with. The only small issue I have with it is that the 'teething leaf' piece at the bottom is a little heavy and not very soft so it's not a great teether. It would be better if it were made in silicone. Just my opinions though. I would definitely recommend this toy. We call ours, 'Hootie'. ;-)
B0090OM1F4|4|They don't fit a newborn's head, but they are very cute, well-made, and I look forward to having her wear them when she fits into them. They don't take up her entire head like some bows do.
B006QH45BG|5|All the flaws of the City Mini are now corrected in the GT model! Adjustable handle bars, back rest, sitting up right, suspension. It's the best stroller, we actually exchanged our Bugaboo Cameleon for it.
B00B1M2Q5S|5|Items arrive on time and as described
B00MVQ7J5U|5|It is perfect for reusable cup's reusable plastic straw.
B00II38IA0|5|Perfect for summer.
B002V6E5HU|3|This bag is super cute and the price is much more reasonable than other wet bags for sale online. I loved the idea of the rounded, drawstring style rather than the flat zip-top of all the other wet bags I've seen. Even so, I've found that the drawstring is too long and always gets tangled in the wash. I finally trimmed it and retied the knot and it still gets wrapped around things and has even ruined other items in the wash from getting tangled with them. Also, it became stained within the first few uses and I can't get the stains out no matter what I do. Really wanted to love this but haven't had the best experience with it unfortunately!
B00BNUVNJ8|5|I like the design of this scrub brush. It's easy to clean and does a great job cleaning bottles and glasses.
B006O1TMA8|3|I would buy this again because Peg Perego is the best car seat and I really like this stroller.  With that said, Misuse of this adapter with the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio 4/35 can be dangerous.  At first I did not think it was going to work.  That's because when you &#34;latch&#34; it in, you don't (neccesarily) hear a click.  Also, if you do hear a click that does not mean you put it on correctly.  The two spears that point up fit into a couple slots into the car seat but they don't look like they were custom made for this seat in particular.  I think they just happen to work.  With that said, when you get them in you have to test it to make sure it's safely in.  If it is safely in, then you're set.  If not, the seat will tip toward or away from you and fall.  Yeah it's scary but they (can) work with training.
B000PKJDTO|5|This bib is absolutely fantastic!  I've used other Bumkins bibs and have LOVED those too.  However, my 14 month old daughter was able to pull them off and throw them on the floor while she was eating.  This Bumkins Junior Bib gives more coverage and my daughter is unable to pull it off.  This bib is a life (and clothes) saver!
B00A0FGN8I|5|I have this car seat in the blue and absolutely love the color for my little boy.  At six months old he is 23 lbs and 27 inches long, and although he is still within the height and weight limits of the seat, we have moved him into a convertible as the Mesa is now a little cramped for him.  We still have this seat in out second vehicle should we need it though.<br /><br />The only con I can find with this seat is the weight, and that maybe just because I have a monster for a baby.  Other than that, I love the stylish look, the color options, the material on the sun shield, the ease of clean up for the fabric, and the ridiculous easy installation.  I am able to move this seat between vehicles very quickly by myself without the aid of my husband, which has been quite freeing for us since he works and I am quite active with our son.  I wish all other car seats installed so quickly and easily.  My son has been very comfortable and the padding has been enough for him, although, he does have a good amount of it himself.  I would definitely buy this carseat again.
B0038JDV4W|5|I bought a few different brands of toddler forks and spoons and this brand is so far my favorite.  I like that the fork and spoon are rounded so it's easy to scoop food up using either.  The plastic utensils I've found are more difficult to use as my daughter gets older and it's harder to stab the food with the fork.  She's almost 2 now and still uses these.
B001GIPSCK|5|This nap mat is so much more than I expected it to be!  Soft, good size, so cute, and it even has straps to be worn as a backback.  I bought it for my 19 month old son to use at mother's day out.  My daughter is 3 and has one that is not near as nice so almost bought her the butterfly one.  Only reason I decided not to was because she won't be napping much longer and actually doesn't ever take one at mother's day out anymore.
B007NG5UF4|5|Does what it says it does. I work in the garage in the back which is separate to the house and it keeps me in touch with the baby.
B004IVGD3K|5|great looking in room
B001I45IAY|2|I bought this thinking we could see the kids if we were out and left them with a babysitter.  What I found out was in order to do this the monitor must be connected to the pc.  We only have one laptop!  We don't have internet on our phones.  There is also a $10 month charge.  Had I known exactly how it worked and there was a monthly charge, I would not have bought it.
B0011FWR8G|5|From the moment that my 19 month old grandson got hold of the drumsticks, it became his favorite toy.  This gift was a total winner!
B000096PXY|5|I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent.
B0034G5VC4|5|I love this calendar, it's been the only way I've had time to record everything that's happened in my baby's first year.  It has a handy sheet of stickers will all of baby's first milestones so you don't forget anything.  It also has sheets every month to record baby's schedule, likes/dislikes and measurements.  It is so much easier for me to keep this in the nursery to just jot something down than finding the baby book and dragging it out.
B002A9JCVW|5|Love it is so beautiful I highly recommend this product specially if you have 3 girls who are really small.
B0040A12VW|5|I bought this for a friend as a shower gift.....she loves it!! Every time I see her....I wish I had bought it for myself! It has so much room, great pockets...and still looks stylish! I love this brand....I always recommend it to friends/new moms!
B00CMS0P3A|5|We've had ours for about 1 year and love it. Great design. It's an actual backpack, small but toddlers shouldn't carry much anyway. Love the bumble bee hat with the antennea too. The leash part is not too long but that's actually a plus. Gonna get the shark or dinosaur for our son.
B001NITVXA|5|I am very happy with this purchase,there was no deception invloved in the description of the item, it was delivered on time. I am very happy thank you.
B002I07FB2|5|Good stuff for my great grand baby. Makes a great gift. for the price you can get two for the baby shower.
B00I0M8RUU|5|Very pretty looking sippy cups
B004GCJMP2|5|I purchased this sliding door lock for my grandson. He is almost three and is able to open the sliding glass door on their house. Trying to keep him inside is a chore sometimes, so I thought this might help my daughter and son in law. It works well, keeps him in and also works to keep him from locking them out. I recommend it for anyone with kids or grandkids that have a sliding glass door and a curious child.
B001IYIQS0|3|Nice and strong material but the holder is easy loosen.
B0000E3D8L|1|First of all, you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident (as the police officer who installed my car seat told me.) <br />Second of all, When you buy this mirror it comes with a \\"protective\\" piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror, but when you remove it, you see that the mirror is very foggy. I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth, thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic, but it made it worse. Now the mirror is foggy, scratchy, and totally unuseable. <br />It's going back to the store today.
B00FHZW0R4|5|Attaches nicely to dining chair and does not take up a lot of space, safe and comfortable for 3 month old... Baby does not slip or slump... like the reclining feature...
B001UFCJ9O|5|We purchased two, putting one on each side of the stroller. We went to kings dominions waterpark and one we stuffed with everyones wet bathing suits (there are 7 of us!). It held perfectly. No sagging and no loosening of the straps. The Velcro straps are very sturdy and thick. Everyone asks where we got them!
B001LF3X7A|5|At last, I've found my perfect diaper bag. I've tried many other brands (Petunia Pickle Bottom, Fleurville, OiOi, Lexie Barnes and even other Skip Hop models) only to find some important element lacking - usually lack of organization, space, style or security. But this bag has it all.     *Two roomy external bottle pockets also fit sippies and 16 oz. thermos bottles   *Two interior bottle pockets also fit sippies (hard to see these pockets in the Skip Hop provided photos, but they were a nice surprise)  *Nice and roomy interior zip pocket in main compartment, large enough to fit a spare onesie, socks, and knit pants  *Foldable changing pad which is softer nylon, not the cold cheapy vinyl Skip Hop uses in the Dash and Duo lines.   *Large exterior pocket in the back fits coloring books and magazines, and has a magnet closure (magnet isn't that strong, however - wish it was a snap closure instead)  *Medium pocket in back which has antimicrobial lining. Not sure if this pocket is supposed to be for food (seems too small for use as a lunch compartment and snacks might get crushed) - it is way too big for pacifiers...would fit around 20 pacifiers though if necessary. I use it for my wallet and wristlet and hair comb. Diapers and wipes would fit here too.   *2 front zip pockets. One on top is good size for your cell and keys. One on bottom a good size for burp cloths, bibs, travel size lotions.  *Nickel feet on bottom - protects from wear and scuffs  *Beautiful ribbed nylon (not sure how nylon is \\"eco\\" though) fabric. I have this bag in black and it looks sharp.     Overall, the only thing I would change is having a snap option on the back pocket (versus magnet). That is a very minor issue compared the issues I found in other bags (poor construction, lack of interior pockets, no exterior pockets for sippies, cheap zippers, etc...). This one is a keeper, wish I had it when my second child was born a year ago!
B004EWGDG0|4|I bought this basically for the stroller.  i like the design, and the stroller was easy to set up.. The carseat is kinda cheap feeling.  The stroller is nice, and easy to push. i gave this item 4 stars based on the stroller.  The carseat could have been better, the sun canopy is really flimsy. (but this is just a back up carseat for me.) For the price you pay, this is a decent travel system.
B003LSNSKM|4|I like this except for the covers. I prefer my thirsties covers over the Bummis. The reason is that there are buttons to make the thirsties wrap shorter,  but no way to adjust the length of the Bummis. I haven't even touched my roll of liners. Also the OsoCozy prefolds were not wide enough for my baby. Even when she was very young. She was born 8lbs 4 oz. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. We ended up tri folding them in the covers. But I originally intended to use a Snappi with these. They are very soft and easy to clean. Overall, I love the prefolds and dont use anything else
B003QP31R0|1|My son kicking his feet has more bounce than this \\"automatic\\" bouncer. If anyone rated this product over 2 stars, I would honestly wonder if they worked for the company. This is a complete bait and switch. i have 4 children 4 and under. I know what a \\"bounce\\" is and this is NO automatic bounce. it is sooo slight, it is insulting.
B00FF9QFVO|5|I have purchased a Sigg water bottle, Tervis water bottle, and numerous lesser-known brand names. The Copco Hydra bottle is my absolute favorite because of it's sleek design (almost like that of a real disposable water bottle), durability, and ease of cleaning.<br /><br />The top screws off (right above the top of the pink grip), so you can easily wash it by hand or stick it in the top rack of the dishwasher. You can also use this opening to stick ice cubes or lemon and lime in it and enjoy. Other bottles have narrower openings that do not open up thus, making them harder to clean and add ice to.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this water bottle!
B000W7O7DM|5|This is the best mobile i've ever seen or had!! I love it, it just makes my daughters crib so much more alive!
B000PRUAFI|4|We use gates for both children and dogs.  This one is adaptable and easy to set up.  We have one for stairs and one to block a hallway.  A bit pricey (why I rated it a 4) but extremely well built.
B005XJ2VGY|5|My 5 months old loves this chair! I like the material as well as it is easily wipe-able. The operation of it is easy as well, although the tray (which I think its the same for most highchairs) does not slide on smoothly. Most importantly, it has got a rather small footprint!
B004FV67GG|5|This bag is so cool. Some friends of mine had one and I just had to get one.  I would highly recommend it. The fabric is very thick and great quality.  It's legit.
B002H9XCO8|4|This is just a simple ring with a knob on the end.  But it seems to do the trick.  The shape makes it easy for baby to hold on to and get into his mouth.  It's not really going to hold his attention unless he's interested in chewing it.
B001CWVYMI|1|I bought two of these, based on the reviews. I thought that they would hold up for the year or two that I would need to haul our car seats on trips. Wrong. After the first part of our first trip (2 flights), there were holes in them, which I patched up with duct tape. After the return flights, one of the bags split at the seam. Maybe our Britax Marathons were too heavy for the bags (although the car seat fit in them).
B00009IMCK|5|Bends in all sorts of ways
B006TJP8A8|4|Its works well but I am not sure how much air it allows, the baby seems sweaty at times. It does fit any stroller. My baby sometimes gets scared when she wakes up but she is only 6 months. I am hoping she will get used to it. I wish it was a different color. But it does what it says blocks the sun very well.
B000G1YW98|4|We bought this from Amazon for our dog who is recovering from spinal surgery. She was never a crate dog and being crated increased her anxiety and she struggled inside it. So we looked for a sturdy safe way to confine her without her feeling trapped and claustrophobic. This pen worked great! You can remove panels to make it bigger or smaller- we needed it small to start with- and increased it as the dog was allowed more movement. It will always be helpful when we want her contained if anyone is over who is afraid/allergic to dogs, or we don't want her running into the road if repair people have to keep coming in and out, for example. Overall, this suits our needs for many reasons. The height is perfect for our pet, too. As others have mentioned, the storage and panel removal are both excellent. The only thing I would say to watch for is that children or pets can 'move' the entire thing by pushing against it. Supervision is essential.
B008EDO768|5|I like the coverage these potty protectors provide.  They can be used for<br />all ages.  A strip or two of toilet paper in the front of the toilet seat<br />made complete cover when I used it.  Due to the variability of<br />seat sizes.  I will use them.
B004FN0Z62|5|If you are looking for a quality, but very light-weight item  -this is it. We have been searching for a quality umbrella stroller and this is the one we chose. Its so light - really. Folds up very snug and you can hold it in one arm - and your squirmy toddler in the other arm (as I found out).<br /><br />I have an 18 month old (27 pounds) and she fits in this with room to grow. The handles are at the perfect height. The turning circle is tiny and I honestly this this is the best stroller since sliced bread! It is also very sturdy and handles really well on our dirt/stone driveway as well as side walks. Very easy to open/close and push.<br /><br />The only 1 drawback for me is that there is no see-through part of the canopy - but due to the height of the seat and its set-up, you can just peer around the side of the canopy and see everything clearly (including watching your pretty little daughter shove her finger up her nostril up to her knuckle.. haha.. charming!).. but you get my point.<br /><br />Cant recommend it enough!
B00DYOQMF6|5|These glow for a long time make making it easy to find at night.
B0000CARJQ|5|Its as shown. Strong not to sharp of points. Wish it was all forks,but most i could find in one set
B000WUCJLQ|4|It took me about 10-15 minutes to assemble, and it works great so far. I don't know what others are talking about, that it doesn't swing hard/fast enough, it seems to be just fine. Plus the plug in feature is PHENOMINAL. Honestly the mobile is really cheap and when the swing is on it shakes back and forth violently, lol. I just took it off completely since it annoys me...
B002BS1NPK|1|Waste of money. There is no way to hook it up to the toilet. I would not recommend this product.
B0039MIUYY|1|Doesn't snap together properly, dangerous. My daughter sat on it and it wobbled and she fell off of it, the seat then fell into two pieces. She was too afraid to use any training poetry's similar to this and we had to switch to a seat that sets directly on the toilet.
B00007IT4Y|1|I bought this gate because we have a unique space at the bottom of our stairs and liked that it had extensions.  However, after it was bought and installed I tried to open it and had a very diffcult time.  There is no way I could open this gate with a baby in my arms.  Also, the other aspect I don't like is when the gate is open it stays to the size of the opening.  I am very unhappy with this gate and will not use it.
B0027ZARMW|5|I bought 2 of these before my baby was born because I wanted to try every cover I could and see which I liked best.  I thought these were cheap, and even though they got great reviews, I figured I wouldn't like them.  Boy was I wrong!  My little boy was 6 lbs 12 oz at birth and is currently (at almost 4 weeks) almost 9 lbs, and these fit him great.  They have from the beginning.  While other covers left gaps around his skinny legs, these covers never leak because of the gussets.  They don't leave red marks around his tummy.  They do tend to stain pretty easily, but I don't care because diapers get pooped and peed on and that's what they are for.  I'm sure I could try to sun out the stains if they bothered me enough.  I really wish I'd skipped the Thirsties Duo wraps and just bought these!  I thought I was saving money by buying adjustable covers instead of sized, but the snaps on those to adjust the rise just bug me.  These are much trimmer over a pre fold.  They do not fit very well over a larger diaper, like a Kissaluvs size 0, but they do work.<br /><br />They are cheap, but they fit and they work!  Don't hesitate to try them based on the price!
B00K5VKYIM|5|Awesome towel set, super soft for baby's skin and excellent quality for the price!!!
B00AJSISAC|5|Fits perfecly snug in our 2001 neon and in our 2006 G6. Almost like the seat was put in by the manufacture when car was built! Can't budge it at all once it is in.
B002A9JCVW|5|Works great for small spaces. Nice and sturdy. We have Dr brown bottles and works wonders for us
B001AAZ0SQ|2|The bag itself appeared to be of decent quality, but the wipe container/dispenser was broken upon arrival - it would not latch closed. Returned the bag without getting to use it.
B008RS8NRO|5|Both work great! Would reccomend.
B0011E5LXK|5|This pump is now on its 4th kid and seems to still be trucking.  I am glad that I have this model instead of the one integrated into the backpack/bag--with my daughter, we travelled by airplane a LOT (at least 1x/mo).  It was so nice just to throw the pump in my bag, with my accessories, without worrying about an entire integrated bag that I would have to make room for.  I have the great brown/blue color set.  Easy to get spare parts (I have two sets of valves/membranes and two sets of connectors, additional collection bottles, replacement tubing, etc).  Used this with the pumpin' pal handsfree system.  Liked the Pumpin Pal shields better--may have been using the PIS shields wrong or had the wrong size but the Pumpin Pal ones just seem to work better for me.
B001WAJVZM|5|Our baby loves all things shiny. Which means he was fascinated with the bathtub spout. Unfortunately, one day he stood up beneath it and got scratched by it. That is when we found Moby the spout cover. Moby was very easy to install and slips right onto the spout. We live in an apartment so we have the basic standard faucet which Moby was designed for. Moby has a clever design (hole for shower pull and slit down middle) which allows it to slip right on the faucet. Moby's mouth goes low enough that the baby is well protected from future scraps. Moby fits snug on the faucet and so far our baby has not figured out how to remove Moby. Our baby loves the little whale and will often speak whale to it. OoooooOOOOoooo! I think they are getting along quite well.
B0057EEC44|5|I have tried at least 4 other pacis and my daughter only likes this one. I don't know what it is about it, but she loves it.
B00440CZ7I|4|We had been very happy with our Kiki stainless steel bottles and were happy to be able to transform them to sippy cups when the time came. Very useful!
B001IH0SAG|5|Love love love. I can nurse anywhere and feel comfortable because it's modest.
B0054G1JSM|3|The cradler is a very good product. Earlier this year, I purchased one for my partner's car and it kept our son's head upright while he slept during trips so I decided to purchase one for my car as well
B007PDHYUE|5|I thought after washing these that they were very soft.  They are thinner but I have found that all our other terry hooded towels are just the same.  Very cute design and I would buy these again.
B001W2YCH2|5|Great! I scooped this up when it was on sale! (an awesome deal if you can wait it out.) It does not smell! Perfect!
B005DOK1ZC|5|I was happy with this product and received it promptly .
B000VXLBAY|5|I got this to make a baby gift basket for my sister-in-law who is due in a few months along with the Lambs & Ivy Little Princess Basket Liner to line it with and this is such a cute basket set.<br /><br />I haven't put the basket together yet, but I think it is going to be the perfect size for all I got to put into it. I'm still collecting items to put into it. It seems to hold quite a bit of stuff.
B00C9A8MQS|5|Loved it.  Great for kids.
B003WM0EMC|5|this product is what i inteded it to be, i would recommend anyone who is looking for this product to search no further! My sons loves it
B002VLR6JE|1|Missing pieces. Had to return it.
B000V88HJM|2|I used to have an alligator nail clipper with a light which I can no longer find.  I tried this one for my new baby but the magnifier just put me off and I ended up using it like a regular nail clipper.  I found another nail clipper with a light on amazon and have ordered that instead.
B0075XBEYQ|5|Baby loves it
B003D7E2XI|5|This was a great purchase! Need it at about 3.5 months when I started to feel back pain. BUY IT WITH THE JERSEY COVER. Also, I didn't wash it right away because of the other reviews complaining about how hard it was to get back on...uh, have you ever changed a duvet cover? That is hard. This was NOTHING! It was so much softer after a washing. I was in so much pain I pretty much bear hugged this thing right out of the package and didn't let it go, but now it's much softer. I think it's great. It prevents you from rolling onto your back which is a no-no at around 18 + weeks.<br /><br />It is large..we have a king bed and it's great. But yea, if you're sharing a full, don't do this to your partner. It will smush them off of it. Just upgrade to a Queen :)<br /><br />BUY THIS!
B0033RIE28|2|This swing is not cheap. And still it falls short in three areas.  First, the seat of the swing is supported by metal bars that span the length of the seat.  You can easily feel these bars when you touch the seat.  Either they are too close to the surface or the padding is too thin.  Either way, it doesn't seem comfortable for the baby.  Second, while there is a plastic handle that hangs over the seat and dangles the toys from the top to entertain the baby (a plus), this handle doesn't move in front of the baby enough.  The kid would have to look directly up to see them.  Third, there are basically no differences in swing speed and the swing can not use the baby's weight to determine the speed.  My baby was being thrown around like crazy in this swing in the beginning (and he was born over 10 pounds).  Now that he is bigger, the swing isn't the roller coaster it used to be but now it seems like there is just one speed.  I would not recommend this product.
B000BH79YW|2|2 yrs ago, I bought this for our son from Babies R Us and LOVED it!!  it was soft and flexible and suction worked great!  fast forward 2 yrs and now that I have a daughter I decided to buy another one in pink.  but this time I ordered it on Amazon.  I don't know if maybe Amazon has a defective batch, I was a little confused at first.  Now I'm wishing I had just returned it but now it's too late.  The mat is slightly smaller and it's no longer a soft flexible rubber.  It is more stiff and the suction barely works.  so yes my 11 month old constantly pulls it off the table.  I have to keep pressing it down.  If you want to try it out, I say buy it at Babies R Us so that you can open the box and see for yourself.  Because the one I bought here is pretty much useless if it doesn't stay on the table.
B00F0T8WWE|5|One of the essentials to have on hand when bringing a newborn home.  Our baby is 2  months old now, and we have used the nail clippers and nail files the most often.  Also the baby brush and comb are soft and useful after baths.  I can see the other items will come in handy as our baby grows. The carry case is convenient.  The clear pockets are useful so that we can see the contents at a glance. I'm glad we bought this.
B00H3X7ZSW|3|The screen works okay but has some problems with the suction cups failing from time to time.  You must clean the window very well before putting it on and it still has a tendency to lose suction from one or more of the cups.  While it works, it does a good job of blocking sunlight.
B00BXE5NWM|4|I would have loved these sippy cups if it wasn't for the fact that the spout is so hard to clean unless you use a dishwasher. We do not, but I can imagine that this would not be a problem for most people. Other than that everything is great about it - it is leak proof, you can adjust the flow, easy to use with only 3 parts. Oh - and the only sippy my son likes!
B008HCXIU2|5|It works very well, I use it on the back seat and I can look to my daughter while I drive.<br /><br />It is also good for her, because she can see herself in the mirror, that keeps her entertained.
B002T44LFK|4|She actually took out the bear and put in her favorite stuff animal, which is a rabbit and it fits perfectly. Love it.
B00003TL7P|3|I had received both the Diaper champ and a Diaper Genie for my baby shower, unsure how the diaper champ would work, I hung on to both of them. Thank god I did. The concept of the Diaper Champ works great, very easy to use, although in the first two day that I brought my newborn home, the odor was so bad that little fruit flies were flying around in the room. Also when you open it up to empty it the bag isn't sealed so the odor escapes then. I have put my Diaper Champ aside and have opened my Diaper Genie, which has worked extremely well. I would rather by the refills that deal with the odor.
B002QYW8LW|5|Cute and practical.
B00RY9P3AW|5|Love this bag!!
B00AHQADD6|5|This is such a helpful pillow!  My baby has lots of spit up- placing her in the lounger while I do things with the others kids has been a life saver :). Would def recommend this to others
B000IDSLOG|5|I shrugged it off when many of my friends suggested I buy this toy (a 20 dollar squeeking giraffe? Really?). But after seeing my friend's twins obsessed with it, I broke down and bought it for my son. The second it was out of the box he grabbed it, stuck it in his mouth, and hasn't put it down since. I have tried every known teething ring and teething product out there (ones with cooling gel from the fridge, ones that vibrate, etc) but my son held them for a milisecond then tossed them on the floor. Sophie will pay for herself in the first week. She costs less than half of what I payed for every one of those teethers combined. Wish I had bought her 2 months ago, when he first started teething.
B008EF1R7I|2|too much lint.
B001I481LM|5|Never thought I'd care enough about a formula mixer to write a review... but here I am. We have twin boys. Both on different formulas due to a mild protein allergy in one. Both who drink a LOT of formula, more and more every day... so we are making a LOT of formula. We have two of these mixers, one for each formula just to be careful, and we LOVE them. They make making formula fast and easy, NO clumps, no clinking spoons on sides of pitchers, no trying to get a fork in there to get out a clump, easy to pour spout. Don't even hesitate, put it in your cart right now and you won't look back.
B00AAJNHA6|3|The monitor has nice functions and works pretty well.  For the price it does a lot. I have 2 cameras (& could get 2 more).  It has a sleep function to conserve battery life, can turn music on the camera on from handset, can talk through camera from handset, can move camera over quite a large range from handset, good nightvision with no bright lights on camera, simple zoom function, can sit on shelf or comes with screws to hang on wall.<br /><br />My problems: occasionally it loses connection even though my house isn't very big; it has an awful humming/buzzing noise that will drive you crazy if it's quite when you have it on; disappointed in manufacturers customer service.<br /><br />About the buzzing noise: I don't notice it as much when I'm using it during the day & the other kids are making noise in the house or the tv or radio are on. However at night it is really annoying.  The solution is to turn on the sleep function; when it's on the monitor turns off after about 30 seconds & just the blue light around button blinks occasionally until baby makes noise, then the screen turns on again.  This handy function eliminates the buzzing noise since it is silent when the monitor goes to sleep.  It also makes the battery last for a long time (I use it all night & an hour or 2 during the day & only need to charge it every 4 days or so).<br /><br />Customer service: Poor. I emailed the company asking if the buzzing noise was normal. They told me to switch plugins from camera to monitor and re-pair the cameras to monitor to see if it helped. It didn't change anything.  They said I can mail it to them to see if it's a warranty repair, however that will take 2-4 weeks after they receive it plus shipping back time...which means I won't have a monitor for potentially 6 weeks...that does NOT work for an item I use 10-12 hrs every single day! They also didn't even know their product well enough to suggest that I use the sleep function. I'm not impressed & will never buy a productfrom them again.<br /><br />However, in the end it was very affordable for a nice camera with a big screen on handset & is expandable up to 4 cameras like I needed.<br />(Functions I wish it had: I wish it were able to be remotely turned on since I put baby down for a nap & forget sometimes to turn camera on; I wish camera could run on batteries so it were a little more portable sometimes).
B000VK2RGE|5|I bought this as a gift for a baby shower. The recipient loved it and thought it was very cute. The frog is a pretty good size (around 16inches or so long) so her child will be able to keep it for years. It seems durable and well made. It is very plush and soft to the touch. All in all this product is exactly as described and makes a wonderful gift.
B00005JIVI|5|I had originally bought the &quot;traditional&quot; hard baby tub for my son.......that was my first mistake. Dont waste your money on those! He would constantly slip downward or side to side.  It was very scary for him and bath time ended up being such an unpleasant experience for him.  I wish I had done research and found the Safer Bather first.  This tub is fantastic!!!  It cradles your infant and there is no fear of slipping in any direction for them.  The cloth material is very comfortable, warm, and it helps keeps your baby in place.  This product is a MUST and no baby should do without!!
B00AHVR1RM|2|I needed a new carseat after my old one expired.  I wanted another Graco since I already have several Graco strollers and I love how they fit together so easily.  I chose this one since it was gender neutral and a really good price on sale.  Once it arrived I realized there were 3 things I REALLY didn't like about it.<br /><br />1.  The canopy top can't move all the way to the front like my old one.  The back has to stay tucked around the back end of the carseat, so no pulling the shade all the way forward to get the sun out of baby's eyes or let them have a darker place to nap when running errands.<br />2.  The fabric was just not great.  It wasn't breathable like the SnugRide 30's I had been looking at in the store.  I had read other reviews where people said their babies would sweat like crazy in this material.  I could definitely see that happening.  It may be easier to wipe up messes, but it wasn't going to let my baby's skin breath well.<br />3. I absolutely hated that to tighten the shoulder straps you had to do so from the back of the carseat, and each strap was tightened separately.  I loved my old model that just tightened both so easily from one strap near the front buckle, and the SnugRide 30's seem to have the same feature.<br /><br />So even though it was a great deal, I returned this seat (Amazon is GREAT at returns by the way!) and am now looking at spending just a tad more so that I can get one with all those features I miss so much from my old model.  This seat is just fine if none of those issues would be bothersome to you.  I just know they would bug me.
B001Q3L9UK|5|This is a great cover for a baby carrier.  I have a Graco car seat and it fits great - with holes for each of the straps and the clip.  It does not get in the way or change how the seat works at all!  The outer coating is water-resistant and works better than a blanket. The two side zippers are large and easy to use.  They are placed so the baby doesn't touch them at all, yet are convienent for mommy to use.   The blanket on a \\"Lite\\" is thin and works great for fall/spring or a light winter (no colder than 40 degrees) - wouldn't recommend it for freezing cold areas for winter get the other \\"bundle me\\".  The green in the picture is accurate and nicely bright and hasn't faded.
B00931XBGW|1|Never could get this to work
B00183VDYA|5|Love this pacifier attacher. I took my 3 month old on a trip across the country and it was a lifesaver! Stayed attached really well, and never fell off or loosened up until I took it off. The bright colors helped it to be seen.
B007NG5UF4|5|Great reception and the 2 way talk feature is FABULOUS! We have it in our 5 year-old's room and it is so sweet to talk with her in the morning or when she needs something.
B0007XTN5S|2|My son is 10 months old and weighs close to 25 lbs.  I put this on , tried adjusting it as much as possible trying to find the comfort but the entire pressure of the baby rests on the neck.  I went in and out of Toys R Us to get diapers with this on and when I was done I was left with a red mark on my neck like whiplash.  I cannot imagine wearing this with a baby close to 35 pounds.  Even though it was not good for me.. my baby seemed very comfortable. I will now look for a back carrier.
B00CYRYUXU|5|These worked great on the back of the wheel chair at Disney!
B005JHH1VK|5|Great for traveling, very compact, sturdy and very light to carry on. It doesnt recline at all, but our little 11m had no problems to sleep.
B000V8UPIS|5|Perfect
B00LP85Q7S|1|It's bad for the baby
B00DIH3XNS|5|My child does not use a pacifier so it took her a while to use this but the nice thing is the entire thing is soft plastic.  So the child does't have to put the part that goes in their mouth there.  My child chews mostly on the handle.
B000BFR3PE|5|Very good
B009AVQ1VC|5|These are the only pacifiers that my baby will accept since she was a newborn. She is breastfed and I even tried giving her the \\"breastfed baby safe\\" kind of pacifiers that are shaped differently, but always spit them out but she always held on her her MAM pacifiers.<br />Great brand!<br /><br />(I've always picked mine up in Walmart so I don't have to play around with being shipped the wrong color, I don't have patience for that kind of funny business!)
B0040T80JA|3|It is a nice pack of baby washcloths. They have nice colors to them, but some did shrink. It's weird because I would wash them all together and some shrunk. As you all probably know baby washcloths are small already, so the ones that shrunk are tiny! I still use them to clean his face with and stuff. I don't think I would buy them again though.
B009IVKY7Q|5|I can't believe we don't have this in canada! I love it, it's easy and convenient :) and healthy snacks for on the go for all the family even I will be using this for when I get my jaw surgery I would recommends to any one I got a few friends after seeing mine that ordered
B00LML9Q6U|5|Awesome product. Used it around fireplace hearth. Saved a few bumps
B000067PQ0|5|Must have for all new moms. Helps relieve pain, gives baby a chance to nurse when engorged and saves Mommy's sanity!
B00A1WETZ4|2|The wallpaper boarder is pretty but does not stick to the wall at all. It kept on falling down, and the paper was not sticky enough. Disappointed in the wallpaper boarder and for the price I paid plus shipping I'm not happy.
B00CG3CE4Y|5|Great. Nice and soft and love that you can use each bib for a couple meals and just keep turning it to a clean spot before you throw it in the laundry.
B005JBXG7Y|3|its ok
B000FDSNAG|5|Very sturdy and hardy bag for my umbrella stroller.  Takes abuse and still looks great.  Doesn't fall off.  Worth the price.
B004KBLDHO|5|The Tommee Tippee bottles have become one of my favorite. When the baby had collic we as parents were at a loss as to what to do for him. These bottles showed up just in time and worked like a charm. I'm not saying they fixed everything but they did provide some much needed comfort to the baby and helped us, help him. If you have a collicy baby, I would suggest giving these a try.
B007VBYVWE|3|Probably should have realized this from closer reading, but these weren't the fluffy version that I remember from a few years ago.  They were thinner in both the padding in the center and the thinner material at the sides.  They weren't bad - just not what I expected.
B0081ZOV06|5|I bought these for my 4 month old son. He has loved the original Soothie, so I wanted to try these, the &#34;Super Soothie&#34; as they call it. They are stiffer and the rubber base is a bit thicker. He really enjoys them. I think they feel more like a finger (which is his usual preference if he can grab someone's hand!) He likes to switch between the softer and harder ones depending on his mood. I just wish they made the WubbaNubs with the option of this one.
B00LZKT9YM|5|really good size easy to apply
B005PWVIZE|5|We recently renovated our kitchen and didn't want to drill into our new cabinets. These gadgets do not create any damage and are VERY EASY to take off and put back on. I have several and they come in black and white!
B0087SXE1O|2|My baby received this rattle as a gift and enjoyed it until it started incessantly buzzing.  The sound mechanism must have malfunctioned and went from cute monkey noises to a constant and loud buzz.  Replacing batteries did not fix it so it's just a hard plastic toy at this point.
B000E57F3Q|3|I absolutely loved this diaper bag with the funky color & was able to hold everything I needed. The CD holder is adorable but really, who needs it?  I actually cut out the cd folders & used it for extra powdered formula or extra disposable bibs or a burb cloth.  The straps broke though after only 3 months.  I am now looking for a good replacement & haven't found one I truly am happy with yet.  I will probably try the Expo which is quite a bit more money but looks like it may be constructed better.
B006Z2BZAQ|5|I am very pleased with this purchase.I bought this mattress for our evenflo pack'n play and it fits perfectly. There is no gaps for babies arms or legs to get caught. This mattress is very comparable to a crib mattress (only it's smaller). The firmness not too hard & not too soft. The thickness is also very good. My baby sleeps all night comfortably.
B006ZVV0P2|5|Thank you Britax for making these.
B00M1Y5ANK|5|Absolutely love this car seat! Very functional and user friendly. Our son looks very comfortable in this. The side impact protection is quite large and takes up more room than some of the other car seats we looked at. But, I guess you can't put a price on protection and I'm all for it.
B009X4C796|1|We have been using this car seat for four months and LOVE it! It was purchased for baby when she was 6 months old after we were rear-ended. I decided to upgrade baby to a convertible at that time instead of purchasing a new infant carrier (which baby and I both hated). After doing extensive research, I decided this was the car seat for us.  Why we love it: SO comfy. The seat is well padded and provides excellent support for baby. The strap pads are a nice touch. The fabric is heat- friendly. It stays cooler than traditional car seat fabric. This was a must for our Arizona family. It sits higher up than most convertible car seats I looked at. This allows baby to see out the windows even being in the center back seat of the car. The deep seat allows plenty of room for baby to grow taller and still be rear-facing comfortably.  I have a tall baby and was worried about her legs having enough room while rear-facing. No problems there with this seat. EASY strap height adjustment. Um, hello, ain't nobody got time to re-thread car seat straps. Another HUGE plus of this seat - NO re-threading! Easy to install. I will admit that I had the fire-department install it (free of charge) the first time because I wanted peace of mind. I have since had to move it between cars several times and it's a breeze with the latch system. I recommend using the fire department the first time because they provided really helpful tips and education regarding car seat safety. They also showed me how to install it, which was more helpful than the instruction manual. Great price for such high-quality. I realize there are cheaper car sears out there, but they're...well, cheap. It's worth it to me (and my husband) to spend more on better quality, especially where baby is involved. And while this isn't the cheapest, it's also nowhere near the most expensive.  Some things to take into consideration: This is not a lightweight car seat. Which is not a problem, but I wouldn't travel with it. We are doing some traveling this summer and I know I'll have to invest in a cheaper/more lightweight car seat. This doesn't bother me at all because I wouldn't want this nice seat damaged during travel. Just something to take note of. I don't know that it would fit with 2 other car seats on the same bench. Obviously this isn't an issue for most of us (3 babies?? AH!!!), but I have a friend who has twins and another on the way, so she had to go with a [much more expensive] more compact option. The instruction manual was difficult to make sense of. Since I had the fire department install it, this wasn't an issue for me. But I did read through it and found it to be confusing. Another reason to have the fire department install!  In conclusion, we love this car seat. It fits in the back of my PT Cruiser with ease. Baby is comfortable and loves riding in the car now! I recommend this seat to everyone.  UPDATE 6/29/16: This seat is not even 2 years old and I had to stop using it. The tether to tighten/loosen the straps has never been particularly easy to use but it was getting worse. I noticed the other day it's because the strap is ripped. It's almost impossible to tighten/loosen the straps so we had to stop using the seat. This is a $200 car seat. Things like this should NOT happen. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality.
B004B0VT32|5|This is brilliant. I used it all the time to warm up bottled breast milk on the go. Saved a lot of hassle.
B00B8OB2I6|3|The only issue I take with this is, the cover doesn't actually tie to the cart. It's just stretched over it. Not that you should ever, but you can't really take your eyes off the cart for longer than a second if your child is anything like my daughter. I'm constantly worried that if I turn away to grab something, she could pull the cover off and hurt herself. It is cute, though, and the pockets and toy loops are very handy.
B00CQBMPF4|5|Product is good. Son likes it. We set it up a little different
B00FS4LW00|5|I like the design and quality of material. Also it costs much cheaper than other brands
B00E1CI2MG|5|Avent is my go to bottles and of course you need the nipples. Our baby had gas issues and Avent was our life saver. This nipple is for thicker liquids (like when you put baby cereal on their milk) and also bare in mind that you need to figure out if your baby is ready for it. Hint - How I can tell is when he drinks and the nipple keeps shrinking to where he can suck anymore.
B001ODAHF0|2|I thought this would be great stroller given the postive reviews.  But I have found the ride to not be smooth, the front wheel is very loud.  The seat is not comfortable and the straps are very hard to adjust.  It does however turn very easily.  It has not been used and is collecting dust we now use the Britax B-Agile stroller and love it.
B008KW8J8K|5|I bought this chair for my 2 year old and she loves it. Well made chair, pretty easy to clean.
B001PTGPXQ|4|My son is a fan of disney's car franchise, so this stool was a good idea and it is sturdy.
B0006B4BVW|4|Our little boy falls asleep much  more quickly and sleeps a TON more soundly when he is swaddled.  We have found the fleece version to be more secure than the cotton ones, but a little too hot during the summer months.     Pros of the Kiddopotamus:   -much quicker than blankets   -more secure than any blanket we've tried (the best blanket we found, if you're interested, was the stretchy thermal Gerber one)   -held our little man's arms tight for the first 6 to 8 weeks    Cons:   -our little guy is a little older he is able to get his hands up by his face.  We thought this might be a good thing, as he likes to suck on his fingers, but we've found that when we reswaddle him with his arms by his sides he falls asleep quickly.
B002ZDFVP4|5|I really love this bed rail, it doesn't move if a child rolls up against it. I would recommend it for a toddler bed.
B0002JETPQ|1|False advertising,  it said that it was a swing gate under the description. This is a slide gate not a swing gate. I will never purchase anything from them again.
B0015IVQKY|5|We have used these spoons since our 2.5 year old was 10 months. Perfect for getting food in and not hurting her. She now uses it on her own.
B00AHVR6T0|4|It was easy to put together. It is very durable and easy to get my grandson in and out of, and clean up is also very easy! I love the hoot owl design and the easy to place and remove tray and that I can convert it to a booster seat when needed. The only draw back for me is that it doesn't just fold up for quick and easy storage. It has a great base of support, but unfortunately takes up more space than I would have preferred.
B009Z2GYK4|5|We have mostly Alva diapers (which we love) but we also love these diapers! The double open ends make it sooo much easier to get the liners out. We double stuff all our diapers and these hold two liners perfectly. There's really no complaints about these diapers besides I wish I would have found them before I purchased the majority of my stash.
B004QXX06I|5|I got this item for my daughter for daycare. We love it. It's easy for her to roll up and put away or carry. It's soft and she loves it
B0050GD2EA|4|This item is awesome. It has ties so that the wind cant blow it off. The plastic is soft and durable. My only complaint is the front bottom is tearing but it still holds in place very well
B0058K5IIQ|5|When our son started to stand up, he often banged his head on the wood flooring we have.  My wife and I were looking for a large size play mat we can buy as a cushion as well as his play area.  Once we started the search, we quickly realized how expensive these large mats could be, and while we loved our son, we could not see ourselves paying so much for a mat.<br /><br />Then we came across this play mat.  We were skeptical with the price and description, but at the end we decided to take a chance.  When we received the package, we were very impressed with the quality of the mat.  It is quite thick and soft.  The surface is really easy to clean, and after 6 months of use, it still looks brand new.<br /><br />The graphics printed on the mat are interesting but not as nice and well finished as more expensive ones.  You can see where the graphics just repeat, but that does not seem to bother our son (and definitely not my wife and me).  It is a great buy for the price.
B000KW5I6E|5|I took this with me to the hospital and used it right away with my newborn. It is perfect for providing that additional support needed to elevate the baby into the right positioning and give your arms a break! It is funny because every time I put my little one on it she knew it was feeding time so it helps with the ritual I think. I bought a cover for it since there will be stains from time to time and it will protect the pillow. You can get covers on Amazon or some really cute & creative ones on Etsy. Definitely a must-have in my opinion. This came in a clear plastic zip case you can use to port it around to protect it from dust and other things if you need to for travel or storage.
B0009ET94A|5|I have to say this is one of my favorite products!, I have given this to family and friends for their babies
B001QXCF12|5|While switching from the bottle to the cup we ran into some problems with the speed of the flow.  My daughters bottles had a &#34;rapid&#34; flow nipple on it which made drinking from spill proof cups really tough. Tried these as the package stated it was &#34;easy to sip&#34;.  It is the only cup she will use other than the ones with the straws.  A lot of the other sippy cups require the child to squeeze the spout while drinking.  Not an easy task for someone who is used to a quick flow.  This one seemed to be the easiest for her while remaining spill proof--she shakes it as heard as she can and nothing every drips out of it.
B00B9ZHLRU|4|This is a pretty good product. I have three, which I fill by pouring puree from my blender into a zip bag and squeezing through a corner hole into the Keeper Pouch. The entire process from hitting &#34;puree&#34; to filling these pouches is about 2 minutes. The lids are harder to get clean and for some reason my latest blend of corn and pineapple (for my toddler) isn't cleaning out of here well. Maybe the acid in the pineapple? First time it's done that in about 2 months of using it. Also, you have to put your finger over the cap or put the twist cap back on to &#34;shake it down&#34; when it's nearly empty, or you'll miss about 1/5 of what is in the container. These are nice for on-the-go squeezies with my toddler. They don't leak and I think they're a good buy for the price point. I really don't think the filling station is necessary for this product unless you're filling more than 3-5.
B006SFUEF2|5|We bought this when my 2 year-old started having nightmares and problems sleeping. She had always slept perfectly with the light off before, then suddenly refused to go to bed and would scream when we left her room. I think this was probably designed for babies, but it gave just the right amount of comfort (soothing music and light) to help distract my toddler from being alone, and helped her to fall asleep by herself again. A real life-saver, and although she now goes to sleep fine, she still asks to have this music on as I think she likes the background noise. I would definitely recommend this product.
B008RXZ90I|4|I looove it!!! it does spill, but not as bad as i thought it could be. My Emma looks pretty drinking her juice in this beautiful cup
B005MQRH08|5|Love this head support. Good price and great quality! Would definitely purchase again. It worked perfectly for my twin boys.
B00834D5SO|5|A definite reccomend for this carseat.  My baby transitioned from her infant seat into this car seat and no longer cries when the buckle snaps into place, she sleeps comfortably.  There is plenty of room for her to grow (she's rear-facing and 22 pounds).  Though it took a little bit of time for me to find and figure out everything, within 30 minutes (minutes which included 4 children whooping and hollering and asking me questions) it was installed and ready to go.
B00K08IS2Y|5|These are the best sheets ever! I read many great reviews before purchasing one but most got the sheet free for reviewing it. I paid for mine and can tell you I ordered a second. My grandson started pulling up the sides of my previous sheets and I worried he would become entangled in them. He cannot do that with these. And they are so soft. They wash up great. What a great product!
B007UYBOJU|3|The item could use some more cushion where the children sit.  The dual cup holders are very nice.  My 5 year old didn't complain or anything about the item.  I did ask him how it felt when he was sitting on it and he said just &#34;ok&#34;.  This isn't one that is certified to the child use on an airplane BUT 100% works for a car no issues at all.
B000FFQD10|5|I have issues with my ears, so the decent is always a problem for me.  Not with these things!<br />I've never had a better plane ride.  Next time will buy a pair for my husband too.  He's starting to have problems with his ears on planes.
B0001WMZSC|1|I bought this for my daughters room ,she is 22 months old.  I wanted a place for her to keep her books.  After putting this together, it was very wobbley...it swayed, it was not sturdy at all.  Then once I tried to move it...things just went downhill.  I did not feel that this product was safe enough to place in her room.  So I took it back, and haven't purchased a replacement.  I am a huge target shopper, love their stuff, but this was a let down.
B004AHKUHM|1|This monitor just stopped working and could not get it to turn back on.  Its in the garbage and we had to buy a different one.
B004HFQOM2|4|bought this as a gift for a baby shower and it arrived exactly when you should of! great experience and awesome product.
B001G87KYE|4|I have a medical condition that prevents me from making a full milk supply.  This device is what has made nursing at all possible for me.  I have used it with all 5 of my babies.  It is not easy to use at first, but with practice, it gets easier.  I would recommend getting the baby to the breast before s/he is crying, so that you can both be more patient.  I would also recommend having a lactation consultant that is VERY familiar with this teach you how to use it.  The tube has to be in the exact right place to work.  I have found that it works better than the full size SNS and is less cumbersome to use.  I also break off the clip that comes with it and string the black ring around some elastic.  Then I tie the elastic to make a necklace that slides easily over my head and wear it around my neck.  That also makes it less cumbersome.  You will also need a roll of first aid paper tape to tape the tube to your breast.  This only comes with one strip.<br />I will say that it is easier for bigger babies to use.  My last one was 9 and 1/2 lbs and he did great with it.  But there were still times that I had to latch him on 3 or 4 times before we got the tube right. Again it is best to start the feeding during the early hunger signs like sucking rather than crying.<br />I use this for the first 2 weeks after birth when you should be in bed anyway, then I switch over to nursing and topping off with a bottle when I have to get up and start being mom to everyone again.  I love this product and am so grateful that it exists because I would never have been able to get my babies hooked on nursing without it.
B0058K5IIQ|5|I purchased this play mat for my baby who was just starting to roll over. This mat is of good quality and has colorful pictures to keep baby interested. It is easy to clean as well. I would recommend wiping down this mat with a wet washcloth before allowing baby to play on it.
B0032AMM9M|5|We really like these wipes! We had purchased some of the hemp blend wipes from Kissaluvs and were disappointed because they were so scratchy and just didn't clean him up very well. Flannel is the way to go! These are soft and absorbent. We have a little bottle of wipe solution that we make and just put a little on the wipe for cleaning him up. Will purchase again!
B000JIHP88|4|We bought this and our baby loved it, but the leaves would slow down considerably when they were going up and down, almost to stopping.  We thought it was broken so we exchanged it for a new one, and the second one did the same thing, so we just figured we had to live with it that way.  With some more use though it seems to be doing better.<br />The music is great- it calms the baby down.  He also likes the motion- keeps him from getting too restless in his crib while I read or sing to him.  You can turn the motion or the nightlight on and off, and the music can be loud, soft, or off, so you can create any combination you want (including all 3).  Some people have said it's too quiet, but I think it's the perfect volume, even with the white noise playing in our son's room, he seems to be able to hear it just fine, and the quieter setting is perfect for helping him doze off.<br />Overall a great mobile, we're very happy with it, and glad the slow motion didn't prove to be a chronic problem, as that was annoying.
B000FT7NSI|5|I did read all the reviews from this crib in this website and others and 90% of them were positive and the negatives were about how long it it took to put it together or a few scratches due to the white color, so I went for it and I'm amazed about how beautiful and secure this crib is, no scratches, no negative things about it!! I'm really happy for my purchase, and it took my husband 40min to put everything together!! I would recommend this crib 100%!!!
B001PTGPUY|4|The functionality of this potty seat is great - it fits so easily in the bag and goes with us everywhere.  The plastic is sturdy, even with the hinges, so my so feels comfortable using it.  The only drawback I have noticed is that the seat can slip around on slick surfaces toilets - your little one might need your help to steady themselves.  This has not been a detraction - my son loves to use his seat.
B001L7O2W8|4|This bedding is just lovely, exactly what I was looking for a present, just amazing.
B001OC5UMQ|4|Works great. Older Kids can get thru easily & don't have to take down & put up everytime you need to go in other room.
B0018ZVT4M|5|These are so hard to find in the stores.  I use these in the bottom of my special needs daughters bath chair.  She does not like the mesh feeling on the seat and this keeps her from slipping around.  I have had many before and I have even washed them in the washing machine a few times to make them last a little longer.  I always order two or three at a time so I can have them on hand.
B00008439C|5|I am very pleased with this product.  My 4-month old has only been taking 20 minute cat-naps and I needed some way to encourage longer sleep during the day.  I thought maybe a background noise would help.  I did a TON of research and review-reading before making this purchase.  I was concerned after reading the reviews about the lack of volume that has been claimed for this product, but have not found this to be an issue at all.  The volume levels are not too soft at all.  In fact, I often worry about it being too loud.  It has a great volume control to fit your needs.  We use the ocean sound, and at first I was worried because one wave sound is louder than the rest, but turning the volume down one notch solved this so it wasn't overbearing.<br /><br />The sounds are fantastic.  My husband likes to play with the blending of various sounds.  There is no break in the repeat of the noises and you cannot tell when the sound is starting its cycle over again, as I have read on so many other sound sleepers.  There is a HUGE variety of sounds as well.  I was impressed.  It has something that should match anyone's needs.<br /><br />It's a huge advantage to have the sound sleeper be battery operated or able to plug into a wall.  It's been a piece of cake to quickly unplug and use it on battery power when my son has fallen asleep in our bedroom or another location.  I love this feature.  We live overseas with the military, and when we vacation we can still take it with us to use on the batteries, since we can't use the plugs here without an adapter/transformer.<br /><br />We love the timer that is on the sound sleeper as well.  We usually let it run on \\"on\\" until my husband and I go to bed.  Then, when I am going into my son's room to check on him for the last time in the evening, I simply flip the button to timer and an hour later it goes off when we're all asleep.  Love the timer feature.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this product more than 5 stars if the ratings were higher.  It was a fantastic purchase for very little spent.for very little spent.
B0071D1AKI|5|Perfect for our faucet. Easy to use.
B006WAF1X8|1|Very small
B00LC92KH4|4|I have had the clek fllo for a month now and overall, I do love it as a car seat.  The Fllo fixed majority of the \\"issues\\" that people had with the Foonf.  I had the Foonf, and had to return it because it wouldn't fit in any of my vehicles (Prius, 4runner and Accord) and for several other reasons/issues that are well known about the Foonfs.  What I think the Fllo excels at where the Foonf did not:  1. Size - it is significantly smaller than the Foonf, but it is still big.  2. Weight - it is significantly lighter than the Foonf, but still weights a lot more than other convertible car seats on the market with similar specs and safety ratings.  3. ARB Bar - it is SO much easier to install the ARB bar on the Fllo than the Foonf.  It slides right into place.  The Fllo fits into our `10 Prius nicely.  It is a little bit too big as it is really close to touching the driver side seat but it manages.  I have very little to no rear view obstruction.  It fits into my '03 4runner nicely!  No rear view obstruction!  We recently went on a trip and rented a car.  My original rental was a Jeep Liberty and there is no way it would fit in the rear middle with and allow for a comfortable driving position.  No way it would fit on any of the sides either.  I had to return the rental car and get another one.  This time I got a Chrysler Town and Country.  It fit nicely into the side captains chair and was getting close to touching the back of the passenger seat but it was definitely manageable.  I wish I got a picture of the seat in the Liberty but I was too cold and too frustrated (was in freezing temps in Colorado at the time).  So here is where it went all DOWN HILL with the Clek.  If you plan on traveling with this car seat, be forewarned! Let me give you a little background about my travel experiences.  I am a 35 year old male IT consultant and travel around California and the US on numerous flights.  I hold A-List Preferred status with Southwest, Premier Platinum with United and Platinum with Marriott.  I know how to travel and do it efficiently.  SHORT STORY: DON'T TRAVEL W/ THE CLEK. Sure, you can get the WeeLee bag for it, and sure it is FAA approved... but it is NOT worth the trouble you will face at the airport.  Not only you struggling to get it out of your car, pack it into the WeeLee, lugging the monstrosity through the airport, etc.  Sure you can fight with the airline and TSA and the US Marshall and almost get arrested for raising your voice... I assure you, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  There are MANY other very nice car seats (Diono) that are EASIER to travel with and literally 1/3 the size.  If you are bored and want to read my long story continue below:  I read up on traveling with a Clek Fllo or Foonf and using their WeeLee travel case.  All users said they had to put up a fight with the airlines to even get it through sercurity, let alone gate check or even carry on (WeeLee folded up in overhead after boarding).  So I prepared myself with knowledge that this seat is FAA approved, Southwest (along with other airlines) \\"automatically\\" allow you to bring a car seat on the plane, blah blah blah.  So we are traveling from LAX to Colorado on December 30th.  Needless to say the airport was BUSY! 2+ hour wait to check in bags.  Fortunately for me, I skipped the line and right to the front of the A-List line for Southwest and immediately checked in my bags.  I checked in my typical luggage and then also talked to the SW personnel behind the counter about gate checking my car seat.    Ok, before you get your panties in a bunch, I know what they say about gate checking or checking in your car seat. It is as good as \\"wrecked\\".  I think that can be true, but at the same time, is a little extreme.  The WeeLee bag is super sturdy and although Clek does not come outright and say that you can check it in (probably due to liability), I'm sure they know and intended it to do so.  The bag even has a fragile symbol (cracked wine glass image) and upright symbol (arrow pointing up) stitched into the bag. I think we all know what and who those symbols are intended for.  Even their promotion video on their site shows other vacation objects happily walking into the bag (beach towel, sunglasses, dive fins, etc) and they say that there is room to pack other vacation essentials.  Uh, I wonder where this bag is going... probably on a plane.  Not a cruise. Why would you really need a Clek on a cruise? Also, I planned on gate checking the bag, which is well known to be \\"gentler\\" on your bags than traditional luggage check.  So the SW agent at the counter said that I could take my WeeLee through security and gate check it. This is where the **** hit the fan.  I proceeded to cart my WeeLee to the stairs up to security and I was promptly stopped by a security personnel at the bottom of the stairs.  She proceeded to tell me that there was no way I was going to take that through security, let alone on the plane.  I then proceeded to tell her that this is a car seat and am going to GATE CHECK IT, not CARRY IT ON THE PLANE.  She refused to let me through even though I told her it was Southwest's policy to let in car seats.  She gave me attitude and we exchanged professional words.  TSA heard the commotion and came over. I explained to them that this is a car seat and I want to GATE CHECK IT.  They would not have it and I started to talk to TSA.  Then a US Marshall lady, hearing the commotion, came over and so did a LAX K-9 police officer.  I argued back and forth explaining that this is a CAR SEAT and I want to GATE CHECK it.  They would not have it.  They said it would not fit through their scanning machines.  DUH!  Neither did my Bob stroller and infant car seat, which they moved through a different entrance in my previous travels.  They finally referred me to a SW manager and she denied me too.  All in all, after going back and forth with 3-4 people, I gave up.  I ended up just luggage checking it.  So whose fault was it?  Clearly the airline because their policy is to let in car seats.  But the \\"airline\\" was there that day represented by a SW Manager, security, TSA, US Marshall and LAX PD, which in the end denied me access.  In the end, my car seat arrived at the destination in good condition.  Yes, honestly, who knows how it was handled, but by all appearances it looked good.  You would think I had a good trip after this ordeal at LAX but the drama with the car seat did not end there.  This thing is big. I knew that from the start but I thought I would be able to manager wheeling it throughout the airport, onto shuttles and into a rental car.  The exterior dimensions of the bag are a monstrous 31x18x18 and with a Clek Fllo a jacket and a few other light clothing items, weighed 45#s in the bag.  I couldn't imagine a Clek Foonf (38lbs rear facing) in there.  My destination was Colorado and needless to say it was COLD out there.  -18 when we landed in Denver.  My wife was carring the baby in an Ergo and had the diaper bag on her shoulder. I had a XL luggage, Clek WeeLee, breast pump bag, and my work back pack and what a PITA it was to walk through the cold, through snow, and lug everything onto the Avis shuttle bus.  Then get it off the bus, drag everything to the Avis Preferred booth and then to the rental car.  If it is a warm and sunny day like it always is in San Diego, the Fllo is a pleasure to install. I love how \\"tight\\" it installs with the lock offs and it just feels so secure.  Change the venue to a freezing rental car parking lot where it's dark and wet; installing the Fllo is not fun.  It's not fun wheeling the WeeLee out into the snow, opening it up, taking out the Fllo, throwing it into the car, taking off the seat cover, installing the ARB bar, messing with the cotter pins to secure the ARB bar, messing with the LATCH belt storage, collapsing the storage shipping container...errr WeeLee and throwing it into the back of the car.  Don't forget, that the Fllo does not fit in just ANYcar.  It fit very nicely in the rear middle seat of a Nissan Rogue (toy SUV).  We got another rental car on another leg of our trip, a Jeep Liberty, and no way would it fit.  We changed it out to a Chrysler Town and Country minivan and it fit fairly well.  All in all, I thought to myself as I drove away from the rental car center after installing the car seat.  WTF was I thinking bringing a Clek Fllo?  Don't get me wrong, they are wonderful car seats (better than Foonf), but for traveling.... Really?  I think it was the vanity in me.  I wanted to keep up with the \\"Joneses\\" and show the world, \\"Look at me, I have a super expensive Clek car seat (the WeeLee has the word \\"Clek\\" in LARGE letters stitched to the side) and `I Love my kid. I buy quality. And, I dig design (Clek's slogan).'\\"  I was ashamed of myself.  A 35 year old dad, wanting others to see that I have a Clek and I like style.  Was all that worth the hassle.  No. To me, Clek is kind of like Apple iPhone.  They didn't invent the convertible car seat but boy do they know how to make it look good and market it well.  There are lots of other good car seats out there (with just as good if not better specs/ratings), but Clek gives you that feeling of \\"I'm with the `in' crowd.\\"  Here is my solem vow.  My Clek Fllo will stay in my current vehicle. It will never travel with me on a plane again.  I will not let my vanity get the better of me.
B002WB2D50|4|Good quality with excellent price<br />I recommend it to everyone is looking for this product<br />Thanks<br />this will not be my first time :)
B001OD8X4W|4|My grandson seems to love it, though the sounds could get on my nerves just like any other kids toy. It is a little tricky to adjust it but its getting easier the more I do it. Walkler is well built and seems like it will last a long time.
B00DDU0NOW|5|Great purchase and a must have.  It provides the ability to safely wash babies at different stages, fom newborns to 18 months.  Price is unmatched.  Item arrived early and in perfect conditions.  I would reccomend for personal or a gift to anyone.
B001DOLRZO|5|My special needs 3 year old got this over 2 years ago and still plays with it every day.  It is a great portable size, easy to hold, has volume control, simple button controls, and an on/off switch.  Like the previous reviewer said, it does not burn through batteries, I changed the batteries for the first time last month.  Ours has also endured multiple throwings, like every day in every parking lot and grocery store and still looks new and works great.  Highly recommend.
B00006408K|5|My daughter is now 14 months old and even though we have to change her on the floor for safety (she's a wiggler!), we still use the diaper depot on top of her dresser.  It holds 20 size 4 diapers with no problem!  I use the side caddies for diaper cremes, hairbrushes, and her nail clippers.  I absolutely love this and it helps at least one space in the nursery stay organized!!!
B00AJSIVWW|5|I was very happy with this car seat when I started using it. It was easy to assemble and fits perfectly in my compact car. The covers detach easily for washing after messes are made. The cup holders are flexible and hold all shapes and sizes of snack and drink containers. We have a very happy munchkin in her new big girl seat.
B0016LRSOI|1|This is the most obnoxious thing that we've ever purchased involving our kid. The stupid refills are a huge pain in the butt to change, and the diaper stink leaks as bad as if the diapers were in an open garbage. Don't waste your money on this.
B00F2JFMJS|5|My 4 month old boy loves these bottles. He transitions back and forth from breast to bottle with no complaints ;) a couple presses on the bottom of the bottle creates air pressure and helps the little one get every last drop. BPA Free non toxic plastic. No phthalates or bisphenol A. Clear nylon bottle and nipple is made from food grade silicone. Spendy but worth it.
B00E1WLEDA|5|Replaced the parts and it works like new again!
B000GE1MEI|5|I give these 5 stars because they are easy to install and easy for adults to open the toilet without touching the toilet.  They work.  The only downside is that if you have a preschool age child in the house who is potty trained, they are a bit difficult for them to open as well, so they will need assistance.  Otherwise- great product.
B0042D69WY|4|The legs are little imbalance and making noises so we have to put something under some of them. Other than that it works very well. We like it
B0000E5XHH|5|I had to write a review.  We did a lot of research before getting the pliko stroller and car seat system .  We've been using the P3 now for over a month and have been very pleased with the performance of this unit.  I am an aerospace engineer with over 10 years in jet engine mechanical design so I hope I can lend a little credibility to this review.  The bottom line is that stroller is extremely well designed and good looking and well worth the money.  The only bad experience we had was from our families and friends who couldn't believe we spent so much on a stroller and pretty much openly ridculed us.  I know they're just jealous because this stroller is so nice (ha ha).  First, relative to the car seat.  There were several complaints that the car seat was too small and that the baby would quickly grow compared to a Graco.  I measured the key dimensions of the Peg and Graco car seats.  The dimensions of the plastic shell were the same, but the Peg had a 3/4\\" foam padding that the Graco does not giving the appearance of a tighter fit.  I'm sure both Graco and Peg designers work to the same anthropometric data for babies.  We felt that the padding would make a better cushion for a new born baby and could be removed as the baby grows.  We actually felt sorry for the little baby that would have to ride in the uncoushined Graco car seat.  <BR>The prime decision factor for the stroller was the more compact size.  We both have small 4 door sedans and no plans for a minivan or SUV.  We compared several models in our trunks and the P3 gave us so much more room.  The other side benefits of the P3 were the maneuvering capability, independent side handles for bag carrying and of course the look and construction.  We did a side by side comparison of several Graco's and the P3 around the babies r us store and found the P3 to be by far the easiest to maneuver one-handed.  The fit and finish of the Graco combined with the different rake angle of the front castering wheels caused the wheels to lock up at which point you have to jockey your position to correct.  The P3 handled like a dream.  A complaint we saw repeated in other reviews with the P3 was the small carrying capacity of the underside pouch.  It is small due to the umbrella design of the stroller, but what we have found was the the independent handles inherent to the design of an umbrella stroller like the P3 allows you to place your shopping bags over the handles and carry way more than a Graco pouch could hold.  This would not be possible with a wrap around handle found on the Graco's.  Also, the drink holders are a little small, but we have found to be satisfactory for our needs.  I'm not going to go into detail about the look and contruction of the Pliko's.  You have to see and feel for yourself at a store.<BR>In closing, the price is a lot for these units, but well worth it, in my opinion.  I am the type of purchaser that likes to buy something nice once and will pay more for higher quality and buy less of it.  My sister has been through 3 Graco's in the past 5 years because of mechanical problems.  I don't foresee the P3 breaking as easily.  Even if the equivalent Graco model never broke, the extra money over the 2+ years of ownership is not too big of deal in my opinion.
B0000CAOOM|5|I had a wooden high chair when I was little, so when I saw this chair at Babies R Us, I had to have it.  I put it on my registry and got it as a gift.  It took me 5 minutes to assemble with no problems at all.  When I first put my 5 month old son into it, he didn't like it very well, but that was because he was very small and still unable to fully support himself, so he kept tipping side to side and front to back.  They way I compensated for that was to put an inverted Inclined to Sleep behind him.  It holds him in place nicely.  Once he is able to sit upright unsupported, then I will remove it.  I highly recommend this chair!
B000UEI12K|5|We decorated the nursery in Eric Carle and this was a cute addition sticking it's head out of her book box.
B001E50KJQ|5|We used the wubbanub with our baby and she love's them. They are easy for her to find at night on her own as the plush makes them easy to grab. So we bought them for a family member for their soon to arrive baby girl.
B0095YYBPC|5|ABSOLUTELY LOVE! My son has been a.difficult sleeper since 2mths old since this is when he decided to hate being swaddled,bc of this we bought the.velcro.swaddlers. He absolutely hated these and would have crying fits to.break his arms free but this was the only way he'd sleep through the night so it had a be done. I took a chance on the magic suit and I'm so happy I did. Got it,washed it,put it on very first night. It was a little difficult to get his arms thru but we did it and he instantly fell asleep. I wasn't swaddling him for his naps so he would often wake himself up after about 45mins of sleep. I put him in the magicsuit and he napped for 2hrs!!! I love it and recommend it for those babies that hate being.swaddled and are busting out of those velcro straight jackets!
B005J58CV0|5|I got this for my ten month old  grandson. He loves it.
B008KG5R6I|1|The rotation on the light part broke within a week.
B0001WHY6U|5|I would have to say I was pretty surprised when I received this product. I actually thought I was getting a paper chart that I can tape to the wall but when I received it, it was made out of wood. It seems pretty sturdy. I love it. Great addition to my sons Sponge bob room I am trying to put together.
B00JW539OS|5|Those bags are made to do the job. The soiled diapers fit well in those bags and no concern about bad odor.<br />Thank you.
B007E8RSFG|5|First off I love how comfortable and form fitting this carrier is and how light weight it is as well. I have an almost 3 year old and I have been using this carrier for her through all stages of her growth. Lately it is perfect for long hikes when she is tired of walking I have put her both frontwards for a snooze as well as backwards as a pack. She is a super active kid and likes being in it. She is almost 40 lbs and wearing her is a lot less stress then other packs or carriers.And again I love how light versatile  and comfortable it is!
B00EU5AL8W|5|Love it
B009EDSWJA|5|very nice pad, plenty of room and does the job needed. Price was very good too. My wife likes it and i recommend it.
B002SG7JSU|5|i highly recommend this product. i put these on for the Christmas crowd and left them on because they look nice and keep things  &#34;safe&#34;.
B00JGNYQES|5|Finally ! I have been looking for something like this for a long time ! I love to use a comforter at night but was not able to because I want to dress one layer less than my baby, specially at the cold 20s degrees nights ! It came specually handy when we had a cold storm and the heater stopped working !
B004J1QNFW|5|We could see immediate results when baby is wearing.  This is a very durable necklace, and came at a great price.
B004070E1O|5|I ordered this for an expected grandson, due in April, so it hasn't been used.  I got this because a friend has a baby who loved the texture of this blanket and I have a whole monkey theme going on with a sleeper and a puppet, not sure why.  The blanket is very, very soft and no one can help touching it so I hope the baby likes it as much as I do.
B0006HBRY0|5|I bought this for my son. He loves it! It has survived spills and crumbs. Each time we were able to get the spills out. It is a great carseat.
B000P635T2|1|Each package only contains one lock. Most bifold doors will need 2 of these. This makes them very expensive. They should come 2 to a package. Also, there are no clear instructions included.
B00508MVAO|5|I like this. My son always trys his best to move the bowl. But he fails in doing that<br />.He keeps trying.
B00CLAZLN8|5|Very well made.  Received many compliments already.  Appears to be quite durable.  We are very pleased and would recommend to anyone.
B0007IQLZI|2|I had previously purchased Gerber Birdseye cloth diapers to use as spit cloths and they were great. (Still using them after purchasing in 2008.) When expecting my twins I needed to stock up on more and saw these. They are nowhere near the quality of Gerber. They are not all that soft, are not hemmed well at all and fray after just two washes. Spend the extra couple of $$ and buy the name brand instead of these!
B0033B9CZ2|5|I think this actually works better than the tubing that came with my PISA. The original tubing would slip off from time to time, but this stays firmly attached. Great product!
B00008ZCGH|5|These were the first toy I bought my baby.  I purchased them while still pregnant because I thought they were so cute.  My son has loved them from the start.  I put a different one into his crib everyday and he enjoys playing with them in the morning.  First he just liked to look at the patterned sides, then the pictures, then feel the textures and now he's grown old enough to shake and throw them and loves the sounds they make.  Fun toy!
B005VLX5RS|5|The best baby spoon
B002SG773W|5|\\"I loved these bibs for my 2 kids! I liked the Dr. Suess ones! So cute :) Best out of the tons of bibs that we've tested and tried. Durable, machine washable, super easy to clean up, and waterproof! Yay! Couldn't get better than that! :)
B007M4IZO0|3|I have a black coffee table from ikea and when my now 11 month old son started to walk against it, it was time to baby proof. This color matched really well and I've actually received comments on how nice the table looks. The padding is sufficient that if he falls near a corner or side, he is not going to get cut. The installation tape it comes with has worked well. I dusted with Pledge then let the table dry before applying. So far, only one corner has come off and that is my fault for not using the tape to the edge of the whole corner. It was easy enough to remedy. The only down side for me on this product, is I had to buy two because it did not go the whole way around my table. Make sure and measure. Overall, better than anything I've found at Baby's R US or Target even after four months of use.
B00CP3JKD8|4|Our son is 7.5 months, but we've been using this seat since he was about 6 weeks old. We started in the most reclining position, just for a few minutes at a time. After a few weeks, we started sitting him in it and giving him toys to play with while we were eating dinner, and also moved it to the medium sitting position. Around 5 months we gave him a sippy cup and spoon to play with while we ate. By this time, we was about ready to start sitting on his own, so we moved the seat to the upright position.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I've really liked the flexibility of the sitting position, and that we've already been able to use this seat for 6 months. We'll still be able to use it a bit longer, too.<br />2. Let's face it, babies are messy little creatures, and the seat cover and straps get dirty ALL the time. They are all easily removable and washable. I hang them up after going through the washer, and they are completely dry overnight. I've washed them quite a few times at this point, and they still look like new, despite being slathered in avocados, prunes, and sweet potatoes.<br />3. This chair is both flexible and compact. I like that I can use it in a chair or by setting it on the coffee table.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The tray has a depressed area for a cup holder, but none of our training cups with handles fit in it.<br />2. The seat has feet that I think are supposed to keep the seat from sliding around on slippery surfaces, but they don't work.<br />3. While we do have some time left with this seat, there is no way that it will work up to four years.<br />4. Maybe it's our table and chairs, but this doesn't pull up under the table at all. The sides of the feeding seat are too high to fit. We use the [[ASIN:B00B7DXDN0 YummiGo Brown / Light Blue All-in-one Portable Booster seat/high chair]] when we want to pull baby up to the table with us.<br /><br />Really, for the price, this has been an excellent value, even baby only uses it for a year or so. We'll put it in the closet and save it for the next kid.the closet and save it for the next kid.
B007HKOLKQ|5|Just what I needed.
B0073C3SPC|5|I have had some of these installed for a few months now, and they work flawlessly.  My wife hired someone to childproof most of our house.  These work exactly the same at a very small fraction of the price she paid.  They install easily and work really well!
B00A6XPYAM|5|I didn't really have time or energy to make baby food, this definitely made it easier for me to do it.  My attitude was that if it was too cumbersome I knew I wouldn't actually do it so buy the shortcut items and make it palatable and easy on myself.  Pays for itself in the long run.
B00OJN7L3I|5|We used when flying to CA from FL It worked great...It was really dirty after 2 flights so glad it protected the carseat.  Just wish it was more water proof vs water resistant.  Carseat sat in bag in the rain on tarmac seat wasnt soaked but did get damp. Fit graco nautilis 5 point harness setup
B006ZVV0NO|3|Don't stay stuck to the window as well as I'd like, but they do the job.
B000LXQVA4|5|Great grandson has had hours of entertainment in his &#34;jumperaroo.&#34;
B00BQYVQWU|5|I love this. Great control. The clarity is awesome and being cordless is great. it is just as described and lets u peak in on them without waking!
B000I2MRLU|5|We ordered this toy for our infant when he was just weeks old. He is now almost 4 months old and loves it. The hook is perfect to hang from the carseat or from his play gym. The feet are made of different fabrics and make a crinkling sound when baby grips them. The antlers are particularly enjoyable to our now teething tot who insists on gnawing on them when he is out and about in the stroller. The two rings on the end of the moose make this fun clinking sound that gets a giggle from our baby every time. Finally the body of the moose is soft and great for cuddles when baby gets tired. We are very happy with our Moose!!!!
B00EL8S9BO|5|very happy with this product at this price point. we use it while we're watching TV with headphones, so the visual sound level indicator is important to us. works very well. battery seems to last a very long time.
B00AJSJE6O|5|Holds our boys attention well and was reasonably priced.
B005BW1RL8|2|This thing is a lot bigger in real life that it looks online.  I wanted something somewhat low profile and not completely obnoxious for my little girl's carseat but this thing is kind of insane and cheap plasticy looking.  It also doesn't fit right on my Graco carseat.  It is too far away from her or too close.  I am sending it back.  I think the solution is to just get a clip thing with one toy on it.
B002R7Q7ZG|5|It's a step stool that really works!! First she needs a little help, then she steps up on this green stool and BAM!! She climbs up onto the potty with relative ease! It's a friggin miracle! Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, how did we survive without you?
B003KMWATY|5|If you find your newborn sucking like crazy and it seems like they're not making any progress on their bottle, it is time to step it up to the level 2 nipples! When we did, we not only found that our son was taking in less air, but he was finishing eating far sooner.<br /><br />He is happier, has less gas and feeding doesn't take nearly as long even as his appetite increases. Great buy and we'll definitely jump to the level 3 when we run into the same issues with these ones in a few months.
B000GE1MEI|4|This is a good product.  However, it is not as secure as we would have liked. If you pull on it just right it will open without unlocking it as it is intended to do.
B003XT43MG|5|For reference, we have the BabyMod Olivia crib and this mattress fits snugly. Arrived quickly and well-packaged. Feels like a good quality foam, but I can't yet comment on performance because the baby has not arrived yet! We chose this mattress in part because it was rated second best by the Baby Bargains book (by Denise Fields) which has been awesome helping us choose products so far.
B001G3SDXQ|5|We've been using these pacifiers since our daughter was about 6 weeks old.  We never switched to the \\"super soothie\\" (which is the 2 pack of pink ones you see in the drugstores) because my daughter never took to them.<br /><br />The pink/purple set is a fun change- I originally got them to try broaden my daughter's horizons a bit after my friend mentioned that her daughter was so obsessed with her green soothie that even at 2+ years old she is enamoured with anything that turquoise color!<br /><br />The downside is that now my daughter LOVES the purple one and insists on it by name (\\"papo one!\\"), so to have another onhand, I need to buy a whole new package!  You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.  We'll tackle this issue soon, but til then, I need another purple soothie.
B004S8MGHU|3|Very handy! I used this bra for 8 months of pumping every day. My only complaint was that the Velcro didn't last long. I had to buy new Velcro and sew it on as a replacement.
B00005BLMP|5|Excellent product... I liked it a lot, 100% recommended. My baby eats very well. Thanks for everything!. Soy de Venezuela
B00IYTTO2Y|2|Silicon portion is very hard to remove from plastic tray.  It works but wish it was easier to use and not so hard to clean.
B00D2VMUCU|5|A+++
B006Z6E8AG|5|Amazon's recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment
B000067DY9|4|I really like these diapers. They arent the best for a little newborn, but once they get about a month or so, they work great with most diaper covers. We use a snapees with our son, so we don't have to worry about pens poking him. The weave is tight enough but the snapee can still get it's teeth in really secure. We also use them as burp cloths.
B002D3XEKA|5|Such a cute gift. I bought this for my cousin's baby. She is a nurse and her husband is a doctor.
B0023W6XP4|5|This bag is worth every penny! I bought it to use as a diaper bag. I wanted something versatile, durable, and not too 'baby' or 'girly.' It has the perfect amount of space. The side pockets are a perfect size for bottles, and they are insulated. The changing pad is a tad too small, and I will replace it once my baby gets a little bigger, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this bag to EVERYONE!
B00005BVK7|5|This mobile is my two month old's favorite toy -or activtiy for that matter. He looks at it and &quot;talks&quot; to it. The pause of the mobile really does give him a chance to focus. I will buy this mobile for my next friend who has a baby.
B00000J0FW|5|What a wonderful little book!  My children and I love to sit and look  through this &quot;family album&quot; made just for them.  They can cary it  wherever we go, unlike the grownup albums, and can rehearse who is who in  the family all the time.  Since their grandparents live out of town, this  is a wonderful way of seeing people who love them, but can't always be with  them, and it helps anchor these people in the child's mind.  The book is so  durable, I never worry about pages ripping or drinks spilling.  And I can  easily wipe it off so we can look at it once more before bed-time.  We can  change some of the pictures, too.     We love this book so much that we  have bought it for our friends as new baby gifts - and they love it, too!   With the typical Sassy bright, happy colors and patterns, it is a big  winner in our household!
B005PK1FY0|3|it doesn't stay on too good
B00IAVJDHC|5|We received this product in a timely fashion and they provided great customer service to make sure we received it. The adhesive is easy to apply, but take your time!
B00BFQ5BMU|5|They are great and fix perfect in my van.
B00012CHFI|2|I ordered The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper for an upcoming trip with my 2 month old baby. My baby is 22 inches long and 9 lbs. This sleeper would probably only last this one trip as her feet already touch the foot bumper. Also, the netting on the end by her feet is not secure at all. It is flimsy. It has a nice and padded mattress though, which seems very comfortable. It seems like it would be great for a newborn, but not something you could plan on using for a long time.
B00IAF74OC|4|At first I thought I'm going insane to spend more money on an extra product for my child. A foot rest that I've never seen any of my friends use. Once we got it, we were pretty excited.<br />My 30mo always complain about being stuck after being in the car seat for about 45 minutes. Because I'm quite short, I know how uncomfortable it is to have my legs dangle off the chair for a long period of time. And this footrest is great. She looked a lot more comfortable and she was enjoying the ride a lot more while she rested her legs on the footrest like a queen.<br />The instructions were a little confusing. There was a part that wasn't shown or mentioned in the instructions. So I just took a guess at what it does. Also, the pictures in the Korean instructions were better than the English. I pretty much installed it by looking at the pictures.
B000V82RE8|1|We've had this chair for five months now and I never quiet got used to it.  Here are the problems we've had:    -The sliding tray is difficult to take out, especially when holding a baby.  It requires both hands, some wiggling and a few curse words.  -The buckle gets stuck often.  I often have to press it on one side several times to get my daughter out.  -The seat with the buckle, which can be height adjusted, slides in and out of its place now freely so it has now become nearly impossible to put in my daughter without a struggle.    -My 11 month old seems uncomfortable in this chair.  Perhaps because the seat slides back and forward at times, she has had a hard time sitting up straight.      This chair needs constant adjustment, every time we need to get in and out is a struggle.  These things should be seamless.     We also purchased the outrageous overpriced cushions.  The bottom proved useless from the beginning.    I regret this purchase.  It is by far the best looking chair and we wanted something that would blend into our home well.  It is not worth the money or the annoyance.  I look forward to purchasing something else and hope they take this chair back.
B00DWWVV5Q|5|This is a great transition product for babies that were swaddled, like mine.  At about 3 months old, we stopped swaddling her arms, but recently she's been rolling over and I was worried that there wasn't enough room in the swaddler for her to move legs freely.  But, she won't sleep without it.  This gives her the cozy swaddle feeling around her chest while at the same time leaving enough room for her legs to move, which gives me peace of mind when she rolls onto her belly (which she does consistently now when she sleeps).
B0042D69UQ|4|I love this bouncer. It's appropriately priced and fits well on our kitchen island. I like to plop my baby in it first thing in the morning after she gets up and gets fed for the first time. Then I'll come downstairs, put her in it, and I will clean bottles and get things ready for the day. It fits on the kitchen island and the table so I can see her and get to her easily. She also likes to see me. I also work from home so I will put it on the floor next to my desk, take the toy bar off, and bounce her with my foot while she dozes off and I'm working. She's just now getting interested in the toys, but I can tell she has fun in it. Be sure to read directions carefully on this one too! I messed up when putting it together and had to have my dad bend a part of it to get it on and then bend it back for safety. Once you screw things in place, they are there for good!
B0001NE8OA|1|It really is a hassle. It does keep the smell out even if you don't do things exactly right, but it does take a scientist to figure this thing out!!
B00KDJ4YXM|5|The led ring light IS a little too bright, but other than that it's a perfect baby monitor for us (we found zoom feature particularly useful). Haven't had any issues mentioned in other reviews.
B002VLZLS2|5|Cute & just how I imagined.
B00PG7G46Q|5|Nuff said!!!
B000X2HC9W|5|Good enough for a parent storage to add to my wave stroller which doesnt have any. Spacious cargo, although cup holders are not as stable if the whole thing has nothing to lean on. It just swings under the handles. Otherwise, neat little addition.
B00OLRJYEQ|5|Great buy for the money. Grand daughters love them!
B00BFQ5BMU|5|So easy to clean up, worth every penny.
B001I7PY1E|5|goood
B005ADTQXE|5|we like it
B00KHJXEHK|4|Super big
B00KAJ6PI2|5|Fantastic product.
B00EHKCH78|5|Perfect sized bag made of durable material. The fabric and the zippers both feel as though they will last a very long time. Spacious inside and so many pockets!!!  The pockets for bottles/cups are inside the large pocket. When you have only one hand to grab it, it would more convenient to have a side pocket. But overall, it's the best backpack I have seen and for a great price!!
B002CGRT1S|5|We love these gates. We currently own two, each placed at the top of a staircase. They are very secure (and were surprisingly easy to install) and easy to operate. The latch is baffling when you first look at it, but once you teach someone how to open it, it's very simple and can be opened and closed with one hand. They are quiet to operate and will swing all the way to the wall, allowing for a wide open doorway when needed. This gate also works well with our high baseboards, as the mounting brackets are higher than the base of the gate, allowing the gate to be near the floor and the bracket attached well above the baseboards. We have a different brand gate in our kitchen that has several inches of space between the bottom of the gate and the floor - luckily the kid isn't interested in climbing under it (although our small dog is more than happy to squeeze under and beg for food!).<br /><br />I also love that this gate doesn't have a bar going across the floor. I am a klutz and don't need an additional obstacle to navigate, given that I already have to dodge a toddler, two dogs, and scattered building blocks, toy trucks, and sand buckets. We will likely be adding a third gate to our house (oh the joys of living in a 3-story townhouse!) and I am 99% sure that we'll go with this gate again.
B00PHWOIOU|5|My new baby granddaughter loved these toys. They are both brightly colored and durable. A thumbs up!
B00HVB7UKO|5|Light weight... Fast shipping...very pleased!!
B00318CLTG|5|Needed a well built straw bottle for my toddler. This serves its purpose well. Has survived quite a few drops and throws.<br />Also does not make water smell of plastic.<br /><br />Have not used it for other liquids, only water.
B002F9MV88|4|I bought these to catch all the drool for my teething son.  He doesn't pull these off as he has done w/ other bibs.  He isn't drooling as much since I bought these so I can't speak to their absorbency since we haven't tested them extensively.
B00APQM77I|5|Soft and fits snug. Perfect! Love these sheets. Better than I expected. Highly recommended. Great after washing. No shrinking. Soft soft soft
B0075QF91W|5|material is good quality and the height on the back is perfect (vs the higher ones) because our car seats really don't touch the back enough to justify a higher back - recommend checking to see if you need a higher or shorter back protector.
B002WN2AKG|4|my expectation was only the pages but they have like something inside that will make a funny noise and shouldn't because is for baby to sleep ??? :(
B001TPUWGM|4|We bought this stroller with the KeyFit 30 car seat and like both of them a lot thus far. We have been using them for a little over three months now. They feel very sturdy and safe, which was important to us. We walk a LOT with the baby in the stroller (3-4 miles/day on sidewalks and pavement) and it has been holding up very well. The only negative experience we have had so far is that the plastic part of the canopy got some kind of small crack/tear in it. We can't figure out how that happened because nothing was ever placed on top of it. I called up Chicco USA right away to complain and they said the stroller was under warranty and sent me out a new canopy for free immediately! Good, domestic customer service is another plus for us. I am usually the one pushing, lifting and folding the stroller up and find it to be very manageable. It doesn't hurt that it is aesthetically pleasing too.
B000XP96VQ|3|So the zoom is nice & large, it's definitely a &#34;full sized&#34; stroller. The bottom carry all is large & nice. The wheels swivel nicely & the seat is nice & wide. However, my 22mo old is only 31&#34; tall and his head already hits the top of the seat area where the shade structure is. He does NOT have much growing room, which sucks because I had hopes to use this stroller for another year or 2. The kids sit up nice & high, however, if your kids like to sit up & straight, you're out of luck. The back doesn't fully recline to a full upright seating position, so my kid is constantly pushing his shoulders & neck forward to sit up straighter. *sigh* easy to put together, the shade structure is nice, the parent console is nice as well. If it weren't for how this isn't for taller kids & the back being more straight up sitting, i'd give this a full 4 stars.
B006I18WS2|4|I have only used this one time and it was at a Harris Teeter grocery store. It fit, but I did have to remove (easily) the advertisement on the cart that attaches to the back of the seat area so I could safely install the cart cover. This comes with instructions, but is easy to install without any. My baby tolerated it for a one hour grocery run! Ill use it again and again!
B002GXC7H8|3|These bottles covers are slightly loose on the Born Free bottles, but we have twins and use them heavily and have not had one ever slip off or even move at all when feeding.  It is true that the Dr Brown silicone sleeve fits the Born Free bottles better. We have both.
B000BMKEVC|4|You can tell by the price and the very basic features of this item that it's not a fancy, high-quality stroller, but that's not why you're buying it. You're buying it because you NEED this thing--it will save your arms from that cement-laced infant seat you're carting around the store with you because your baby fell asleep in it and there is NO WAY you're going to wake that baby up just to stick it in a Moby wrap. Trust me on this.<br /><br />Here are the pros:<br />- It has cup holders and a little compartment on the console you can snap shut that you can store your keys or an extra pacifier in<br />- As long as you're pushing it on a smooth surface, it handles nicely and pushes easily.<br />- Baby is rear-facing, so you get to make eyes at her and address her needs while you walk.<br />- There's a good size basket to store your diaper bag in with room to spare.<br />- Car seat fits in snugly.<br />- Stroller collapses and sets up easily and quickly--there's no learning curve on this one!<br />- It's quite compact and easily fits in the trunk or back seat of your car.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- My husband is tall, and the handle is just too far down for him. Even my sister in law who's 5'9\\" says she has to slump to reach it.<br />- While the stroller is supposed to be a \\"universal\\" fit for infant seats, my car seat, the Chicco Keyfit 30, does not actually \\"snap\\" into the Snap N' Go. It does slide right in and feels nice and stable--I've never had a problem with it. Chicco does make their own ([[ASIN:B005JDOYF0 Chicco Keyfit Caddy Stroller Frame]]), but since this one was half the price, I opted for the cheapie.<br />- If you want to access anything in the basket, it's almost a guarantee you'll have to remove the car seat first. I don't find this too big of an inconvenience most of the time.<br />- If you're on anything rougher than smooth asphalt, you and your baby will feel the bumps.<br /><br />It's true that you won't use this stroller for more than a year (my daughter isn't even six months old yet and she already prefers her front-facing [[ASIN:B008BSE8VA Chicco Liteway Stroller, Moss]]), but you'll get a lot of use out of it those first few months. I used it almost every time I left the house, and I still use it when I need a light stroller for the store. I definitely consider this item a must-have for any new parent.
B00DMPO8AI|4|We love how cute the backpack and lunch box are.  The lunch box could be a bit bigger (it's regular size, but I prefer bigger to fit more variety of food). The backpack doesn't have an inside pocket so we use the lunch box for pencils, crayons and other materials.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a bit pricey for the quality but since my 4yr old twins and I are in love with the characters (best educational show ever) we truly love it.
B008BGNTJ4|5|I got scolded by my daughter for even suggesting a walker for my grandson.  &#34;Haven't you read Consumer Reports?&#34; she asked.  Apparently walkers pose a safety hazard.  I agree if baby is left unattended, but I know my daughter, and she watches baby like a hawk.  I also remember the fun our children had in their walkers, and the little bit of freedom it allowed parents who need to get some things done in a day.<br /><br />The only problem is today's walkers are pieces of junk.  They're not well-made and are full of electronics or paraphernalia littering the tray.  I didn't blame my daughter for having reservations, but I knew if she had the right walker, she'd change her mind about their usefulness and safety.  That's why I bought a Joovy Spoon.<br /><br />Everything about this walker is nice.  I love its simple design with just a splash of color in the seat, which is machine-washable and made of heavy-duty (yet comfortable) material.  The tray is extra-big and removable for easy cleaning.  The base is very wide which provides added strength and stability.  It easily folds up for travel or storage.  The Spoon meets or exceeds all government standards in compliance and stair safety, but common sense dictates parents should also use a gate to keep stairs out of reach.<br /><br />I was sold on this walker's features, and bought one hoping my daughter would see the light.  They visited and just as I thought, my daughter was less than thrilled.  That is, until she saw how much our 5 1/2 month grandson loves being in it.  Or how easy it is to feed him there.  We have low-pile carpeting in our kitchen, and baby's feet just touch the floor in the first position (there are three height levels).  My daughter was amazed at his contentedness in this walker and my ability to get dinner on the table simultaneously, yet the whole time baby was well supervised.<br /><br />Because of my daughter's reluctance to have one of these contraptions at her house, I offered to keep the Spoon at mine for when they visit us.  You guessed it, after that initial visit she completely changed her mind and took the Joovy Spoon back home with her that day.  She now sheepishly admits it is one of the most useful baby products she has ever owned, especially in their kitchen which has hardwood floors.  This may be an expensive walker, but to me it is worth every penny.Spoon at mine for when they visit us.

B00KHZPH74|4|This suit saved my sanity when my daughter had a bit of a sleep regression. She went from only waking 2x a night to waking hourly; this suit brought her back down to 2x and she's on her way to just once a night!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Even though she's a sweater, she doesn't seem to get too hot in this - the cotton seems to breathe enough<br />* Large neck area prevents her from drooling or spitting up on the collar when feeding and sleeping<br />* She sleeps so much better now!<br /><br />Cons:<br />* A pain for middle of the night diaper changes! It would be so much better if the zips went all the way through the bottom so that we could easily change her diaper in the middle of the night. Having to wiggle her little legs through the thick fabric wakes her up too much and she can get fussy and worked up.
B00A30FWPU|4|Great bag has many pockets ..but it is bigger than expected....
B00RMM6OOU|1|The lid doesn't fit. The suction doesn't work. Worst bowl ever. I wouldn't pay $.05 for this thing.  I honestly don't understand how this has any positive reviews.
B006JV4HC6|4|I got this chair for my one year old. I was hoping to get one of the old versions of the hook-on-highchair that has a vinyl seat, but couldn't find it! This one is nice though, except that it gets VERY dirty. You can wipe away some of the food mess but certainly not all. Also, there is a crevice between the cushion and the chair that collects any dropped food. On the plus side, the seat is high enough for the toddler to reach the table. It's made of durable material and has a durable frame. It assembles and disassembles easily. It sort of takes a while to screw it onto or off of the table. I have skinny kid that likes to climb, so I have to have the straps pretty tight or he will climb out of them. This chair would be perfect if it was covered in vinyl for easy clean up.
B004HFQLKW|3|When I first saw this product for review, I thought it looked really cool.<br /><br />I won't even pretend like this is one of those products you just can't live without! It's actually just an extra step needed to feed my little one. He doesn't get formula very often right now, so when he does, I find it so much easier to just pour some water in a bottle, mix formula, and shake.<br /><br />I actually find this product extremely pricey for what it is. I wouldn't even give it as a gift, because mothers I know, including myself, would much rather that money go to something more useful.<br /><br />IF this is something you would benefit from, I would definitely follow the directions EXACTLY! Please check the formula first, so you don't burn your little one's mouth. There has been a couple of times that I've shaken the formula(without the mixer), only to discover that it didn't completely mix. I DO understand that some babies might benefit from this!<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this is one of those products that initially look like a must have, but probably end up sitting in the cabinet.
B004LD6VLO|2|It is definitely cheap, and the picture is better.  Reminds me of something I would have bought in a gas station off the interstate.  :(  Really not worth the money.
B005ZBHXP4|5|Excellent product. Very soft material making it a comfortable  seat for the little one.
B000I0YYYU|5|This a great and beautiful drying rack! It fits ANY bottle and the brush works really well too. It even lets you hang pacifiers off of it and allow them to dry as well! A wonderful product!
B003EUIJJW|4|Item is really cute!  Sticker decals are really thin and need to be careful when peeling from sheet.  Overall, very happy with the outcome.
B000G82J3M|5|We got these toys to put into our 13 mo old's easter eggs. She LOVES them.     If our daughter could talk, this is what she would say:    PENGUIN!! I LOVE PENGUIN!    Piggypiggypiggypiggy...    Monkey! Says AhAh!    Cow! Says Moooooooooooo!    PENGUIN?! HOW COOL IS THIS PENGUIN?!?!??    Sheep have funny faces. Also, tasty.    Raccoons taste like Winnie the Pooh.    Also...PENGUIN!!
B00O8RQSL6|3|This is a pretty good gate for the price. I have the handle ones that mount onto the wall, and at $20 to $30 a piece I could really only afford the other 2 for stairs. This one got placed wherever. I was skeptical because compared to the other Plastic ones versus the wooden it looks really flimsy, but when you pick different colors (I chose pink ) the inside was created with a durable plastic.  I have pets to and thought he (dog) would naw thru this but it hasn't been disturbed  and it really is a good price. I price checked and this has the best price with shipping and the options to choose from pink, plain or blue.  Update: 10 NOV 15 Barely 3 months old and it broke today. You get what you pay for. It wasn't pushed on hard, my husband was setting it in place, and the wooden bar snapped. Hopefully this doesn't happen to a child because they will get hurt from the spiky broken pieces or a splinter. Again, it was fairly cheap so you get your moneys worth.
B009R27JJC|5|We love out Diaper Genie. You don't have to worry about your house smelling like dirty diapers anymore and they are super easy to change. I highly recommend this kind. It's so nice not having have to deal with a whole bunch a diapers this makes life easier!!
B007XL658K|4|My son sleeps so much better wrapped in these. One thing to note, they are different. He has slept through the night wrapped in the green one but the patterned one fits totally differently. He gets his arms and even legs out of that one. So if you get them try them both.
B00CYRYUXU|5|So useful!!!!! Purchased one set for each of my strollers. These hold so much weight!!!!!
B003X4G55O|2|This isn't a great option if you have big kids.  I have 3 year old twin boys and one of my sons used the pottette in the car.  He peed all over himself.  Might be a good option for younger kids but wasn't worth the money for my family.
B0000CBGBS|5|I love the baby papasan its comfy and great for my colic son! most nights he sleeps in this instead of in his crib!<br />BUY IT TODAY!!!!
B006PB2C5Y|5|Great seat. My daughter loves it and I'm thrilled to find a unisex design that she and I both love. I hate having all pink everything. The snack and drink trays are great and it's easy to assemble. Definitely glad I opted for the Evenflo. I was skeptical after being a devoted Britax fan, but this definitely made the grade and had a pretty lil' price tag to match.
B00GKF71Y2|5|Easy to use and seems to be accurate. I am going to take to my daughters next doctors appointment to compare temps.
B009FU3Q5C|4|This is my second purchase as I dropped my first one and dented it a little at the top so it takes a little effort to align properly and to screw tightly. So do be careful not to drop it. Despite seemingly fragile, it works well and keeps food hot even after a few hours. I bring it out all the time and even use it at home to keep food warm when I have cooked my son's food but he's still taking his nap and I'm not sure when he will wake up.
B001O0D78M|5|Brilliant in the way it simply connects to the rest of the pram! Very well planned and very well thought out - wouldn't be without it! Shame they're so overpriced in Australian stores!
B00A1M9S9G|5|Adorable and shipped fast
B008K3YUHI|5|Not sure about assembly, my husband put it together on his own one evening and he didn't complain. Otherwise, I love it for feeding and rocking my son. The arms are cushioned which is great for those long feedings in the begging. My only complaint is that as a short person (5'2&#34;) I have to sit on a pillow to feel truly comfortable but that's no big deal. Cleans up well and looks great in our nursery.
B007VDK59A|5|Was very happy to find this, had no idea they were out there to be honest. Seems to soothe my daughters congestion and break it up as she sleeps. The pads get you through a night, or longer if you unplug, but seem to lose some potency each time of course. Refills are easy to find, just be sure you get the correct ones for your vaporizer - there are a few different ones out there.
B008HCXISY|2|I was excited because it said it was for all ABOB single strollers... WELL if you look at the bob website you will find out that it is only for BOBs 2011 and newer. Kinda disappointed. So it only gets two stars because I am mad that it didn't state that on the website.
B000G7TIZA|5|I love this changing pad! It's deep so that the my baby sits down into the pad. I love that it has four sides on it, because I'm using a dresser instead of a changing table. Every changing pad cover that I have bought has fit great and the strap keeps the baby very secure. It is easily wipeable is there is an accident that seeks through the cover.
B00PNQ3LY8|5|Very soft and large. Love! It is one of my sons favorite blankets.
B00L3NVFLQ|5|Super adorable and great quality!!
B0057GNXZG|5|All Graco's things are perfectly, not enough words to describe about this smart car seat. Be worth the money paid for. Thank you to Graco.
B0032B500O|4|Worked great until our baby hit 20lbs. Then it started snapping on the side, and dropping his feet to the floor. Thankfully he was never dumped out of the swing, but after that's happened three times now, we won't be using it anymore. The max weight limit says 25lbs. Obviously not.
B0038OLMXE|5|glad we bought it! wooden baby gates were not effective and hard to use. This gate is simple
B004AHMCKA|3|I wish it actually suctioned!
B0052QOL1Q|4|they are great for my older son when I take out the silicone insert.  as for my infant, he sometimes has a hard time sucking out if I tighten it too much.
B001FB5BFW|5|We bought this car seat when our daughter graduated from her infant carrier to a forward facing seat (so I cannot vouch for its use for infants in the rear facing mode). We selected this seat because it was highly rated by a top consumer review group and it was a nice balance of price and features. As a bonus, the green and black color scheme matches nicely with our Chicco stroller travel system. We have been extremely happy with the purchase and like this car seat much better than the (cheaper) Evenflo Chase Deluxe we purchased for our second vehicle. The seat was very easy to install using the Latch system and fits our car nicely (2002 Nissan Altima). The buckles and strap adjustment mechanism are intuitive and easy to use (a major complaint with the Evenflo). Adjustment of the car seat height, arm rests, and belt positions are dead simple. Note that Safety 1st has apparently released a newer version of this seat with mostly cosmetic changes. This was not a concern for us, but if you want the absolute latest model, be sure and check the item details closely. And perhaps most important, our daughter loves her new seat and has no problems using it for long trips. We are pleased with our purchase and would highly recommend this car seat to anyone.
B00C6YBPX4|4|Very pretty, but the comforter/blanket is too small for the crib. It doesn't cover the crib mattress; it's too short and too narrow. I also can't figure out how to make the bow on the canopy stay and look like it does in the picture while covering the rope that's attached to the netting.
