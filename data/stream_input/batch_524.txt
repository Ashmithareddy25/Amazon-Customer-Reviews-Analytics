B00005JLT5|5.0|I personally believe The Pianist is the greatest movie ever produced about the Holocaust, along with Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is also one of the most graphic and, therefore, definitely one of the most realistic movies out there. At times during the film, things get into such detail it's actually sick. Obviously, this movie is not for children; in fact, I believe I am too young to have watched it in the first place, but I definitely don't regret doing so. <br /> <br />The story itself is very interesting and pretty amazing. It's the story of survival. While \\"the pianist\\" did, most others didn't. It's frightening to think of why this one man did not die with all the others. Was there any particular reason, or was it all just luck? <br /> <br />To know this story is in fact true probably makes it about ten times better, but, at the same time, much, much harder to watch. <br /> <br />The shooting was especially fantastic and so were the scenes in the movie. The characters were all very believable, and, basically, it does seem like it was all very well thought out.  <br /> <br />The Pianist is simply a masterpiece. It truthfully revives the horrors of the Holocaust, and therefore, is one of the hardest movies you'll ever watch.
B00029LNHS|1.0|only found 1 song I liked on the entire CD thanks to Whitney and it sounded better coming from her.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is probably one of the most beautiful movies ever made (especially by Walt Disney!). It is truly a classic and I am quite sure that most people are familiar to the story and have seen the movie at least once. If not, I insist you rent it/buy it as soon as possible! <br /> <br />This movie surely does have the something most other Disney movies lack - whatever it is. It is the story of life - how things are not always what you would like them to be, how we all have our tragedies, and how things are unfair, but also, how we can make things beautiful and we can bounce back and improve ourselves and everything around us. It is also the story of an innocent, young person who barely knows the world and is now meeting it face to face. <br /> <br />No matter how many times I've watched this film, it still makes me cry every single time. It's so heartbreaking and so beautiful at the same time. Words fail me to describe it. Definitely Disney's masterpiece!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|The real hero of this epic story in my opinion is not Achilles, but Hector. A sad movie.
B000085RTZ|5.0|For a long time, I listened to Nightwish, and then later discovered Dream Evil, and I found that I really did enjoy the style of music. As my title reads, what a change of pace, from the typical headbanging bull**** you would normally hear, or even better, the crap playing on mainstream radio nowadays. Kamelot is easily on par with Nightwish, Dream Evil, and this cd, is a must have. <br /> <br />Two days ago, I found this CD in a bargin bin, and I gotta say, I did not expect it to be this good. Well thats an understatement actually, as this cd turned me on my head, and took me for a ride through the world Kamelot crafted. The music and lyrics will stick with you long after the songs have ended, and repeat listens, just get better and better. Basically, this is the kind of CD that gets better the more you listen to it. <br /> <br />Sixteen tracks, that litterally blew my mind. Of course, the initial opening track confused me, but as soon as it ending, and \\"CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE\\" started playing, I was hooked. This cd has been on consistant play in my CD player, since I got it. <br /> <br />I have no issues saying that, Kamelot is a great band, that needs to be heard. Best cd I've bought this year, no questions asked. So do yourself a favor, and take a ride through \\"Kamelot\\", it's an experience you won't forget.
B00062IVKI|3.0|This film is certainly well done.  Robert DeNiro gives a good performance, but not nearly as great as Liza Minnelli.  Often when Minnelli plays, she gives an aura of competence on the screen that forces the viewer to think, \\"Nobody else could have done this,\\" and as it were, truly nobody could.  The sheer power of her performance alone is more than enough reason to watch this movie.<br /><br />DeNiro plays as Jimmy, a tenacious and compulsive saxophone player that insists on getting what he wants, and what he wans is \\"1) Music, 2) Money, and 3) Women.  But sometimes you find the right woman first, and then the numbers switch around.\\"  He meets Francine (Minnelli), a singer who counterparts his perservering behavior enough to get him what he wants but hold her own.  The two then go off to make their name in the music business any way they can, meaning eventually the music and their relationship start to tug them in different ways, and with conflict we have drama.  Two hours and forty minutes of it, in fact.<br /><br />The character of Jimmy is such that I couldn't help but ask, \\"Are the viewers supposed to want him to succeed because he's the hero, or are they supposed to want him to succeed because he's going to keep trying anyways and we just want him to stop?\\"  He tends to insist a bit too much, and watching his character is only worth the time when DeNiro's playing off of Minnelli.  The audience sympathizes with Francine because they can't possibly imagine dealing with Jimmy, but since they can't imagine dealing with Jimmy, they also have to wonder what the heck she's doing with him.  The two characters are constantly at edge, even when it seems they are going to reconcile.<br /><br />Such a method of exposition is at least interesting to watch, but it's largely stretched out and filled with more big-band music than one can possibly hope to sit through comfortably.  The first two hours of the movie kept a good pace, but somewhere after the two hour mark the movie does a sort of Singin' in the Rain-ish musical-in-a-musical that's packed with so many layers of stories that it becomes confusing and, most importantly, completely useless.  All of it has Minnelli, and Minnelli continues to sing afterwards.  By the end of a good half-an-hour of her reaching crescendo after crescendo, one's ears are in need of a rest...  and it's not like the movie has ended yet.<br /><br />It's a shame, in fact, that overall the movie feels displeasing to me, considering how strong the acting and directing are.  Here is a movie that's deserving of praise but very difficult to watch.  See it if you can, take from it what you can get, but don't expect to feel like watching it ever again.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBin the Rain-ish musical-in-a-musical that's packed with so many layers of stories that it becomes confusing and, most importantly, completely useless.

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchock is one of the greatest directors who ever lived and this film is one of his best offerings. Either from a purely technical standpoint or from the standpoing of shear entertainment, Psycho is first rate. Hitch proves that one can make a genuinely terrifying film by leaving the horrors to the mind of the viewer. I loathe slasher films and exchew almost all horor flicks but found Psycho to be a wonderful time well spent. Watch it and see why Janet Leigh was afraid to take showers from that time on.
B000000W5L|5.0|The Rolling Stones in 1972 came out with what I consider to be the greatest rock album of all time; well, it's my favorite anyway. EXILE is the definition of exhilirating hard rock..Nearly all the songs are excellent. From \\"Rocks Off\\" \\"Rip This Joint\\" \\"Tumbling Dice\\" \\"Let it Loose\\" (My favorite on the album) and the fantastic \\"Shine a Light\\"..This album is one great song after another and it never lets up. This is definitly The Stones at their best and ROCK N ROLL music at its best. In my opinion, EXILE ON THE MAIN STREET is the best rock album ever made..I can't see it losing its ground to anything soon.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Back in middle school, Eric Clapton changed my life. Up until then, I had listened to exclusively hard core gangsta rap. Than a tape trader friend of mine passed me along a copy of Slowhand and I quickly realized why people called him God. Shortly thereafter, Clapton participated in the legendary Unplugged series showing a different side to his already accomplished guitar repertoire. I have picked up every one of his new albums since then. Which lead me to today with the release, Back Home. <br /> <br />The title Back Home can be linked to Clapton returning to more of his 60's sound of blues rock after his recent affinity for straight blues including last years album of Robert Johnson songs. Listen to the opening track, So Tired, Back Home can also mean being back home with his family, including his three young girls. The song chronicles the life a new dad who can't seem to take it in but at least, \\"momma's a natural.\\" The song even features a baby screaming at the end. <br /> <br />Clapton also rediscovered his love of reggae on this album, but instead of a Marley cover, he decided to write his own in Revolution. The slowed down song deals with a person who want to start a revolution not necessarily because he feels the cause deep down in his heart but rather because he has nothing better to do. The album does feature a couple cover songs including George Harrison's Love Comes to Everyone and the Stevie Wonder penned I'm Going Left. And just like B.B. King had Clapton come play with him, Clapton has brought in a few of his disciples to play on the album including John Mayer and the current king of the slide guitar, Robert Randolph. Steve Winwood and Vince Gill, who wrote One Day for the album, also appear along with Billy Preston who contributes on the keys throughout the whole album. <br />
B0002VEXUA|5.0|Like Keith Moon and Pete Townshend from the Who, Liam and Noel from Oasis merit 5 stars for their comedic skills alone. That they also deliver the goods musically on this, their finest album, is worth another 4 stars. My only complaint is that the interviews aren't longer.    Since Amazon won't let me rate this 9 stars, I'll do the next best thing and share some of the DVD secret tracks with you. There may be more, but these are the ones I do know:    * DVD Secret Tracks *    Rock 'N' Roll Star audio track - press \\"down\\" on your DVD remote for an interview about Liam wanting bagpipes on Rock 'N' Roll Star. Yes, bagpipes.    Supersonic audio - press \\"down\\" for music theory.    Cigarettes & Alcohol audio - press \\"down\\" for interview with Noel about the song.    Slide Away audio - press \\"down\\" for interview about the name Definitely Maybe.    Married With Children audio - press \\"down\\" for the letter from Guigsy on why he was not on the DVD.    Sad Song audio - during the black intro, press \\"down\\" for audio clips of the legendary \\"Wibling Rivalry\\" interview.    Live Forever audio - press \\"down\\" for interview with Noel about wanting Live Forever as track three on the album.    Press \\"angle\\" on Live Forever, Shakermaker, Supersonic and Cigarettes & Alcohol for US versions of the videos.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I add to all the other positive reviews? For me, the main attraction is the characters.  There's a subtlety, an implied history, a depth of human complexity that pulls me into each episode. Most of them could probably carry a book on their own. My favorite is Inara Serra, the \\"companion,\\" the beautiful, loving, respectable courtesan, a unique image of the sacred prostitute. (And my personal theory is that this character was one of the factors leading to the show's cancelation. Fox is pretty conservative.)  Give it a try, and I think you'll be hooked!
B00021R7CG|3.0|First thing to remember when watching ANY movie about nuclear war (\\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"Fail Safe\\", \\"War Games\\", etc)or the government hierarchy is that most of the procedures and technical details presented are made up by a writer.  \\"By Dawns Early Light\\" is no different.  Although it pretends to be a serious story wrapped around serious military 'mumbo-jumbo', this movie normally provokes howls of laughter when viewed by those in-the-know.  The nuclear weapons procedures shown in the movie should not be taken as gospel by any stretch of the imagination.  And Cheyenne Mountain is always so big with huge state-of-the-art computer displays and lots of flashing lights (and dont forget the Stargate down the hall...).   <br /> <br />There are some good moments:  The initial attack with the President and his party and scramble of the bomber crews is well done.  Rip Torn chews up his scenes as a war-mad Army colonel who somehow becomes the only person that acting-President Darrin McGavin will listen to.  A theme developes over the course of the movie that the civilians running things are mostly inept and grasping while the military men are calm, rational and more in command of the 'big picture' (with the exception of Torn). In the end it is the military, in the form of James Earl Jones as the commander of the SAC 'Looking Glass' who takes action to save the day.   <br /> <br />The acting overall is first rate and the special effects are okay, the nuclear horrors mostly implied by flashes and desperate radio transmissions.  A good drama to watch and ponder the effects of any nuclear attack, but don't take it too seriously. <br />
B00006RCNW|5.0|I was a little wary of this show as I'd heard so many good things about it but hadn't seen it, so decided to plunge in at the beginning. <br />Two days and 8 episodes later and I'm hooked - everything I'd read was true. The characters are well written and presented, and the storylines don't flinch from reality or have to hold back to fit in with US network telvision restraints. <br />Definitely recommended, if you've watched and enjoyed HBO shows such The Wire and Oz, you should give The Shield a try.
0151008116|4.0|<br /> Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, was a really sophisticated book. I liked the parts when he is out in the ocean. From one to ten I gave this book a six. I say it is a six because I think some parts of this book was really confusing when it was going from the present to the past. There are parts of this work that are emotional but too emotional that I don't want to ruin the end of the book. Though I really recommend this book there are some precautions that I should mention. These are the type of people that read this book are people who have open mind about anything. This book might have so many different meanings to so many people. People who don't have an open mind for big books might not like this book. Not only because it is big but because it is hard to understand the begging. I recommend that if you start this book you should not quit on it in the beginning because you need the beginning to know what this book is really about. If you like action books this book might not be the best book for you. I say this because the transitions are really confusing and you might not know what they are talking about. Ways that you might be able to over come this is by asking a lot of questions to your teacher. But when you get passed the beginning of the book and you get into part two you will realize that this book is a really good piece of work. This book is about this boy who is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. He learns that a Bengal tiger so big might be as sweet as a candy. But how he got there is a mystery you have to read it to find out what really happened. I recommend this book for any of you people who like realistic fiction books. Well don't take my word for it so go out and read it.  <br />
B000A158TC|3.0|Excellent anime for anyone getting into the genre, or for those Shirow fans who have to have everything! A classic, but a classic with one major flaw.  <br /> <br />That flaw being that they didn't add the original Japanese audio along with the English subtitles for this UMD! Sorry, but that is just unforgiveable, and don't get me wrong I still love it and the English audio isn't bad it's just I'd rather listen to the original voices.  <br /> <br />Shame on Sony and Manga Video for not including thats why I'm only giving 3 stars.

Either way the cost is same. Now what was that saying mother always used to say \\"Patience is a Virtue\\" she was right after all!! <br />
B000007R1M|5.0|Although most people, and by that i mean kraftwerk fans, would state that 'computer wordld' and 'trans europe express' are kraftwerk best albums, I find this one by far the better one.  Not one bad song (ok only six songs I know), and with metropolis, spacelab, the model and the man machine 4 of the best ever kraftwerk songs... brilliant...
B000AADYYO|5.0|Excellent album. I would recommend to either new fans or veterans. They evolve quite well into this album. Mike's vocals have gotten much better with this release as well. Him and Peter play great guitar, and Lopez is a freak as usual. Some might call it \\"more proggy\\" which might be true, but I think its an excellent relesase from a most excellent band. Favorites are Ghost of Perdition and Harlequin Forest.
B00005JN5X|4.0|Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the Brothers of the title, look like they really enjoyed themselves making this movie, and whereas that's a good thing, it does take away from some of the picture. This is the first movie that Terry Gilliam has done since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and is a return to some of the more fantastical elements of his imagination, and directing skills. Most of his movies have either been disastrous, or remain cult classics with his fans, and hopefully this will be a welcome return to the big screen, and the box office.<br /><br />The story is an interesting twist on the famous fairytale authors, suggesting that the Brothers fed on the fears and superstitions of local peasants back in the 1800 and something's, by showing up and ridding the folks from demons, witches and the like with their own magic and exorcisms. The fact that they provided the \\"false\\" spirits in the first place through inventive (for the time) magic shows and props, was just incidental to the fact that they were heroes making an honest living. All seems well until the arrival of Jonathan Pryce as a warring French General in the region of occupied Germany where the brothers are working, who arrests them for being charlatans, and makes them a mafia style offer. They can either stay and be tortured to death by his henchman Cavaldi (brilliantly comic performance by Peter Stormare, piled high with pathos) or investigate the disappearance of all the young girls at a nearby town, on the edge of an enchanted wood. Pryce believes that someone with a similar MO to the Grimms is up to no good, as do the Grimms themselves, until they arrive, and actually see things that are more than hard to explain.<br /><br />The banter between Damon and Ledger is great, Ledger being the younger more imaginative sibling who makes notes on all their travels (hinted at being the famous fairytale bible) and Damon more rational and grounded. It will of course take a combination of them both, and the local knowledge of the fetching Lena Headey as Angelika to solve the mystery.<br /><br />I never felt like this was a big budget picture, the locations are fairly grim themselves, with rain filled muddy streets in small villages, and a forest made on a sound stage, but the overall effect was a real treat. Gilliam injects enough \\"magic\\" into the picture without being way way \\"out there\\" as you felt in movies like The Fisher King, and Baron Munchausen, and supports the maxim, that less is more.<br /><br />I won't spoil the story; it's inventive, funny, a little spooky in places for younger viewers, and cleverly laced with many references to the many and varied much loved tales of the famous authors. Go see for yourself, chances are you'll have fun.

Makes it worth every penny and worth the wait to get it! The song 'Louisiana - 1927' came immediately back into my mind after hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and the levees failed and all those people died, still are dying, will die. It is a poignant song that fits like a glove. 1927 or 2005. Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose. Many hearts were broken then, many hearts are broken now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A totally awesome series.

B000002C25|5.0|Unbridled arrogance, excess, and obnoxiousness. Also known as, the essence of rock 'n' roll! This amazing album is larger, longer, and louder than life. It's almost too much to take in all at once; I can understand why so many people just can't get their heads around it. But give \\"Be Here Now\\" a chance and you will find smart songwriting, great melodies, and stellar musicianship. The arrogance is justified.    \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" is an absolute monster, a swaggering psychedelic epic so huge it leaves you almost too exhausted to continue. Definitely one of the coolest album openers ever and one of my personal all-time favorite songs. But that's just the beginning.    \\"My Big Mouth\\" is the sound of 24 blazing guitar tracks all turned up to 11, with drums and vocals fighting furiously to catch up for the 5-minute running time (and it's one of the shorter tracks!). \\"Magic Pie\\" is the album's second 7-minute epic, featuring a soaring chorus, an excellent Noel Gallagher vocal performance, and a long found-sound coda. \\"Stand by Me\\" and \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know\\" are anthemic stadium rockers that keep the adrenaline level high.    From here the album dips back into '60s psychedelia for \\"The Girl in the Dirty Shirt\\" and the epic (see how that word keeps coming up?) \\"Fade In-Out.\\" \\"Don't Go Away\\" finally scales back the guitar pyrotechnics for some tender acoustic plucking and a beautiful, wistful melody backed by bombastic strings and horns. The title track, \\"All Around the World,\\" and \\"It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)\\" return to blisteringly loud guitars and huge, anthemic choruses. Finally, \\"All Around the World (Reprise)\\" takes us out with an orchestral restatement of the song's outro and the sound of a door closing. (Between the song proper and the reprise, that's almost 12 minutes of \\"All Around the World.\\" Wow.)    This record has certainly taken a beating over the years, but it really doesn't deserve the bad reputation. Take another listen to \\"Definitely Maybe\\" and \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\"-- isn't the bombast and brashness part of the charm? \\"Be Here Now\\" just takes that musical philosophy beyond the limits of common sense, to its lunatic extreme. Sometimes bigger actually is better, and \\"Be Here Now\\" is as big as rock music gets.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Coming off of a solid blues cover album in Me and Mr.Johnson  Eric comes out with an album that branchs out and brings   more to the table and that just the blues stuff that made him   so famous all those years ago.    Good mix of Reggie, R&B, Soul and pop. Granted, it is alittle  on the polished side, and honestly I don't like that most of  the time. However, this is an exception. Songs like the new  single Revolution are what makes this a solid album. Not only  does Eric sound group vocally, but his guitar sounds smooth  and the band in the backgroud feed Eric very well.    The blues sound isn't totally gone here... Lost And Found is  a good song with a old time bluesy type of groove and is  actually one of the albums strongest tracks. The best track  here is the Stevie Wonder cover I'm Going Left. It might   sound like the most slick song on the entire album, but it's  still awesome. Feels almost like some happy church song or  something.    Not to say it's all good... Run Home To Me is a rather dull  track that has nothing going for it.. It's rather slow  with  no great guitar, and even the backing group is flat on this  one. It's not a complete throw away, but it's the weakest   on the album in my mind.    Album highlights:    I'm Going Left  So Tired  Revolution  Back Home  Lost And Found  One Track Mind    Btw, don't bring up Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review over  at allmusic... Dude gave Ashlee Simpsons album 4 stars. So  much for his credibly. If you are looking for a blues album  you probably just want to stay away... But if you are open  to all styles of music, and don't mind hearing Clapton show  off alot of influences I'd suggest picking this up.    btw, Anybody ever notice how these negitive reviews almost  always start off as \\"I'm a Big fan\\" yeah right.... If you  were a big fan you'd understand that he doesn't want to stay  stuck in 1965. I'm almost embarassed to call myslef a blues  fans because some many of them are short sighted and close  minded.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|With the upcoming release of his movie 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' and his video game 'Bulletproof', there is no stopping 50 Cent. And with the re-release of his recent CD 'The Massacre', 50 has included a DVD that contains video clips for each of the 20+ songs on the album. These range from clever animation (In My Hood, Piggy Bank) to the more typical clips we expect from rap stars (Candy Shop, Just A Lil Bit). With the addition of a great remix of the repetitous 'Outta Control' track from the original CD, 50 has used Dre's proven production skills and paired up with the latest G-Unit stablemates, Mobb Deep, to put a fuel injection into the re-release. The 'Outta Contol Remix' already has clubs pumping around the world and is steadily climbing the Billboard chart. 'The Massacre' remains the highest selling CD for this year with almost 5 million copies sold in America alone. With the clever idea of a re-release that includes a DVD and film clips to every track, this is one product that is sure to fly off the shelves and put a few more pennies into 50's piggy bank.

B0009UC7H0|3.0|After a 25 year hiatus, another Clive Cussler novel gets the big screen treatment. Being a fan of Cussler and having missed the earlier movie based on his novel Raise the Titanic, I was looking forward to seeing Sahara on DVD. After seeing it, my feelings are somewhat mixed. On the one hand, there were some things I really liked about the movie and on the other hand, a lot of things that I didn't. But most of the gripes, I think, stem from comparing the movie to the books. I agree that it is difficult for me to look at the movie objectively but one thing is sure for me. This movie does not measure up to most of the movies in the genre.<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey makes a better-than-average Dirk Pitt, which was a casting choice that I was not so sure about when it was first announced. Steve Zahn, although funny, lacked Al Giordano's (the book version, I mean) charm and cool-as-ice-under-pressure bravado and wisecracking nature. William H. Macy, who plays the part of Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker, just did not look like the tough-as-nails, manipulative and charming (although, to be fair, he is always smoking his trademark cigars) NUMA chief portrayed in the book.<br /><br />The story, based on the book, had to sacrifice a lot in the transition to the big screen and this wasn't such a good thing. I admit it will be difficult to bring the whole book to the screen but I think it could have been done better. In the hands of a more talented and experienced director, this movie could have been as timeless and exciting as the movie that revitalized the Action Adventure genre, Raider of the Lost Ark.<br /><br />None of the action sequences were what would be called spectacular or thrilling and since they were all pretty short sequences, rarely had time to build to a breathtaking finish. In this age of jaw-dropping special effects and flashy explosion-filled Summer Blockbusters, Sahara actually looks quite tame and mild. The only sequence that stood out was the \\"Panama\\" sequence. But this sequence comes pretty early in the movie and by the end of the movie I was wondering why they didn't save the best for last.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In Summer, 2004, my friend asked me if I knew anything about this cancelled TV show called \\"Firefly\\". I told him that I vaguely remembered it being on, but didn't really know much about it. He proceeded to fill me in and showed me the first couple of episodes. I was really tired at the time, so I remember now being overly impressed with those episodes. However, I did think them cool enough to maybe watch the other episodes sometime.    Thankfully, my friend bought me my own DVD set as a gift before I moved to Florida.     I have to tell you, this is one of my all-time favorite shows. Top 5 at least. I love the concept, the characters, the stories. I keep the DVDs in my room on my bookcase, and I treat them the same as a favorite novel. It's a very rare instance when a TV show really touches me like this one has.     Unfortunately, this show is yet another example of the stupidity of network TV that is consistently outdone by the cable networks as far as quality of programming. They finally get a good show and throw it away when their efforts to keep ratings low are sucessful. I'm thrilled that the movie is coming and really hope that Fox realizes what tools they are after it is successful.

B00007ELEL|4.0|Not their very best work- try \\"Fargo\\" for that- but if you like the Coen brothers' films, you'll like this one, too.
B0001AP158|1.0|Very disappointing.  There was no energy in their performance at all.  All the old songs that I loved were changed to ballads.  I've always loved their ballads too, but there was no energy in this music at all.  It seemed completely void of any enthusiasm or emotion.  I'm not sure what they were trying to convey, but I guess it went past me.  I was even excited about it being an acoustic performance.  I remember seeing Cinderella live years ago doing an acoustic show.  It was incredible!  I don't know what happened to Bon Jovi.  This DVD was just very very disappointing.  It just didn't sound like them at all.  I hope they aren't gone forever.
0385513755|5.0|I found The DaVinci Code to be a well written intelligent read. Being raised catholic and as a grown up jaded to oraganized religon in general,Mr Brown's ideas do strike a note with me. The fact that organizations such as Opus Dei really do exsist and have such medieval views of women and the modern world disturb me. I find that Mr Browns description of the historical figure we know as Jesus Christ not that far-fetched or heretical. He may have been the only Son of God, he was also a human being with all our faults and our noble qualities. Above all else The DaVinci Code is a great whodunit that delivers.
1400032717|4.0|I loved this whole book.  Christopher is an absolutely amazing charachter.  The way Mark Haddon portrayed him was absolutely marvelous and without a doubt unforgettable.  This book explores one boy's life journey.  His hopes for the future, his dreams, and this book explores his amazingly imaginative and intelligent mind.  It is a must read for all who wish to be entertained, who wish to laugh, and all of those who wish to learn more about the diversity of todays intellectual thinking of the mind.  Christopher is truly unique as is this whole book. <br /> <br />
B00006AG5N|3.0|Actually kind of fun to listen to Elvis' early, lesser known (to me) hits.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Some reviewers seem to see the title \\"Human After All\\" as an ironic statement, since this album contains lots of repetitions and could be described as very sequenced and robotic. I think the statement Daft Punk is trying to make with this album is deeper than that. This is a very emotional album. On this album they've picked out choice hooks that provoke a certain emotions in us, and looped them. An emotion, repeated over and over and over. Whatever you feel when you are told \\"Television rules the nation\\" Daft Punk apparently wants you to feel over and over for four minutes. And that is beautiful. Whatever you feel when you hear the song \\"Make Love\\" (The melody sounds very sad to me) Daft Punk wants you to feel that over and over. In many ways this album is about exploring the depth and meaning behind how something makes you feel. It encourages the mind. You're forced the weigh and analyze the feeling you get when you hear something looped on this album. In this respect, \\"Human After All\\" might mean that it is human to philosophize about things. The sculpture \\"The Thinker\\" comes to mind. Daft Punk wants us to think about the melodies and hooks and why they make us feel a certain way. \\"Technologic\\" is a stream of tons of \\"___ it\\" thrown at us, and the second we start to think about one, we are given another one and we can't remember the last one we were told. The statement they might be trying to make in this song is that it's all the same damn thing. It all doesn't mean anything, it all means the same thing, and what does that mean to us? The last track is \\"Emotion,\\" where we are given simply the word \\"Emotion\\" to ponder on. A fitting closer to an album about emotion. How can we leave without pondering on the word for what we feel, and what we feel when we hear THAT word? This album is beautiful and brilliant.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|You'll never believe how much this cost me: $16.99. So for seventeen clams, I got two discs spanning Bruce's career PLUS one CD of outtakes. How's THAT for an overview?<br /><br />Moving right along, this is a great place to start for those who want to hear the Boss. The whole thing kicks off with the Dylan-esque rocker Blinded By Light, a true classic. For You, Spirit in the Night and 4th of July could also very well have been high points in the Dylan catalouge. But the best of the pre-Born to Run material has got to be Rosalita. My dad thinks it's too long, but I love it, another amazing Dylan-y number, only it's a LOT more complex then anything Bob ever made.<br /><br />The Born To Run material is all incredibly strong, especially Jungleland, arguably the most complex rock song ever recorded. The same can be said with the selections from both Darkness at the Edge of Town and the River. But the Nebraska songs show a slowdown. Nebraska is a good song, but not great, and Atlantic City is just plain annoying.<br /><br />Thankfully, it picks up again in the form of the Born in the USA songs, best of the bunch being Dancing in the Dark, my favorite Springsteen tune. Tunnel of Love is good, but a bit annoying at times. Human Touch, Brilliant Disguise and Living Proof are all likeable, but Lucky Town is awful. However, Streets of Philadelphia and Ghost of Tom Joad are strong, as is the Rising, but I could do without Mary's Place and Lonesome Day. The second disc ends with two superb live performances: American Skin and Land of Hope and Dreams. As you can see, the second disc is a bit uneven.<br /><br />But that's nothing compared to the outtakes disc. Though the first five are strong, the disc hits a hobble in it's stride with Missing (Memo to Bruce: NEVER RAP AGAIN!!) and Lift Me Up (His falsetto is terrible). Viva Las Vegas, County Fair, Code of Silence and Dead Man Walkin' are all good, but the closing song (Countin' on a Miracle) is too country for me AND features the return of Bruce's awful falsetto.<br /><br />All in all, this is among the best comps money can buy.awful falsetto. <br />All in all, this is among the best comps money can buy.  <br />
B000002KDG|3.0|If you're just starting out on your shake-out through Neil Young's back catalogue, you've doubtless read that this album is essential (not least in all the surrounding reviews). I don't disagree, but like almost every Neil Young album it has its fair share of stinkers too. It's feted because it's one of only a couple of albums that weld his acoustic and grungey sides together. This should make it the ideal entry point. Unfortunately, of the 4 electric songs, 2 are criminally poor filler (Welfare Mothers and Sedan Delivery), and another is laughably overrated (Hey, hey, my, my, into the black - a shocking plodder that would be all but forgotten if it didn't namecheck Johnny Rotten and contain THAT line). This only leaves the peerless Powderfinger to seriously entertain you, which it will do for years. Notwithstanding Powderfinger, it's the acoustic set that's worth your attention. Thresher and Pocahontas both contain some gorgeous imagery and - if you keep your wits about you - the former contains some less than diplomatic references to Messers Crosby, Stills and Nash (if you're into the forensic side of things). Sail Away is pleasant enough, while Ride my Llama is the weak link of the set. Which leaves the acoustic version of My, my, hey, hey, which is an improvement on the electric version, but still way overpraised for the same reasons I've moaned on about above. And that's it. 9 songs: 3 essential. I calculate that as 3 stars. I love the man to death, but what exactly is the fuss about?
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Seriously, this film is even worse than the Titanic. I've tried to enjoy it, tried to search for the film's deeper meanings, well, there aren't any believe me. If the film's theme is just The finding of good company even in a strange world, The solace one finds in another in loneliness,then I would have to say that it is very poorly done.  <br />The story is basically about a famous American actor who got an advertising job in Tokyo, but when he got there he is alienated by the Japanese culture and had some difficulties communicating, but then he met a woman named Charolett, who also feel the same way. Well, first I have to say something about the acting, it's B-A-D. Bill Murray, in the entire film has nothing but a depressed look on him. He showed almost no character transformation, at least not in his acting. He did not get more and more cheerful, but continues to \\"get lost\\" in his loneliness. The whole film did not give me a feeling of comfort, since the message is \\"The solace one finds in another in loneliness\\" and therefore it's suppose to be comforting. But after I watche the movie it left me with an empty feeling that I even cried. Because the message the movie gave me is that life is empty and meaningless, that even in such a gorgeous city, you can't be happy and find things you enjoy. I also felt tramendously lost, lost in wandering what the purpose of life is. Lost in feeling that there's always something missing in life.  <br />The other thing is the Asian discrimination. Like another reviewer said, the two protagonists never managed to learn about their surroundings, never bothered to learn to speak Japanese because they just assumed that everybody knows how to speak English. If that is not a sense of superiority, then I don't know what is. Through their eyes, the Japanese people seemed extremely uncool, they are silly, stupid, couldn't say the \\"Rs\\" right, and have no artistic talent. All these things are discrimination and racisim. And I don't find it the least bit funny. So yeah, the protagonists wanna get the hell outta there, I would too. But the reason I received was not because they are so alienated, but that the place itself was so incredibly stupid to stay in. And this is also shown in the plot too, for example Bob and Charolett complained about cooking their own food.  <br />Overall, I cannot understand why this film actually touched the Oscars, I guess once again I can say that the critics are mindless idiots. Also I just have to say to you guys, don't persume you know a culture or a country just because you've read books on it, studied it or watched it on TV. Because all those things can be biased. Go to the country, spend time there, and you may be deeply surprised. As someone who lived half of my life in one country and half in another, I have the right to say this.
0783226063|3.0|Everybody has some philosophy on book-to-movie translations.  Mine is this, \\"You should be able to watch the movie and understand what the filmmakers are trying to do without having the book as required reading.\\"  I've watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Godfather\\" trilogies, without ever having read the novels they're based on.  Those trilogies are amazing movies.  Here's another case in point: a Jack Ryan or James Bond picture.  They all range between solid-and-greatess (okay, a few average 007 flicks aside), but I've never read the Clancy or Fleming novels that inspired those either. <br /> <br />I watched David Lynch's \\"Dune\\", and must say that it has enough \\"Lynch-ian-isms\\" in there to declare it one of his library, but this doesn't seem to be his vision that he's trying to share.  I couldn't help but feel that he made this motion picture under intense studio pressure.  I haven't always liked Lynch's movies (I believe that \\"Wild At Heart\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" are average films), but I at least knew that they were his stories and point-of-view.  \\"The Elephant Man\\" is based on a true story, plus some written biographies, but I still felt that Lynch had complete control over the film.  In \\"Dune\\", I feel that Lynch tried to find a balance between his style and sciene-fiction entertainment.  I think he kind of failed here. <br /> <br />Take, for example, the inner-monologues where Paul Atreides or the Bene Gesserit women analyze their surroundings.  Never, in any Lynch movie, has this technique been used.  This is a desperate attempt to narrow a 600-page masterpiece into a 2-hour motion picture.  You know what?  It doesn't work.  The special effects are also very poor.  They are imaginative in concept, but not awe-inspiring in execution.  The plot, when looking only at the film, makes almost no sense at all. <br /> <br />The acting is very awkward, too.  Some actors master the vocabulary, but don't express emotion, such as Emeritt McGill or Sean Young.  Some actors give bravado delivery, but it's of no use, like Patrick Stewart or Linda Hunt.  And some don't really establish their own identity, like Sting or Richard Jordan. <br /> <br />I will give this movie credit for having one amazing soundtrack from Toto.  Like Vangelis' synthesizer in \\"Chariots of Fire\\", this contrasting style actually works wonders, and is probably \\"Dune\\"'s biggest strength. <br /> <br />David Lynch's movies are better when he analyzes his characters from the inside.  All directors have films that don't quite work, but I don't think I want to see Lynch tackle another epic, historical or fantastical.  Lynch has said himself that he's interested in his visions and ideas, and that he doesn't always know what they mean.  Because \\"Dune\\" spells things out already and is complex, it leaves room for Lynch's style, but not his heart or passion. <br /> <br />I've taken the time to read Frank Herbert's novel, and it is a phenomenal piece of writing.  There are so many plot developments, vivid imagery, and well-written characters that I admire the daunting task that Lynch must've had in order to make sense out of this book.  Then the Sci-Fi Channel released a 3-part miniseries that captures the book perfectly. <br /> <br />So, after this long-winded analysis, how's the movie?  Well, I've grown to like it more and more, but it's because of external sources instead of internal measures.  In other words, I got more out of the movie because of the novel, the video games, and Sci-Fi miniseries.  I wasn't an impatient viewer, but simply had to look elsewhere so that one movie was entertaining.

B00009XITP|4.0|This film is wonderfully done! Amanda Bynes is a great actress. Plus, the gorgeous and talented Colin Firth is her father. The plot may be predictable, but it will definently make you smile.
0156027321|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because the idea is really a great one, but the plot is frustrating. It starts out a little slowly -- the first 50 pages or so. Little did I know that it's actually the best part because once the plot really gets going, it goes nowhere fast. If you're looking for a compelling shipwreck story...this isn't it. If you're looking for an inspiring, faith-building story...this isn't it either. It's somewhat of a disappointment all the way around.
B000003TSP|5.0|It is pretty widely said that Portishead's self-titled second album is okay but not as good as Dummy. Let me say that my point of view tends not to be so wide. <br /> <br />If you were a lover of Dummy tracks like \\"Sour Times\\" and \\"Roads\\", you will be disappointed with this album. But if you dug the styles of tunes like \\"Wandering Star\\" and \\"Pedestal\\", then you should do yourself a big favor and buy this album if you haven't yet. There's absolutely no way you'll regret it. Because, for me, Portishead's Portishead is one of the greatest albums ever released.  <br /> <br />Dummy was filled with creative \\"songs\\". You know, song-like structures and things you can listen to out of context of the rest of the album. But what separates this from Dummy is that you won't find \\"songs\\". What you'll find is about an hour of beautiful, haunting, mind-altering MUSIC. There's no better fuel for meditation, creativity, conversation or even tripping than \\"Portishead\\". This music puts you into another world against your will to have you chewed up and spit out. Listening to this album in its entirity is more of an experience than you'll be able to find in most places. And those who have not had this experience are sad, sad people who stare at the floor when they walk and pass you with an aura of uncoolness.  <br /> <br />The eclectic beat (changing from pure trip-hop in Undenied to an indie garage flavor in Half Day Closing) keeps you moving through its swaying motion into its abyss of uniquely layered melodies and sounds (oddly distorted guitars, a heart-rumbling bass, morbid pianos, and effects lifted straight from old noir flicks and 50's sci-fi vibes) with the great icing of Beth Gibbons vocals that you'll swear is a ghost living inside of your head.   <br /> <br />Now, that being said, this album is definitely not for everyone. Impatient people and shallow listeners will not be able to properly absorb all of the textures and oddities of this masterpiece. Some who listen at face value may find it to be repetitive (although it isn't in the least bit repetitive, definitely less repetitive than the often compared Tricky). It is imperative to listen to this album with both a relaxed and open mind.  <br /> <br />Also, as a little side-note, if you're a fan of the filmmaker David Lynch, you'll probably dig this album a lot. I don't know why. It's just one of those truths.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|It seems that Eric Clapton has been working more in the past several years than most veteran rock/blues musicians of his generation, rather than resting on his previous success.  All this and with a rather young family.  On \\"Back Home\\", Clapton shows us just how versatile he has become.  Switching from playing old blues songs as on his two previous releases to more modern, current trends in music like on \\"Back Home\\".  I enjoyed the variation of material on this disc.  His guitar does take a back seat to his vocals, but his vocals are in top form throughout the disc.  The band and the recording mix is supurb.  Since I like his vocals as much as his guitar playing, I rate this disc a winner!

0895260131|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this primer in Islam.  With Islam in the news almost daily, I needed a quick reference to this important topic.  I decided to purchase this book based on the reviews on this web site.  The negative reviews were most important because they were never on point and never demonstrated any documentable problems with the book. Thus I knew the writer has struck a nerve and was probably correct in his assessments. I highly recommend it a a first book on Islam and have recommended it to many friends.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember when Firefly originally aired on FOX and I remember thinking the idea of a space western sounded stupid and not very interesting. When it was later canceled I was not surprised. When Firefly was later released on DVD I heard nothing but praise for this show and how great it was. I admit my curiosity was peaked but I still was not ready to give it a try. Then I heard rumblings that there was a movie in the works based on the show. That along with many of my friends telling me to buy this was enough for me to give it shot. I watched this whole boxest over the period of two days. I was shocked at how good this show was. And I was also angry with myself for never giving this show a chance back when it originally aired on television. But then I realized that I wasn't the only one and now there are thousands of us who have just now discovered this great show on DVD. This show is unlike anything I have ever seen on television and it works. Also it was one of the first sci-fi programs I had ever seen that remembered that in space there is no sound. So during the battles in space you hear nothing and I love that. I really enjoyed all of the characters and looked forward to each episode and what would happen to them next. Also after the first few episodes I found myself singing along with the theme song and still do every once and awhile. But all good things must come to an end and I was disappointed when I had finished the set knowing that there would be no more episodes. But as I mentioned, there is a film that will be released later this year and I cannot wait. I think anyone who is on the fence about this show should take a chance, as I did, and buy this set. And if you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it from a friend and I am sure you will end up buying a copy of your own before long. This show is that good and Joss Whedon has proven he is one of the best.

When I was young (read that \\"back when dinosaurs roamed the earth\\") there was much debate over the value and acceptability of the \\"anti-hero.\\"  I remember the tortured soul Barnabus Collins from Dark Shadows as being one of the sparks of the debate.<br /><br />Pow, now it's 2005 and yet another flawed, dark, brooding, Hero has hit the written page.<br /><br />The difference is, Dexter has no superpowers, he's completely human. Dexter is an observer of humanity, but not a member of humanity, by his own definition.<br /><br />Dexter is as moral as a serial killer can be and operates within his own framework of rules. His adoptive father Police officer Harry's rules.  To make this even more interesting, he is a blood spatter annalist for the police department.  This gives him accesses to the very thing that he hunts and kills, killers. His special preferance are child killers.<br /><br />By his own admission, Dexter knows what feelings he should have, but doesn't and who he should care for, but can't.  His struggles to keep his human mask in place and his \\"dark passenger\\" content are a fascinating, page turning, suck you in, keep you from sleeping 'till you finish the chapter, section, book, kind of ride.<br /><br />I loved the book, and eagerly picked up Darkly Devoted Dexter.

0786856297|5.0|This is a delightfully entertaining book based on the premise that the gods of Olympus still exist and have mingled their blood and talents with mortals.  All is explained casually and naturally with the author's charming wit and imagination.  The text of the book is such that adults will enjoy and laugh with Percy and his gang of semi-gods with different powers.  Olympus is over New York  City (of course) and the entrance to Hades is in Los Angeles (naturally, just the right place).  This is a very sparkling and pleasant diversion from the tragedies of this past week in New Orleans.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It is true that this cd will grow on you. The first time I listened, I wasn't so sure, but I did know that I liked the song \\"White Shadows\\" in which I don't understand why \\"Speed of Sound\\" is considered to be a hit, because I think there are a lot of better songs on here... <br /> <br />I suppose, this cd (or band) is not meant for people who like metal or/and rap music, unless you're the type who likes all kind of music, then that's great. I honestly don't think Coldplay is overrated. Coldplay is almost like The Beatles of today. They bring a nice alternative rock sound. In fact, this album, I find to be a little trippy. <br /> <br />X&Y, that song has such a neat pace to it. Chris' voice moves up and down and I just like the sound of it. Talk is another favorite of mine. It begins with a small guitar solo that is in the background... and then in comes the drums and other guitars. It's such a great song... White Shadows has a nice bass in it. I listened to this cd on a car trip this summer, and when this song came on, the bass echoed in the car. It was really great. This cd makes you daydream a lot. <br /> <br />Throughout this cd, there's a new sound in it. A keyboard sound that almost sounds similar to an organ, but not quite. It sounds very \\"oceanic\\" if that means anything. It reminds me of being under water (and the cover art is also a very dark blue). It just creates a theme that connects with everything. Even one of the last songs \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" truly brings out a theme. I don't know why I find that appealing, I just do. <br /> <br />  This is a great album, and I can't decide whether I like this better than \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" I think this is a good album. If you've like Coldplay since \\"Parachutes\\" you should check it out. It will grow on you if you don't know what to think of it.
B00003CXA2|4.0|I would have given it 5 STARS, but because Hanks is out of character several times, especially when he cries at the end. Gump would not cry or have those emotions towards his son. The whole film he played Gump as a naive unaware oblivious person, but then all of a sudden they went for the melodramatic moment at the end, which was simply not needed. He also overplays the part sometimes and lacks believability. Watch it a few times and you will see what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />I give it only 4 STARS and most of those go to Zemeckis for his direction of a film that really takes you in some many directions, and work each time.  <br /> <br />YES, you have to be an idiot not to know its PURE HOLLYWOOD, but so what? It works!  People that criticize Hollywood films like this most simply do it to be rebellious. You can admit you like these types of films, but still love cult, underground, independent, foreign films etc. Nobody cares if you like Forrest Gump. It's a movie of life, death, victory, failure, love, hare, anger etc. and it manages to encompass all of those emotions well. For those who criticize it, go make your movie and see how yours turn out.
B0000640S1|5.0|John Rambo was a man on the edge. He had fought courageously for his country, he even was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery and valor. He was also an exceedingly dangerous man, a killing machine, a man haunted by memories of Viet Nam. An Army Ranger, a member of a special unit that worked solitary, behind enemy lines in South Viet Nam, living off the land, killing, maiming and dispiriting the enemy. He was a prisoner, who was tortured mercilessly, until his escape, when he was finally sent home, not to cheers and parades but a chorus of dissenters spewing venom and saliva.<br /><br />If that wasn't bad enough, he had been rousted and ran out of town by sheriffs and chiefs of police throughout the Northwest before he got to this the small mountain town of Hope, where there came an inevitable clash of wills with the local Chief of Police, Wilfred Teasle (Brian Dennehy).<br /><br />John Rambo is just passing through and decides to get a hamburger and a coke but Chief Teasle has other ideas. He doesn't want any riffraff in his town so he picks up Rambo and drives him to the edge of town, He wasn't particularly nasty about it, in fact he tried to be pleasant, determined but pleasant, but he wasn't so pleasant later when he found the kid in the local diner. He told the waitress to put the kid's order in a bag and hustled him back out of town. By now Teasle was very annoyed, so he went and parked on a side street and kept watch to make sure the kid did not walk back into town.<br /><br />For his part the kid (Rambo) had reached his limit. If someone was going to push him, he was going to push back. He was determined to go back and confront the Chief and make him back down but of course Teasle had other ideas. He arrested the kid, took him to jail, hosed him down and started to give him a haircut and a shave.<br /><br />As mentioned, Rambo was an escaped POW. He was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese and was tortured relentlessly before escaping, so when the deputies tried to shave him with a straight razor, he flipped out and grabbed the razor and slashed a deputy that reached for his gun.<br /><br />Thus began an odyssey of death and mayhem in the nearby mountains and eventually destroyed a good part of Hope.<br /><br />Credits<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone... John J. Rambo<br /><br />Richard Crenna .... Col. Samuel Trautman<br /><br />Brian Dennehy .... Hope Sheriff Will Teasle<br /><br />Bill McKinney .... State Police Capt. Dave Kern<br /><br />Runtime: 97 minutes<br /><br />Director: Ted Kotcheff<br /><br />Story by: David Morrell<br /><br />Screenplay: Michael Kozoll & William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />To start with, I must tell you that First Blood is one of my favorite movies, so naturally I think everything was top drawer. The acting, the directing, the story, the editing, the cinematography, everything was excellent, especially Stallone who shinned with his less is more style of acting, reminiscent of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne.<br /><br />The story came from a debut novel of the same name by David Morrell, who after such an auspicious start has penned many more novels. I read the novel as well and as violent as the film is the book is much more violent. The novel was set in the town of Madison, Kentucky, instead of Hope. By the way the town that the movie was shot in was indeed Hope, but it was in British Columbia, Canada not Washington or Oregon.<br /><br />Overall, I find First Blood, to be an immensely entertaining movie and one full of morals. You may not be aware of these morals while you are watching the movie but they are more obvious upon examination. It would be good if we could take these morals with us from this movie and adopt them. Things like; you cannot judge a book by it's cover, things are not always as they seem, never prejudge your fellow man, live and let live, authority is not an excuse for misconduct and so forth.<br /><br />First Blood wasthe first and in my opinion the best of the Rambo trilogy, with the second being very good as well. If you haven't seen either of these great movies, you're in for a treat. Assuming you like action movies that is. Final Rating 5 Stars.e first and in my opinion the best of the Rambo trilogy, with the second being very good as well. If you haven't seen either of these great movies, you're in for a treat.

B000000WF0|3.0|This is my least favorite of The Verve's LP's, though it is still pretty descent within the confines of trying to reach a wider audience.  I say that because these are mostly Richard Ashcroft's songs with guitarist Nick McCabe's input.  Not McCabe ideas with Richard's input, or atleast more of a balanced, free flowing collaboration.  Like many Verve fans, I still believe McCabe is the most undervalued and gifted guitarist of his time, and I think songwriting structure takes away from his experimental visionary genius.  This is why a \\"Neon Wilderness\\" opens up another whole new universe to my ears, and my appreciation for \\"Weeping Willow\\" has grown.  The special insert \\"Deep Freeze\\" is life-affirming, like an isolated and surreal moment in time.  Nick simply seems to have more free range.    Having said that, I think Sonnet, The Drugs Don't Work, and maybe the most undervalued track, Velvet Morning, show Richard coming into his own as a songwriter. (Check out \\"Lord I Guess I'll Never Know\\" and \\"So Sister\\" from the BSS single.)  I liked how one review called UH \\"shadow\\" rock.  I just wish Nick McCabe's experimental influence on the album was more than just a shadow.  Its understated shadow blues that does and does not work.

B00097A5HW|4.0|Even if you don't speak Spanish like myself, you'll enjoy this album.  At first listen to kick-off single \\"La Tortura\\", I was immediately drawn into the raw emotion of ex-lovers that transcends language.  Throughout the album, Shakira continues to put you in touch with her feelings, melding her heartfelt lyrics with latin, pop, and new wave beats.  And for an addded bonus, there is not one but two remixes of \\"La Tortura\\"; the 'shaketon' mix as last track on disc 1, and 'reggaeton' mix on disc 2.  Now if there were only a club mix...

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is the brainchild of writer/director Joss Whedon (whom you might remember from the Buffy and Angel series).  He has a wonderful sense of ensemble cast dynamics and a terribly witty writing style(Swearing in Chinese is a nice touch).  This series is action comedy at it's finest.  Even the theme song, which Joss wrote his-multitalented-self, is catchy. <br /> <br />  The characters are well developed and uniquely funny(even the witless thug Jayne is endearing at times) and the interaction they have with eachother are complex and quirky.  The swearing in Chinese is a nice touch.   <br /> <br />  The acting is also excellent.  Nathan Fillion is especially superb as the saavy Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  From the interviews I saw in the box set, everyone in the cast really felt a part of something great and loved working on the project.  Their enthusiasm shows through.  Each person brings his/her own strength to the table.   <br /> <br />  The series starts out a little slow on the plot side, focusing more on developing the characters and mis en scene.  You can tell he had big dreams for this series and was going to develop a rich and entertaiing story, but studio executives wanted more whiz bang right away.  For some reason they didn't give the series much of a chance and cancelled in the first season.  The box set tells air dates for the episodes and includes the unreleased ones. <br /> <br />  I'm hoping that the theatrical release of the firefly movie Serenity will evoke enough interest to jumpstart the series again.  After watching the final episode in the set, I was left wanting more of the witty camaraderie and tricky plots.  There are a lot of questions left unanswered (maybe some will be revealed in the movie) and a feeling that there are many adventures still to come.   <br /> <br />  Unfortunately, the execs didn't feel the same.  But I, for one, am delighted to add this box set to my DVD library and look forward to Joss's future projects.
B0000009S3|5.0|GO GET IT. I personally prefer it on vinyl because it has more of a \\"lets start making out\\" appeal with the ladies. Especially side 2.<br /><br />As far as the cd is concerned, I didn't notice many differences.<br /><br />WILLIE THE PIMP, is like a way extended sixties party song (Like you'll hear it in the background of all those movies where the \\"squares\\" try to look cool by smoking pot and then they start going berserk and make an ass of themselves so that some chick can laugh and say \\"thats not very groovy.\\")<br /><br />It way rocks though. And the fact that every other song is instrumental doesn't hurt a thing. Trust me.<br /><br />This album is cool, sexy, and even some times a little funny in the background or right up in your earphones this album is a winner.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Wally the Pimp
B0002858YS|1.0|In a quest to find something right with today's radio, I landed upon \\"Hot Fuss\\" by The Killers.<br /><br />And now, my quest continues.<br /><br />This album is loaded with overrated buzz, horrible lyrics, and ghastly tunes. Just quit it Mr. Flowers, new wave pop is dead, and you're anything but the Re-Animator.<br /><br />Singles for this album such as \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" are just totally ridiculous. Take for instance, the chorus of \\"Somebody Told Me\\"<br /><br />Well somebody told me<br /><br />You had a boyfriend<br /><br />Who looked like a girlfriend<br /><br />That I had in February of last year<br /><br />It's not confidential<br /><br />I've got potential<br /><br />WHAT? Granted, it's not a mumbo jumbo hunk of lyrics like pretentious prog act The Mars Volta, but still, the lyrics, in any context, are just bad. And the album gets drier and drier as you move on, finally closing with \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\".<br /><br />Well, trust me, if you listen to this album, perhaps not.
B000002B7O|5.0|I was just messing around reading some reveiws when I noticed that there is a REMIXED version of this album. The most recent release of this one and BLIZZARD OF OZZ have had tracks re-recorded by the new band. This means that the original drum and bass tracks have been recorded over by different people.<br /><br />ITS ALL WRONG! I was very scared because this here is one of the greatest records ever. I used to have this copy but I lost it.<br /><br />ME, I'm buying it immediatley before these copies really do dissapear.  YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME.
B0000009SF|5.0|Similar in concept to Waka/Jawaka, The Grand Wazoo is bookended by two beautiful instrumental musical works of art.  While, in my opinion, not ultimately as skin-tingling as the two show pieces on Waka/Jawaka, The Grand Wazoo and Blessed Relief are two prime examples of Zappa's innovative and immensely exceptional musical talent.  He is one of the most underated American composers of the twentieh century.  If you love interesting, intricate, jazzy, textured and rhythmic music, buy this and its companion piece Waka/Jawaka.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004YZFR|5.0|<br />The quality of the restoration brings this 35 year old print up to modern standards in terms of vision and sound.  The songs are presented with passion and life by the Stones at the peak of their power.   I would recommend this DVD as a 'must have' for younger people as an explanation of the hold that the Stones have over their parents generation, and as a 'must have' for baby boomers seeking an affirmation of their original connection with the Stones at their peak.   The fact that all of this is wrapped around the out of control Altamont concert only reinforces the fact that this is a record of a unique and special time and place, not a carefully preconcieved packaging of a bloodless product.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|Hi there <br /> <br />This hit directed by lee tanahori is such a great film, the first triple z movie that ame out, that was totally crap. the stunts in there were all computwer generated. if your gonna moan about this film then  i suggest you watch a movie your all interested in. <br /> <br />Lee is from new zealand and im from new zealand. i live in the capital city of new zealand and you cannot tell me that this moive is crap. <br /> <br />Peace
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie actually didn't scare me as a child- I loved it, and I love it even more now. It's so much more interesting than the first movie. I always wondered why Dorothy is so much younger in the sequel than the original but for some reason that only makes it cooler, plus Fairuza Balk was perfect as Dorothy.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Almost 15 years after Nirvana released the groundbreaking \\"Nevermind\\", Dave and his band are still going strong, progressing more and more into the rock scene. <br />Dave Grohl is a great musician. He can sing, yell and he is a good guitar player too. <br />This double album is the perfect combination for any maintream personwanting wanting a good rock album. Catchy songs, rock anthems, great drive on one hand and pretty melodies, chilled out \\"reflective\\" compositions, and soft singing on the other. <br />Dave Grohl certainly has understood what the public wants and is responding totally right to their needs. <br />On Disc 1, there are some great rockers, namely \\"DOA\\", \\"The Last Song\\" and \\"Resolve\\", which you are sure can get a crowd going, and \\"In Your Honor\\" is a great opener.  <br />Disc 2 doesn't really work for me. Most of the songs are just too \\"copied\\" from \\"no Code\\" esque nirvana-esque acoustic melodies. Having said that, it's not all that bad. I find \\"over and out\\" very pretty and there is some beautiful guitar work on \\"razor\\", very reminiscent of Penguin Cafe Orchestra. This, if anything, certainly shows that David Grohl is a respectable talented guitar player.  <br />After four albums, all going in slightly different directions,  \\"In your Honour\\" shows that the Foo Fighters have found their ture identity as a contemporary American rock band and are happy with it. <br />The trouble is, whereas \\"One By One\\" felt more genuine, rawer and taking more risks, this album is clean cut, but too safe and very predictible. Because of this, despite the good songs, I don't get as much a kick listening to in \\"In Your Honor\\" as I would with \\"one by One\\" or even \\"The Colour and the Shape\\". It's a bit like everything is meant to be \\"too perfect\\". There is no soul or purpose behind it. It's just another mass media product with not much originality. This would explain why \\"In your Honor\\" has been sitting at the top of the charts for over a month.  <br />All in all, I can't say that the album is bad, but it's not something which I aspire to either. <br />I give this album 3.5 stars. <br /> <br />
0552152927|3.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are usually excellent, but the first couple are on the weak side. If you're new to the series then I'd suggest starting with Equal Rites or Mort and go from there for a while, then read the first two later when you're in a more forgiving mood.
B000021XS0|5.0|About a month ago, I decided to purchase my first Dream Theater album. I came home with Metropolis 2: Scenes from a Memory. I gave it a listen on my CD player and came out with mixed emotions. Based on reviews, I was expecting to be blown out of my chair. However, the album slowly grew on me. Honestly, every time I hear it, it groes on me more and more. <br /> <br />As just about every other has posted, this is a concept album, meaning the whole album is actually a story. Scenes from a Memory is truely a work of art. Every song is tied together neatly, but yet each song has it's own distinctive sound to it. The storyline is the true gem of this album, but I will leave the fun of deciphering it up to you if you haven't listened to this album yet.  <br /> <br />The muscicianship is superb, specifically the guitar playing from John Petrucci. Also, James Labrie's vocals are really good in here. Every song in here is enjoyable. Overture 1928 is a great instrumental track that sets the stage for the entire album. I won't go over all the songs, but I will say that my favorite track from this album is Home. It is a great track with great singing and a really catchy chorus. It also has some great solos from John Petrucci.  <br /> <br />A lot of \\"metal heads\\" don't appreciate Dream Theater for allegedly being too soft. I think its a weak argument with a very narrow view. I really recommend this album for anyone. It's the epitome of what good music really is. I don't consider myself a metal head, because I value lyrical depth and meaning into the songs rather than just sheer speed and screaming, but my undisputed favorite band of all time is Iron Maiden. It gets me mad that another reviewer tried to give himself a \\"hardcore\\" image by naming all the bands he named, which included Maiden.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer's album, \\"Room for Squares,\\" is a great album if you just want to listen to some great music in the background while studying, driving, or cleaning.  It has such a great beat to it that just helps you concentrate on what you are doing at the moment.  It is also great if you just want to sit and think about something.  It helps get the thoughts flowing because of the way it stimulates your brain.  This album always puts you in such a great mood. <br /> One of his top songs, \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" is definitely one of those feel-good songs.  It has such a catchy tune to it and wonderful lyrics to sing to.  \\"Why Georgia\\" is such an amazing song because it describes very well how someone feels sometimes.   Sometimes you have just got to forget about things that you are supposed to do and just think.  Drive around somewhere randomly, sit on your bed, or just watch a movie; it does not matter because all you are doing anyways is thinking. <br /> One of my favorite songs would have to be \\"No Such Thing\\" because this song talks about how you just want to be free sometimes to run and do whatever you want, not worrying about what other people think.  It talks about setting your own goals and achieving them how you want to do things.  It is such a true song and, also, has an awesome and catchy beat to it.  You feel so worry-free and weightless while listening to it that, while all these pressures and stress builds up in your life, for a moment, you feel like you can fly and nothing can ever bring you down.   <br />  Overall, I absolutely love this CD, and John Mayer in general.  There are a couple rough spots, but it is a great CD to listen to anyways.  It is very calm and relaxing and so it does not really cause stress like other artists do.  Some songs just have such heavy metal and a lot of bass that it causes you get stressed out, even though there is nothing there to stress out about at the moment.  John Mayer is different.  It is great anytime music andyou cannot get tired of it! <br />
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Eric Clapton isn't just a muscian, he's my friend. For over 30 years his music has formed much of the soundtrack of my life, from the angst ridden power of Layla expressing my own pain with unrequited love to the generational passion of Father's Eyes precisely describing my feelings as both a son and a father of two sons. <br /> <br />In \\"Back Home\\" we find an Eric Clapton who's found joy in family and as one friend to another I say \\"good job\\" and thanks for letting us share that joy. <br /> <br />The first release, \\"Revolution\\" has a feel similiar to \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and the George Harrison \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" brings to mind the stage full of incredible muscians that was the \\"Concert for George.\\" But the best songs of the CD are the title track and \\"Run Home to Me.\\" Sounding like \\"River of Tears\\" it is packed with emotion and again as a father I can't help but wanting to remind both of my sons that they can always \\"run back home.\\"  <br /> <br />Thanks Eric for sharing your life with us, the pain, the hard journey and now the joy.
B00005JNEI|4.0|this documentary is soooo good. it makes you think twice about the american government. it has some very good points, but a lot of it is comedy. u can tell from the beginning lots of it is made up. often though bringing up points that were very true. it was very good in theaters. i live in miami and i saw it the very first day it came out. it had people screaming in the middle of the movie like f*%$ BUSH! OR F*$% U BRITNEY! there was almost a riot coming out when the documentary was over. that is the good thing about the movie. it will have u talking about it for a while. bush fans will not like it at all. but it was satisfying. this is the miami reviewer.PEACE <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I attended the Gigantour as it passed through Michigan, and attended the  \\"Meet and Greet\\" following Dream Theater's performance. What a thrill to be able to personally chat with the members of  DT, for about an hour, in a relaxed and casual atmosphere. And despite the steep price tag, I would  highly recommend it. I can only say, their brilliant musicianship onstage was only surpassed by their graciousness and hospitality after the show.     DT opened the Gigantour with The Root Of All Evil, the crowd erupted in orgasmic  pleasure, and it was a nonstop 100 minute compendium (they had to share Main Stage with 3 other bands) of  Octavarium and some of their previous best work.     Octavarium is clearly a case of DT getting back to their progressive roots.  Their previous release, Train Of Thought, was a highly successful departure into the heavier side of metal.  LaBrie continued this heavy metal foray with his superb solo release earlier this year, Elements of Persuasion.  The metal community has apparently taken notice--Petrucci and Portnoy were invited by Vai and Satriani to join the 2005 G3 Tour.  And while they appear to have expanded their appeal to fans of Metallica  (justifiably so, given Metallica's long creative decline)  DT may have disappointed some of these fresh recruits by reverting back to their progressive roots.  Nevertheless, Octavarium is a mouth watering blend of seventies style prog rock and the cutting edge prog  metal DT has pioneered for over a decade.    If you have a need for some frantic fret and ivory riffing, then The Root Of All Evil, Panic Attack and Never Enough should nicely satiate  you.  On the softer side,  These Walls and I Walk Beside You, while more mainstream,  will safely transport you to a soothing place beyond these earthly boundaries.  The Answer Lies Within may be the weakest effort, appearing somewhat sentimental and platitudinous, despite a masterful  piano and orchestral arrangement.  The second longest track, the  haunting 9/11 manifesto, Sacrificed Sons, is a tribute to those lost in our national tragedy and features some strong guitar work by Myung and Petrucci and  majestic LaBrie vocals. Finally, there is the self titled, 24 minute opus, Octavarium, with it's surreal Pink Floydesque opening, and mix of seventies style prog rock  (King Crimson, Triumvirat, Eloy).    All in all, I think there is enough here to satisfy the most discerning  DT fan tastes and expectations, with the caveat, that each song be evaluated on its own merits.  Some, however, could be turned off by the lack of a consistent theme or progressive style, and the early prog rock influences, which have typically been channeled  through various DT member side projects.  I find it amusing that some have criticized Octavarium as too \\"radio friendly\\".  It would appear DT has a long way to go before they're nominated for an MTV Moon Award.  There is no mistaking Octavarium for anything but pure Dream  Theater, another progressive metal triumph, continuing an incredible run of musical excellence and cementing their  place in music history as arguably the most influential  prog metal group of all time.  Of course, the passing of  time is the ultimate judge of how well a musical compilation will hold up, and I have every reason to believe I will be playing this one enthusiastically for a very long time.  Also, this is the last of their record deals with Atlantic, so it will be interesting to see what impact a new record label and producer will have on their music going forward.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is \\"off the chain\\" even though im a guy and everything this CD explains about her love. I understand what she is going through because im in love myself. This CD is good.
B00000B9BD|5.0|I generally agree with the positive comments offered. However, I would highly recommend that you consider getting the DVD instead. The DVD is normally no more expensive than the CD (often cheaper) and arguably demonstrates the full \\"concept\\" that the album was getting at in one of the first full-length music videos. Images of the Troubles in Belfast hint at the meaning of the lyrics of the title track. Maybe some of the images are pretentious - but what do you expect?  The Strawbs were as much prog rock as folk rock by the time of release of this album.
0679737456|4.0|Dear peer, <br />                                    The first thing that you need to know about Black Ice is the author which is Lorene Gary.  I liked this book because I learned that you can make mistakes of doing drugs, but you can quit just in time to have a better future. <br />           This book is about a girl named Libby; she went to a boarding school at St. Paul's High  <br /> School. She once went to a forest to smoke weed and pot with a group of friends. Also in this text Libby was forced to have relationship with this boy. He gave Libby a necklace of engagement, because he really liked her a lot. But Libby did not like him, so she threw the necklace away and Libby's mom picked it up and she wore it on her neck. <br />                  This story is short in length, but difficult to read. It was difficult because, a lot of event happens in every chapter and you have to read it carefully so that you could know what is happening. <br />                    My opinion about this text is that it is very interesting and it kept me entertained while I was reading the story. That is my opinion and the reason I think this book is very interesting because, I like reading Auto-Biographies. I really enjoyed reading this publication about Libby life. <br />                          Thank you  peer  for taking your time and reading this essay. I hope you make your decision and read this book. So that you could know everything that happens in this master pieace.      <br />

B0002OERI0|4.0|If you look at the title expecting Green Day bashing, you are sadly mistaken.  American Idiot is an spanking good album.  However, when considering this is supposed to be the \\"big comeback\\" it's somewhat lacking.  The whole Bush bashing thing has made Green Day stray from the things that got them famous in the first place.  That said, \\"Holiday\\", \\"Jesus of Surbia\\", \\"Give me Novacaine\\", and St. Jimmy are still pretty good songs.
0743490304|5.0|Once I read the 'Da Vinci Code' I sought out everything written by Dan Brown.  'Deception Point' was the final of the four novels I read of Dan Brown and I believe it could be the best out of 'Da Vinci,' 'Angels,' and 'Digital Fortress.'  Very fast paced, excellent characters and a timely story based on NASA and Washington and technology and science and politics...oops, I better stop before I give anything away!  Buy this book if you like a good read while you enjoy the characters and learn soemthing to boot!

B0009VCSXW|5.0|Sin City has finally come out on PSP, and my god it doesn't get better than this.  <br /> <br />A few words about the movie - This is, without a doubt, a MASTERPIECE of film-making, and definately live's up to the hype surrounding it's release.  <br /> <br />Now that's said, let's get onto technical side of the UMD disc. <br /> <br />Video: <br /> <br />Sin City looks absolutley JAW DROPPING on PSP. Consistently sharp, contrasty as hell with solid \\"BLACK\\" blacks, no evidence of grain or compression artifacts, and no bleeding whatsoever...it's a SOLID performance from Mirimax/Dimension. The OAR is untouched, keeping it's original 1:85 ratio (with tiny little black bars at the top and bottom). Subtitles are large, displayed in yellow, and easily readable against the image. Overall, this is a faultless presentation. <br /> <br />Video: 5/5 <br /> <br />Audio: <br /> <br />The sound on this baby packs quite a punch, and right from the word go you'll be pleasantly surprised. Make sure you crank this up to full volume, as it deserves this experience to be fully appreciated. Overall, a nice job boys. <br /> <br />Audio 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Extras: <br /> <br />Now, this is the first UMD disc that i own, to spoil you with more than just your usual trailers. Like the DVD release, we get the gorgeous animated menus aswell as the 8 min \\"Behind-the-scenes\\" featurette, giving you a teaser of what we'll expect on the future Director's edition coming out.  <br /> <br />Extras: 4/5 <br /> <br />Overall this is, without question, the disc to own this season. And for under $20, there's no excuse not to buy. Fantastic Visuals, Excellent Audio, and great extras, this is the benchmark for future UMD releases. Get used to this kinda UMD treatment boys and girls. <br /> <br />Overall 5/5 <br /> <br />-zallapo
0670033375|4.0|Prof. Diamond has an unparalleled expertise in anthropological research and the interaction between societal and political factors and environmental and evolutionary changes. That combined with his lucid writing style makes this a great book.  <br />Don't be distracted by the sensational title; this book is an impressive resource of research on societies ancient and present and the compilation and distillation of this data is remarkable.  <br />However you might find yourself disagreeing with some conclusions drawn from this data. That I suppose is what a good book is all about. <br />
B0009RCPY8|2.0|I agree with the previous review.  The video and audio transfers are truely among the worst I have ever experienced.  The picture is grainy and the sound has discernable noise. <br /> <br />Frankly, I feel a bit cheated.
0679720200|5.0|The minute I heard \\"existentialist literature\\" I was rather fearful of this book. I took it on vacation recently and read it cover to cover in about five hours. It is interesting because the main character, Monsieur Meursault, is absolutely detached as a human being. Typically, I would find such a concept rather boring, but somehow his ideas and actions are such a train wreck that I could not tear myself away.<br />In a rather small way, it reminded me a bit of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky in that a man murders another, and pays the price, yet never understands the magnitude of his crime because he believes \\"nothing really matters\\" in this world. Meursault's is a rather frightening philosophy, but somehow just disturbing and seemingly nonchalant enough to keep one poring over it until the end is met (in more ways than one).<br />This was a book that read rather like a movie playing in my head, and though it's far from \\"charming,\\" it certainly does make you wonder at the foibles of man. If you are like me, you will be shaking your head and saying, \\"No Way!....Better him than me!\\"<br />It is a quick read and one that is heavily prescribed in high schools and colleges nationwide. Give it a try! It's a classic.
B00005JODA|1.0|Almost unwatchable.  The camera never stops moving, and by that I don't mean panning.  I mean jerking, twitching, and swaying.  At best the movie would have been only passable if it HAD been watchable.  Here's a tip if you must see it - take some seasick medicine first.  The friend I was with, unbothered by the filming, gave it two stars for the thin plot and clichs.
B00007J5VN|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then.

0735619670|4.0|Steve McConnell's 1993 was released in the same year I graduated in Computer Science and started work. At the time I skimmed this book, not finding it particularly helpful. I was looking for a book that told me how to do exactly what I wanted to do at that particular moment.  <br /> <br />That, I now realise, is not the way good engineers learn. Through McConnell's analogy we learn that software design and implementation is very like construction. <br /> <br />Twelve years later I picked up the second edition and recognised vital skills, habits and mental models that I have developed over the years. Experienced programmers will find that it repeats and clarifies what they have learned, perhaps making them realise why they do certain things without knowing why it works out better that way. Of course there's stuff in there that I have not learned yet too. <br /> <br />Readers of the original book will find it has been updated to include much that wasn't around in 1993... Java, C# and even internet applications in general. The book has a fresh feel, yet the original concepts survive the changes in technology, which is really the strength of the book. It teaches you timeless techniques and ways of thinking, rather than specific programming details. <br /> <br />If making software is construction, this book is a guide for all you quality builders out there; the ones who make applications with solid foundations, durable construction that meet or exceed all the users expectations.
0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked this Way Comes is a story of mystery.  If you like spooky and curious novels, you are going to like this one. Something Wicked this Way Comes has events you probably want to know who the bad person is and what is going to happen.  I did not really understand the story in the beginning; because my opinion is that, the author goes from talking about a character and does not click with the rest of the story.  The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read.  The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like.  You can picture the theme of the story easily.  Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has.  The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one.  They hide, because the carnival freaks are trying to hunt them down!  If you choose to read this novel, read each chapter carefully, because if you do not you will get lost and would not know what is happening.
1573223026|4.0|Okay, let's imagine for a second that you're depressed about ...something. Your life. Your career. Your family. Whatever. And it's New Years Eve. You may have had bit to drink and this has added to your depression. Suicide might seem like a viable option at this point. So you head up to the roof of \\"Topper's House\\" (i.e., London) and plan on hurling yourself from the top. But wait. There are two more people up here with the same idea. No, make that three, as a guy carrying a pizza just arrived. Is he depressed too? Yep.<br /><br />So now what? Can you do this with an audience? Is there a waiting line to queue into in order to get this sinful act finished?<br /><br />As it turns out, you and your new roof-top companions decide not to kill yourselves. Instead, you form a sort of dysfunctional support group to help each other get by. And you learn a bit about yourself in the process. Meet Martin, a washed-up TV newscaster who slept with a 15-year-old and went to prison. Now he makes his living on a cheesy cable TV talk show that no one watches. He's lost his wife, his children and, most importantly to him, his self-respect.<br /><br />Next, meet Jess, the daughter of a minor minister of education who doesn't fit in anywhere. Her older sister has disappeared and been presumed dead. Her mother and father think she's a freak. And she's a foul-mouthed flunky.<br /><br />Then we have JJ, an American and former rock-n-roll band member who now delivers pizzas for a living. He's lost his girlfriend, his band buddies, and his will to play music.<br /><br />And finally there's Maureen, the mother of an adult invalid who never gets out of the house because she has to constantly care for her son. She has no life, no friends, and limited knowledge of what is out there in the world.<br /><br />Does this sound like the type of support group you'd want to belong to? Whoa!<br /><br />*****************************************************************************<br /><br />Nick Hornby, author of HIGH FIDELITY, gives us a great dark comedy story about these horribly messed up Londoners and how their fateful meeting turns each of their lives around.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This isn't a feel-good, solve-all-of-your-problems kind of story. The resolutions are slow and not always uplifting, but they are insightful and almost always laughable. The solutions to their problems are often found through some of the worst methods (i.e., sleeping with strangers, cussing out healthcare workers, getting a low-paying job, etc.). But they are intriguing characters that you just have to continue reading about, even though it is often painful to see what they do to each other and, ultimately, to themselves.> <br />Nick Hornby, author of HIGH FIDELITY, gives us a great dark comedy story about these horribly messed up Londoners and how their fateful meeting turns each of their lives around.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|They seem to come out with a couple of these \\"coach transforms team\\" movies every year, and I'll be doggoned if they don't keep getting better and better.  It's not hard to make a sports movie; throw some B-ball and cheerleaders in there somewhere, and we guys will watch it.  It is hard, however, to make a good sports film.  Coach Carter is the best kind of sports film because, when it comes down to it, the heart of the story really isn't about sports at all.  It's about changing kids' lives and inspiring/threatening them to go out there and make a better life for themselves.  Coach Carter succeeds where Friday Night Lights fails - yes, Friday Night Lights is a terrific film, but the message it conveys in the end is that sports, especially winning, is more important than anything else.  Coach Carter cares about his kids a whole lot more than he cares about winning.<br /><br />The basic story is pretty simple.  Coach Carter takes over a team of undisciplined players who are used to losing games and underachieving in the classroom.  Things are going to change.  He tells the kids that they will win if they do as he says, but they will have to earn it, and they will have to hit the books as well as the courts if they are going to play for him.  He makes them sign a contract: they have to agree to maintain a 2.3 GPA, attend all their classes (and sit on the front row), and dress up on game days.  These requirements go beyond state guidelines for academic eligibility.  Initially, many of the players balk, and one even walks.  Coach has his guys ready to play, however, and they start out on a tremendous run.  The kids get big heads and so some stupid things - and they pay for it.  Things hit rock bottom, though, when Coach Carter finds out that many of his kids have not lived up to their agreements: several are skipping class and failing.  That's when Coach Carter locks up the gym and cancels practice as well as key games until such time as his team has lived up to their agreement.<br /><br />The tragic part of this story is not the kids, it's the school administration and the parents.  Some of the parents have fits over the stipulations of the coach-player contracts, but the whole community goes apoplectic when Carter actually starts forfeiting games.  Let the kids play, they yell, because basketball is all these kids have in life.  Boy, that's a great message to give your kids, isn't it?  Then you have the school principal who is seemingly satisfied with mediocrity; only half of her students actually graduate, and she seems to think that's just the ways things have to be.  She doesn't approve of the academic requirements Coach Carter institutes with his team, and she doesn't like the lockout one bit.  Worst of all, she completely stymies Carter's request for academic progress reports from his players' teachers - that's why he doesn't find out half of them are flunking until well into the season.  The school board is no better, clearly putting sports before academics.  Coach Carter has to fight an uphill battle not only with his kids, but with the very people charged with educating them.  That is a disheartening reality in two many school districts today - and few schools will be lucky enough to have a Coach Carter to stir things up.<br /><br />Naturally, the movie takes us to a number of basketball games, but they don't dominate the story, not by a long shot.  The only quibble I have about the games concerns the big game at the end.  During the obligatory win-or-lose shot hanging in the air for an eternity, some of the fans in the crowd seem to be smiling.  I've lived through a number of these eternity-stretching last shots, and never have I smiled - I've grimaced, certainly; I've gotten down on my hands and knees on many an occasion; I've lifted my hands in earnest supplication to the Almighty; I've grabbed my hair and hung on for dear life - but never, ever have I smiled in such moments.<br /><br />Based on a true story, Coach Carter is a wonderful, inspirational film, and Samuel L. Jackson is terrific in the role of Coach Carter.  This movie sends all the right messages to youngsters, especially those whom society basically expects to fail, using various compelling subplots to validate the whole story in reality.  It also serves as a clarion call to parents; you can't always depend on the school system to educate your children - and if you don't care about your child's education, he or she probably won't care either.ry, Coach Carter is a wonderful, inspirational film, and Samuel L.

6305897786|4.0|Overall a pretty good movie and definitely worth a rental and if you like the mystery or occult genres, a purchase.  The Amazon review is correct that the movie, right up to the end, seems to be on the verge of something truly horrifying and shocking, but never delivers.  That's true, but the movie is enjoyable on its own terms, just as the X-Files is enjoyable on its own terms even though it never delivers on its promise.<br /><br />The movie is  well-casted and well-plotted.  Although I disagree with most of Johnny Depp's choice of roles, I have to admit that Depp is one of the greatest actors of my generation.  Some people are just naturals.<br /><br />It's a very European movie.  That means lots of books, lots of faux-philosophical discussions and themes, lots of cigarettes and lots of espresso drunk out of semi-demitasse cups in coffeehouses.  There is action in the movie, but it's not a driver like in American movies.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Love it.  Bought the CD for \\"Take Me Out.\\"  Not one song I don't like.  First heard this on a VERY long drive from Montana to Arkansas.  Especially good for keeping yourself awake while driving across Colorado in the middle of the night.  Trust me.  You won't be able to stop moving once this starts up.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|What happened? Before I continue, don't take me for some closeminded dm only fan. I love Avenged Sevenfold. Waking the Fallen is one of the greatest album's I have heard. Now, they seem like an mtv wanna-be motley crue band. I mean was it really only two summer's ago that I bought Waking the Fallen? O how the mighty fall fast. I just saw them on an mtv rock countdown along with my chemical romance, fallout boy, hawthorne heights and green day. I mean God. I have never seen a band sell-out that fast. I know their singer blew a blood vessel. He should have just quit. For the sake of the fan's and the rest of the band. I don't recommend this at all. I do recommend anything else they have done. All past work is great, enjoy.
B00006AW2G|5.0|What can I say, this is a classic, one of the most jam packed Rolling Stone albums the group ever recorded.  You are not a true fan if you do not have this album.  Gimme Shelter is so funky I just listen to that track over and over.  This takes me back to the Fillmore East in the Village and the Electric Circus, a time when rock was your life not just your music.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I think vocalist/ guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt said it best, \\"There is no other band in metal like us.\\" Normally, I would have found this funny and conceited if most other band's had said that about themselves. However, with Opeth I think he's right. They do what they do and they do it well. Being a long time Opeth fan I was semi worried about them being signed to Roadrunner records. A few thing's came to mind. A. They're going to suck up and become a shadow of their former greatness, B. alof of nu-metal kid's are going to get into them and will mkae them mainstream. Well, those worries of mine have been put to rest. Opeth actually recorded Ghost Reveries prior to signing with Roadrunner. So, if that may have been keeping you from buying this, don't let it. This to me, is what metal is all about. Heavy music, growling vocals. Fast/tight guitar work and so on, yet mixing in a great singing voice, keyboards and acoustic guitars. They bridge everything that is good about metal together. They're all great musicians and don't need a cheap Cannibal Corpse type image to get attention. The fact is, a band like this, mixing acoustic guitars and death metal growls could have come out very sloppy and unnatural if not done by incredible musicians. I feel somewhat ashamed of myself for doubting them for even a second. They once again return with a brilliant epic album that lives up to the legend that is Opeth. The only change in Opeth is the official adding of Per Wiberg to the band, who does keyboards and things of that nature. This album(amoung many others released this year) shows us that metal is still alive and well in 2005.<br /><br />1. Ghost of Perdition: This track really got me excited. Another epic track clocking in around 10 and a half minutes. The first few seconds have some melodic guitar before kicking in to a heavy song. Inbetween the distorted guitars and death metal growl's we find some great acoustic guitar's along with some great singing. Even though Mikael's singing voice seems to be going faster and a little rushed in this song, it is still brilliant. I love how Opeth can write song's with such length and have every second be as exciting as the last 5/5.<br /><br />2. The baying of the Hounds: Amazing. The music here is just so tight and intelligent. The acoustic guitar that kicks in at 7 and a half minutes is brilliant and feels so sad and emotional. While the guitar a minute before was a fast paced riff that made me wanna just headbang. Per Wiberg here does a great job of adding keyboards in here that don't push other insturments away but only add the atmosphere. Not a track you will find yourself skipping 6/5.<br /><br />3. Beneath the Mire: Begins with some mid tempo drumming and some haunting organs. Has some of the best singing here. I find it just so incredible how he can go from a heavy growl to an incredible singing voice. The guitar that kick's in at around 3 minutes and nine seconds into the song, is pure magic. Soon after some keyboard's kick in that remind me of A Fair Judgement from the Deliverance album 4.5/5.<br /><br />4. Atonement: A melodic intro, with some odd/ interesting drum's along with some singing vocals coming in around a minute and twenty seconds. The keyboards here take control and is one of the most melodic songs here 4/5.<br /><br />5. Reverie/Harlequin Forest: Start's out with a single guitar riff and some incredible violin type keyboards that I just find amazing. Has some of the best lyrics on the album here. Alot of tempo changes, which for most band's would seem like a song with no direction. However, Opeth are the king's of such type song's and they know what they're doing. Incredible epic song 6/5.<br /><br />6. Hours of Wealth: The first all acoustic song on the album, a wonderful ballad. Definetly has a gloomy mood to this song. The lyric's seem pretty sad and come off as meaningful and avoid the \\"o poor me\\" cliche song 4/5.<br /><br />7. The Grand Conjuration: The second this songstart's you know you're in for one hell of a dark ride. Even though it doesn't begin as very heavy, you know you're in for one heavy song. At around two minutes it get's to that point. The lightning fast solo is one of the best here, really show's their talent. Also, the keyboards give off a dark sound, which adds to the heaviness of this song. Another thing I love about this song, is that about 5 minutes into this song you think it is going to end but then comes right back in for another round 5/5.<br /><br />8. Isolation Years: This song begins with some moody guitar, which I personally love. One of the shortest song's here is the perfect closing song. Leaves the listener wanting to listen to the album again and again. Brilliant. \\"And isolation, is all that would remain. The wound in me is pouring out to rest on a lover's shore.\\" 5/5.<br /><br />So, I recommend this cd as much as I do any other Opeth album. It is anything but boring and one of the best of 2005. You can not go wrong with Opeth. An album that lives up to their legendary status. EnjoyThe second this song start's you know you're in for one hell of a dark ride.

It's brimming with stories, strategies and tips from the best of the best in today's motivational and inspirational fields. It's a well-thought-out workbook that guides you every step of the way in taking action on the Success Principles. And while it's a hefty hardback book, the many sub-chapters break it down into manageable bite-size info-bits. This one is a keeper!

B00005JNQS|5.0|I've bought yesterday in Sams Torreon the Robots Widescreen DVD edition, and the case presentation is very good. First, the plastic case is inside a metal cardboard (like Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow), and looks very cool.     Second, I've seen dubbed in spanish, and I've read a lot of good commentaries about Robin Williams work, and is fantastic, you can listen also to Ewan Mc Gregor, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes and Jennifer Coolidge voices, very well.     This movie is fun to kids, because it has a lot of LOL moments, in fact, if my son laughts crazy, the movie is good. If my son say \\"Daddy what time rest to the movie?\\" the movie is bad, and this movie has been seeing one more time, and other, and other, and other.    To adults, make a reflection about COMPUTERS, because since starts to talk about actualization, no reparation, it came to my mind my 3 old computers, that need a renew no a reparation.
630512762X|5.0|Nicolas Cage plays a villain worthy of a comic book, the chemistry between him and Travolta is outstanding. The cinematography is dazzling, the plot is so far out it is amazing, but still stays within the realm of possibility.    If you are a fan of either of the main actors, or are just a fan of action, this movie cannot be passed by, and I highly recommend owning it as you WILL want to see it again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to admit not knowing anything about this show just a month ago. I got a copy from a friend to watch after reading about it and was completely blown away. The acting is top notch. The story line gets better with each episode. Its been such a long time since I've enjoyed a show this much. In fact, I rarely ever watch TV anymore but if this show was still on I would definately be catching it every week. I enjoyed the borrowed copy so much I have purchased one for myself. I look forward to sharing it with friends and family.
0156027321|4.0|At first I was skeptical...a boy in a boat with a tiger!? But what surprised me was the philosophical depth of the story, mingled with wonderfully creative story-telling.  The extreme brutality of Pi's experience (that the author reveals to us), both real or imagined, manages to evoke what true joy could be.  <br />For me it highlighted that joy is all around us, but somehow it is only when we are forced by neccessity, by the shear will of survival, to squeeze joy, and not only wine, from the rock! <br />Whoever you are, or wherever you come from, you will take something personal from this story!
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Anyone who has followed Eric Clapton's career or seriously collected his music knows that this is an artist who faithfully follows his heart.  His body of work spans musical styles and every human emotion.  His 1998 album, Pilgrim, was an entire album about heartbreak and lost love.  Back Home is a joyful, upbeat album about found love.  Eric is finally at peace and content in his life, and his latest album reflects that. As much as I admire Eric Clapton the blues interpreter and rock guitarist, I deeply appreciate Eric Clapton the loving father and husband, and musical craftsman.  Back Home is a rich and fulfilling  product of the latter. <br /> <br />The songs on Back Home are exquisitely produced and energetic.  Many of the tracks include memorable hooks and melodies, something sorely missing from modern popular music.  And there are intimate lyrics that lie bare the heart of the artist.  Ultimately, this is a very courageous album to produce.  Will love and joy sell to Eric Clapton's audience?  Maybe, maybe not.  But as the songs on this album attest, the most important things in life can be found Back Home.  And that is where Eric Clapton's heart is, today.

I would have thought that Mr Webber would have made a much better choice and scrutinized the vocal performances more than he obviously did.  Is Gerard an actuall trained singer or not? <br />If you watch this with the sound off (there goes the beautiful music), at least you'll still have a beautiful visual.  What a shame.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased Firefly after seeing a preview for Serenity, the movie based off of the series.   Knowning nothing of what to expect I ended up watching every episode in the course of a week, wanting to draw it out.   Has to be one of the best shows ever done.
B000053V7O|5.0|When I first saw ROUND MIDNIGHT as a young man, I thought Dale Turner was real jazz musician and wondered what he had done that made him avoid America, like Roman Polanski.  That's a tribute to the good acting of Dexter Gordon and the direction of Bertrand Tavernier, who I understand is Swiss.  The tight close-ups of the 1959 Blue Note reverberate with sweat and reality.  Recently I had the chance to watch this film in tandem with Michael Curtiz YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN and I saw some similarities in the way Gordon is photographed with the John Alton shadows and stripes across his handsome face, just as Juano Hernandez was given almost the noir treatment in the earlier film, in the heated nightclubs where everyone wears a cigarette out the side of their mouth and the smoke makes feverish patterns across the whitewashed walls..  I wish the DVD had included some memories of the film makers, including some testimony from Tavernier to see if he had really studied earlier American jazz films or not.<br /><br />A young French jazz buff grows close to Dale who then becomes his idol, and shares acting duties in the film, just as Dale sweats out his addiction to liquor but what he can't shake his love/hate affair with New York City and with America as a whole.  That ambivalence is a factor the young Frenchman just can't understand; it goes way over his head and leaves him standing on the far shores of love even on the banks of the East River.  I suppose if this movie had been made in the USA this character (Francis) would have been played by a woman (like Doris Day) in YOUNG MAN WEITH A HORN, for in the USA men aren't allowed to give each other the adoring looks that Francois gives Dale in this one.  Given the time period (1986) perhaps the part would have been offered to Robin Givens or Lisa Bonet?  As it is we get the incandescent Lonette McKee at her finest, and singing beautifully too.  The film goes to great lengths to prove Francis solidly heterosexual, and pro-family, with his parents and a cute little daughter.  David Rayfiel, who wrote this paean to black-white relationships, was for years the favorite screenwriter of Sydney Pollack, and also wrote the amazing rape revenge picture LIPSTICK.  He is a true journeyman and here he gave Dexter Gordon a part that should have won him the Oscar.with his parents and a cute little daughter.

1932100385|5.0|This book, among other sources of information, was instrumental in getting my husband and me to dramatically change our eating habits. After only a month, I've already noticed drastic differences in the way I feel. We're not completely vegan, nor are we completely vegetarian, but we have steadily whittled down the number of animal proteins in our diet. After reading the book and experiencing the benefits, I was astonished to see all the negative reviews written about it. Especially the ones that attack the model of the study and the statistics involved. My husband has his Masters and is currently pursuing his PhD in statistics.  He's also a consultant on experimental design and helps researchers get their statistics right. When he read this book and looked at the statistics therein, he did find some minor mistakes here and there, but none so egregious that it would invalidate the findings.<br /><br />I think if you look hard enough at any scientific experiment, you're bound to find minor chinks in it. You cannot design a perfect study because there will always be things you didn't anticipate or things you didn't account for. That said, the fact that this study didn't include certain factors doesn't negate its findings. Anyway, I think most of the critics are the ones who refuse to make a lifestyle change - much like a smoker refusing to believe all the research pointing to the hazards of smoking. They are desperate for any tid-bit of information that might say their current habits are fine and that the researchers have no idea what they are talking about. No matter how much criticism this book gets, you still cannot deny that this is the largest, most in-depth epidemiological study to date on nutrition and its direct relationship to health. You cannot ignore the importance of it.
B000053VAZ|3.0|This might have been a better film, except that it reminds me a lot of the wise-cracking cut-up that always sat in the back of the classroom when we were kids:  he always tried too hard for a laugh, and never knew when to shut up.  So too is one left with the feeling that everyone involved in this film is trying so damned hard to make sure that every single viewer knows that the characters are a little off-kilter (but still have the same feelings & passions as \\"normal\\" folks), that they don't notice that we all got that point pretty early on.  After a certain point, one feels like one is being beaten over the head with the film's rather ham-fisted quirkiness.  It doesn't make for a bad film, but it becomes a \\"too much of a good thing\\" situation.  I felt more manipulated than anything else.
B00005JODA|5.0|From the very beginning of this film, the beautiful cinematography ensures the attention of the viewer. The protagonists are played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, and some of the best performances of the year are given in this picture. Upon the brutal murder of his free-spirited and beautiful wife, Tessa, Justin Quayle, a British diplomat working in corrupted Kenya, weaves his way through the tangled intrigues of the corruption of both governments and drug companies. The plot is not only highly believable, casting a dark but relevant shadow, but fascinating. The movie takes place fairly out of order, but is not at all confusing, and the pieces slowly fall into place, as the web unwinds. Amidst the beautiful scenery of Kenya, through the dramatic and moving performances of the actors, a delicate plot unravels. A beautiful film.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Listen here, all you who are giving this a bad rating because you don't like death metal/have a problem with the covers and lyrics. Are you really so ignorant? Of course you're not going to like this if you don't like death metal. And if you are letting the lyrics get in your way you are just a plain dumbass. Now, as far as death metal goes, this is THE perfect death metal band. Perhaps the songs do sound very familiar? Perhaps they keep the same lyrical writing style? Perhaps this is what Cannibal Corpse has perfected? Ah yes. For what this is, I give it 5 stars. I personally liked Tomb of the Mutilated far more, but that's not the point. I even believe a few of their earlier cds actually sucked. But this, no, this is ridiculous. If you have any idea of what being a musician is like, you will appreciate this band, even if it's not your thing. Talent is pouring out of these individuals. The DVD that comes with this CD would shatter your images of these guys...all are very laid-back chill dudes, who enjoy other forms of music besides metal and are very capable at playing whatever style they want. Top-notch musicians. Listen to the guitar on \\"Frantic Disembowelment\\". Do I need to say anything else?
B000063JDE|4.0|What is most intriguing about this film is the contrast between the reaction of the average moviegoer (so mind-numbingly boring that they were barely able to sit through it) and the local intelligentsia (\\"brilliant\\", \\"innovative\\", one comment compares Lynch to \\"Bergman, Fellini, and Bunuel\\" - insert the sound of gagging here).    Although these extreme comments are very entertaining they are pretty much useless for anyone thinking about whether to view this film. So what did those with extreme opinions find or fail to find in this film? My guess is that they found about same thing but reacted to it in very opposite ways. The film is a rather obvious dark satire on the hypocrisy of American culture-what lies under the thin veneer of middle class society. So the disparate viewer reactions may just be political. And while an entertaining film with subtle subversive messages can have mass appeal, Blue Velvet is not a particularly entertaining film. Nor is it a particularly subtle film although Lynch does try to keep the viewer confused by suggesting that some of what we are viewing (or have viewed) is a dream and by keeping many details ambiguous (such as just what is Hopper inhaling-helium?).    It is not important that we know any of this stuff for sure anyway, as viewers can fill in the missing pieces with whatever fits their personal agenda. This is the same technique that Lynch relies on in \\"Mulholland Drive\\". Both films are filled with contrived plot twists, misdirection, and insanely over-the-top characters. You stay with the story to find out how Lynch will manage the seemingly impossible task of pulling all these disparate plot elements together by the end of the film. Of course what seems impossible is impossible, Lynch has to cheat at the end, turning what appeared to be realism into expressionism. Lynch relies on the fact that instead of feeling cheated, a large segment of his audience will instead credit him a degree of vision never seen before in cinema history. Since there is nothing to contradict their interpretation they credit him with the visionary genus to have intentionally placed each element that supports their interpretation in the film.    Despite the many negative comments, this cheating does not make \\"Blue Velvet\\" a bad film. Indeed Lynch's ability to make something expressionistic look like realism is amazing as long as you credit Lynch with a brilliant technique and not with a brilliant vision. That said there are some basic problems with \\"Blue Velvet.    The first problem is that the underlying depravity in suburban and small town America is very ordinary and unexceptional,  not the imaginative \\"deep into the recesses of our minds\\" stuff portrayed in this film. Even less controversial suburban portrayals like \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" feature what would be considered extreme behavior, as the average suburbanite is more mundane and far less adventurous than the protagonists of those films.    The second problem is that you have to constantly work at suspending your belief that this is a film. Burning mental energy just trying to stay 'in' the story does not make for a good movie-going experience. Although Dern and Hopper are fine, MacLaughlin and Rossellini are simply awful. So the viewer tends to wonder what is going through Rossellini's (the actress) mind during the filming of each scene and not what was going through her character's mind. And I am writing in terms of cast names and not character names. MacLaughlin seems to be in almost all Lynch's films and his career specialty is sapping the energy from scenes.    \\"Blue Velvet\\" starts with some great images: ideal suburbia - kids crossing the street, firemen waving as they go down the road on their truck, and a man watering his garden. Then the guy has a stroke and collapses. We are then treated to the best shot of the film: his dog playfully jumping around the squirting hose he continues to hold as a toddler ambles toward him. Then thecamera moves down for a macro shot of the insect world in his lawn. This bears an interesting similarity to Blair Treu's 2003 film \\"Little Secrets\\", where one of the children runs a business of keeping all the neighborhood secrets in a safe place for a fee. Ostensibly a squeaky-clean family film, \\"Little Secrets\\" takes Lynch's basic theme and turns it into a lesson about friendship and trust.    \\"Blue Velvet's\\" strong point is the cinematography, which is absolutely gorgeous and dreamlike. It's weakness (in addition to those already mentioned) is that its weirdness is positioned midway between 'The Graduate' and 'The Doom Generation'. It somehow manages to be both inaccessible and uninteresting.    Suburbia is a place to escape the problems of the world and those who choose to inhabit suburbia do so because they are either afraid of the world or just too lazy to be exceptional; and not because they are the creatively perverse villains of \\"Blue Velvet\\".     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

B0000024UO|4.0|If you like hard-rockin', crunchy Texas blues, well, this may not be the album for you.   \\"Be Careful with a Fool\\" is the only song on which Winter really cuts loose in this way.  But that song alone is worth the cost of the record, because it's a bonafide gem!  He takes this obscure BB King number and infuses it with some of the hottest licks ever recorded. In fact, I do believe Mr. Winter knocks the proverbial frets off his Fender.  <br />However, \\"Johnny Winter\\" is very much a blues piece, and drips with passion.  It explores a good variety of blues styles. <br />The opening cut, \\"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\\", kicks off with a nice funky riff, and stays electric and funky. \\"Leland Mississippi Blues\\" is some great Stratocastic rocky blues, with a blistering solo.  \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\" features a horn section and you'll want to shake your thing, especially when Mr. Winter cuts loose in the middle eight. <br />\\"I'll Drown in My Own Tears\\" has Brother Edgar playing some nice honky tonk piano. <br />The most soulful song is \\"Back Door Friend\\", a slow blues burn.  Johnny takes all your stress away and puts it on his own shoulder for you.  You just kick up your weary feet and smile! <br />A good deal of this album is a testament to the steel slide guitar style of the Delta.  (From the inside-sleeve photo, it appears to be a National-style Gibson Steel.)  He plays it beautifully, and it's refreshing to know that in 1969, there was somebody around with enough passion for a \\"non-popular\\" musical style to pay homage. <br />Johnny Winter's voice is passionate as well--some might call it an acquired taste.  It certainly wouldn't get him very far on \\"American Idol\\"--then again, Simon probably wouldn't get this music anyway. <br />\\"Johnny Winter\\" is a soulful album that comes straight out of the heart of the artist, which is why it has endured.

The author's fable about the boy \\"Santiago\\" is poorly written. I felt like I was reading a book by somone who had just completed a crash course in Philosophy 101. What the author does well is keeping things simple. I guess that's what people love about this book. He does point out obvious things, and maybe once in a while we love to be spoonfed.

B00006EXL5|4.0|So here's my little MCR story: The first time I ever heard of them, I mistakenly ignored them. When they released their second album \\"Three Cheers...\\" I read the lyrics to the first single \\"I'm Not Okay\\"; loved the lyrics, downloaded the song, hated it for some reason.  <br />THEN one day in Urban Outfitters (I know, I know, *gag*) the heavens parted and I heard \\"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison\\" and I LOVED IT because it is brilliant. So my friend lent me the album and I just fell in love. I decided to get the first one since I loved Three Cheers so much. <br /> <br />\\"Bullets\\" is much different from their major-label release. I didn't really like it at first, I think for one thing because it has poor sound quality and at times it's hard to hear what Gerard is singing. But once you get past that (and look up the lyrics - Gerard, honey, you need to enunciate...and stop screaming so much, you're gonna ruin your pretty vocal chords, and you have such a beautiful voice!) it really grows on you, just like it did on me. The more I listened to it, the more I loved it. This album really needs to be given a second chance...and sometimes a third, fourth, and fifth, to really appreciate it. I only gave it four stars because there are one or two songs that are just kind of, erm, bad (but that's okay). And I don't usually go through song-by-song reviews (cuz most people have short attention spans) but this one really needs to be broken down, all the songs are so different. <br /> <br />1- Romance: <br />Romance is actually the first song on the album (damn you, amazon!) It's just a short but beautiful intrumental recorded by guitarist Ray Toro. He did it with his computer. Ray is awesome, btw. <br /> <br />2- Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us <br />Oh lusty song titles of joy. Anyway, the song. Catchy, great guitar work (because Ray is awesome, of course, that needs to be restated). Gerard sings about pills and gets pissy. Unfortunately you really can't understand what he's saying most of the time, so look up the lyrics. It's pretty dark. But still one of the better songs on the album. <br /> <br />3- Vampires Will Never Hurt You: <br />Awesome song! It seems to tell a story about vampires, and what happens when one is captured by the vampires - will they kill him as he requests, or will love conquer all? Or something. Well, heck, vampires are verrah cool :) Just an all-around great song, it starts off slow and then it really rocks. Best lines: <br />\\"Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse <br />And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church <br />We're hanging out with corpses, and driving in this hearse <br />And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul\\" <br />AND <br />\\"We'll throw back holy water like cheap whiskey.\\" <br /> <br />4- Drowning Lessons: <br />I usually skip this one, it's not really anything special. But the guitar is awesome. Because it's RAY. So talented. <br /> <br /> <br />A QUICK NOTE ON THE OTHER BOYS: Okay the old sucky drummer (Matt) recorded on this album. Feh to him. BUT bassist Mikey (so cute!) and other guitarist Frank (hee) are AMAZING. They're both very good musicians, the way they can play is just crazy (especially live).  <br /> <br />Okay, moving on. <br /> <br />5- Our Lady of Sorrows <br />Pretty good. Gerard says f*ck a lot. <br /> <br />6- Headfirst for Halos <br />AHHHHHHHHHHKNMDMSQFGHJVFYRTDYE$W#!!!!!!!!! I think it's the best song on the album ^_^ It's very upbeat and fast (which of course means amazing playing by the boys). The lyrics are very cool, it's all about going insane over someone, basically, but kind of told in a flashback format. <br />\\"Well let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all <br />I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling <br />And now the red ones make me fly <br />And the blue ones help me fall <br />And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling <br />And as the fragments ofmy skull begin to fall <br />Fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts\\" <br />It sounds violent....but dammit it's such a great song. Plus no one under the age of 18 should be listening to MCR anyway, they tend to deal with some pretty heavy stuff that stupid 11 year olds and teenagers alike just can't really understand. <br /> <br />7- Skylines and Turnstiles <br />.....................*sigh* Alright, it sucks, I think, but it's the first song Gerard ever wrote. Thank God he got a billion times better. <br /> <br />8-Early Sunsets Over Monroeville <br />Very lovely! And very mellow. One of my early favorites. It's a beautiful song, just very calm (a welcome contrast from the rest of the album). Still dark lyrics, but you can't even understand what poor Gerard is singing half the time anyway. <br /> <br />9-This Is the Best Day Ever <br />For some reason I like this song a lot. It's about romance in a hospital! (Or torture chamber, who knows). Oh Gerard, you sure do know how to show a girl a good time. <br /> <br />10- Cubicles <br />Catchy. Not lyrically deep or impressive, just catchy :) A good song for anyone who had an office romance go very, very bad. <br /> <br />11- Demolition Lovers <br />Oh. My. God. Easily one of the best songs MCR has EVER done. It gives me chills. It starts off very slow. It's dark and beautiful and reaches depths of emotion and want and lyric mastery that is beyond anything else on the album. Everyone needs to hear this song even if you don't like MCR or anything else on the album. <br />\\"Hand in mine, into your icy blues <br />And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway <br />With this trunk of ammunition too <br />I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets <br /> <br />I'm trying, I'm trying <br />To let you know just how much you mean to me <br />And after all the things we put each other through and <br /> <br />I would drive on to the end with you <br />A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full<br />And I feel like there's nothing left to do <br />But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running\\" <br /> <br />It's another song that tells a story, but it's much more in-depth. Incidentally, it inspired the storyline for \\"Three Cheers\\" - it's on that level of greatness. <br /> <br />So there you have it. Hope you enjoy the album. :)

Brilliantly illustrated with a language that is as original as the graphics, I highly recommend this to fans of the movie.

1932907009|5.0|I have all of the \\"classic\\" screenwriting texts and many of the more contemporary ones. Snyder's new book is going to push most of those in my collection to the very back of the shelf.  <br /> <br />This book is definitely not a Lew Hunter, David Trottier, Syd Field or Joseph Campbell how-to book with specifics on story-telling, formatting, dialog writing or breaking into the market. What this offering does, instead, is to help the writer think through the story that she wants to tell and to put it together in such a way that it's attractive to potential buyers.  <br /> <br />Examples: The first couple of chapters ask you to focus on basics first (like logline and title) because, in order to write an effective logline and a captivating relevant title, you must have a good understanding of the story you want to tell. It then moves on to the other SP components that must be clear in the writer's mind before actually sitting down to type the FADE IN.  <br /> <br />The things I found most useful: the beat sheet (ch 4) helped me visualize where the key elements needed to be placed in order to have the story be more effective. The board (ch 5) gave me a tool to help me layout the scenes structurally so that the important plot points and transitions are placed where they need to be to make the story flow.  <br /> <br />Granted, there will be those who pooh-pooh the \\"put-this-event-on-this-page-and-allow-\\"x\\"-number-of pages-for-this-to-happen\\" approach to screenwriting but I have to tell you -- I've been researching a project for almost a year now and have been struggling with the most effective way to tell this story.  In one day, I was able to complete a beat sheet, complete the outline, separate the good scenes from the bad and recover the enthusiasm for this SP that I had almost a year ago when I started it.  <br /> <br />Once you have a good understanding of the basics of screenwriting, this is one of the two best books (the other is Michael Hauge's Writing ScreenplaysThat Sell) to help you get your script in shape to make it attractive to potential buyers.  <br /> <br />Thanks, Blake! <br />
0441172717|5.0|A student of mine recently said, \\"I use Dune as a philosophy of life.\\" Given how hard it was to connect with this particular student, I chose to reread the book to better understand the student and to revisit a book that I loved in high school. I remember reading the entire series in school and being engrossed in the story. Now, having stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi except for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", I was wondering how I would look at Dune as literature. Interestingly, \\"Dune\\" is a \\"Reading List\\" book in Montgomery County Libraries, a well deserved indicator of its classic status.<br /><br />The pace of this first book is outstanding. You get the background necessary on the Atreides family's departure from their lush home of Caladan to the dangerous, though potentially more lucrative, world of Dune. Herbert skillfully reveals how this royal family has to adapt to the extreme conditions of the desert world. The theme of prophesy and destiny is also there from the outset with Paul Atreides trial with the Bene Gesserit \\"gom jabbar\\". The book has action, war, politics, philosophy, religious meditation, scarcely concealed environmental commentary and wonderful characters. Paul's evolution from insightful adolescent to desert prophet is the central theme of the story, but the political and military struggles between the Harkonnens and the Atreides family is equally compelling. The shifting allegiances of the struggle and the historical backgrounds that introduce each chapter are the tale telling of Herbert the master. This book is immensely ambitious and, for the most part, succeeds in creating a compelling world with compelling characters.<br /><br />I can't help stating a few things that struck me as minor flaws. The polar opposites of good and evil were a little tough for me to take at times. Duke Leto is potrayed almost as an innocent saint and Baron Harkonnen is portrayed as irredemably evil. For a book that usually tries to model real political drama in a sci-fi context, Harkonnen especially was hard to stomach at times.<br /><br />The philosophy and religion of the Bene Gesserit were interesting to me, but I think the politics are stronger than the spiritual in the book. Other readers and reviewers may disagree here, however. I'm more concerned with the Bene Gesserit and the religion of dune in future books. In contrast, Herbert's approach toward seeing the future, a philosophical core idea of the book is outstanding. Paul's struggle to negotiate vision, prophesy and leadership will challenge all to think about the challenges and responsibilities of predictions.<br /><br />There are a few key silent periods; Herbert sometimes chooses to skip a few years to maintain the pace. I don't know if they exist, but I'd like to hear tales of how Paul started leading Fremen raids or how the Harkonnens oppressed the everyday citizens of Dune. Like the history of our world, the history of Dune often neglects the everyday citizens who had to operate in the midst of conflict. Here, though, I understand Herbert. It's more that I dig the book so much that I want to know more about Dune in this time period than that I think Herbert could have written a significantly better book.<br /><br />I dig Dune even better than the Star Wars world, especially given Lucas' flawed efforts in the prequels. It's just harder to write visually stunning stuff for movies in a bland desert than in \\"a galaxy far, far way\\". Still I can't help but wonder if Lucas borrowed any ideas in constructing Tattoine?<br /><br />Kind of wandering here, but I hope everyone gets the point. This is great sci-fi, not to be missed if you've get any interest in the genre at all.<br /><br />6 stars!!!<br /><br />--SDci-fi context, Harkonnen especially was hard to stomach at times. <br /> <br />The philosophy and religion of the Bene Gesserit were interesting to me, but I think the politics are stronger than the spiritual in the book.

B000003N8G|5.0|A legendary album and rightfully so, Charlie Haden's 1969 protest piece, \\"Liberation Music Orchestra\\", is one of the essential pieces of music of his era.  Assembling an extended cast of musicians to support the music with arrangements by the versatile Carla Bley, the music blends free jazz with folk traditions from the United States and Europe.  Along the way, a series of fantastic individual performances underscore just how brilliant the record is.<br /><br />The record, as all LPs were, was originally two sides, and Bley took advantage of this in the arranging, with the two sides being very different-- opening with a passionate theme (titled just \\"The Introduction\\") featuring superb alto playing from Dewey Redman-- this quickly descends into the first folk piece, the Eastern European \\"Song of the United Front\\" before moving into a medley of Spanish folk forms.  Standout performances from guitarist Sam Brown (who is positively brilliant throuhgout the extended suite) and Don Cherry (whose cornet solo is totally brilliant) threaten to hide the brilliant arrangement-- Bley cleverly interweaves Spanish themes over an \\"oom-pa-pa\\" beat implying an Eastern European waltz in the middle of the piece-- the effect is nothing short of stunning.  Eventually, her introduction is reprised, again performed with enormous passion and power, leaving one having experienced something stunning and noteworthy.<br /><br />The second side isn't quite as good, admittedly-- without a unified sound, its more of a straight jazz performance-- with two originals by Haden (\\"Song for Che\\" and bass feature \\"Circus 68 69\\") surrounding an Ornette Coleman composition (\\"War Orphans\\") and an interlude composed by Bley.  Don't get me wrong-- the performances are great, its just that the first side is so stunning in its genre blending that with the second side being more or less straight free jazz (if such a thing makes sense), its not quite as exciting.  Still, standout solos from tenorman Gato Barbieri and Haden himself highlight the Haden originals.  \\"Summer '68 '69\\" is interesting in that it quotes a couple patriotic pieces throughout while tenorman Gato Barbieri wails away recklessly, Bley slyly phrases \\"We Shall Overcome\\" on organ, hinting at the closer.  A stunning performance of that folk theme with trombonist Roswell Rudd positively overwhelming, it really is something to hear.<br /><br />When it's over, you feel like you've experienced something.

B0006L16N8|3.0|Like other reviewers have stated, this albumn took some time to \\"sink in\\".  I wasn't too happy with it at first, and I still think 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is a way better albumn. <br /> <br />  X&Y just doesn't have the depth or atmosphere as the previous one did.  Although, it is nice to hear some new Coldplay after listening to the two previous albumns over and over.  My favorites on this albumn are: Square One, Talk, and White Shadows.  The title track is a little corny (waves & outerspace)....yawn.  And 'Fix You' is a little sappy.  Poor Gweneth! <br /> <br />I do appreciate the new material and it has grown on me.  However, I don't think they accomplished \\"Best band in the world\\" status as they claim they wanted to with this offering.

B000002AS3|5.0|I first heard Oasis's debut album when my brother played me a tape of \\"Definitely Maybe\\" one day in the fall of 1994. I quite liked some of the songs on it and remember finding \\"Live Forever\\" vaguely familiar, probably because I must have heard it playing on the radio or something when it was released as a single, or maybe, retrospectively speaking, because it was so good I thought I must have already heard it somewhere before. However, I didn't really pay the album much mind until almost a year later when I was in the record section in the basement of a retail store and they played \\"Definitely Maybe\\". I stayed in the record section to listen to the album and decided I would buy it.<br /><br />It was loud, it was exciting, it was the plug to fill the void in music that had been prevalent for too long, particularly in the early 90's when music didn't really seem to know which way to go, except \\"back\\" perhaps. Hence, people like Sting, Annie Lennox, Brian May, Rod Stewart, Paul Weller, Freddie Mercury and Elton John all scored their first hits in years in the early 90's. The fact these people were deservedly being taken note of again was no bad thing by any means, but I think it showed that people back then wanted some quality talent, some established popular heroes who were consistently reliable for making good songs. Suddenly though, here was music from a band that was new and really worth listening to, and they opened the floodgates for other guitar bands such as Blur, Pulp, Radiohead, Suede and Supergrass. There was a new, exciting feel to the music (which the British media in all their naivety tediously stuck under the same umbrella and called \\"Britpop\\"). It was intelligent music with a social message but delivered by everyday working class people who weren't talking down to you or trying to be pretentious pop stars.<br /><br />The album gets off to a great start with the full-tilt rock of \\"Rock `n' Roll Star\\". Powerful guitars drive the song with Liam's unmistakable vocal delivery, singing like he really means it. And that's the difference between Oasis and most bands of the last 20 years. They sing it and they play it because they really mean it, not just because they want you to think they mean it.<br /><br />\\"Shaker Maker\\" is a good, clever song with Beatles-esque imagery in its lyrics, and the song has been around for long enough now for me to forget any close association its melody might have with the New Seekers' Coke song, \\"I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing\\". It's not one of my favorite Oasis songs, but it showed this group weren't just an out-and-out rock band but instead could come up with clever melodies and lyrics for songs that had an air of wit and whimsicality to them as well, as they further demonstrated with \\"Digsy's Diner\\", \\"Married With Children\\", \\"She's Electric\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\". This in more ways seemed to show their influence of the Beatles.<br /><br />\\"Live Forever\\" was the song that made people sit up and take notice a bit more, but who was to know back then whether or not this band were capable of achieving anything else as good, or even better. Remember, Oasis didn't come to the attention of the masses until \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" the following year. Noel even said if he thought anyone was going to take notice of the band in the way that they did he might have thought twice about ripping off T. Rex for \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\". Actually, the song's riff borrowed from the T. Rex song \\"Get It On\\" was in fact ripped off by Marc Bolan and co. from an earlier Chuck Berry song anyway.<br /><br />\\"Columbia\\" is another standout track on this album with its infectious, relentless groove reminiscent of The Happy Mondays but played from a wall of sound that sounds like nobody but Oasis. \\"Supersonic\\" was the band's first single and a good song but again not one of my favorites, although a band could do a lot worse than launch their music career with a song like that, and manyhave. It has great attitude, with the first line being \\"I want to be myself. I can't be no-one else\\". Probably my least favorite song on the album is \\"Bring It On Down\\", a snarling, boisterous song that leans towards punk and somehow just fails to hit the mark.<br /><br />\\"Slide Away\\" is still my favorite song from the album and one of my all-time favorite tracks. When Oasis released a DVD to mark the tenth anniversary of \\"Definitely Maybe\\" in 2004, somebody on the DVD commented that the sign of a great album is when people talk highly of a track that wasn't even released as a single, to which they were referring to \\"Slide Away\\". I'd have to agree with that. The song moves at just the right pace with a blend of wonderful melody, lyrics and chords and I particularly love the ad-lib section of the song from the end of the last chorus to the fade, complimented perfectly by Noel's lead guitar work.<br /><br />So, overall a classic album that is held in very high esteem by me and the British music-buying public over a decade later, but is it the best debut album ever?

0393317552|4.0|Motivating this book are two questions 1)  When Spanish conquistador Pizzaro encountered Inca emperor Atahualpa, how did the former, with fewer than two hundred men overwhelm the latter with over 80,000?  and 2)  When the Europeans set up colonies on the island of new Guinea, why was it that they had so much stuff to trade, but the natives of the island had so little? <br /> <br />The answer to the first question is, of course, that the Spanish had Guns, Germs, and Steel.  Diamond does an outstanding job arguing for the pivotal importance of Germs in the equation.  He clearly explains - using the idea of germs - why Europeans overran the Americas and Australia but not Africa.  His agument regarding steel is notably weaker; but I think it does support his thesis adequately.  I failed to detect a compelling argument for why Europeans had guns but others did not.    <br /> <br />The book's primary focus is on how civilization got started.  He looks first at the cultivation of plants and then at the domestication of animals. Examining areas in Africa, Eurasia, the Americas, and Australia, he totes up the lists of suitable flora and fauna and evaluates their merits. He notes that it was  the fertile crescent that harbored the most suitable grains, legumes (or pulses), and domesticable animals. No other location comes close to having this rich combination of natural resources.  He shows that this explains the very early appearance of  agricutlure and therefore of writing, religion, and law in this area (and in China).  <br /> <br /> He also shows how any human advancement would spread more quickly in Eurasia than it would within the Americas and Africa. This gives Eurasia a double advantage; it can harbor more people by virtue of its agricultural practices and each person has greater access to new ideas because of strong east-west trade currents.  Thus cultures in Eurasia could easily adapt ideas based on those of other societies instead of creating them from scratch. <br/> <br />He concludes that any person who accepts his thesis of the forces shaping civilization - at least the necessary precondition to get started - would necessarily conclude that civilization's advances must inevitably run quickest on the Eurasian continent.  <br /> <br />A large portion of the book is focussed on the factors influencing the establishement of an agricultural system that is capable of supporting a whole large class of non-agricultural workers.  The assumption, I believe, is that we already know that this is the primary requirement for the birth of a civilization. Still I was looking forward to Diamond's take on what happens after we all learn to read and write.  I was hoping he might explain the ascent of the west since 1000 BC or 1500 AD.  But he does not. <br /> <br />He does not, for instance, argue why it was the British and Spanish, not the Turks and Indians who settled  Australia and the Americas.  This, perhaps is a different question.  Yet it seems to be linked to the idea of frontiers and access to resources.  For it is always when the full set of advanced cultural practices reach  populations in the richest, most uncultivated frontiers and these ideas cast anew in the light of a new environment  that civilization seems to gain its greatest momentum. <br /> <br />He uses Polynesia as a microcosm for the world.  In this laboratory, a group of people with the same genetic cross-section and same cultural practices embarked on a grand venture to settle all the islands of the Pacific some two millenia ago or so.  The systems of government they set up and the level of civilization they reached were highly dependent upon the agricultual productivity of their citizens.  Colonists on small islands unsuitable for agriculture became hunter-gatherers and lived in egalitarian societies.  Those in productive lands organized into small states with strong chiefs or kings, each with their own little standing armies.   <br /> <br />The book is richly researched and solidly argued as far as it goes. But there are a handful of quibbles one might raise. <br /> <br />1)  The author tends to repeat himself.  As the book progresses, the portion of prose that is a restatement of something said before becomes so high that this reader found himself skipping whole chapters. <br />2)  The author fails to provide a compelling argument about why China lagged Europe at some point after 1500.  One wonders why the author did not simply use the argument at hand.   Colonialism provided to Europe the raw materials necessary for industrial production.  China was closed until two or three decades ago and so did not have adequate access to the raw materials that vaulted Europe and North America to their current place.   The opening of China to the world has quickly closed this gap. In other words, the cultural practice that gave frontier states the advantage was the high value they realized in trade: of getting  required natural resources and finished goods from other places instead of being closed off.  The book's central thesis is that the first and most necessary condition for the success of a society lies in its access to the required resources, and that transport of goods and ideas is crucial to the success of this enterprise. For this book to  fail to make this connection I find to be an astonishing lapse.   <br />3)  Unless it is hidden in one of the skipped chapters, Diamond never starts to answer the second motivating question about 'stuff', even though it is a simple and direct extension of his fairly robust argument. <br /> <br />This book is of crucial importance in counter-balancing our Darwinian view of the world.  It was not that Europeans were better people by some genetic measure. (Darwin seemed to assume a single measure of fitness. But each environmental variable provides a different metric of fitness so the whole notion of one group being generally 'more fit' is utter nonsense.) It was that they had a body of technologies, cultural practices and diseases  that naturally tended to overwhelm other groups.  And that these ideas and practices (and sometimes diseases) are an inevitable advantage any agrarian or post agrarian society has over a less highly organized one.   Europeans simply got a head start thanks to geography.   <br /> <br />There is much to learn, and much to contemplate in this book.  Read It. <br />
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is an awesome CD. Even though the group broke up some years ago, there are still fans out there that will always love their music. If you want something poetic or just sounds good, Savage Garden has both. The Affirmation  CD contains 8 of their best hits. Fast music and plus an excellent cover in which both Darren and Daniel appear really hot!! A must buy for any Pop-lover out there.
B000000WG4|5.0|You have to listen to Tubular Bells five to ten times before the music starts to sink in. Note the very subtle mood changes when listening to the piece.  <br /> <br />Though I like the music, I fear it will not appeal to the average contemporary listener. If you like Yanni, but are willing to go the extra step than try Mike Oldfield.
1400032717|5.0|I didn't know anything about this book, I didn't know it was about an autistic boy, and to be frankly, neither do I know much about autism. I just got this book from a friend who said I may love it and I really love it.<br /><br />I love how Christopher sees the world, sometimes it's strange, but it's full of logic and reasoning, agree it or not. Sometimes we saw people screaming and we thought they were screaming, we just thought they were annoying and we never try to understand why they did it.<br /><br />Thanks Mr Haddon, your book is truly inspiring.<br /><br />I love the way how Christoper describes the things around him, it's highly 'predictable' (as one reviewer said) but just because they're so predictable that we ignored it.<br /><br />I took a plane from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City today (and finished reading the book), I tried to look more carefully at the world around us, they're still the same, but suddenly I found something different because I'm looking at it.<br /><br />I don't know if you understand what Im writing, but i hope everyone has a chance to read this book, it won't change your life, but it will give you some ideas of how you should see your life.
B00000331V|5.0|BLOW YOUR FACE OUT, The J. Geils Band's second live album, is even better than FULL HOUSE. The band has managed to take the Memphis-Chicago-Muscle Shoals-St. Louis-New Orleans-Detroit-New York-Kansas City blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll traditions to the next level by including more originals this time out, and moreover, Peter Wolf's onstage raps have improved immensely since the last album. Any serious rock fan must own this one.
B000A7S4B0|3.0|When they last came to us, we were forgetting about whatever happened to Rock and Roll and bought into the coolness of wearing leather jackets, smoking and wearing a fro. Spanning from The Brian Jonestown Massacre brings together former members with more to create the type of rock they wanted to. At least it all makes sense now that they left Virgin Records.          Now doing music on ECHO/PIAS records, they are creating blues-rock and sympathy-soliloquies within every inch of their guitar strings, therefore getting away from the whole cool stamp, and just playing what they were influenced, whether there is a stroke of blues, soul, Garage, or Gospel, for that matter (and that may be based on the theory of the \\"Gospel Song\\").         \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\" sure does channel a bit of Spiritualized in the Process. The jingle jangle feel of ambiguously absent drums, and the occasionally blaring harmonica to add the feeling. \\"Time won't save my soul,\\" he cries with sorrow, and with that, he makes the sound a lot believable. This band that we believed were drinkin' fun-loving boys from a Smalltown is creating their own version of traditional gospel. In fact, this is a worthy single that should have been introduced. Otherwise, raising the bar from what we expected last time. Many may not even expect HOWL to start off with an organ starting off an experimental coordination that may get The Dandy Warhols to wander back into studio. \\"Devil's Waitin'\\" is where the songwriting and storytelling mesh to create a good song, at least one that makes a good doo-wop sing-along. The best line is \\"I may have no Jesus/I may have no soul\\" told from the perspective of a jailbird who has seen it all and knows that his soul is doomed, if he were to not repent. Now to hear a song that sounds like something the old BRMC, the single \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\". The drums join on in with another future jangly favorite only the striped can be able to make with a whim. To tell you the truth, the songdoesn't really sound like as much of a single as \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\". \\"Suspicion Holds You Tight\\" is where blues and Soul is executed at their most level, in terms of quality. Eventually you may want to skip this song. \\"Promise\\" is a song that should be the next single, or the first for that matter. This song by the lyrics has a hold-on, I'll-be-there-to-comfort-you feel. And to tell you the truth, that is what we need most in this day and age. \\"Weight of the World\\" should be right up the alley of longtime hipster Garage fans. In fact, this is the most anticipated of the songs saying how hard life may be to move on.           \\"Restless Sinner\\" takes on a western look at blues-country worthy of changing your life with an acoustic look at life, and this one has plenty of soul to spare. He proclaims that this proclaimed idolater \\"has no face\\", and is \\"another fallen child\\" in the gutter. It shouldn?t be hard to wonder why this song isn?t something to redeem our attention. This song may be powerful enough to drag us out of our shell. The best part about \\"Gospel Song\\" is that not only do the lyrics appear with plenty, but they seem to have the lush music to back it up. They show just how shiny gospel can be and that it doesn't just have to be mournful. And those expecting as Brian Jonestown Massacre influence may want to take a listen to \\"The Line\\", or the bonus track. It is the epitome of the album but too much to call a roundup.           So it seems those who are still wondering what ever happened to their Rock N' Roll will find these former garage apostles are thinking about ditching it for saving the soul they almost lost to a collective or a Record company. The only downside is that music may not always keep your attention span so much, except maybe on the B-Side. Or is that for you to decide. Throwback Traditional always didn't really hold my attention, really. Well, I'll say anyone who misses Spiritualized right now may feel right at home, though. Those expecting a new Take Them On, On Your Own may be a bit disappointed on the first listen.  Rating: 6.75/10
0790733226|2.0|A well done movie, but a huge and suspensful buildup with a fantastic machine to go....nowhere.    Like other reviewers who could see the big picture,the hugely paid writers of this film could come up with nothing better than toothpaste commercial-quality special effects of some lame Florida nightclub beach with a (very) low galaxy studded ceiling ??!!! And to have the dead dad deliver some mushy, useless speech that said NOTHING??!!!    Things I agree with other reviewers on:    Angela Bassett had to ACT! instead of just acting. She ate the scenery in each of her scenes. Quite annoying. James Woods did the same.    Whenever Matthew McCaugheny came into a scene, the movie stopped dead in its tracks and yes, don't hit us over the head with religion! If religion had its way, we'd all be still living in the middle ages. Science (the opposite of religion) has given us technology and all the comforts that go with it. Laughably ZERO chemistry between he and Jodie Foster.    Zemeckis teased us with the big build up to nowhere. Shame on him for not finding creative minds that would have provided the necessary pay-off to taking a ride in the Fantastic Machine. How dumb did he think his paying audience was? Pretty dumb.    Like I said, well made big budget movie worth watching IF you do not expect a pay-off which this one thoroughly promised but failed to deliver.
B000000993|5.0|This band did something that you won't often find with heavy metal bands: they went platinum after one full length release. Tool's second album (not counting their earlier six-track EP) broke them into the mainstream and went on to sell a million plus copies.<br /><br />Many Tool fans would argue \\"Undertow\\" is also their best album. Even though I disagree with this (I think Tool get better with each album), I can certainly see why someone would think that.\\"Undertow\\" just pulls you in and doesn't let go; it delivers 69 minutes of the good stuff: brilliant songwriting, good musicianship, dark, moody atmospheres/moods, clear production, and lyrics which are adventurous, daring, angry, and depressing. And, even though singer Maynard's vocal pitch doesn't alternate much, he sure sings with much conviction when he's angry or sad.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Undertow\\" is kind of like Tool's third album, 1996's \\"Aenima,\\" but it's more subtle because this album's guitar riffs don't roar or explode as much. Lyrically, subjects such as sex, loss of innocence, and (of course) religion are covered. It's my opinion that \\"Prison Sex\\" is about Jesus having sex with his disciples (according to Maynard), and \\"Sober\\" seems to be saying that Jesus was a lying party animal who drank too much.<br /><br />\\"Intolerance\\" begins with a humming riff which sort of foreshadows a later Tool hit song, \\"Aenima.\\" Maynard starts this song sounding almost poppy, and he builds to an aggressive yell.<br /><br />\\"Prison Sex\\" begins with choppy, stop-start riffs. With soaring guitars and buzzing, rumbling bass guitar riffs, this song's music is actually pretty peaceful and melodic. This is ironic in a way, because Maynard is singing lines \\"I have blood and cum stains on my hands.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sober\\" has more prog-ish, stop-start riffs. This song starts out in low gear, but it builds and explodes for the choruses.<br /><br />\\"Bottom\\" starts with guitarist Adam Jones playing trippy guitar strings, which are so fast, they kind of sound like helicopter blades. The middle of the song slows way down, though, for a spoken word passage.<br /><br />\\"Crawl Away\\" ends with a big, extended yell from Maynard. But this song is a highlight because it has good guitar work throughout; the guitars stop, start, beep, crunch, grumble, soar, and wind/bend.<br /><br />\\"Swamp Song\\" seems like a very low key song at first, but the guitars speed up the tempo. I enjoy how this song's chorus is a stop-start beat with staccato vocals.<br /><br />\\"Undertow\\" has more catchy, beeping guitar noise (which kind of sounds like something off of \\"Aenima\\").<br /><br />\\"4 Degrees\\" begins with almost twangy strumming. The power chords kick in and play chunky riffs, and part of this song is almost a bobbing beat (with the drums pounding simultaneously as the guitars). Meanwhile Maynard is singing calmly throughout the song.<br /><br />\\"Flood\\" is almost completely instrumental. The first four minutes and forty-five seconds are very depressing and ominous, with thumping, atmospheric drums.<br /><br />Then, we have to sit through 59 tracks of mysterious silence. Luckily, this time goes by rather quickly, as each of the tracks are very short.<br /><br />Finally, we hear the voice of a televangelist making a sermon, and the last song, \\"Disgustipated,\\" has begun. This preacher is saying that carrots are living things and that harvest day is the Holocaust for them. Then Maynard comes aboard and whispers (increasingly loud) \\"This is necessary. Life feeds on life, feeds on life, feeds on life, feeds on...this is necessary\\" over a drum beat and some crazy guitar sound effects.<br /><br />Since I don't believe this is Tool's best work, I wouldn't recommend it to you if you're new to them. But the bottom line is this C.D. is essential listening for everybody else (especially for prog rock or alt metal fans), because this album may be quite strange in spots (i.e. the last track), but one thing is for certain: this \\"Undertow\\" is very strong.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|When I listen to songs, I tend to assess them by how I re-act, I rarely delve into lyrics (that usually comes later) - I haven't had a good listen to the whole album yet, but what I have heard is darn fine (regardless of lyrics, and seeing as they seem pretty intelligent guys I wouldn't imagine they'd be as childish as something like Smile Empty Soul's are). <br /> <br />Bits and pieces of this album sounds like Bill Steer (of Carcass fame) has walked into the studio and helped out on guitar, this is by no means a bad thing, listen to B.Y.O.B then compare it to some riffs from Heartwork and you'll hear what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />Overall, IMHO it sounds like a fusion between grind core and punk (Band Religion vs Carcass? :-) - but it's well done, and not much is sounding similar at the moment.
B000002UDB|5.0|\\"Magical...\\" establishes a true turning point in the musical career of Liverpool's boys. Based in an articulated set of innovative musical works, two of his most celebrated and easy singing themes such as \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and the everlasting expressive \\"Fool on the hill\\", engaged the great audiences, and, in the meantime opened the gate to all a new generation in search of new proposals, inspired basically on \\"psychodelia\\" in which the rhythm found a broad support and expansive platform such as \\"I'm the walrus\\"  and \\"Strawberry fields forever\\". In this sense this album would be the transitional work<br />to a trilogy that nestled in their minds: \\"Lonely heart's club's band\\"  and  \\"The White album\\".<br />Recommended without reserves even if you are not a fan of this eternal ensemble.
B0002X314C|5.0|Damn, this guy is talented.  I'd say describing him as a male version of Alicia Keys is accurate, R.C.  This album is a great journey of soulful music.  It's one of those albums you don't get sick of easily.

If you felt entertained, or better yet, enlightened, by his last book, you'll love this one. Collapse feels like almost a sequel, in which he turns his attention from the function of ancient societies to ours today. If you aren't startled into some serious thinking about modern society today after reading this well-researched, smoothly-written book, it isn't Diamond's fault - it's your own.

B00005OM4K|5.0|What an awesome box set.  I have 17 box sets and this is the best one so far.  This set features everything by Creedence Clearwater Revival from the very early days of Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets to the Live In Europe Concert.  There is a 76 page booklet included giving the history of Creedence and the struggles they had to make it.  During the Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets Tom Fogerty took the leads.  In the Golliwogs, Tom Fogerty took some of the leads while John did most of them.  The sound quality on disc 1 (Velvets and Golliwogs) is not that great but then we have to consider the technology of the early 60s which just wasn't up to the standards we have today.  The booklet clearly spells out the progression from the Blue Velvets to the Creedence we all know and love today.  It's great to hear how the voices mature over time as you listen to these recording.  The thing I love about this set is that the first disc is comprised of the T.F. & The Blue Velvets, then The Golliwogs.  Discs 2 through 5 includes all 7 Creedence albums in the order they were released with the track order of each album in tact.  Disc 5 has the last studio album and part of The Concert album on it.  The Concert album is continued on disc 6 and followed by the Live In Europe album.  I have been looking for the Live In Europe album for some time and now I finally have it in this compilation and remastered to boot.  If you don't have any Creedence albums and are contemplating buying them, forget it.  Buy this box set and you have everything they ever did even the pre-Creedence material which you are probably not going to get.  It is well worth the money and all you have to do is pop in all 6 discs in your CD player, sit back and have an evening of Creedence Clearwater Revival without ever having to get up to change the record or disc.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This chilling tale established for Sissy Spacek her great lap to fame. I watched her in Badlands after this movie. And it was extremely easy to predict for her the future triumphs at that moment.<br /><br />Who can forget -searching and scrutinizing inside personal memories- about the jokes, funny situations and sometimes great doses of black humor in our fellow classmates?<br /><br />In this opportunity we find a seriously mental wounded teenager, by the fanatic harassment of a frustrated mother who found relief in the exacerbating practice of the Catholic Religion, castrating her daughter and pretending become of her an extension of her will, suppressing the NATURAL wishes and illusions of the youth.<br /><br />On the other hand, we have her classmates, who ignoring her hellish familiar background, are continuously mocking at her.<br /><br />Particularly pathetic is the sequence when she experiences her first menstruation, that submerges immediately in her particular and horrid hell.<br /><br />She possesses a weird gift, better known as Telekinesis, that will be in last instance her mortiferous weapon in the code of the film.<br /><br />This film established for the great audiences the name of Brian De Palma and the platform of two raising stars: John Travolta and the beauty Nancy Allen (the future De Palma's wife).<br /><br />A great acknowledgement for Piper Laurie for her towering performance.<br /><br />A classic film with remarkable special effects that rides between the terror and thriller.
0743454529|4.0|When I finished reading this book and everything had fallen into place, I realized I really loved this book.   <br />The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because throughout the book there were little things that just got under my skin - the fact that a 13 year old was bringing a lawsuit against her parents was a little over the top and that kept nagging at me throughout- however, if you haven't read the book yet - hang in there, it will all make sense in the end.  And I didn't care for Sara she seemed so focused on the sick child and nothing else around her, that it also got under my skin.  <br />  <br />Now, the good things - I love the way Picoult intertwined the other characters lives into the story.  Even though the book was mainly about Kate and her family, I came to be very interested in the other characters lives.   <br />And the ending (which I do not see as a cop-out as some others suggested) hits you like a ton of bricks.  You do not see it coming - just when you think you have it all figured out it throws you for a loop.  I had to re-read some of it to make sure I was reading it correctly.  The reason I do not think the ending is a cop-out is because that is exactly what could happen in real life!  You find yourself trying to control your life when WHAM! something happens to show you that you are not in control after all......  I highly recommend this book! <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is an excellent album.  I would recommend it to any indie or neo-folk fan.  I see reviews that compare Sufjan Stevens to Sea and Cake and Vince Guaraldi.  I agree; there are definately influences from popular jazz and lo-fi indie.  Where this artist shines, however, is in his ability to combine what seems like an endless number of styles into a cohesive new sound.  Listen for a few minutes and you will detect other influences like Philip Glass and Stereolab, but unlike those artists, Stevens' music doesn't tend to drown the listener with their signature repetitive sounds.  Glass's influence is undeniable in The Predatory Wasps.  By far the best feature of this album is the supporting choir heard most strongly in songs like Chicago and Man of Steel.  One gets the undeniable impression that Stevens has nabbed a random selection of Illinois residents from the streets and plugged their beautiful voices into his work.  Buy it soon.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|This record reminds us that Eric Clapton is the greatest innovative blues guitarist who ever lived.  That being said, the arrangements are too tame to live up to that lofty praise.  The record is, however, a genuine attempt by EC to reconnect with his roots and passion and to regain his soul, which seems to have been missing from the mid-nineties through the first few years of this decade.  If Slowhand had included a little imagination in his interpretations here, such as the way he reinvented \\"Cross Road Blues\\" in the sixties, and more importantly could recapture the desparation in his playing so eloquently showcased on the Derek & the Dominoes album, I think Me & Mr. Johnson would be the landmark blues album of the twenty-first century.
B0009A1B7C|4.0|I liked mezmerize becuse it was hard core. system of a down is one of the best rock bands out there. i recommend this CD to people that likes hard core rock.
6305622914|5.0|This hallucinating, provocative and irreverent script had to come from England: the nest of so many and not least brilliant gems in the recent past. Films of the stature of Pygmalion, The importance of being Ernest (adapted from Shaw and Wilde respectively), Kind hearts and cornets, The Lavender Hill Mob, Lady killers,  Hobson's choice, Whisky Gallore - delighted and still make it laugh - to several generations and carried as flower and its fruit the germinal seed of the Monthy Phyton in the seventies.<br /><br />The severe underemployment crisis leads to these men to create a very original way to face his financial problems.<br /><br />This film to my mind was the best  Comedy in the Nineties, sharing honors with Delicatessen.<br /><br />Full laughs! Don't miss it.
1881273156|5.0|Is your loved one/spouse just not satisfying your emotional needs?  Is your 'love tank' on empty?  Then this book will definately be a huge sigh of relief for you.  <br /> <br />  Gary Chapman has concluded, after many years of counseling, that there are five \\"Love Languages.\\"  The \\"Love Languages\\" are: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.  But don't just go by this list!  There can be many dialects within these categories.   <br /> <br />  Chapman makes note of how many people today think you should always feel like you do in that 'in love' stage but that will typically last no more than two years.  Love is a choice, and learning to speak your spouse's language can make your marriage fulfilling and rich.  It may take effort to learn how to speak the language your spouse will respond to best, but in doing so, your life together will most definately be fulfilling.   <br /> <br />  Chapman helps you discover your spouse's love language, as well as your own, and gives stories to support and illustrate each one.  You and your spouse should read this to rediscover your love for each other and fill up your love tanks!
B0006399FS|3.0|I've seen it happen before. A band is forced to chug out albums under difficult or rushed or confused circumstances, and the \\"spontaneity\\" and honesty of what comes out grabs the attention of the masses and hits something in the human heart. Then they become self-aware, and start over-analyzing every note. Production values soar, but the grit and soul of the music is \\"smoothed over.\\" Witness \\"Beautiful Letdown\\" by Switchfoot versus \\"New Way to be Human.\\" Witness \\"Atomic Bomb\\" versus \\"October.\\"  <br /> <br />I would say, lock Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry up in a house with some old guitars and amps, a delay pedal, a trusty drumset, an SM-57, and a 16-track analog recorder. Tell 'em they come out with an album in 2 weeks or they never come out at all! I seriously think what they'd put out would be better than \\"Atomic Bomb.\\" Better yet, fly 'em down to New Orleans for a day before you lock 'em up. Get some of the old passion and \\"crying out\\" flowing again! THAT is what this album lacks.  <br /> <br />Give the last half a chance - it's better than I expected! Their slow, contemplative stuff is pretty good. I just wish they had the fire in the belly that practically brought you to tears in \\"Pride.\\"
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I first saw this movie in high school (huge Steve Vai fan here) and rented it so many times that my parents would no longer let me rent it.  A few years ago I tried to buy the DVD, but could only find Britney Spears Crossroads and was getting frustrated until one day I found it.  My son, who is 5, also LOVES the ending of the movie and asks me to play it over and over again.  He is as much a Steve Vai fan as I am. <br /> <br />Anyone who has a small liking of Blues or guitar playing must see or own this movie.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to the White Stripes... I just wasn't sure that I wanted to be sucked into the Hype.  Perhaps they were a little to main stream for me.  I decided to give elephant a try; I had had White Blood Cells - and was a bit wish washy on it. <br /> <br />Well all I can say is if you do not have this CD, you NEED to get it.  Jack White just knows how to write songs!  I compare it to the old AC/DC that I used to listen to in high school... even if you want to turn away, you just can't!
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden's Powerslave is an amazing metal album.  Most reviews you're gonna hear are going to be positive on this anyway so it's almost pointless to write a review.  This album is a most have for any metal fan. Songs such as \\"Aces High\\", \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" and \\"Rime of the Ancient Marnier\\" are all time metal classics, plus \\"Flash of the Blade\\", \\"Duellists\\", \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Back in the Village\\" are also awesome tracks and \\"Losfer Words(Big 'Orra)\\" which is probably Maiden's best instrumental track.  Pick this album up.  I hope this review was helpful to you.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is the only Cold Play CD I really like. It is excellent. The other CDs are OK, but not as good. It didn't take me any time to get used to the songs. All of the songs are good and create a great laid-back mood. I don't have to skip over songs, like on other CDs. I loved it on the first listen. Chris doesn't sound depressed, like some have criticized, he sounds insightful and real. However, the lyrics are not as eloquently written in comparison to U2 or the Cure or something- The quality of music exceeds the quality of the lyrics. Still, it is so hard to find a good new CD sometimes and overall this was a great purchase.
B000002MY3|5.0|For high school kids today, who were born in the late-80's and early 90's and may have been too young to remember this album, or for anyone looking to hear what the sound of the 90's was all about, they should check out \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" as this was the quintessential 90's album: When music was actually original and said something in a different and interesting way (as opposed to record company creations today doing remakes and then having tiresome tabloids trumpet how wonderful they are week after week after boring week).<br /><br />Perhaps Morissette did sound \\"angry\\" but the emotions she expressed here are what everybody has felt at one time or another.  Everyone's been angry (dare I say jealous?) at being dumped and the other person seemingly going about life as though nothing were wrong while you're falling apart (\\"You Oughta Know\\").<br /><br />The one song that sticks out for me is \\"Ironic.\\"  Come on, if that doesn't describe life in a nutshell, I don't know what song does!<br /><br />Alanis Morissette is another in a long line of very talented Canadian imports and kudos to Madonna for discovering her.
B000001F9N|5.0|If you are a Donna Summer disco lover, then this cd is one of the best.
B000002KDO|5.0|Oh for the days when Sabbath was young and hungry. They just got better and better with each album. Toni Iommi proved here that he was more than just master of the downtuned powerchord. Instrumentals like Embryo and Orchid prove his skills as a musician as well as a Metal Master. The two best known songs on this album are Children of the Grave and Sweet Leaf. They are Sabbath staples and will forever be loved by fans.<br /><br />Lord of this World is a different song for Sabbath to do. Here they are praising God and Jesus, something you probably wouldn't expect from them. I wonder what all the preachers thought about this song back then when they were trying to convince everyone that Black Sabbath was indeed the \\"Devil's Music\\". Into the Void is another subject that Sabbath first got into, that is space travel. I'm sure Ace Frehley from KISS loved this number.<br /><br />Paranoid will probably always be my favorite Sabbath album, but Master of Reality is a jewel in the classic Sabbath collection, it's a must have for fans of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, and classic metal.
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie is truly one of those classic 80's movies that is great to watch at any age. The pop culture is fun to enjoy, and the humor is appropriate for young and old. I put this movie up there with \\"The Goonies\\" it's that terrific!! My sister and I loved this movies as kids, and she was so excited that I got this for her birthday this year, we watched it the same night she got it in the mail and loved it as much as we had way back when. I definitely recommend adding this one to your movie collection!!
B000005J56|5.0|After watching the Buena Vista Social Club on Showtime, I loged on really fast and searched for this gem. This CD is great for all those old timer's that were in to the salsa scene back in the day, this CD is great and the companion DVD is even better.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This album is unbelievable. I ordered it because I had seen the special on PBS and loved a few of the songs they sang. Now every single song has become my favorite. My roommate and I fall asleep to it every night. If you love good music and soothing voices, this is DEFINITELY worth the money.
0793518326|5.0|I really have no complaints about this book. Sure there are a few errors here and there but think about it... four dudes transcribed every part of every Beatles song. Come on, they're humans, of course there are bound to be mistakes. If you can't fix the errors on your own then you have a problem. <br /> <br />My only semi-complaint about this book is that it doesn't include the songs found only on the Anthology series. But it was published before the Anthology compilations were released so the book is not to blame. <br /> <br />Also, I haven't come across a price anywhere close to Amazon's. This is an amazing deal. Buy this book.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I admit, my first exposure to Death Cab For Cutie was through Transatlantacism, their well-praised but also most mainstream release. The songs were catchy, the melodies were tight, and the lyrics were good. I then decided to listen to The Photo Album, since I had read the reviews stating how it went against the grain of their older stuff. While it wasn't as immediately catchy as Transatlantacism, after repeated listenings it became clear to me that it was the superior album, especially on tracks like Styrofoam Plates where Gibbard really shows his talents in lyricism and song writing. <br /> <br />Fast forward to this summer. I first heard the single off Plans, Soul Meets Body, on a local radio station. This was a few days before it got on myspace and in constant circulation and I thought that, while it was a bit poppier than their earlier efforts, it was still good. After hearing it a few times, though, it really grew on me. That basically sets the mood for this entire album. Upon first listen it seems to be a few good melodies with lots of filler in-between. To be honest, on my first listen I didn't find this CD all too impressive. A few stand-out tracks on the first listen were I Will Follow You In The Dark (a musically simple but lyrically impressive acoustic song a-la Styrofoam Plates) and Someday You Will Be Loved (which has quite an infectious melody) <br /> <br />I listened a few times more, though, and realized that each song was a gem of its own. The overall composition of this album is very well done, the song order and pacing is very well produced. The songwriting carries the poppy vibe of Transatlantacism but the simple genius of The Photo Album, combining the best of both into a very impressive result. Gibbard's lyrics take a darker tone on this album, with the topic of death appearing more frequently (Soul Meets Body and I Will Follow You Into The Dark, for example, both mention dying together) but are still just as tight as on the previous albums. <br /> <br />One criticism I've seen thrown at this album is that it's all piano, no guitar. This is just a flat out lie, I really cannot see where this idea is coming from. Yes, there are more piano songs on this album than transatlantacism, but the songs with guitar still outnumber them. Despite accusations of selling out, I don't think Death Cab For Cutie has lost any of their integrity on the switch to Atlantic. <br /> <br />And just to give a bit of background on the music I listen to, my three top albums this year so far have been Frances the Mute by The Mars Volta, Ghost Reveries by Opeth, and this album. This isn't just coming from a pop indie fanboy.
6305949980|5.0|The movie is awesome and the special features are even better.  If you are a Tim Burton fan this is the movie to have. It has his first film, VICTOR, and FRANKENWEENIE which is another short film of his.  Please get this movie , you wont regret it.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|The 25th Anniversary Of \\"Guilty\\" Is Wonderful!!! Great Sound On Both The Cd & Dvd Sides, Great Fun To See The Unused Photos As Are The Two Performances From \\"One Voice\\"!! The Album Is A Classic From Beginning To End!!! Most People Know The Hits...\\"Woman In Love\\", \\"What Kind Of Fool\\" & The Title Track...But There Is So Much More To This Album, From The Dramatic \\"Life Story\\" To The Dynamic \\"Make It Like A Memory\\" To The Fun \\"Promises\\" & My Personal Fav...\\"Never Give Up\\" This Album Is A Treasure Trove Of Classic Pop Songs!!! Barbra & Barry Had The Magic Then & Still Do Today!!! Looking Forward To \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" September 20th!!!
B0002ZYE1Y|3.0|When it's on, it's masterful, explosive, haunting and well executed.  It can truly be brilliant.  But....      When it's off?  Trite, silly, overdone, repetitive and grating.    Unless you are a true fan of this style of music, you will find yourself skipping about half the tracks on the CD.  You will also find yourself turning it up for the other half.    It's worth a buy, even with the bad tracks.      (Imagine this album as a fusion of Evanescence, Megadeth, The London Philharmonic Orchestra and a Lord of the Rings Soundtrack.)
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I would recommend this to any metallica fan who is still wondering why on earth they no longer can make a good album. This DVD has managed to turn my anger against what once was my favourite band into sympathy: it seems they just can't do any better nowadays. It also looks as if Hetfield & Ulrich were expecting the making of the movie to work out the band's problems, while it may have only served the purpose of feeding the monster they created, i.e., all the people who have been working for them all these years. Surely all those people are still interested in making money out of Metallica, even by doing this big brother thing. However, none of the band members appears to feel comfortable being shooted, especially James <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|This song is one of the best songs that Mariah Carey has sung man you can listen to this song all day and you won't get tired of hear Ms.Carey all day long. This song is of the chain man anyone can listen to this no matter what.

078681859X|5.0|I am generally not a fantasy reader, but am trying to read some of the books that my students and friends recommend.  This book came HIGHLY recommended by my sister and a few of my students at school.<br /><br />Written in alternating points of view, from the magician in training, Nathaniel, to the demon Bartimaeus, this book tells the story of what can happen when one gets a little too ambitious and things go out of control.  While Nathaniel doesn't necessarily mean for things to go badly, they generally do.  He doesn't pay much heed to the warnings of the dijinni Bartimaeus, whom he has summoned.  And let me tell you, Bartimaeus has great voice in this book.  His comments and sidenotes will make you laugh aloud.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fantasy and enjoy the Artemis Fowl books, as well as the Harry Potter series, then this is definitely the book for you.  Once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down.  Since the chapters alternate between the two points of view, I found it to be very original, as well as entertaining.  But really, this is one of those books that is worth the read!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Once again, there's no point for me to tell the plot of this because everyone knows it but I just want to get my point accross. While this book was my least favorite of the first 3, somehow, this movie was brilliant. I was sucked in from the start when I saw Dobby. Dooby was brilliantly created and is like a cute version of the evil Golem. Dobby was wonderfully brought to life. Once again, the movie had great acting, not by Daniel Radcliffe especially but by the wonderful Alan Rickman. But, I'm sure kids reading this review have no idea who he is.  <br />This movie is simply an excellent family movie. It's great fun and turns a solid but average book somehow into an excellent family movie. So, enjoy yourselves kids, because this is going to be the best Harry Potter movie of the franchise, period. How do I know? I don't but the rest of the books are too long to put into a movie that isn't boring. Chris Columbus directed two good movies, this one much better than the first, but I'm sorry, now that he's not the director, I think that this franchise is going to take a turn for the worst. Especially after seeing the third movie. Yikes!
B0009X766Y|5.0|I remember seeing this film when it was released when I was a kid. <br />I have always really enjoyed this film. <br /> <br />I remember purchasing the wide screen/letter box version of the film on VHS in the 1990's. <br /> <br />What TOOK SO LONG FOR THE WIDE SCREEN ON DVD? <br /> <br />A family member & myself had been waiting and waiting & waiting for it. <br />Universal should be shamed of themselves for keeping fans waiting for so long. <br /> <br />BUT, I AM GLAD IT HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!!
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic~ Bjork is a very advantgarde release from the pop genius from Iceland. She has a very unique voice and one never has to wonder if it is a Bj&ouml;rk track that one is listening to. However this does not mean that she is not accomplished singer, just that it sounds very different. The lyrics can be a bit confounding at times and she sounds like she has taken a page from the lyrics from Skinny Puppy since at times they are about as confusing and seemingly inane but with plenty of hidden inteligence and savvy behind them. I love the cover and this is an album not to be missed.
B000068CNX|5.0|Great quality, amazing extra features and trivia game, love the footage never seen before!
B00005JMAH|2.0|First off, I was intending a creepy version of the Harry Potter movies. That's not what I got. It was supposed to be scary and very creepy. Well, it wasn't. This movie would have been a lot better if it would have been rated PG-13. That would have made a good interpretation of the book. First off, the 3rd book was the best one. It was excellent. But, this movie somehow managed to ruin the whole book and everything for me. This movie is very weird and really dark. I didn't like this peculiar interpretation of the book with lots of strange moments where I was scratching my head, thinking, what the heck????? <br />This movie is weird especially thanks to the wierd bus driver. The movie was also boring to me and after a while, it lost my interest. Sure the visuals were great, but I can't say the same for the strange, boring movie.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Russell was cheated by not even receiving a nomination for this film.  I remember the exclaims heard from the crowd in the room the morning the nominations were annouced. <br />Another fine Peter Weir film. <br />The only thing we could have done without is the typical scenes of people becoming ill on a ship going through a storm.  Unnecessary.
0316666343|2.0|I am listening to this book on cassette and I'm not going to finish it. It has been dragging on since cassette 4 (out of 8)and I couldn't believe that I had that much more of the story to plod through. Sebold's writing is very thick and beautiful in points but it felt like the purpose of the story was diluted after the mid-point in the book. I'm glad I'm not alone in my thoughts about the boredom brought about during the back end of this book. Reading the other reviews made me decided that I will put The Lovely Bones down and return it to the library and pick up another one of the titles I have in the wings. I don't want to waste any more time.
B000002OZY|2.0|Tommy is not the first rock opera, as it is widely acknowledged to be. The story of Tommy is not even the Who's. While the music of Tommy is great, and some of the Who's best, the album itself is a crime. The real first rock opera is S.F. Sorrow by the Pretty Things, a psychedelic band from San Franciso, released in 1968.  <br />The album is a rock opera and tells virtually the exact same story as Tommy, except the protaganist;s name is S.F. Sorrow, not Tommy. For some reason, The Who not only gets the credit for making the first rock opera, but also for a story they didn't even think of. I like the Who a lot, but this album is a complete slap in the face to The Pretty Things. Townsend even admitted that most of his influence for Tommy came from S.F. Sorrow, but forgot to say the reason was its the same story and concept of Tommy.
B00003CXI1|4.0|A while back, when there was the Harry Potter madness, I read the first 3 books. After that though, I was pretty much done and I haven't read another one since. I realized that I'd grown out of these books and that these books weren't very good, at leat not for older kids. Sure, it's great for the little kids, but for me, a guy in high school, you know. Anyway, this movie is based on the first book of the same name. The cast is great and it brings the book to life. So, if you're looking for a good book interpretation, you've got it. As for a family movie, it's good but the Incredibles, Shrek, Toy Story 1 and 2, Monsters Inc., Home Alone, etc..are all superior to this.  <br />And for little kids, it's a great movie and excellent book interpretation but while I'm watching this, I'm thinking of good serious movies. 5 stars for the kids, good family movie but not the best. 2nd best movie of the first 3.
B000002N2P|5.0|Insomniac is, I agree, very, very underrated. This is actual punk, where the songs are more angry but nonetheless entertaining.  It's one of those albums you can rock-out to, with songs like \\"Armatage Shanks\\", \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" and \\"Babs Uvula Who?\\" (side-note: the artwork on the cover is called: God Told me to Skin You Alive).
B00005JODA|4.0|Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) finds himself oddly attracted to Tessa (Rachel Weisz, \\"Constantine\\"), the feisty young woman who peppered him with `inconvenient' questions during his lecture. As the hall empties, he approaches her and they begin a torrid affair. Justin's duties as a mid-level ambassador call him to Africa and Tessa asks to come along as his wife. Acclimating to his new surroundings, Justin tends to his gardening as Tessa becomes involved with the local community. Soon, she uncovers a conspiracy that may involve the government and a huge corporation. When she is discovered murdered, Justin begins to make inquiries, and decides to finish what his wife started.<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\", based on the bestseller by John Le Carre and directed by Fernando Meirelles (\\"City of God\\"), is a very well-made, intriguing, adult thriller. Perfect fare for the Fall Oscar season but the studio apparently felt so strongly in the film, they decided to release it at the end of the competitive summer season. I hope it finds an audience. I also hope it is remembered during awards season.<br /><br />Meirelles, who directed the great film \\"City of God\\", about a gang of young men in Brazil's slums trying to survive, seems to be the perfect choice to capture \\"Gardeners\\" sun-drenched African vistas. The director has a unique visual style, providing interesting detail which doesn't seem obtrusive or distract from the narrative. Exterior scenes are drenched with light, washing out most blues and greens, revealing hot colors like red and orange. On the other hand, interior scenes are predominately blue and gray. This may not seem revolutionary, but the technique used aids the look well. Depending on the amount of light, some scenes are more saturated than others, creating a consistency throughout.<br /><br />Meirelles also uses other interesting techniques. For instance, in one scene, Quayle is making a long journey by car. The camera is positioned in the passenger seat, looking out over the hood of the car, which fills the screen. As the journey progresses, a street corner approaches, there is a long fade, then another street corner with different people. This visual touch adds a level of interest to a scene which could be rather boring in other hands.<br /><br />The film is told in a way that expertly mirrors the unsettled state of Quayle's character. Because the film is, more or less, his journey, it seems only fitting that the director would attempt to take the viewer into Quayle's head. The film starts with Tessa's murder and we follow Quayle as he unravels the secrets behind her death. Throughout, we see flashbacks to his life with Tessa, learning more about her. As the story and journey become more consuming, the flashbacks become more surrealistic. Occasionally, he thinks that Tessa is in the room with him. Some people who read this description may think that the film will be difficult to follow, but if anything, this timeline aides in out understanding of everything.<br /><br />Fiennes is, as always, great. A meek diplomat, he initially seems unsettled by most things, including his new, very forward wife, taking refuge in his hobby, gardening. After they are married, he is disoriented by her energy and tenaciousness. As they move to Africa, he becomes unsettled by his new surroundings, finding refuge in his wife and his hobby. But after her death, as he begins to uncover the secrets she uncovered, he seems to fall more in love with her, appreciate her more, become more like her. This isn't to say that he didn't love her from the beginning; he just didn't understand her as well. As he becomes more embroiled in the conspiracy he changes to become more like her, understanding her more. The performance is extremely subtle, and believable, yet moving and completely natural.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz is also very good. She has a more difficult role as everything she does is experienced by the viewer in flashback. She has to createan indelible, interesting character from the first moment we see her, or else we don't care about what happens to her. She does this by making us appreciate her; during Quayle's lecture, she begins to pepper him with nasty questions about the government. Most people in the audience titter a little, shocked that the lecture was interrupted, but they soon turn against her. After the lecture, Quayle approaches her and they go on a date. Meirelles uses a series of images to depict their first sexual encounter and I have to tell you, it's an erotic scene. Not because he shows a lot of graphic detail, but because he shows a series of quick shots of various body parts, yet, somehow, the shots seem to linger, almost suggestively. In one shot, Tessa's leg is raised in the air as Quayle removes her stocking. What these series of shots convey is their mad infatuation with each other. Later, she visits Quayle's office and he literally drops everything to give her his undivided attention. Weisz conveys that she genuinely loves Fienne's character and we form an attachment to her.<br /><br />The cast is filled with a number of great supporting characters who add to the mystery. Danny Huston (\\"The Aviator\\", \\"Birth\\") plays Sandy, Quayle's associate who may have had a hand in the mystery. Bill Nighy (\\"Love, Actually\\") is featured in a rare dramatic turn. And Pete Postlethwaite (\\"Dark Water\\", \\"The Shipping News\\") makes an impact in a particularly brief role.<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is that rare thing, a film for adults that contains great performances, great writing, fashioned with skill that actually makes you think about something other than car chases or dumb comedy.s to create an indelible, interesting character from the first moment we see her, or else we don't care about what happens to her.

B000002MP2|5.0|....is incredible. It's energetic, upbeat and covers adolescent topics such as boredom (Longview), having an argument and trying to cool down (When I Come Around), angry at those around you (Having a Blast) and running into an old friend who's changed (Emenius Sleepus).  Without a doubt, this is definatly one of their best and I recommend buying it if you can.
0060245867|5.0|This book is very cute. My son is 2 and he loves the story and the illustrations.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I rented this piece of [...], thank God.  Do yourselves a favor and rent it if you can, because this movie sucked. Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to represent the \\"humor\\" based on seeing puppets having sex and exploding, as well as keeping the strings undeleted. A sad attempt at best.  You wanna laugh at that type of thing? Play with your sister's dolls.  Don't get me wrong, I like Trey Parker and Matt Stone's work, but this is bad. If they weren't the ones who made it, I wouldn't have given it a second look. If you must have it, go ahead and buy it. Just make sure you have a job first.
B00002E23E|5.0|For those of you who got this, watched it, and screamed WTF, here's the answer:<br /><br />It's a Led Zeppelin concert.<br /><br />As for my take on the rest of the movie, I'm guessing the producers/screenwriters/actors/and everyone else were all high.  The point is for the concert.  The rest is just for a good laugh.  And for me, it was a five-star laugh.<br /><br />However, it'd be nice to be able to give it ten stars, because I have to give a whole seperate five stars to the concert itself.  The Madison Square Garden Concert is incredible.  I love it and how it was put together.<br /><br />So, even though I was only able to show five stars, I would like to give this DVD ten stars.  The concert was awesome, and the movie was a definite five-star laugh.  It is very much worthit.
B00008MLSH|4.0|Any budding soprano that doesn't choose the usual warhorses, and opens her debut album with an aria from Mozart's Idomeneo, and turns it into a tour de force, sparkling performance, is worth all the hype. And the best is yet to come- the second track, Non mir dir from Don Giovanni is even better. Not technically, far from it: the way she fudges that trill at the end is astounding, but this Anna is so alive, so achingly beautiful, that it remains one of my favourites among the many versions I have heard over the years. Netrebko has performed Donna Anna on stage - to a great acclaim- and that shows here.<br />The rest of the album offers energetic Berlioz, great bits of Lucia - a wonderful mezzo Elina Garanca joins Netrebko on this one- and La sonnambula sung in a way that makes Dionizetti and Bellini palatable for me... The runs are  little messy sometimes, but give Netrebko the vocal challenges, the idiotic libretti and a sleeping gown and she can act the hell out of it, even in a studio recording. The spunky Manon makes her mark in the gavotte, the Faust is charming- and devoid of many written trills and such, but it's good clean fun and she is putting some life into that chirpy classic.<br />And then, the kinky Rusalka, lovely, strong and devoid of any of that cheese and swooning nonsense that many other singers have splattered on it. I love this opera and Mesicku aria is one of my big favourites, and I have heard countless renditions of it, from a near perfect Benackova to a very cool Karita Mattila to a horrible, slurring and scooping, bottom of the lake Fleming, and Netrebko really gets it right for me. When I was a kid reading all the stories about rusalki, this is how I imagined them- sad, erotic, and with some character. I can understand her Czech too, how often that happens! I guess only  someone from our Slavic language pool would understand how well she controls that super rounded Russian oh's from overtaking what she is singing, and even though her diction is funny business overall, the voice more than makes up for it.<br />The closing Musetta's Waltz is just about perfect- once again, not too much, not too little, would make me see the tired old Boheme if it played around here and she was in it... Netrebko has some work to do on varying the colors of her lovely, dark voice, and kicking up the diction, but she is shaping to be major economic force in the opera world and from this debut CD it is clear why- the looks are backed by a high wattage talent, acting skills and plain good taste.funny business overall, the voice more than makes up for it.

B000062YB1|3.0|Most Slayer fans will tell you this record is one of their best, although I have always felt it was overrated.  I still love it, but it just does not match up to their two previous releases.  Many critics of 'post- 'REIGN IN BLOOD' Slayer' accuse the music of becoming slow.  I disagree when it comes to SOUTH OF HEAVEN with tracks like 'Silent Scream' and 'Ghost of War.'  However, SEASONS IN THE ABYSS truly is toned down in the speed department.  It also has an 'overproduced' sound, and I question the intentions of the record label and/or the band at the time. <br /> <br />There are still many positives about this record.  First of all, Dave Lombardo is still in the band.  Secondly, we get three major hits in 'War Ensemble,' 'Dead Skin Mask,' and 'Seasons in the Abyss.'  'Dead Skin Mask' follows Slayer's earlier roots in songs with evil harmonies such as 'Raining Blood' and 'Spill the Blood.'  The lyrical content is also about Ed Gein, the cereal killer who cut off the faces of his victims and wore them as masks.  As always, Slayer does not dissapoint lyrically.   <br /> <br />'Expendable Youth' and 'Skeletons of Society' deserve an honorable mention, however, they are much slower tempo-wise, and this element really cuts down on the high-energy factor we usually get from this band.  Also, I must add that 'Born of Fire' might be the worst Slayer song I've ever heard.  This song is one of the reasons this record gets only three stars from me.   <br /> <br />Many Slayer fans will say that REIGN IN BLOOD, SOUTH OF HEAVEN, and SEASONS IN THE ABYSS are their three best records, but I don't even view this record as even being in the same LEAGUE as the other two.  It is still worthy of a purchase, but it is definitely not worthy of all the praise it receives.  Instead of this, check out DIABOLUS IN MUSICA, which doesn't get any of the attention it deserves.  It's also much more similar to early Slayer.
B000001G50|1.0|First of all, the collection is bad enough: if you haven't had enough of that Pachelbel Cannonn yet, omnipresent and ever opressing- it's a popular ringtone, too- you need to get out more. Poor Pachelbel didn't even commit this atrocity, some crazy arranger did. The Albinoni Adagio brings me the fond memories of Brezniev's funeral- it has been a fixture of the state funerals for ages, but why would you need to listen to it at home? Dedicated Goths might like it, but getting a spray can of \\"Fresh Grave\\" home fragrance would be cheaper.<br />The works of Mozart, Vivaldi and Gluck included on this collection are all nice and fluffy- on paper. What is most grating about this recording is how Karajan manages to make everything sound pompous, cold, leaden, slooow and sticky, smooth as baby food and just as bland. After few tracks I began to feel as if I was drinking wet cement. The sound is atrocious- it's an old recording and nothing has been done to improve the itchy and scratchy, low-fi feel of this collection. Hopefully it will die a natural death soon, but while it's still in print- beware!
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|This is a cool DVD set. Even though there are about 80+ performances that were not included in this set, it was still a blast from the past...that is if you like 80's music. The concert, by today's standards, is so raw and plain...but hey...I bought it for nostalgia and the music.

0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked this way comes is written by Ray Bradbury.  This book is all about a mystery.  The mystery starts with this weird and creepy man.  Jim and Will are the two main characters in the story.  They are introduced to this shadowy man early in the book.  This man puts a spell on the two boys.  Many things are happening to the boys all through out the story.  At certain parts of the book, they are chased by a storm.  This storm continues to bring many bad things to the boys.  There was a special day for Jim's dad; he could not wait until his son had come home.  However, the surprise that he was expecting was not what Jim had brought to him.  Jim and Will had been arrested by the police.  They would not tell His father where they were.  At that point, of the story, I thought to my self, \\"What could the father be thinking of his son?\\"  At that point, I could only feel sorrow for how he felt.  This story goes on to more details and to more problems to the two boys.  The story ends in a surprising ending.  For more details on the book, you have to get it and read it.
0553802534|3.0|While I still love Lisa Gardner's writing style - every character in this book was so dysfunctional I couldn't care about any of them.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I really enjoy this album because her songs are really expressive.And they explain feelings and I especially like the song \\"We belong together\\".Because Its telling like mini story about how shes singing to her boyfriend talking about how they belong together and how the boy he left and she is just telling her how they belong together and that she loves him and so does she. But I really enjoy the song its really pretty specially for girls.
B00000612P|5.0|When most people talk about Rod Stewart's greatness - they're usually referring to this album.  What made this different from previous and subsequent efforts was the maturity and individuality of the work.  It didn't pander to commercial tastes as Rod's later career moves would be criticised for.  So get this for the real Rod Stewart - the rocker, the soulster, the folkster.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I have many favorite movies, but Meet Me In St. Louis is the one that I watch most often.  This particular film is very special.  It packs a lot of great entertainment in one production.  It is a musical, a comedy, a love story, and a nostalgic look at simpler times.  Few movies can be all these things and be so wonderful as each. <br /> <br />My favorite character in the film is that of little Tootie (Margaret O'Brien).  She adds a depth of mischievous fun to this movie.  It's hilarious listening to her lines and trying to imagine anyone actually behaving in that manor (especially at her age).  Truly funny! <br /> <br />Yes, this movie is fantastic.  I won't spoil the movie but will say that the transfer to DVD is incredible.  I could not have asked for a better DVD package.  The movie is clear and the extras are fun. <br />
B00092ZMDY|2.0|I was dreading writing this review, most people will click the negative review button on this just because they are Eagles fanatics and not be able to see this DVD unbiased. I understand that though, completely. I love the Eagles.<br /><br />1) The lack of Don Felder is obvious in the sound of the band. The 'Eagles' sound that we've listened to for years is lacking without him. Don Felder and Joe Walsh always played off of each other and now it just doesn't happen. Sorry.<br /><br />2) The overt and heavy-handed use of a horn section, another guitarist and another keyboardist is just too painful to listen to. The clean, vibrant and very-much in-the-pocket performances from 'Hell Freezes Over' DVD are gone, replaced by what seems to be an attempt to tour just for the sake of it and to keep the \\"proverbial\\" pool heated (a term concerning touring musicians once coined by Lars Ulrich). If it's just about making money now, then I'll prefer to keep mine, thank you. Sorry.<br /><br />3) The DTS mix DOES sound brittle as several other reviewers have pointed out. The DTS processing clearly wasn't completed with as much thought as the 'Hell Freezes Over' DVD. Sorry.<br /><br />4) Don Henley, Glenn Frey & Timothy B. Schmit looked a little too 'geriatric'. Joe Walsh seems to have a lot of problems just enunciating his words for some reason. It really looked as though he was wearing `Depends' under his sarong pants he was wearing onstage during the second nights performance.  I hate saying this about the Eagles, seeing that I've always appreciated them for their ability to perform and make great music. Their albums and music though, thankfully will continue to be timeless, even if they're not. Sorry.<br /><br />5) If you own `Hell Freezes Over' DVD and own the `Selected Works' CD box set (which includes the Millennium concert that has a lot of songs that were played on tour but not on the DVD) then keep and cherish that as it really is the definitive work by these guys. Sorry.<br /><br />6) A lot of the performances by Don Henley (on this release) are just unwatchable because he's lost his ability to really carry the music and vocalize, gaining the weight maybe hasn't helped him much either. Sorry.<br /><br />Listen, I really love the Eagles in every way, but if you have to decide what you want to spend your $25 on, this aint it, get `Hell Freezes Over', and if you already own it, then be thankful and appreciate the previous releases. Sorry.nley (on this release) are just unwatchable because he's lost his ability to really carry the music and vocalize, gaining the weight maybe hasn't helped him much either. Sorry.

B00008ADPF|5.0|First off i would like to say that    Michael Smith has no taste in music and nickelback is not just catchy lyrices and beats they are a band that knows how to play music and how to play it well.  they have lyrics that have meaning and the music to go with them compliments them the way few bands can do.  they are one of the best bands out right now and they only get better if u see them live.  I would recomend this album and they older albums as well as any and i mean any future albums because unlike most bands they stay true to there fans and keep there music the same and thats great because there is no way to improve something that is this great and this iss wat any true fan loves.  NICKELBACK RULES!!

B00092QRGK|5.0|I'm speaking specifically about this import with the 2 bonus tracks and DVD. If you can nab this one from the marketplace for more like 40 bux (same price as the other imports with simply 1 bonus track and no DVD), do so without a second thought. Sprung and Secret, the 2 bonus tracks are both hot jams, and help balance out the number of downtempo songs and ballads on the CD. These are literally 2 of the strongest tracks on this disc, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />And, to just stab fans and buyers in the back, the record company RE-releases the \\"Platinum Edition\\" with added tracks here in the US...and STILL leaves these 2 tracks off!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana is classic! This is coming from a woman who listens mostly to Simon and Garfunkel, the Cranberries, and Vienna Teng (watch out for this Asian American newcomer). I have nothing bad to say about Nirvana, except that I don't like how they destroy their instruments after concerts. That made them seem like they were trying a bit too hard. <br />Nirvana's lyrics does everything--it mocks but it's sad at the same time. And all of the while, you have Kurt with that funny grin while singing his strange but honest lyrics.  <br />Nirvana probably also stands out to me because of the influence they've had on my own upbringing. They really set the mood of my middle school days (since that's when they came out). While everyone loved them to death, I really didn't care and was just listening to Simon and Garfunkel. But as time went on, the Spice girls and the boy bands came out, I was just like, \\"wait a minute, what happened to creativity?\\" And then I started hearing what Kurt was saying through his music, as I went through my own teenage years of torment. It also didn't hurt to grow up in the same state Nirvana grew up in, therefore taking personally the feeling and the mood of their songs. <br />It's sad that Nirvana is no more, but maybe it's best that David Grohl is now the frontman of his own group and Krist is in Olympia, WA as a political activist. Oh well. <br />Nirvana wins, in my book, as the anti-rock band of all time! Like the Beattles before them, they really changed music's history.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Steve McQueen is the San Francisco police detective assigned to guard a witness for the prosecution in a big mob case, but the witness is the wrong guy. It's a crackerjack suspense story, complete with the now-classic car chase scene through the streets of S.F. Robert Vaughan is good as the oily D.A. who is on McQueen's back all the time, but is apparently up to no good. The only fault I could find is the nonsense between McQueen and his girlfriend (Jacqueline Bisset) over the \\"brutality\\" of his work: it is forced and pointless. McQueen gained star status with this role, and the tough-guy rebel/rogue cop became a popular character (again) on film. It would only be a couple of years before we'd have Dirty Harry to contend with. Definitely worth a watch.
B000002UAO|5.0|They're both extremely great albums. But most people seem to think Revolver somehow outdid Rubber Soul and I just don't see it. Revolver was insanely brilliant. But RS was too.  <br /> <br />'Help!' had some of the most amazing pop music on it, and I think that's part of my love for RS. They carried that great sound over onto RS but you have that later sound you'd hear in all it's glory on Revolver creeping in on this record for the first time.  <br /> <br />And John was peaking in a ridiculous way. Help! was the start of it, and by RS he was writing the best stuff on earth.  <br /> <br />Drive My Car - is probably my least favorite track on the entire album but it's the Beatles, and it's a pretty good song. I'd have thrown out the \\"Beep Beep Yeah!\\" but who am I anyway.  <br /> <br />Norwegian Wood - Such a great song. Here Comes The Sitar (catch the joke). It had to have been all over as soon as people heard this new sound on their album. This song really puts you somewhere else.  <br /> <br />You Won't See Me - Sort of a throwaway for the Beatles, but still a great song.  <br /> <br />Nowhere Man - Was he writing about me? Couldn't have been. I'd probably give one of my legs to be able to go back in time and see them doing this live. (which they did do)  <br /> <br />Think For Yourself - Great RS song. They had a couple like this one. They were more mediocre but medicore for the Beatles is like a five star song for a regular band. Nice song. Nice George vocals.  <br /> <br />The Word - Amazing song. The bridge/middle is mindblowing. One of my very favorite Beatle/john lines: \\"everywhere I go, I hear it said, in the good and the bad books that I have read\\". Great song. Great message.  <br /> <br />Michelle - Obviously if John is writing amazing songs, Paul is going to try and out-do him, and here he does a great job. The way I see it, this was Paul's warm up for writing 'Here There And Everywhere' on Revolver. Great soft song. You've got that classic layered backing vocal track and then as it fades away, that great mysterious guitar sound makes an appearnace.  <br /> <br />What Goes On - Garbage. haha, kidding. I love you Ringo. Nice song. I love this man's voice.  <br /> <br />Girl - I cannot express how great this song is. John Lennon always had that weird vibe about him, which made you wonder if he wanted to kiss this girl, or kill her. Maybe I'm crazy but he WAS a woman-beater before his Yoko days and you can hear it in his music. So soft and loving, yet there's just something wrong. \\"..will she still believe it when he's dead, ah Girl\\".  <br /> <br />I'm Looking Through You - One of my favorites on the album. Paul McCartney was a song-writing machine and if John was writing great songs, he was too. I think the softy image he's been tagged with is slightly incorrect (I'm Down, Helter Skelter, ect ect) but the man was just too freaking good at writing those kinds of songs.  <br /> <br />In My Life - This song is obviously one of the greatest things ever written. All I can say is thank-you John Lennon for this brilliant song. And the sped up piano George Martin helped throw in there fits the song like a glove.  <br /> <br />Wait - Nice song. Nice guitar piece. You can tell at this point they were exploring the guitar on a level they hadn't before. <br /> <br />If I Needed Someone - This is one of those songs where I much prefer seeing/hearing a live version of. It's just a live song to me. Another really nice guitar piece ala George.  <br /> <br />Run For Your Life - \\"I'd rather see you dead little girl then to be with another man\\". Cleverly dodging (and rightfully so because it wasn't a negative song really) the stigma that has built up about 'Helter Skelter' Paul says the only slightly negative song the Beatles (john) ever wrote was 'Happiness is a warm gun', but lyrically, 'Run For Your Life' has got to be more negative. Sort of a cousin song to 'No Reply' the way I see it. Maybe it was pure fiction but I think to an extent, these lyrics are the reality of who John was in the early days.  <br />John always said he wrote about what he knew, and apparently he knew alot about abusing women.  <br /> <br />Still nice song lol. Makes you wonder about that deep breathing on 'Girl'.  <br /> <br />Long live the Beatles. (I realize no one will ever read this review burried under 900 other Beatles reviews)
0596007124|5.0|book in water, and curly; <br />but the content is really interesting
B00005JNTX|3.0|I'll be honest with you...I went to the theater to see this, and walked out shortly after the horrible exchange of dialogue between Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen at the beginning.   <br /> <br />Bad mistake. <br /> <br />It arrived on DVD, and out of absolute boredom I suppose, I purchased a copy telling myself, \\"I'll give it a chance.\\"  Glad I am.  Good it was.  Now I realize you're not reading \\"Newsweek\\" or something so I won't go into every single pro and con of this film but I'll tell you one thing---it's action packed, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's clever...and there are some REALLY bad performances at the first.  Somehow Michael Madsen drags Bruce Willis' performance down, because later on in the film, Willis returns to his former glory.  Perhaps because by then he's paired with Jessica Alba, and not the fat-guy from Reservoir Dogs.   <br /> <br />Finally, I guess I was trying to give this three and a half stars, because it's really better than a flat three, but not quite a four, if \\"Batman Begins\\" is a five.  What really hurts this film in the long-run will be it's playback value.  I know what happens.  The big BANG! SHOCK! is over.  As much as I loved it, and though it's sitting on my shelf, I haven't yet forced myself to watch it twice.  I WILL...eventuallly...but what about three times?  And four? <br /> <br />I...just...don't...know.... *(to be read overzealously---perhaps like Bruce Willis in this film)
B00004W50Z|5.0|I've never heard it said, but I'm sure it has been, that Robbie Robertson plays guitar a lot like Paul McCartney.  The legacy of The Band has always been overshadowed by the dense Americana-flavored music and lyrics of their second album, \\"The Band\\"--but Robertson and company were also a terrific rock-'n'-roll outfit.  (In fact, their real roots were in rock: they played Bo Diddley-inspired rock and roll behind Ronnie Hawkins, and by themselves, for nearly a decade before they ever met Bob Dylan).  Stage Fright came out a year after \\"Abbey Road,\\" and the similarities are surprising.  Listen, for example, to the obviously Beatle-ish \\"Just Another Whistle Stop.\\"  I don't know whether this album was influenced by the Beatles, or whether it was just influenced by the same thing as the Beatles were (because, yes, even the Beatles had influences).  Either way, \\"Stage Fright\\" is a great slice of American rock and roll, the perfect counter to British domination of the genre throughout the 60's.  Hooray for The Band.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I won't go on for six paragraphs about how good this movie is.  In all reality, I would need twenty or more.  This is THE definitive comic book movie of all time.  It stays true to the source material, and as true to reality as possible.  Be warned though, this Batman is not for the faint of heart.  Clooney and Kilmer were laughable in their batsuits.  Michael Keaton looked cool enough.  But Christian Bale as Batman is downright scary.  If you think Keaton pulling a thug close to his face and whispering just who he is was scary back in 1989, you've got another thing coming when Bale growls and hisses and hangs criminals upside down over the sides of buildings as they more than likely soil themselves.  All of that, plus the villain (Scarecrow) makes Nicholson's Joker look...like...well, a clown.  THis is not only the greatest comic book film of all time, but it deserves a place within the top 100 films of all time for it's cinematography, script, direction, and performances.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: <br />Absolute paradise for Batman fans---and still a damn enjoyable movie for people that would say, \\"Bat-who?\\" <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|I became a fan of the Beatles when I was in high school in the early and mid 90's.  I gradually bought each album and never ceased to be amazed at hearing the tracks that non-fans didn't know about.  Songs like Rubber Soul's \\"You Won't See Me' Revolver's \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and the White Album's \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\".  Abbey Road was among the last albums I bought and it is probably my favorite part of the Beatles' catalog.  I have had this CD for over 10 years and I always find it fresh, relevant and comforting. <br />This album cannot be dismissed by anyone who values music generally. As another reviewer mentioned, even the Beatles' dectractors cannot ignore this album.  Although the styles represented here are not as disparate as on the White Album, many different genres are represented contribuiting to the album's overall strength. <br />George, my favorite of the four, is perhaps the best element of this story.  His Abbey Road songs, \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" are classics and rival anything the Lennon/McCartney juggernaut ever wrote.  George's contributions to the others' work are wonderful as well.  His \\"dueling guitars\\" bit with Lennon on \\"I Want You\\" shows that George had a grasp of the blues and that the Beatles could have done the Led Zep sound had they wanted to, just like they could have done the Stones. His solo on Ringo's \\"Octupus's Garden\\" is representative of his role in the group in that he complements the song without overwhelming it.  Finally, his lead on \\"Oh! Darling\\" is great. <br />This album is great at the muicro and macro level.  Listen to the outro on \\"I Want You\\", George's lead on \\"Oh! Darling\\", Ringo's drums on the bridge to \\"Something\\", Paul's bass part on \\"Something\\" with headphones.  They are all spectacular! <br />If you're looking for a good album for a drive this will suit you as well. A fitting finale for, in my opinion, the greatest band the world has known and likely will ever know.
0679805273|5.0|This book is GREAT about telling kids about life.  It reminds us that we all have good and bad days.  And it ends with encouragement 98 3/4 percent guaranteed.
0143058177|5.0|While this is an abridged version, very little of the story is really lost.  This reader gives each character his/her own distinctive voice. The reading is lively with excellent pacing. I have had this on cassettes for a few years and have worn out the tapes from listening to them so much.  I am now buying the CD.
B000002AVF|5.0|In the Autumn (or fall) of 1995 Mariah released what would become one of her biggest selling and most popular albums titled daydream this was also the beginning of a new Mariah who would evolve into a much more RnB style Artist which was trying to distance herself from the squeaky clean good girl image that was put across by her early albums. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with the lead single FANTASY (released earlier than planned due to public demand) this up-tempo classic is one of the most famous and loved Mariah songs with its funky beat this song was huge everywhere and of course reached the number one spot in the USA. The next song is UNDERNEATH THE STARS a sweet sort of innocent ballad about young love a nice song but not among the most famous of Mariah's hits. However the next song ONE SWEET DAY is a ballad with male soul group boyz 2 men and holds the world record for the most consecutive weeks at number one (16! to be exact) this is a very emotional song about missing someone close to you who has passed away (it was written for one of Mariah's producers who passed away) while not my favourite song on the album it is defiantly a highlight of her career. OPEN ARMS is a cover song ive never heard the original so I can't compare the two but I really love this one I think it's the lyrics that really bring the song to life. Next up is another number one hit ALLWAYS BE MY BABY this has a nice tune and a cute video filmed at Camp Mariah (a camp for kids in the city to get to experience the country) <br /> <br />I AM FREE is a song about somebody completely changing your life and making you feel \\"free\\" this could describe Mariah's feelings after her split from very controlling Tommy Mottola the song just sounds very personal somehow. WHEN I SAW YOU is a ballad and one of the many good songs on the album and is about love at first sight some think that the lyrics are too repetitive in places. LONG AGO is probably the most RnB song on the whole album and sounds like kind of like something that should be on the butterfly album and is about not being able to resist someone a very cool song with nice lyrics. MELT AWAY is one of my favourite songs on the whole album its lyrics, music and melody blend perfectly it also has a sort of up-tempo feel for a ballad. The next two are songs FOREVER and FANTASY (SWEET DUB MIX) the former is your typical Mariah style ballad though you can tell even her straight forward ballads are becoming more RnB - ish and the later is a cool remix of fantasy but nothing amazing (the ODB remix is far better). The last song LOOKING IN is very emotional and the music is kind of haunting (you'll know when you listen) and in the words you can see Mariah's secret unhappiness at the time of this recording this is a great way to end the album!^_^  <br /> <br />Daydream couldn't quite top music box sales wise but it came very close and is without a doubt one of her best and really does show her growth but what would come next would shock the public indeed! ^_^                                    <br />
B000002L68|3.0|The first time I really noticed the rock and roll music of Prince was the year 1996, and I was watching the movie \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" with my little sister.  As I was watching the movie I heard \\"When Doves Cry\\", this became a favorite song of mine for a while.  I later found out this was done by Prince.  I had heard of him before but never really knew what he was about.  Through the years I have noticed that Prince has a very unforgettable style.  His album \\"Purple Rain\\" was one of the big hits of the 1980's.  Prince's entire collection of albums had great songs on each one but this was counted as one of his best ever.  <br />The best tracks on this album are \\"Darling Nikki\\" and \\"When Doves Cry\\".  These are both entertaining to listen to.  They have a beat that just makes you want to move with the music. The song \\"Purple Rain\\" is also a great song but you need to be in the right kind of mood to listen, it has a downhearted feeling to it. <br />\\"Let's Go Crazy\\", \\"Take Me With You\\", and \\"Baby I'm A Star\\" are also on this album.  These are also good but not songs I like to listen to.  \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" was one of his bigger hits but I only thought it was an ok song.  There doesn't seem to be much to the song, he repeats the same words over and over. The beat is not strong enough to carry a song like that in my opinion. <br />The last two songs on this album were \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" and \\"Computer Blue\\". These two songs are not enjoyable to listen to at all.  They feel forced with brokenhearted emotions that are not really there.   <br />As a whole this album seems to be lacking depth and the songs seem to blend together.  It does not have the refined edge of a greatest hits album that I would prefer.  I would give \\"Purple Rain\\" 3 out of 5 stars; there are some entertaining songs on it but not enough to carry the weight of the entire album.
B000002HJD|5.0|This might be the first audio book ever made.<br /><br />One sunny day in Los Angeles Jim Morrison went into a studio, but without the &#34;Doors.&#34;  Instead he had sheets of notebook paper with scribbled poems.  He sat down with a microphone in front of him and recited his poetry earnestly like a man who knew he was doing something special.<br /><br />He drank a little, but did not get wasted on booze, or drugs.  That was what had caused the rift between Morrison and the rest of the &#34;Doors&#34; during the recording of the L.A. Woman album.  His prolonged derangement of the senses had distanced him from the rest of the band.  The rift would never heal because Morrison died some months later in Paris.<br /><br />Yet on that day Morrison left the &#34;Doors&#34; with a present, material that they would later turn into the &#34;An American Prayer&#34; album.  This album is very innovative in its approach.  Original poetry set to music.  The music however, drifts between sets and is mixed with ambient sound, for example the sounds of passing cars, or of war, and parades.  This mix of music and sound adds to the blues singer's voice as he reads his work in a level tone, like in an audiobook.<br /><br />Still there are songs mixed in.  This was in no doubt to add to the commercial value of this album.  Even so, I end by saying this is my favorite Doors recording.
B000003CKH|4.0|On each Cake CD there are always good catchy songs and bad, boring songs.  \\"Its Coming Down,\\" \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,\\" and \\"Daria\\" are examples of good actchy ones.  \\"Race car ya yas,\\" and \\"Sad songs and waltzes\\" are examples of bad boring ones.  The rest of the tracks are good ones though that stay true to Cake's style and i recommend this Cd to anyone with an open mind.
0684803356|5.0|This book has everything.  War, Romance, and the little known history of the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Hemingway is at his best in this book.  His keen journalistic eye doesn't miss a detail.<br /><br />Although the era he is writting about has long since gone by the reader cannot help but be pushed back in time.<br /><br />There is one scene that always sticks in my mind.  I think Pablo's mujer is telling Robert Jordan about a village they \\"cleaned\\" of fascist.  The details of the brutality in that section of the book will give any reader a glipse of what war is.
B000007VCM|5.0|Despite the fact that \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" was used in an automobile commercial ( uuuugh ) , and despite the fact that the follow-up to this groundbreaking album ( the Led Zeppelin AC/DC rip-off \\"Electric\\" ) was a dumbed-down hard rock tribute, and despite the fact that Cult singer Ian Astbury now sings for the Doors in Las Vegas ( yet another UUUUGH ), this beauty of a collection called \\"LOVE\\" rises above everything that was released years before and years after. Landmark, in every sense of the word. There is nothing to compare it to. That is the best compliment I can pay it. That and the fact that I still play this one regularly, and still have to tell people who bother to ask who it is. \\"LOVE\\" covers so much ground. It rocks hard. It sends shivers down my spine. It inspires. It liberates. It transcends all boundaries and limitations. It is the Cult firing on all cylinders.
B000067J1H|4.0|I didn't go see this movie in the theater.  I thought it was going to be another Van Damn movie like Bloodsport.  However, I was mistaken to my delight when I saw the DVD.  The gritty color, interesting characters and of course the lovely Marla Singer.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, now is the time.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I am very happy that there is going to be a second season for the show in spite of the show's non stellar ratings. Thankfully it will not join the Freaks and Geeks, My So Called Life, Undeclared, and Popular club which all were killed off the air too early. Hopefully the second season will get an increased number of viewers that the show really deserves.    One of the things I like about the show is that even though each episode has different episode long plots, there are season long plots (Lilly's murder, Veronica's mother) to move the series along. It is serialized in the sense that as the season progresses, we get little clues regarding the major plots. Even though each episode can be regarded as \\"stand alone\\" episodes, collectively it is a coherent entire season    Kristin Bell carried the show with spunk and charm. Enrico Colantoni was also good. The relationship of Veronica and Keith was the heart and soul of the series. The chemistry between the two was very effective.     It's hard to narrow down my 5 favorite episodes of the season since almost all of them were really great. But here are my top 5 episodes of the first season:                                   **************Possible Spoiler*****************                  1. Leave it to Beaver - I have seen lots of season finales last season, and this VM finale was the most satisfying. It's a perfect culmination as the murderer of Lilly Kane was finally revealed. I was on the edge of the seat the entire episode. And the scene with the paternity results with Keith and Veronica was really moving. And the penultimate scene with Veronica and Lily in the pool with the song \\"Lily Dreams On\\" in the background was appropriately poignant. This was just a perfect episode.       2. A Trip to the Dentist - A stylish episode as Veronica investigates the person who raped her. The flashbacks were nicely done as they were shown the way the witnesses saw them. They were all basically the same but very different in implication because of the minor details that either they failed to mention or choose not to mention or sometimes the way they interpret the situation.          3. The Wrath of Con - I love seeing Veronica and the gang pre murder of Lily. We got insights to the major characters especially the relationship of Duncan and Veronica. The Lily montage in the end of the episode was poignant even though we've only known the character for like 4 or 5 episodes.       4. Like a Virgin - Abel Koontz and Veronica Mars in the prison was somewhat reminiscent of Clarice and Hannibal Lecter's face off in Silence of the Lambs. There's a big revelation in the end that made you look at prior episodes in different perspective. Plus Veronica's got a great case with the \\"purity test\\".     5. Ruskie Business - this episode was packed the way pickles are packed. Veronica was working on 3 different cases (Logan's mother, Meg's secret admirer, finding Tom Cruz the actor) and none of them were fillers. All had satisfying conclusions. And just when you thought it's over, the episode actually ended on a cliffhanger of a totally different plot which I won't tell you.          Grade: A
B0002X314C|4.0|I was driving home, listening to the radio when I first heard Ordinary People. I stopped and just took in the amazing voice and the beautiful piano. The battle in my mind was on going, as I was trying to figure out who this person serenading my eardrums is. Then I heard the name John Legend, at that moment I fell in love. In love with the fresh, creative sound I was hearing. <br />This is a timeless album with songs that suite almost every mood. They are well made with the melodies just hitting the correct spots. And to think that this is Johns debut album gives me shivers down my spine as to what he will do next. This is an amazing start. <br />I am even afraid of picking out a single track because I would feel guilty for not mentioning the rest of the master pieces. Let's just say, a legend has been born.
6305428522|5.0|Even though what was shown in the movie would probably not shock anyone today considering that people nowadays are not oblivious to some of the not so positive aspect of how television operates. If in the future some game show or reality contest was exposed to be rigged, it wouln't be as shocking compared to the period of time the movie took place. It's more like \\"I told you so\\" reaction. OK Im exaggerating but you know what I mean!  <br /> <br />Even though the rigging of a game show was the story that drove the whole movie, it also explored the human perspective surrounding that focal point. We get to see the motivations of the people for doing what they did, how each cope with the scandal and how each is going to face the consequences of what he did (or for some lack thereof). The movie wouldn't be as compelling if they failed to incorporate those kinds of complexity in the movie, because otherwise this movie could've been just a move about a rigged game show. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the movie, when Van Doren (the game show champion who at first unwillingly become part of the rigging but eventually become a conscious participant), played perfectly by Ralph Fiennes, decided to confess to the court of his involvement in the scandal, I was worried when all the judges started to praise his honesty and courage for exposing himself, they were two inches into canonizing him into a saint and forget everything he did. Thankfully someone whose reason is not superseded by passion said that honesty doesn't acquit someone from the wrong things he did. Honesty is an admirable virtue but it should not free someone from facing the consequences of his actions. But the sad fact is that it only seems to apply to the small powerless people. <br /> <br />The movie has something to say not just about games shows but the power of television as a whole. But the movie's true greatness lies in the vivid and memorable characters in the movie. This is a modern masterpiece! <br />  <br />Grade: A
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|It's been quite a while since SOAD released an album since \\"Steal this Album\\".  Mezmerize is definitly a stronger album than \\"Steal this Album\\", and has many  excellent tracks.  <br /> <br />Soldiar Side: Nice guitar riff, and a good way to introduce B.Y.O.B., but the lyrics are a whiney which has gotten a little annoying. 8/10 <br /> <br />B.Y.O.B: Wow... what can I say.  Truley ingenious lyriclly and musically.  It is catchy  and your ears will be thanking you after every listen. 10/10 <br /> <br />Revenga: Another great track off of Mezmerize with an awesome chorus.  It is very easy to get this song stuck in your head, though. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Cigaro: Yes!!! This song kicks some serious butt! I love everything about it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Radio/Video: \\"Sweet Danny and Lisa-ah.\\" Great track with awesome guitar chops. 10/10 <br /> <br />This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On this Song: Doesn't go anywhere.  The song just sort of stays still and doesn't make much of a point.  6/10 <br /> <br />Violent Pornography: Again, fun to listen to and great all around. 10/10 <br /> <br />Question!: Shows what SOAD is really capable of.  Great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Sad Statute: Great song, and the lyrics are great. 9/10 <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood: Eh... not my favorite.  Not much to say about it, but that it really isn't anything special. 5/10 <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood: Boring and unexiting song.  5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, Mezmerize is great.  It has three songs that could have been better, but the other songs are amazing.  I do wish Serj got the air time he deserves insted of the guitarist Daron.  Daron has a great voice, but Serj, quite frankly, has a better one.  I would reccomend this album to any fan of Rock n' Roll music.
B00005JLR8|5.0|On the surface the movie is about an immigrant family dealing with life in America. But if we look closer which is not a hard task since it is pretty obvious that the movie's heart and soul is how the family cope (for some failure or refusal to cope) with loss and acceptance while living in a foreign land. <br /> <br />After seeing the movie I realized that the use of a child's point of view in telling a story is very effective in stories that are potentially \\"sappy\\". The movie was never melodramatic, it's heartwarming and deeply moving, besides the wonderful and perceptive script of the Sheridans, I think the use of the narration and the insights of the little girl was a key factor to that. <br /> <br />So many memorable scenes. One that quickly comes to mind is the scene with the ET stuffed toy prize in some sort of a game. At first it's just about a $30 toy, but in the end it became so much more about that. It was heartbreaking. Another notable scene was the \\"Desperado\\" school number of Christy (the narrator), for someone so young it's hard to believe she sang it with such depth and heart. And the ending was beautiful! It is a poignant closure to characters that are in desperate need of one. After the ending you just know they'll be a much happier and peaceful family. <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B0007P3582|5.0|The music in this CD was very moving, and always got ya on the floor dancing.  I think this is one of his best CD's yet.  I'm sure there will be more to come from him.  What a great CD.
B000002UB6|3.0|... but still a swing and a miss, due to the Beatles' own disinterest in the whole project. I listened to this recently for the first time in, well -- okay, thirty years -- and was surprised how good much of this sounds. Yeah, the strings are pretty swoony and distract from the \\"live-in-concert\\" idea, but the songs aren't all clunkers (\\"Across The Universe\\" is gorgeous) and John's cheeky wit saves the day. The project absolutely ran out of steam by the time it got to Spector's hands, though in fairness to the Beatles as professionals it must have been a little less than thrilling to hear their own boredom and animosity coming through the tape hiss. Even the song selection is a clue: George's scathing \\"I Me Mine\\" makes it to the album, while John's heartfelt plea to his bandmates (\\"Don't Let Me Down\\") gets reduced to a single B-side. That says a lot.<br /><br />  As it is, though, the album suffered from the hand of fate as much as any producer's tinkering; the Stones had already unleashed \\"Let It Bleed,\\" making this  patchwork effort sound less than inspired. Paul's recent second-guessing of the project, on \\"Naked,\\" is totally unneccessary but it's not like he's mucking about with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" material here. After the Beatles' true, \\"wall-of-sound\\" finale with \\"Abbey Road\\", the music on \\"Let It Be\\" seems archaic and a just a little creaky.

0385659806|5.0|I bought this book when I had a 5 hour stopover at Heathrow.  It certainly passed the time and well worth it...by the time it was time for me to board, I'd just finished the last page.  It's a great book to read.  I love the characters and the storylines...it makes me want to work hard and strive for what I want...quite inspirational if I can say that without sounding like a complete git.
B0002858YS|5.0|This CD is great.  Most bands sound the same these days and when you hear new songs on the radio you're like oh this must be so and so.  It's so easy to tell because every song they do sounds exactly the same, and that is so boring.  This CD and band are refreshing.  I just hope they impress me with their next release as well.
B000002I2I|5.0|I just recently started listening to this album again after seeing the \\"Riders on the Storm\\" in concert and I must say that besides the ever popular and excellent songs Roadhouse Blues, Waiting for the Sun and Peace Frog, my favorites are Blue Sunday and Indian Summer because they are so sweet sounding. I never realized that Jim and the Doors were capable of an awesome mellow song!
0062502182|5.0|This is one of those books that just touches your heart. It is written in a very simple language, so that children or adults can enjoy it. I think it has a great relevance to those of us who are adults because it reminds us that when we are dealing with our creative dreams we must perceive the world in a child-like way.  The Bible says, if we want to enter the kingdom of heaven, we must be as a little child. In some ways, this story is the journey of our inner child toward peace, harmony, and self-realization. <br /> <br />The story follows Santiago, a young man from Andalusia which is in Southern Spain. The interesting thing about this book is that we only see Santiago's name written once in the entire book. It took me a few years to remember that the boy had a name because throughout the book Santiago is called \\"the boy\\". I think this is done so that we can connect with Santiago on a deeper level and picture ourselves in his place. <br /> <br />In the Alchemist, we watch a boy follow his dreams and sometimes he makes mistakes, he stumbles, he forgets to read the omens, but the journey teaches him about life, love, and the Language of the  World. He discovers that everything is interconnected, and that all that has been written into existence was \\"written by the same hand.\\" <br />  <br />There are those who wish more complexity out of this book, but I think the whole point is that life seems to be complicated but in reality, the important things in life stay the same, no matter what time we live in. There is a beautiful part in the book where the boy decides to read a friend's books on alchemy and when he is asked what he has learned, Santiago says that essence of alchemy was so simple that it could be written on the face of an emerald. His friend was pouring over books, analyzing treatises and spending all his time attempting the Master Work of turning lead into gold. He spends years analyzing how to do it and never does it. I think this as well as many other scenes from this book are metaphors for life. <br /> <br />Do not let the simplicity of this book fool you into thinking that it is only a children's story or that it is not as valuable as some other spiritual texts. Every scene is rich with meaning. You can learn something new each time you read it.  <br /> <br />Be blessed. A good omen awaits you.
0375405380|4.0|In Power of the Dog, Don Winslow takes on the war on drugs. At the center is Art Keller, a part Hispanic DEA agent. Art, having seen the damaging effects of drugs in his own family, is driven to take down the forces behind the narcotics industry. <br /> <br />Earlier in his career, Keller befriends Don Miguel Angel Barrera, one of the top police officers in Mexico. Keller is stunned when Barrera ends up a drug kingpin and focuses much of his career on taking him down. The question seems to be how much of his own morality will Keller have to sacrifice to achieve his goal? <br /> <br />Once again, Don Winslow has spun an unforgettable story. In a little over 550 pages, Don has given us a compelling and realistic look at the history behind America's often futile war on drugs.  While extremely bleak and violent, the story captivated me. The characters are believable, the plot complex and the action breathtaking. By the time I finished it; I was exhausted and more than a little depressed. With Power of the Dog, Winslow once again shows why he is considered one of the finest voices in crime fiction today.   <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|Some people say this album sounds like it's straight out of the 80s.  Others disagree, saying it's just pop music with a harder edge.  I think those people are all wrong.<br /><br />\\"Somebody Told Me\\" is unique on the album, so if that's all you're heard from this album, forget it.  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" has a nice fresh upbeat feel to it (and great lyrics), but to me, the keys on this album are the rocking of \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" and its great bass riff, and \\"Believe Me Natalie\\", which although slower, is just great material.<br /><br />Are The Killers the Next Big Thing?  Maybe.  As a debut, this is a fantastic piece of work, and as it comes at a time when Jet and Franz Ferdinand are already working on their second albums - which I assume the Killers will commence shortly - we may be sitting on a wave of new rock groups with something to say and an edge to them - all without resorting to the cliche of rapping over guitars (a la Linkin Park, who are above criticism for being so good at it).  If that is the case - and this album is simply the start of a new movement in music - then we can all stop wondering when Prodigy and Guns N Roses will ever release another album, and concentrate instead on albums like this.
020161622X|4.0|This book won't teach you how to program. This book won't teach you any theory. This book won't teach you any history. <br /> <br />What this book will teach you is everything you knew was true but were afraid to hear from someone else: That you are not as good a programmer as you thought you were. Throughout this book you will encounter examples of mistakes all of us make, some that can be ignored, some that will completely turn your code upside down in no time. <br /> <br />The good part is that it gives you hints and recommendations on how to avoid making those mistakes, and how to improve your code and make coding a little more pleasant for you and others who might work on it. <br /> <br />Even if you already know most of what you see here, it is always good to refresh those thoughts so that you don't fall unexpectedly into a bad habit.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Are you kidding?  You still haven't bought this album?  Let me ask you something: Do you like rock music?  Did you like The Killers but wanted something harder, more like Van Halen in terms of speed but more Def Leppard/Pyromania in terms of accessibility?  Did you like Franz Ferdinand?<br /><br />OK, if you're still with me, then get this album right now.  This is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Green Day's finest work.  For that matter, it may be one of the better albums ever made - I'm not saying it's one of the all-time 25, but if there were a list of history's 100 great albums, this has a shot (unless Spin or Rolling Stone is doing the compilation, in which case it's not nearly crap enough for them).  I'm still not sure what the heck they're singing about with this St. Jimmy character, but the music they've written around it is superb.  And if you don't find yourself spontaneously singing \\"We're coming home again\\" after this, then just do yourself a favor and throw your CD player out the window, because you don't need it anyway.
B000002KK2|5.0|When Rickie Lee Jones was suddenly all the buzz in the music industry in 1979, she was assumed to be the next Joni Mitchell, and had a hit album (#3, Billboard's Top 200 Albums) and single (Chuck E.'s In Love, #4, Billboard's Pop Singles) in her hands before she knew it. She was, however, a true revolutionary who would only become increasingly experimental as her career progressed. Her music featured a distinct idiosyncratic style which often included free-verse beat poetry, jazz flourishes, torchy balladry and bohemian, streetwise subject matter - and sometimes all in the same song. It was this, her eponymous debut, which started it all and laid the groundwork for what Jones would evolve into.
0440213525|5.0|I have read so many books from many authors from michael connelly, to janet evanovich, robert crais, linda fairstein, d.w buffa, william bernhardt, etc. These are all some of my favorite authors, but my number 1 favorite book is the client. I read it and reread it every 4 months. I absolutely love it. If you are looking for a great book to read then you should definitely read the client. It is a powerful story about an 11year old boy witnessing a suicide and soon has the FBI and mob after him. The FBI want him to talk while the mob wants him to keep his mouth shut. He outsmarts the both and you will have fun while you join him on the ride.

B000A6T294|4.0|The plot of \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" comes down to three situations. First, and most importantly, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) discovers that he not only has a clone (Tom Hardy) who was created by the Romulans by raised by the Remuseans, but that the enterprising Shinzon has become Praetor of the Romulan Empire, which has a weapon that can destroy all life on Earth. Second, in an obvious parallel, Data (Brent Spiner) discovers yet another of Dr. Soong's prototype androids, named B-4 (also Spiner). Third, and finally in more ways than one, Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) are finally getting married. This 10th Star Trek film, and four in the STNG part of the series, has its moments but is ultimately less than satisfying.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that even before the film's climatic death scene we are already aware that we have another Star Trek death that is not really death scene. Yes, this is certainly more plausible than the first one in \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\"/\\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,\\" but that it is at the expense of the shock and emotional impact the first time around. Consequently, the big payoff rings hollow, which is never a good sing for a major theatrical release.<br /><br />Another part of the problem is that the cast is so large that few of them have much of value to do. Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton) has been standing by for several films mainly to ask Data what he is doing so the android can explain, Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) waits for casualties to show up in sick bay, and Worf (Michael Dorn) is at least good for a few laughs with the comments he makes in his cups while everyone is toasting Riker and Troi. As far as the movies go, STNG has boiled down to Picard and Data, and the rest are along for the ride, posing stiffly and formly in the background. That being said, \\"Nemesis\\" finally gives Counselor Troi the main supporting role and a couple of scenes when she proves she can give as well as receive. But overall there are two many cast members sitting around with little or nothing to do; compare this with the series finale \\"All Good Things...\\"<br /><br />Finally, there are just too many significant gaps in the thinking of the main characters. Picard and his clone think they understand each other as if in the future the nature versus nurture issue has gone the way of safety belts being required on alll chairs on spaceships. Yes, having a clone is creeping. Yes, having your clone serving in a Romulan slave pit is disturbing. But the idea that the result is a younger version of itself was never legitimated by novels/films like \\"The Boys From Brazil.\\" This is supposed to be the future, but the \\"science\\" here is about on par with a 1950s film. If I, who know virtually nothing about science in general or cloning in particular can see the holes in this logic, than Picard's Starfleet Academy training should serve him in much better stead.<br /><br />Now that we are apparently here at the end of the road for \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" it might be appropriate to conduct a post mortem and consider the question of why the theatrical films were never as good as any of the two-part episodes of the television series. The short explanation is they went for bigger (e.g., the Borg rewrite human history) rather than better. What is so puzzling is why a creative staff that came up with several solid story lines almost every season for many years could not cut it when it was required to come up with one very good idea every few years. \\"Star Trek - Nemesis\\" has the characters of STNG but neither the style nor the substance; what does Picard driving a intergalactic dune buggy have to do with why we loved this television show? Plus, the lighting makes Data's skin look really weird. At least we have the complete \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" out on DVD now.can give as well as receive.

006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent book. I love the characters, the setting, and just about everything in the book. In fact, they even made the book into a movie. Diana Wynn Jones has certainly written a fine novel, and she is one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />The story starts out with Sophie, the eldest girl in a family of three daughters. In the land of Ingary, however, that is considered bad luck. When her father dies, her two younger sisters are given apprenticeships and Sophie is resigned to taking over her family's hat shop. However, the story takes a turn when the Witch of the Waste comes into the shop. Unfortunately for Sophie, she offended the Witch and was turned into an old woman.<br /><br />In shock, she just left the shop. She moves in with the Wizard Howl (who has acquired a nasty repuation including a hobby of collecting young girls' souls) and becomes his cleaning lady, after striking a bargain with a fire demon. Sophie would break the contract the demon and Howl had made, and Calcifer, the demon, would remove the Witch's curse. However, like her own curse, the contract prevented Calcifer from telling her about the nature of the contract.<br /><br />Sophie soon befriends Michael, Howl's apprentice, who he took in after finding him orphaned and alone upon his doorstep. While trying to help Michael with a spell, she learns about the curse on Howl. It was cast by none other than the Witch of the Waste. When the Witch and her own fire demon find where Howl was, they hurriedly move away, moving into Sophie's own hat shop which was sold after she left.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Howl courts Miss Angorian, a school-teacher in England, where Howl originally came from. When the Witch kidnaps Lily Angorian, Sophie sets out to rescue the poor woman. Things come to a head when a certain scarecrow that had been following her (rather stalkingly) and a dog-man under a spell are revealed to be the mix of the pieces of Prince Justin and Wizard Suliman who had gone missing months before, and Lily Angorian is revealed to actually be the Witch's fire demon.<br /><br />And at that moment, the Witch's fire demon is at Howl's castle, seeking to find a new human to sustain her life after her witch dies. But to do that, she would have to kill Calcifer, and Sophie would never be free of her curse. Ever.ad gone missing months before, and Lily Angorian is revealed to actually be the Witch's fire demon. <br /> <br />And at that moment, the Witch's fire demon is at Howl's castle, seeking to find a new human to sustain her life after her witch dies.

0671034065|5.0|I started and stopped this book for about a month. I just couldn't get into it. Finally I made myself stick with it. Once I did that, I just couldn't put it down! I was reading it at Red Lights and in traffic jams! I arrived an hour early for a meeting and it was totally fine with me because I had the book with me. I was actually excited to wait an hour!  <br /> <br />This book has just the right amount of comedy and romance and suspense. I love the wit and candor that came from the 4 women! It was awesome! A definite MUST READ!
B00004Z459|5.0|The debut Linkin Park album is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br />It kicks off with \\"Papercut\\", a great track, with a heavy beat and excellent verses. Good chorus and flow. \\"One Step Closer\\" is next and it's even better than the first song. Great guitar, awesome beat, top-notch lyrics, one of the best on the Hybrid Theory album. The next song \\"With You\\" continues the flawless beginning of the CD, heavy beat, great chorus make this a standout track. Not quite as heavy as the previous songs but still awesome is the next song \\"Pts of Authority\\", great song, the remix on Reanimation is also worth a listen. \\"Crawling\\" is the next song, an interesting concept with great lyrics and beat make this one almost as strong as the first four.  <br /> <br />This album has had 5 great songs so far, so I thought the next ones can't be this good. I was right, they were better! \\"Runaway\\" is another lighter track but with some incredible verses and a heavy chorus this song is definately up there. The next song, my personal favorite, \\"By Myself\\" delivers everything that makes Linkin Park great, some great rapping, a bangin chorus, and flawless lyrics, best song on the album. \\"In the End\\" while not my favorite is right there at number 2. With 3 excellent verses, a good chorus, and message this song is the most popular Linkin Park song ever. \\"A Place For My Head\\" is oddly out of place here, but still great.  <br />The flow is not quite as good, and some of the rhymes seem forced, but it makes up for that with a good chorus. \\"Forgotten\\" picks it up with a superb chorus and good verses.  <br /> <br />The only song on the album that's not so good is \\"Cure For the Itch\\" seems to only serve as a filler. \\"Pushing Me Away\\" is a great ending to this fantastic album, great flow on this track with great lyrics.  <br /> <br />I don't give many five stars for music but this one deserves it. <br /> <br />Favorites(in order): <br />By Myself <br />In the End <br />One Step Closer <br />Papercut<br />Pts of Authority <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ive had this CD for almost a year now, and I still havent taken it out of my cd player. It's just that good. One week Im playing \\"St. Jimmy\\" all the time, the next week Im playing \\"american idiot\\". I don't care how many times I hear it, it still sounds like the first time. Maybe it's just the raw energy that this album has. Maybe it's the fact that i do agree with the political stance that green day has is taking, but it still hasn't gotten old. I think this CD will live on forever and might still be in my CD changer 10 years from now. Buy it-- you just might like it too.
B00012QM9K|5.0|Schindlers List DVD Review<br />  The Holocaust refers to the period from January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, to May 8, 1945 (V­E Day), when the war in Europe ended. During this time, Jewish people in Europe were subjected to harsh persecution that ultimately led to the murder of 6,000,000 Jews (1.5 million of these being children) and the destruction of 5,000 Jewish communities. Schindlers List is a movie that based on these true and inhuman events. This masterpiece has given people a vision into these brutal acts. During this time Oskar Schindler saved over 1000 Jews from concentration camps over the period of the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. Schindler would forge documents and provides different names, as well as work certificates for his factory so the Jewish people would be rescued from extermination, those who would be considered dispensable and be sent to the ghetto and concentration camps. Schindler's other employees recruited Jewish workers and were taught, and given instructions by the technicians on how to use the heavy machinery to manufacture soup bowls and by doing this he saved many Jewish lives. This motion picture captured and allowed us to go back to that time to witness how these people were unjustifiably tortured, and punished. It gives us an illustration to see the disgusting deeds committed in these concentration camps. The Jewish people were beaten, gassed, murdered, tortured and hung. They were fed and treated like animals. This film enlightens the viewer into the disturbing reality that was the Holocaust and illustrates how the Jewish citizens of Germany were ordered to perform unthinkable and revolting tasks. It shows the ghetto residents restricted to the confines of the small area provided, were there was no freedom and very little food or water. Schindlers List illustrates the atrocious events that people in power can execute behind closed doors.  It is movies like this that can ensure an event like the Holocaust will not go unnoticed by the public in the future. Its a must see movie and has been awarded 7 Academy Awards. Truly an outstanding movie.
0060989157|5.0|and I can't believe they would even want to tell their stories- but they did.  VERY candid, VERY interesting.  I could not put the book down, much like watching a car crash- you just can't help but keep reading this book.  Makes no matter what your 'type' of music interest is- this is THE book to give some insight into the warped world that Motley Crue lived through.  Amazing tales that capture the imagination- and plenty of which you try not to imagine.  Worth the money.
B00000IL67|4.0|Excellent overview of Alice's career from 1965-1997. Both sides of his 1965 Mascot single are included but only one side apiece from the 1966 Santa Cruz and 1967 Very singles are present, so Alice Cooper collectors may come off feeling a bit irritated(the remaining sides are probably on a bootleg cd somewhere). His best period, from 1971-1975, is well represented(but why four tracks from \\"Muscle of Love\\" and only TWO from \\"School's Out\\"?). Discs 3 & 4 cover 1977-1997 and didn't hold too much interest for me--too many ballads, and Alice never could find a decent replacement drummer for Neal Smith(the live \\"Under My Wheels\\" plods along compared to the studio original). Worth getting, especially since the individual cds aren't showing up in stores so much.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers began their journey to stardom in 2002 and did not become fully successful until their debut album, \\"Hot Fuss\\", was released in 2004.  The four members of the band, Brandon Flowers as keyboards and lead vocalist, David \\"Dave\\" Brent Keuning on the guitars, Mark Stoermer who plays bass, and Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" Vannucci masters the drums, call Las Vegas, Nevada their home.  In 2001, Brandon Flowers responded to Dave Keuning's ad in the \\"Las Vegas Weekly\\" and they immediately clicked.  After many interviews, together they found Ronnie Vannucci, and Mark Stoermer.  The Killers once used a one-hundred and twenty degree garage as their rehearsal room, hence the name of their first album, \\"Hot Fuss\\".  Since then, the band has battled earthquakes and fires to record this album, and they had a near death experience as their plane on its way to the UK hit an air pocket and began to freefall but they found a way to come out alive. <br /> The Killers album is made up of eleven songs of jealousy, paranoia, murderers, stalkers, sexless girlfriends, and the strength, courage, and desire to rise above the everyday world.  In my opinion, the entire CD is amazing, but I do have a few personal favorites such as \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Andy, You're A Star\\" simply because I find their lyrics to be the most captivating.  Most of their music is upbeat and catchy, but not annoyingly peppy or overly positive in unreal situations. I find that The Killers relate to real life situations and experiences.  They also experiment by adding a Gospel Choir touch to a few of the songs without making you feel like you are attending mass just like some previous greats like Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, and Jimi Hendrix once did.  Overall, I give the album an eight out of ten on my rating scale because the album has the ability to satisfy your mood no matter its uniqueness. <br />
0385338082|4.0|I loved this book.  Mostly it was very fun and light hearted but there was real depth to the caracters as well.  You really felt sorry for them durring the crisis that arouse.  Being a new mom I was able to identify with these women, but i think any woman who has ever had children or has ever been in a relationship will identify with at least one of these characters. The chapters are short so for me that was also a plus
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Lavigne has created a whole new style of punk rock music.  In her latest CD, \\"Under My Skin\\", she has found a way to express the feelings that everyone is feeling, or has felt, but she does it in such a way that it speaks out for all feelings that seem impossible to express.  Avril, originally from Ontario, has been a huge part of the pop punk industry since 2002.  She has always been known for her ability to completely forget about the glamour and spotlight of most teen stars, and that characteristic is what has made her such an influential star.  Avril offers a darker, alternative side to the pop stars such as Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. <br /> The lyrics of \\"Under My Skin\\" have taken a gigantic leap from her first CD.  They have matured from high school crushes and her hometown into real life stories transformed into powerful songs about boys taking advantage to a death in the family.  Avril is liked by a large variety of viewers because she is not afraid to let her feelings out, which gives all people a chance to relate.  This album is not only extremely successful, but it is emotional, sensational, and incredibly powerful. <br /> Not only are Avril's lyrics brilliant, but the way she is able to fit the perfect beat to them and turn it into an instant hit is amazing.  She intertwines jumpy, fast paced songs with melancholy songs, and every single one has a catchy chorus.  Avril does something that not many artists have the ability to do without the public completely ignoring them.  She sings about the pressures of being a celebrity, but she isn't complaining about it, so it makes the public want to sympathize with her rather than hate her because she's rich and her life cannot possibly be that bad.  Her feelings are sincere, deep, and one of a kind.  She can sing about virtually every situation and express it so strongly that everyone wants to hear about it for the mere possibility of relating to it. <br /> Overall, I feel that the album deserves a five out of five.  I honestly loved every song on the album as well as Avril's ability to combine all sorts of feelings with all different beats is utterly amazing.  Her music can be happy, sad, funny, and so true while the beat can be dark and depressing, fast and hip, or simply catchy.  I feel that Avril deserves all the credit and then some for this album, and I cannot wait for her next big hit. <br />
B00004Z459|1.0|...Anybody who calls this metal or a \\"rap-rock classic\\" is either brain dead, or is ten years old. Want real rap-rock? Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the way to go. Want real metal? Anything from Black Sabbath to Megadeth to Dimmu Borgir works. This is pop, just POP! Linkin Park is a watered down version of Nirvana, without the insightful lyrics and great songwriting. All you have here are a bunch of homos whining about how much their lives suck. \\"Oh BOO HOO, I have money, but not enough to fill my tub! WHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\\". What a horrible excuse of a band, and while Hybrid thermous isn't as bad as the ghastly Meteora, it still deserves 1 star. I cant wait until this pathetic excuse of a band is forgotten and is wiped off the face of the earth. <br /> <br />Yep, I know, not helpful...
B000025XKM|5.0|I admit to being a recent \\"bandwagon\\" follower of Nick Drake, despite years of immersion on the better side of music from 1970-1974. This remarkable album is short, intense, and has not a single weak link. Comparisons to Van Morrison are apt, but miss something unique and visceral in the quiet brooding of this record. There is simply nothing like it. So, where has it been these last three decades, how does the best work of a generation get lost, and... what else might we be missing, locked away in a vault somewhere?
B000002S4R|3.0|Much has been said in other reviews about the shortcomings of Hofmann and Vejzovic, so I won't beat on them needlessly, except to say that I can't for the life of me figure out why they sang with such uncertain voices: they were in their very early forties then, not quite an age to shelve a Wagnerian, and had sung more difficult roles with great success just few years prior. But I'd like to bring up a point I don't see mentioned elsewhere: this is Karajan's show all the way. It's almost as if he didn't care about Wagner's intent: he is dead set on giving his strings that extraordinary, celebrated shimmer in the pianissimi, whether it is appropriate or not, and he succeeds, even though the opera unravels in the process. Mind you, I am a huge fan of the conductor, but here he misses the mark entirely. With longish tempi, hushed voices (Senta is occasionally barely audible), and delicate phrasing, Karajan transforms this savage, thrillingly \\"scary\\" work into an elegant, sophisticated Viennese exercise in subtlety, sort of a la Richard Strauss circa \\"Intermezzo.\\" No one is allowed to cross the borders of good taste; why, even the Dutchman himself enters sotto voce and is never allowed much more than that. His \\"conversation\\" with Senta - essentially a contract between a cursed soul and his sacrificial lamb - becomes a subdued, calm affair. True, eventually all hell breaks loose, but this is due to special effects, not singing or even the orchestra's superb playing. It really comes down to that: if you want an orchestral sound that's short of sublime, you probably won't do better. But if singing and interpretation are of import, this is not a Karajan show that Wagner would be happy with.
B000026FOA|5.0|Folk strings, cello, and flute accompaniments are a recipe for disaster in lesser hands, but Nick Drake's debut album is absolutely fantastic - and somehow remains clear and centered despite the diverse who's who of late 60s talent that populates the record. The secret to holding the center, despite a certain eclecticism in arrangements, is Drake himself, whose sometimes dreamy garble tethers the record to the ground. The remarkable \\"Cello Song,\\" for those unacquainted with Drake's work, is a good place to start. The tail end of that song, with Drake's dreamy humming matching the drone of the Cello is spooky and magical, much like the rest of this inexplicably forgotten classic.
B000093BDX|5.0|Perfect!!!!!!! All the songs I've enjoyed over the decades!
B000025H0Q|4.0|Drake's second outing has neither the dark edge of his first record \\"Five Leaves Left,\\" nor the brooding emptiness of his magnificent \\"Pink Moon,\\" but the ensemble does some complicated and interesting stuff all the same. John Cale's presence definitely felt, giving the album a funky classical and jazz feeling.
0440224764|4.0|I like Grisham's work and liked this one also.  However, the ending was a disappointment.
0060925000|4.0|I read this book in 2001, and loved every bit of it. I can never forget this particular book, because when I was interviewing for a job in India, the interviewer had not completed this book due to its size, and I had, and we ended up having an interesting discussion and I got the job! The book that I had read had 1632 pages, and so if you do not like such 'heavy' books, probably this is not one for you. <br />The book spans generations and talks about one family and its next generation, while detailing political aspects of the times. I tende to skip some passages of the political aspects since I found them somewhat boring. Overall the book is a good read, and entertaining.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|50 has done it again.  The Videos are awesome they truly show the greatness of all of his songs.  At the end of the PiggyBank video he shows the Game in some rather compromising positions.  Got to freeze frame it to see it.  There is even a preview of his new Movie and Video Game.  You got to pick this up even if you already have the CD.
6304698690|5.0|We had the video but I needed to get the DVD of this timeless classic. The book was one of those classics that made an impression on me as a child. This film did the same to me as an adult. <br /> <br />It is an endearing and fun adventure for young and old and may even get many children back to the book which is a classic. <br /> <br />It is wonderful to still have films that tell a story and do not sell a product (as with Walt Disney).
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater is one of the most dynamic bands I have experienced in quite some time. I mean sure, Green Day is fine and any rapper can sing with at least one and a half different styles. But Dream Theater... well they can pretty much emulate any kind of style they want. I'm sitting here listening to \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" and \\"The Answer Lies Within,\\" two examples of their pseudo-Christian-rock style. You just gotta dig these happy-times lyrics: <br /> <br />Life is short, <br />So learn from your mistakes, <br />And stand behind <br />The choices that you make. <br /> <br />------------- <br />If I die tomorrow, <br />I'd be alright because I believe <br />That after we're gone, <br />The spirit carries on. <br /> <br />This coming from a band who in the same album will talk about murder, rape, terror, and general anger - with equally ferocious metal melodies and thrashing. I mean, these songs get you fired up! And then randomly, they will inject these ultra-pacifist interludes that calm the rage. Few bands can sway my emotions in the same way as Dream Theater. Let's not forget that in their most popular album, Train of Thought, they play with time signatures and chord sequences as if the damn things were just a bunch of Legos in a bucket. Their technical prowess is sincere and real, matched only by the likes of Metallica (when they were at their peak) and Rush. <br /> <br />Octavarium, the most recent DT album, is a really interesting addition to their repertoire. It's like some kind of refined version of Train which has all the technical fiddling removed - the metal has gone from an assortment iron and tin and been turned into cold, refined steel. I'm not really sure if I like that, but the outstanding song is absolutely the aforementioned \\"The Answer Lies Within.\\" What a contrast. <br /> <br />If you have a keen interest in the development of \\"underground\\" music, (the kind that doesn't get played on the radio) or if you just like new and interesting music, Dream Theater is a really brilliant, easy-to-enjoy kind of progressive rock. There's no \\"sentimental\\" buildups or horribly cliched lyrics that make you embarrassed to listen. You'll start in one place, get treated to about 4 or 5 unique themes, and end up back where you started with each DT song. If you really want to get started with this band, I recommend beginning with Train of Thought and working backward from there - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and then Scenes From A Memory. Progressive Rock is not some kind of metal cult - it's a universally acceptable kind of cool that incorporates elements from some of the best rock groups in recent history. I'm sure you'll be able to find your place with this band.
B00004NRWH|5.0|love em' or hate em', no one can deny that nickelback is one of the biggest modern rock acts on the face of the earth. for their debut, the state, nickelback brings all they have and places it into 10 unique and interesting cuts.  <br /> <br />Breathe, Cowboy hat and Leader of men all sound like the nickelback we know and love, with catchy guitars, chad's signature vocals and sky high hooks.  <br /> <br />Old enough is short but sweet, with a great chours and vocals.  <br /> <br />Worthy to stay could go down as the most unique nickelback song of all, with a heavy bass effect and turntables! By far my favorite on the record.  <br /> <br />Diggin' this, the sixth song, has some killer guitar riffs and one of the best solo's I've ever heard nickelback play (better than the one on \\"saturday night's alright\\"!).  <br /> <br />Deep opens with a sludgy guitar intro and moves into another great song. Almost industrial sounding, if you can believe it.  <br /> <br />One last run may take some time to grow on you, but when it does, it's killer.  <br /> <br />Not leaving yet' left me speechless; this song has a wonderful intro and some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. The chorus sounds like something by audioslave or vertical horizon, very catchy but done at a perfect pace. All around great song.  <br /> <br />Finally, Hold out your hand is one of the best closers I've ever heard. The songs just keeps building on itself, and towards the end it all comes together for a wonderful outro. Song construction at it's finest.  <br /> <br />Overall, the more I listen the more I agree, this could be nickelback's best release to date. I still love \\"silver\\" and \\"road\\", but this is just a genius record. A must for any rock fan. <br /> <br />Ps. alot of people believe the 2002's re-issue of curb is nickelback's first record. It's not. It's actually a collection of b-sides and early recordings, and honestly, it kinda sucks. As a huge fan, who has the record, I wouldn't have felt bad aboutpassing on it. So again, the state is nickelbacks first offical record, not curb. And what a record it is...

0393324818|5.0|I was surprised by how sophisticated baseball has become with the application of measurement in some areas and by a few teams.  For example, Michael Lewis described how a TV camera from center field was able to evaluate a hitter's performance by marking out the strike zone on the screen and identifying areas in the strike zone where he was unable to hit. <br /> <br />More interesting to me was the modeling that the Oakland A's were able to do to predict success over a season. They were able to predict the number of runs that needed to be scored in order to win a pennant and then determine the staff that would be able to produce that number of runs on the basis of performance metrics. <br /> <br />While it may sound dull to many people, i.e., modeling performance, Michael Lewis was able to present the statistical basis clearly in a manner that wasn't oft putting within a story line that maintains interest. I read the book in a little over a day. <br /> <br />While the book is about how the perceptions of old line baseball people is often wrong and that Billy Bean was able to introduce more accurate statistical methods to value player, it also has value for businesses.  Some the errors made by other businesses would benefit from the methods used by the Oakland A's in pursuing success in baseball. <br /> <br />

B000AADYRQ|2.0|Im so sick of hearing the constant, \\"they were on the OC\\" mumble jummble. This isnt about anything except music. DCFC seems bored. So bored they use the same damn sounding piano in almost every song. Its so formulaic it makes me sick. Aside from \\"Different Names For The Same Thing\\" (which really isnt that good either), The Album is such a stinker. But I feel as if I can let this one slide under the radar. Maybe try and forget it was ever released or maybe it never even happened. The bottom line here really is, If you are curious to hear what all the uproar is about. Dont listen to Plans. Go with one of the bands great albums they did before this catastrophe, Because listening to Plans will ruin the whole DCFC of old.

Mostly everytime you buy a CD, they would be a waste of money because there are about 10 songs that are horrible but this one by Evanescence is definitely worth the buy.
0307165485|4.0|Lovely, old-fashioned, traditional stories and rhymes.  Our little one loves the story of Little Bear. We have to read it each night before she goes to sleep.<br /><br />This book is great value and, is as nice for me to read as it is for my daughter to listen to.
0440419514|1.0|I'd like to offer a bit of dissent from all the raves concerning the Dark Materials trilogy. <br /> <br />Let's begin at the beginning.  *The Golden Compass* is a work of true genius, sparkling with inventiveness and carrying the reader on through its essentially absurd plot (do you *really* believe that any eleven-year-old girl, no matter how precocious, could accomplish all those things?) with fine panache and an unflagging sense of wonder.  Don't stop to think, just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Lyra, the girl from the parallel universe, is out to save her father from the captivity of armored polar bears and at the same time free her friends from the diabolical experiments of the fiendish Mrs. Coulter.  What could be better? <br /> <br />Book Two, *The Subtle Knife*, jars us a bit by switching the viewpoint to our own world, where Will, a young lad about Lyra's age, also sets out on a quest to find his lost father.  Will is another full-fledged superkid, able to accomplish tasks that would daunt even Odysseus as he meets Lyra, interacts with all manner of bizarre beings and hops from world to world with tireless stamina. <br /> <br />Alas, Will is never quite as convincing as Lyra, perhaps because he's so thoroughly grounded in our own mundane world, perhaps because his beyond-adult courage, wisdom, endurance and innate nobility are so utterly over-the-top (far eclipsing even Lyra's astonishing talents) that they begin to test the boundaries of our suspension of disbelief.  Even James Bond was never this resourceful, and certainly never so remarkably articulate.  There are some things that just don't wash, even in a fantasy.  But all the same, there's action aplenty, and if you're not in too critical a frame of mind, *The Subtle Knife* makes for an enjoyable read. <br /> <br />But by Book Three, *The Amber Spyglass*, Pullman's characters and storylines begin to explode in all directions, leaving us to wonder just which of the many players we're supposed to be rooting for -- and why.  Multiple plotlines are fine, if they're kept within reason, but when the device is overdone, the reader becomes like a passenger on a fast-moving train, trying to look at all the passing landmarks but unable to concentrate on any of them long enough to really appreciate them.  Maybe it's simple authorial zeal; but then again, maybe it's to keep the reader from looking closely enough to spot the ever-multiplying logical inconsistencies. <br /> <br />Very quickly, the author's astonishing inventiveness begins to betray him as new concepts, magical gadgetry and otherworldly beings are piled on in such relentless layers that we very quickly reach the saturation point at which anything is possible and therefore nothing can any longer be surprising.  Worse, many of them seem to have been invented as mere devices for hauling the characters in and out of the latest alarming predicament.  Does the Intention Craft, to name just one, really have any purpose in the storyline other than to give Mrs. Coulter a way to escape from Lord Asriel's fortress? <br /> <br />But most unforgivable of all, *The Amber Spyglass* is less of a novel than a thinly-fictionalized religious -- or should I say anti-religious? -- screed disguised as a fantasy novel.  For Lord Asriel's intention is nothing less than to slay God himself and leave the multiverse the exclusive property of its wise inhabitants.  This is somewhat complicated by the fact that God turns out to be nothing more than a drooling, withered, senile angel who gratefully evaporates when the two juvenile protagonists release him from his crystal life-support coffin, but Lord Asriel is undaunted.  After all, there's still God's Regent to contend with, a lustful angel with a name (\\"Metatron\\") that would hardly be out of place on a Japanese giant robot. <br /> <br />Of course with no God, there's always the thorny question of life after death, but militant atheist Pullman has an answer to that one, too.  There is neither Heaven nor Hell, but there is a sort of Homeric underground afterlife where the powerless, whispering shades of the dead go to mutter to each other while harpies mock them for their earthly shortcomings. <br /> <br />Not too appealing, you say?  Will and Lyra agree, and after the usual superhuman efforts, they descend into Hades and free the dead souls.  But being dead, after all, where can the shades go?  Why, to oblivion, of course!  They now have the option of choosing utter dissolution over an eternity of ghostly mediocrity, and just so we don't get the mistaken impression that this isn't really much of a choice, Pullman shows us that the dead are just deliriously happy to die for the second time, this time for keeps. <br /> <br />I single this oddity out as an example of the author's relentless atheistic digs not because it's unique but because it's simply one of so very many from which to choose.  Personally, I have no problem with atheists, but I can't abide *strident* atheists any more than I can abide strident religious fanatics, and *The Amber Spyglass* is one long atheist tract masquerading as a fantasy novel.  Again, I emphasize that both atheists and atheist novels per se are fine with me, but when the ideology starts to overwhelm the storyline, it's time to bail out.  Pullman's loathing of religion -- particularly Christianity, *most* particularly Roman Catholicism -- drips from every page, until even the most militant apostate is ready to scream \\"enough!\\" <br /> <br />Whatever the characters are fighting *for* in this great battle against the All-not-so-Mighty, isn't entirely clear, since the multiverse still seems to be an awfully bleak and unappealing place after the Dust finally settles.  It certainly isn't Love, because none of the couples in the trilogy -- be they Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, the homosexual angels (yes) Baruch and Balthamos, or Lyra and Will themselves -- are allowed to come to a non-tragic end after their travails.  In fact, poor Will and Lyra are cheated out of their hard-earned right to each other by a plot device so heavy-handedly contrived and artificial that we can only believe that the author was determined that there should be nothing remotely resembling anything as trite as a Happy Ending tainting the lunar landscape of his saga, no matter the cost to the readers' credibility.  The \\"tragic\\" ending to *The Amber Spyglass* isn't so much tear-jerky as simply jerky. <br /> <br />The *His Dark Materials* trilogy certainly is not, as the cover blurbs would have it, a new and formidable competitor to *Lord of the Rings*.  It is, in fact, a kind of antimatter version of C.S. Lewis' heavy-handedly preachy Narnia books, but sadly lacking any trace of Lewis' charm.  Fanatical Pullman fans will (and do) loudly proclaim that only \\"fundamentalist Christians\\" (aka \\"religious bigots\\") could possibly be disappointed with *The Amber Spyglass*, but in fact it's more like disappointment in a trilogy that begins so promisingly only to deteriorate into a rambling, unfocused, illogical rant in what should have been the climactic volume. <br /> <br />My recommendation: buy *The Golden Compass*, and enjoy it without hesitation.  If you feel that you absolutely *have* to see more of what's going on in Philip Pullman's sad multiverse, go ahead and get *The Subtle Knife*, too.  But unless you have an unslakable thirst for obsessive antireligious tracts wrapped up in grimly contrived fantasy trappings that fairly groan at their stretching seams (and I know there are many people out there who do), don't bother with *The Amber Spyglass*. <br /> <br />Well, if you *really* want to read it, I have a copy I'm willing to let go.  Cheap.
6305841861|5.0|This sequel to the cult classic film, Evil Dead, is the next installment into, what is praised to be, one of the goriest black comedy horror films to ever hit the film circuit. This film glorifies the very campy fun and essence of your typical B-movie plot, with a side of exaggerated amounts of cartoony violence and blood. Ash takes his girlfriend to a deserted cabin for a splendid weekend together of romance, but everything goes spiralling down into a blaze of horror as Ash idiotically finds a tape recording of a reading of, what is refered to as, &quot;The Book of the Dead.&quot; From here on, this is when the film picks up and the girlfriend goes missing after 'something in the woods' smashes through her window. The origin of the book is narrated in the first 2 minutes, and it almost takes and additional 3 minutes for the girlfriend to go missing. For the rest of the film, Ash battles the forces of evil that reincarnate themselves into everything, from huge trees to even small books. The film is hilarious, with its 'splatstick' humor that pays homage to the likes of The Three Stooges. The pop up scares are impeccable and are always right on target with their build ups. This is a fast, fierce, scary, and most of all, incredibly good humored work by Sam Raimi. I highly recommend this film to horror fans who love a good scare, but at the same time, don't mind laughing at the same time as they're doing so.
B000819PKC|5.0|i had known about jamiroquai before this summer, but for some reason i never really looked into them. i heard Seven Days in Sunny June though in Italy, and then i got hooked. i am totally in love with this new album, just because its got this great funky vibe. you find  yourself walking down the street strutting out to the beat. very groovy- i can totally feel it. to me- music is good if you can't help dancing or singing along to it. by that standard- this ablum is freakin awesome!
0670033375|4.0|Professor Diamond cites many factors on a vast subject, but there is another that makes ecological considerations almost meaningless; more on that later. Great care is required to define just what negative societal effects can be attributed to Earth cycles (with the door left open to those undiscovered) and what effects can be attributed to Man. Such intent doesn't stop mankind from moving forward, but can help us live in accordance with these cycles and our own nature as he says, permitting a better assessment of our impact and our changes.  <br /> <br />Weather was responsible for wiping out half the pilgrims; a hurricane and the tsunamis showed us how non-fragile the Earth actually is, but for all of the disasters that have demolished one civilization or another, nothing can compare to the recurring collapse of societies based on dishonest currency control. No popular book discusses it; Moral Armor is the only one that does.  <br /> <br />The key reason societies collapse is the mismanagement of human energy within those societies. Our Federal Reserve System has us paying interest on every dollar for its very existence, which translates into their inflation of $7 billion daily to pay the interest accruing at $1 billion daily, misallocating nearly half of our gross tax receipts to no one's benefit but the banks involved. Do you wonder why you get six calls a day telling you how you're pre-approved for loans and mortgages for way more than you should be? That's the six billion they have to get spent into the economy daily, which has caused our housing market bubble. If anything is putting America at risk, it is this.  <br /> <br />Environmental concerns play a part in civilization's challenges so by all means consider them, but no historical danger compares to unsound currency control, and it's remarkable that almost no one, not even the professors, knows anything about it. We are reaching the danger point in America, and only mass sentiment, developed through awareness of the problem, can change things. Save yourselves and your families. Learn the truth before it's too late. <br />
B000002G6J|5.0|This is a great background music CD.  At one point, during the dinner party, my friends and I looked at each other and asked \\"are they playing the SAME song over and over?\\" Maybe it was the wine??  :)
0316172324|3.0|Blink reminded me of what Bruce Lee had said: \\"Master the lessons in this book and then throw it away.\\" He meant that once you have it down, his fighting style is automatic; you no longer have to think about it, and the structure of thought is no different.  <br /> <br />Another book is relevant here; Moral Armor. Blink discusses cognitive action in slices; a better mind works with manageable slices while a slower mind attempts to work with too much information. Moral Armor describes the moral pattern of thought, which isolates its essential elements and makes decisions efficiently with an additional facet: complete moral certainty.  <br /> <br />In Blink, it is said that those at the top make decisions with much less information than one would suppose, but I'm inclined to think that like Bruce Lee, they have mastered their realm so completely that they can strike fast, precisely due to that prior foundation of experience.  <br /> <br />Perfect action in thought is based on Aristotelian logic, which is algebraic. Lethargic thought such as Blink's thick slices is evidence of a mind that cannot tell the difference between what is essential or inessential in any given context; such a person lacks a clear standard of value. In Moral Armor, that standard is shown to be life itself, where any speed of mind will reach the same end if only the way is known.  <br /> <br />I like both concepts. When you reach the point beyond all doubt that your moral course is correct--the point of total conviction by rational means--you become untouchable psychologically. To know what is right and how to get there, I'd love to get there in a Blink! <br />
B0006957SA|5.0|A great re-issue and all, but can someone explain why \\"South Australia\\" was taken from the middle of the album and placed at the very end, after the bonus tracks? (The same was done with \\"Pistol for Paddy Garcia\\" on the Rum, Sodomy and the Lash re-issue.)  This is somewhat annoying, and leaves me to use my CD player's programming function everytime I want to listen to the CD.  Why was this done?  The track is part of the album, isn't it--not a bonus track...?
0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith shows a very clear parallel between terrorist motivations and those of strictly observed Christian and Jewish doctrines. Showing direct quotes from the Koran and the Bible as well as their historic execution, the value of his evidence leaves few other rational conclusions to be drawn. Both tell us to kill anyone serving another god. Both say the penalty for any violation of their commandments is brutal torture and death. The individual is always devoured in a socially-based morality.  <br /> <br />To their intellectual and moral credit, most Christians, Jews and Muslims conveniently scuttle these biblical passages in favor of the contrarian passages which instill sound values. The true parallel is that civil people extract independent virtues from all available sources in order to live in peace, while fear-driven people use the barbaric passages as moral cover for their parasitical lifestyle, which itself is a result of their angst with effort and self-responsibility.  <br /> <br />The true key to moral clarity is to understand the motives of the individual--every individual--according not to his capacity to serve or defy God, but according to his adherence to the rational pattern of cognition; the pattern that leads to life. Moral Armor does just that, describing and extrapolating our pattern throughout individual, social, artistic and institutional action.  <br /> <br />The social goal of Mr. Harris and of all rational beings is to develop a world culture that respects and secures healthy coexistent activity between all, which is possible only through reason. What we have lacked up to this point is a fully-integrated morality based on the nature of Man, which we can understand and apply simply, quickly and without violence. That time has come. <br />
0688170528|5.0|What I loved about this book was the way Jodi Picoult developed characters through stories within stories and through dialogue.  She never told me, as the reader, what to think.  Instead, she led me on a journey and I was able to experience and care about Chris and Em in such a way that I yearned to know how their story ended almost as soon as it began.  I didn't find \\"The Pact\\" to be the tear-jerker that \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" was.  Nonetheless, I was intrigued by the subject matter (teen suicide/murder?) and felt that such a complex topic was handled delicately and realistically.  I strongly recommend this novel, even if this is your first experience with this author -- I think you will be glad that you discovered Picoult's talent.
0060537639|1.0|I was not expecting to believe all the claims in this book, though I was intrigued by the possibility of unexpected new findings about the age of exploration. The Europeans were clearly not the first to sail great distances and discover new lands. You would have once been dismissed as a crackpot for claiming that the Vikings reached the Americas 500 years before Columbus, but that's now accepted history. There's also plenty of proof that the Chinese were regularly sailing to the Middle East and East Africa centuries before Europeans could even leave their own shores. But this book, claiming that the Chinese momentously and influentially circumnavigated the globe in 1421-1423, is a disaster of hyperbolic claims and selective interpretation of historical evidence. That's because Gavin Menzies started with an idea, compiled evidence that seemed to point in the right direction, and convinced himself that he was finding mindboggling breakthroughs. But there is little reason for us to be as convinced as he is.<br /><br />You can see plenty of other reviews (here and elsewhere) debunking the many, many research errors committed by Menzies. Most of these criticisms are more believable to me than Menzies' assertions. On a higher level I'll add that Menzies is an unabashed member of the \\"incredible coincidence\\" school of history. In just a couple of examples, among multitudes, he claims that the presence of Asiatic birds in South America means \\"the conclusion is inescapable\\" of visiting Chinese sailors; or an ice-free depiction of Antarctica on a map \\"confirm[s]\\" that the Chinese were there during a January. Menzies also unquestioningly accepts Chinese court histories as accurate, without considering the possibility that they may be distorted by embellishments or state propaganda. The same goes for his faithful belief in the accuracy of folklore and oral histories. An especially damaging methodological error is that Menzies doesn't question the alleged years of origin of any of the maps he examines, which are of course mindblowingly and impossibly old. The Piri Reis map is the most important example, as there is much scholarly dispute (unacknowledged by Menzies) over whether this map really dates from 1513.<br /><br />There are surely many mysteries about the age of exploration, as compelling pieces of physical and anecdotal evidence give us plenty of reason to doubt accepted histories. But what makes this book such a failure is that Menzies has one grand answer for all unsolved mysteries - a single momentous Chinese expedition. Some other reviewers have made telling comparisons to the farcical \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" which does the same thing, except with spaceships and aliens.aps he examines, which are of course mindblowingly and impossibly old.

0156027321|1.0|Our book club selected this novel for the first meeting.  I am actually suprised that we ever met again, especially because I was the only one who finished. <br /> <br />When I asked for the book at the book store, the girl told me what a great book it was.  When I read reviews here (on Amazon), I read that it was wonderful.  At no point in the author's rambling about non-essential plot did I find \\"Life of Pi\\" to be anything short of awful.   <br /> <br />Long story short: when I finally finished, I closed the book and couldn't figure out what I had just read or why I had persisted in finishing it.  Lucky for me, the other book club members put the book down long before the end and we voted unanimously to give Book Club another shot -- no thanks to Pi. <br />
B0000CAXIC|5.0|These are the classics. Yes, the songs that so well defined my adolescents. Like, \\"My Hero\\", \\"Everlong\\", and \\"Monkey Wrench\\". I can still recall in vivid detail the first time I ever saw the music video for \\"My Hero.\\"  I remeber being blown away. The Foo Fighters are essential ninetys rock, and for those of us who have fond memeories of those days, The Colour and The Shape is an esstenial.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|DT wear their influences on their sleeves with this one, the aforementioned \\"U2\\" sounding song, the \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" intro of the last track, the \\"Tool Prison Sex\\" guitar intro, a few \\"Muse\\" and \\"Placebo\\" vocal stylings and harkenings back to segments of songs from previous albums. They venture dangerously close to christian rock schmaltz with cringey lyrics here and there but just get away with it. There's also plenty of cool full-on diddly muso bits. LaBrie's vocals sound good again this time (I no like SDOIT). <br />There is more musical variety than TOT's metal with each member having a chance to colour the music, even if some bits are a bit middle of the road.  <br />I like it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series and I think the people who canceled this series are seriously ill and lacking in intellect.  I am thrilled there is a movie coming the end of this very month and my dream is there will be a new series to follow! <br />The characters are well matched; the dialogue is quick,funny, and while I would like more science the story line is good enough to let that pass. <br />I would highly recommend.
B0002OERI0|1.0|OMG this is da best album ever! It's soo heavy and brutal it makes metal bands seem girly. Green Day is far better than that Boysetsfire band that someone in one of my classes listens to. Green Day 4-eva!! Boysetsfire neva!    (If you believed my sarcasm, then you must have an IQ lower than the number of tracks on this cd. Bathory's Sainthood by Boysetsfire is better than anything that Green Day has ever wrote. Boysetsfire rocks!)
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I just got this CD, based on the great reviews it got, and I gotta say, the reviewers don't lie, this cd is really that good. One change, for me at least, is from Wishmaster, things have changed completely. It's the same vocals and all, but now the band is backed by an expansive orchestra this time(least to my knowledge, as was said, I'm not a hardcore Nightwish fan). <br /> <br />If I had to say why this CD rocks, I'd have to point out a few tracks. In fact, one of the best tracks, comes at the start of the CD. \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\" is a fantastic song, and a perfect example of how good rock and an orchestra can pair up, for a one hell of an experience. Other examples are \\"Nemo\\" and \\"Planet Hell\\" but also \\"Ghost Love Score\\", which is a beautifully haunting song. However, if I could make one comment, it would be that the other version of \\"Nemo\\" should have been on here, as it is just leagues beyond anything out there. <br /> <br />I still have to recommend this one, if for nothing else then the tracks I mentioned, but also, my favorite track \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\".
0783114222|5.0|I, as I am sure anyone else who watches this mini-series, knows the JFK speech at the beginning of every episode by heart that is blended in with the magnificent score. Those combined give you visions of hopes, dreams and promises of the young space program's race to the moon against the Soviets. You are cheating yourself if you don't watch Tom Hanks' wonderful compilation. There are just days on the weekends where I watch certain episodes of this over and over and over again! Even the episode about the geologist who trains the astronauts was wonderful. (Considering how boring geology is to me, that's saying something.)      Although I didn't think I'd have the stomach to watch the Apollo One episode about the launch pad accident with Astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee since the died so horribly but I'm glad I did.  The struggle and the heartache that everyone involved with the testing went thru  was priceless and informative. (Boy, Walter Mondale pissed me off in that one!) The whole program came so close to collapsing that it's scary.      My favorite episode is between \\"1968\\" which was extraordinary, \\"Spider\\" and the one about the Wives.  I specifically enjoyed \\"1968\\" because I vividly remember that year.  (My mother knew Dr. Martin Luther King) and we were living at Camp Lejeune where some of my friend's fathers were due to go to Vietnam.  Not to mention when Kennedy was shot and there were riots and protests about everything (Race and the war, etc.) Somehow I don't remember the pass around the moon  (I think I was still on my Christmas high) but this episode was edited so wonderfully with it's intense and fast moving images that it portrayed the year much like it happened, one catastrophe after another from January thru to December.  They really did \\"Save 1968\\".  The acting by Tim Daly, David Andrews and  Robert John Burke when they first saw the earth rise when orbiting the moon was thrilling.  You could feel the excitement  and the score was magnificent.(How weird that all three of them were featured in Stephen King movies. \\"Storm of the Century, Graveyard Shift and Thinner respectively)    The score for \\"Spider\\" alone makes me yearn for a decent soundtrack to this mini-series, it was just magical.  (If you're thinking about buying the CD.....DON'T, believe me you'll regret it)  The acting was sedate and understated, but also comedic which were all appropriate for this episode.  The tension and frustration of building something that had never been built before IN TIME for the scheduled Apollo mission (which wasn't accomplished by the way)  was conveyed effortlessly it seemed .  All of the different episodes were entwined like threads of a rope and yet were fitted like the symbolic separate pieces of sculpture of the God Apollo behind Tom Hanks at the top of each episode. As he narrates each episode and walks forward the sculpture comes together to form one complete sculpture. (You have to see this part to understand the symbolism)  The flaws that held up the mission in \\"Spider\\" rearranged the missions so that the crew of Apollo 8 in \\"1968\\"episode were able to end that year on a much needed high note.  The little details like those that tell this tale make this a masterpiece!  This is why you should watch every episode as the characters float in and outside of their own episodes adding nuances and insights to each different story just like in real life.  But each episode stands alone on it's own merits too which makes this Brilliant!!   BRAVO TOM HANKS, you preserved our Apollo missions beautifully!!
0679737456|4.0|<br />  This review is for the students.  The title of the book is Black Ice and the author of the book is Lorene Cary.  To me I say this book was very interesting.  The reason why was interesting, because it talked about how blacks and whites used to be segregated.  They were both segregated and both races were treated differently.  For example, the whites had better facilities then the blacks.  That is why I thought the novel was interesting, but others who might have read this book over the summer maybe they did not think this book was as interesting. Therefore, I say this book is not made for everyone to read the masterpiece, just because one person may like the book does not mean that everyone likes the story.  If someone who has not yet read the novel but would like to it would be better if they asked someone who has already read the book if the text would be a good novel for them to read or not to read.  The student who has not yet read the publication would need to know what the text is about so they can determine if they would like to read the novel or not read it. <br />  The students who may like to read about how people different races are treated differently.  They might like to read this novel to learn more about all of their backgrounds. <br />
0316168815|5.0|I wasnt sure what to think about this book when I ordered it. It wasnt anything like the normal true crime or romance novels I usually read. As I began to read it, it immediately captured my interest. I was facinated by the characters view of heaven and perspective from heaven. It was a refreshing change from what I normally read. I still think about this story often. it is just an excellent book all around!
0393039765|5.0|The book was amazing, if you havn't read it, what are you waiting for? After reading this I couldn't stop reading his other books like Choke, Lulluby, and Invisible Monsters.  <br />Now, the movie's ending I though was better, even Chuck did. (Watch the commentary) The book had some good scenes that I would've loved to see in the movie, but they didn't include to finish it off. Chuck is such a good writer and this, his first novel, proves it.

B000006O7C|4.0|Jeff Buckley's tragic death in May 1997 left millions of fans and admirers wondering, \\"What would've come next?\\"  After Jeff's debut, Grace, it seemed like anything could be in the works for his next album, and three years passed with little definitive new material from the painstaking artist.  His death only ensured that no definitive new recordings would EVER surface - but, thankfully, he left behind a treasure trove of nearly-completed songs that, in my opinion, were more than ready for release.  Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk shows that Jeff's talent was growing and changing in new ways that would've likely gotten him a far larger audience than Grace's quirky experimentation did. <br /> <br />The first disc consists of studio demos done with Jeff's band and producer Tom Verlaine.  These recordings are nearly release-quality; the sound is very good, although the vocal takes are not quite as perfect as Jeff doubtless would have preferred.  The sound of the material is less distinctive than on Grace; it's a bit more in the alternative vein of the 90's, with a large hint of Buckley-style melodicism thrown in.  The material is also not as varied as Grace, but especially lyrically, Jeff was headed in new directions.  \\"The Sky is a Landfill\\" contains apocalyptic lyrics which are visionary, as opposed to the heavy romanticism often found on Grace.  In my opinion, the lyrics are more mature on this record, and perhaps more focused.  It's stuff that would've definitely gotten large amounts of radio airplay, and had it been released in '97, would've no doubt been given credit for influencing the post-alternative scene of the late 90's.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 consists of home recordings of Jeff trying some pretty wild things, as well as a few better-recorded ditties.  \\"New Year's Prayer\\" and \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\" are also on this 2nd disc, in largely recreated form.  The middle portion of the disc contains really strange, atonal stuff that sounds kind of like Sonic Youth; the noisy break in the middle of \\"So Real\\" on Grace is nothing compared to the noise-art that fills \\"Murder Suicide Meteor Slave\\" and \\"Demon John\\".  I'm not a fan of the middle of this disc, but at the end, what would've been Jeff's next signature cover, \\"Satisfied Mind\\", wraps things up in a typically engaging solo Buckley performance reminiscient of \\"Hallelujah\\" off of Grace. <br /> <br />If you already have Grace, Sketches is an excellent overview of what the next album from Buckley might've sounded like.  If you are new to Buckley, I would pick up Grace first, because it's really what his legacy is all about, at least as far as definitive work goes.  However, this compilation serves as proof that Jeff Buckley was far more than a one-album wonder and instead was a truly visionary, passionate, and talented musician and artist.
B000002JAX|4.0|Peyroux is not a household name, and it is unlikely that she'll ever be one.  But her voice, her style, and her presentation are singular and spectacular at once.  This CD answers every issue that a singer must answer--if he or she has the gusto and the talent to spit against the wind.  Her music isn't mainstream, nor is her fertile voice; but peyroux will dazzle you with her melodic conveyances until the CD stops spinning.

B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson has encountered a few obstacles in the last twenty or so years, but his legend will forever live in those who remember. In late 1982, Michael Jackson became the next biggest thing to Elvis and The Beatles. \\"Thriller\\" was phenomenal and racked up seven hit singles, over 50 million worldwide sales, crossed and even created musical borders, created the most memorable R&B song in \\"Billie Jean\\". Yes...it is THAT good, and it is powered by the one and only voice of Michael, the powerhouse production of Q, and outstanding backing musicians. Michael didn't just get lucky with \\"Thriller\\". He knew what he was doing. We were lucky to get \\"Thriller\\".

0451526384|4.0|If you're interested in reading some Austen and haven't before, I would recommend you read Persuasion first as it is the quickest read and, in some ways, the most fulfilling (I know that's subjective!). But I found this book SO \\"lovely\\" and much more fast-paced and intriguing than some of Austen's others. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite by far, but this is a great second. The characters are fabulously complex with the frustrating exterior of serenity. Also, if you are interested: there are some great commentaries on women's position in society during the 19th century in Britain which I found so interesting. Specifically a conversation toward the end in the final party!  <br /> <br />If you love this book, or other Austens, READ READ READ Reading Lolita in Tehran. It's fabulous and makes Austen so much more interesting and intellectual!

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|To fans of the first album, the most obvious thing that they notice about this record is it is A LOT more mainstream than the debut.  I'm not sure why the band decided to move in the direction they did but they can't be blamed for wanting to try something else.  As great as the debut was, if a band delievers album after album of the same type of material, it grows stagnant.  There has to be room allowed for change and/or growth and I think many fans of the debut were so in love with that record that they didn't want anything to change. <br /> <br />But the question is, did what 30STM change into improve upon what they were? <br /> <br />Well, yes and no. <br /> <br />If you're looking for radio-ready, highly melodic and tightly constructed songs, then this album tops the original.  However, a lot of the originality and creative songwriting from the first album is largely missing here.  While I can't say that I listened to the debut thinking each song could easily be a hit, I was constantly surprised by the paths that the songs went down.  That's not really the case this time.  While the songs on 'A Beautiful Lie' are oftentimes pretty close to great and highly memorable, they are not particulary surprising or original.   <br /> <br />But it's a give and take; song after song on 'A Beautiful Lie' could easily top Modern Rock playlists and charts across the country.  \\"Attack\\"?  Hit.  \\"The Kill\\"?  Hit.  \\"A Beautiful Lie\\"?  Hit.  \\"From Yesterday\\"?  HUGE hit.  I don't think there has been a rock album this year containing this many memorable songs.  I also don't recall listening to any of the songs from the first album 10 times in a row, like I have for 'The Kill'. <br />While I respect the craft and artistry that went into the songs on the debut more than I do than the songs on 'A Beautiful Lie', I admit, I don't think I enjoyed the debut right off the bat as much as I did this album.  But, what you hear with the songs on 'A Beautiful Lie' is pretty much what you get, they don't reveal any hidden complexitites like 'Buddha For Mary' or 'End of The Beginning' did. <br /> <br />Once again, the band plays well and Leto's voice is top-notch throughout although his lyrics have suffered and fallen into generalities.  As a result, they have lost some of the appeal they had on the debut album.  There are also some really subtle keyboard parts that add a lot to the songs they appear in. <br /> <br />To summarize, this is one rock album that does indeed rock, and while the songwriting isn't as creative or original as it was on the debut, that type of songwriting has been traded for songs that are more 'hit'-oriented and more insantly accessible and memorable.  It's better than most rock records on the market right now and should definitely be picked up. <br /> <br />P.S. - Any band that covers Bjork deserves some extra credit.

0060922583|3.0|This book starts nicely with quantum and other physics theories. It provides the brief description of the holographic theory. Unfortunately, it then plunges into accounts of paranormal, both historic and experienced directly by the author.  <br /> <br />Each account is mapped to the holographic theory the book began with. And it mostly along the lines: happened in the year xxxx, can't be explained by anything we know...but wait, if we apply the holographic theory it all becomes clear. And on and on and on. <br /> <br />The actual accounts of paranormal and how they can be explained occupy about 3/4 of the book. I got tired and bored reading all these. There is no real information or analysis in these 3/4. I would prefer if the author elaborated on the holographic theory and its implications. I believe there are better books to read on the subject and I am going to look them up.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I took a risk when I bought this movie but, in the end, I found out it was a great choice. I had only seen about the last 15 minutes of it, but decided the rest would be as great as the end. And it was. It's one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again and find new things in it. A really well written and creative script teams with a great cast with wonderful performances. For me, it's a great movie. For others, just a weird experiment. But it's up to you, watch it and make your own conclussions.
B00003CX9E|3.0|I guess that I am one of those who fall into the camp of Citizen Kane was a great movie but its not the be all and end all movie of film history. Considering the time and technology available Orson Welles did a brillant job on William R. Hearst.  <br />  I shall also acknowledge that it took a lot of guts on the part of all hands involved to go up against the old boy. But they did and made a great film.  <br /> But I still find it a dated film that covers a period of history that really does not move me like the American Civil War did or some other periods of our nations history. Altogether I rather watch \\"Casablanca\\",\\"The Day the Universe Changed\\" or Ken Burns \\"The Civil War\\".
0345442970|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Star Wars movies and I was hungry to learn more about the worlds, characters, species, and interim events of this spectacular epic. So, I started reading the novels in chronological order, beginning with Cloak of Deception. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />Although I believe anyone can enjoy this novel, knowing the movies in and out makes reading this that much better. I was pleased to see the author delve into Chancellor Valorum's background, and describe what events occurred that eventually led to his political demise. Plus, to see how Senator Palpatine won the hearts and commitment from other members of the Galactic Senate made his meteoric rise to power in Episode I make that much more sense. And I couldn't help but smile when the dubious Wilhuff Tarkin was introduced into the mix of things. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give too much away. <br /> <br />In short, if you are a person who loves Star Wars, likes novels centered around politics, or just digs a good adventure, read Cloak of Deception. I couldn't put it down, and I'd be willing to bet that you won't be able to either. May the Force be with you!

B000003S0D|4.0|'Lizard' is King Crimson's third or possibly their fourth album and contrary to some other reviewers, I really believe it is superior to the albums which came before it. I specifically recall listening to this one for a much longer time than the earlier releases when it came out in 1970.<br /><br />King Crimson is one of the better of the second British Invasion bands, along with Yes, Pink Floyd, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, who built on the success with remakes of classical music done by Procol Harum, The Nice, and The Moody Blues.<br /><br />On this album, they crib one of the most popular pieces of classical music, Raval's Bolero, which was actually composed as an experiment by Raval to see how long he could draw out a very simple musical phrase. Who know what a monster hit it would become!!!<br /><br />I confess that part of my attraction to this album is the better than average cover art which, on the original LP was delivered with a high quality plastic veneer.<br /><br />Among albums done at the same time, in the same style, this one stands a little above the crowd, somewhat below Emerson Lake and Palmer's first album and Pink Floyd's best efforts.
B000002UAU|5.0|Allow me to start this review by saying that four years ago i would have laughed at the thought that a Beatles album would be in my top 5 albums of all time(i thought they were just another 60's-70's pop band, and i listened to a LOT of metal).But then I was naive musically back then, now it's no surprise to me. <br /> <br />Sgt. Peppers is a classic album, by definition for a few reasons: Firstly, there are some recording and mixing techniques used on this album which had never been used before. For instance, one quirk that always makes this album a little crazier to listen to is that the drums are entirely panned to one speaker, and almost everything else is on the other. I often find myself trying to balance it by shifting my head around...you cant help it sometimes. <br /> <br />However, I love this album for more than the way it is mixed and produced. The overall feel of the album is that it is one large, slightly quirky stage show, represented by the album, as a single unitary musical piece. The opening with \\"Sgt. pepper's\\" and the closing with the reprise of the same number help with this.Somehow the songs seem to fit in a logical order so you can just play the whole album through. <br /> <br />Aside from this, there are some trippy songs on this album, and even the way the songs are ordered blows my mind sometimes. After the intro, you get \\"with a little help..\\" , which is an ok song (I'm not a huge fan of Ringo's singing...come to think of it, his drumming isn't always amazing either) followed by \\"it's getting better\\". This song is decievingly pop sounding at first, and admittedly is one of the more mainstream on the album, but halfway through the song, in a bridge you hear a crazy skillsaw sound that just destroys the pop feel of the song. This is followed by \\"fixing a hole\\", which is a nice song. Then the beatles start to blow your mind - \\"lucy in the sky...\\" kicks in. We all know what the song's about, but just listening to this song is sort of like slipping into a hallucinogenic daydream.  <br /> <br />the next important part of the album for me, is tracks 7 and 8. \\"Being for the benefit of Mr. kite\\" is quite simply a spinning circus song. The beatles go out of their way to put you in a circus production, and it works. \\"Within you, without you\\" is for me the pick of the album. The first time i listened to it, just hearing this eastern influenced spiritual-philosophical melody ON A POP ALBUM absolutely blew my mind.There is no other way to put it, and there is no other band that could get away with this, and  make it sound good. <br /> <br />The remainder of the album is a more gentle closing of the album sequence, starting with another favourite of mine \\"when im 64\\", followed by \\"good morning good morning\\" the afore mentioned reprise and \\"a day in the life\\".  <br /> <br />Looking back on this review, I've talked a lot about how the album feels. We all know john is an amazing guitarist, george is one of the most underrated bassists ever, and paul has an amaizng voice - these guys know how to write an album, it was never a debate over that.Desribing this album by the way it feels really is the only way to describe it for me, as that is what makes it so great. The album as a whole is a daydream with john, george, paul and ringo as your tour guides. They show you some amazing sights, and as the album draws to an end, they let you know its time to go, and slowly wander off to leave you sitting amazed, and completely satisfied with the album. <br /> <br />I can understand people disliking this album; it is not for everyone.But if you're one of those people who is really a child at heart, and loves nothing more than to escape from the real world if only for a little while, i recommend this album, because that's what it does for me.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow, I remember back when I was at least 13 and first listened to this joint. It still brings back a lot of memories in my life, some good and some bad ones. Eminem as a song writer, touched a lot of us out there, going through tough times and growing up in this crazy world almost as he did. Not every star has the best childhood you know and that's where his intense motivation comes from when you listen to this album.<br /><br />The rhymes were solid and you could rewind it over and over, always finding something new. The beats supplied by Dr. Dre, Mel-Man and a few other notable contributors were the 2nd most important pieces as well. Almost everything fits in place and all the tracks flow nicely, a few of the skits on here sound a bit silly and dated, though. Even if the song \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" may feel out of place, it still fits nicely with the album's demented portrait. The general feel of this album is dark, which I also enjoy the most. Real life isn't all colorfully painted with happy backgrounds and Eminem guides us into just the opposite on this LP with top-notch delivery, lyrics and flow.<br /><br />It would be hard to pin-point the favorite tracks because in my opinion, they are meant to be played from start to finish to get the overall feel. So, here's a quick run down of the notable tracks: Of course you have the break-through \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" single, the vicious \\"The Way I Am\\", the deep \\"Stan\\", the thoughts about today's youth \\"Who Knew\\", the fierce \\"Remember Me\\", the classic \\"I'm Back\\", the most notorious \\"Kill You\\" opener and so on.<br /><br />But honestly, Who doesn't own this album already? 9 million copies sold, this CD is probably in everyone's collection by now. It's not only about Hip Hop, in my opinion, I think this opens the door to a lot of other open-minded thinkers as well. If you're up to it, give the album a shot if you haven't already.

0385486804|4.0|I read this book in about a day and a half- I simply couldn't put down the haunting story of Chris McCandless.  It is rare to find a true story so utterly compelling.  I enjoyed how Krakauer not only told the tale of McCandless's journey around the country and into the Alaskan wilderness, but I found it even more interesting when Krakauer added a bit of his own history to the narration. <br /> <br />I think that no matter where you came from or who you are, everyone can identify with Chris McCandless in some capacity, which is why this story is so intriguing.  I would recommend this book to any and all of my friends.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I love horror, kung-fu and cartoons. This movie delivers in all three of those categories. I originally rented the imported version with English subtitles. I watched it at least 3 times. When the English version came out, I rented that as well and watched it at least twice. The English version appears to be edited a bit. Less blood and gore, which kind of stinks. I'm not sure if that is a Blockbuster thing, or if all versions are like that. Either way, it's still a great movie.<br /><br />Be ready for serious cheese. If you like Braindead(Dead Alive), Jackie Chan movies, Evil Dead, and any cartoons, you will dig this movie.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Director Ridley Scott has made a movie about dying that lives up to its subject: two of his leading actors died, one before finishing his performance and another following the completion of his. For these two old hard-drinking friends, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, \\"Gladiator\\" was their final film. How fitting that they have left us in a popular movie of astonishing scope and splendor.    \\"Gladiator\\" is a savage sword-and-sandal spectacle (it revived the genre), a rumination on the politics of then and now, a chronicle of dysfunctional royalty, and a revenge tragedy that turns into a happy family reunion in Heaven. Cecil B. DeMille would have given his last bullhorn to have made this movie, but he lacked the skill and artistic sensibility which Scott has in abundance.    Not that DeMille would have fancied the Freudian dynamic of the script, but neither was he the storyteller that Scott is. In relinquishing power, an aging Roman emperor (Harris) bypasses his son (Joaquin Phoenix) for a popular general (Russell Crowe) to rule the empire as a republic. After an act of patricide, the son later sums up his dilemma: \\"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire.\\"    As the general-cum-gladiator, Crowe commands the screen impressively and got an Oscar for it. Phoenix gives the most complex performance and should have won one (he was nominated); Connie Nielsen, as his wary sister, spends most of the movie dodging his incestuous advances. Derek Jacobi seems to have been born a Roman senator. There isn't a weak performance in the picture and several are outstanding, including those by Harris and Reed.    Computer graphics provide some of the most mind-boggling images ever created: amassed warriors on battlefields, bustling streets of the ancient world, sweeping views of cityscapes and landscapes, and a Forum overview that includes the entire Coliseum; when gladiators enter it, the camera completely circles them, giving us an eye-popping view of the huge interior crowded with Romans screaming for blood.     Scott has an artist's eye for composition and juxtaposition. He knows when to pull his camera back, when to thrust forward. The production design, art direction, costuming and music for this movie are brilliant, as this extended DVD version attests. The supplements on the three discs are generous and non-repetitive, and the extra 17 minutes of footage deepen and finish the film.     \\"Gladiator\\" is an intimate epic, if there can be such a thing, and a large scale piece of big box office entertainment. Is there anything the movies can't do?

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is by far, the most exciting and one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.    However, it is a funny cartoonish movie. So those very few who only want to see real kick or think heroes should always act cool may find this is not the move for them.    I'm going to give few of my points about how serious this movie is made, behind its funny and cartoonish look.    1. Story line is easy to follow and easy to understand, but actually its structure is more complicate than most people thought. The story is composite by three parts: The conflict between Axe Gang and Pig Alley, the Sing's story and the love story between Sing and the mute girl. The Axe Gang and pig alley part is straight forward, but the Sing's part is backward by recall his past little by little. And the hearty love story pined 3 parts together and gives the ending. Very clever and well constructed.    2. The director use camera to explain details rather than just speak out by actor/actress. For example, when the two musician assassins first tuning their instrument, you notice small things in surrounding start to \\"off\\", and as the music goes to intense, you realize the potential of its power.  Most movies today has some one like Q in James Bond series to reveal you those gadgets, this movie does not do the same.    3. Music in the movie is well composed. It tells the story too. Take the Axe Gang music for example, there is some thing sounds like people laughing. This music is played every time when Axe Gang appears. At the beginning of movie, it feels like the Axe Gang are very success and laughing at others. But when they are defeated by two masters and Brother Sum's hair is on fire in the midle of the film, the music sounds extremely funny like laughing at themselves.      There are many more than this, but you can find clues in other reviews. So this is all I want to say.  Oh, and don't forget to select original Chinese language, the sound actors of English language don't perform well in myopinion. So leasten to Chinese is better since the camera will guide you most of the time, and the subtitle is easy to read.
B000089CJI|5.0|Very few albums can grab your atention and maintain it even after it is finished, an album filled with songs that you will find singing to yourself for appearently no reason at all during random times of the day, an album that is brilliant in its simplicity that it reminds you that great music is still being made - especially in a time where most music has become so far beyond pointless ventures in marketing; The Postal Service has created such an album. Brimming with catchy, well written songs, 'Give Up' may be the most basic and bare bones pop album recorded in recent time. Sweet, simplistic synth lines and dreamy drum programming permeated by the hypnotic vocals of Ben Gibbard creates an album that has the power to kill off all of the anoying trends that have been popping up all over the place. Each song is simply divine, each having their own point and purpose. Sespite some songs' rather hefty themes, none seem to become bogged down into deep songs of depression and protest, all staying true to 'Give Up's pure, light, pure pop enjoyment. The Postal Service has given us an album that both enchants and keeps the listeners attention and admiration for as long as their ears continue to work.<br /><br />9.5 / 10

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't overstate the quality of this series.  I simply cannot believe this series did not continue.  I was given the DVD set to watch from a friend, and after I watched it twice, I bought my own copy.  The character development is well-paced through the season, the dialogue is outstanding, the wit and comedy are crisp, wonderful acting, and it's all put into a backdrop of \\"wild west\\" in space, with no silly aliens or prosthetic foreheads but real stories and no half-way, cut for television \\"let's keep it PG\\" issues. I actually waited to see this series because I'm not a fan at all of Buffy or Angel (which I believe are terribly written), but this series is one of the most intelligent, gritty series I've ever seen, and I regret I hadn't seen it sooner. <br /> <br />With Serenity (the movie) coming out, I hope somehow this series gets a jump start, but from what I've read, Universal's agreement with Fox to make the movie forbids this.  <br /> <br />In any case, this is a bunch of characters you'll fall in love with.
0066620996|1.0|A friend of mine met with Mr. Collins during an interview with the president of his company. I had the opportunity to tag along.  Jim states that, \\"The best bosses are self-effacing and modest,\\" however, he lacks both of these qualities. The solutions that he proposes in his book are, to say the least, blatantly obvious. Also, his personality is so transparent and phony that one wonders how he came to be one of the top best-selling authors. His business that he talks of so lovingly, his a team of crack researchers who investigate what makes a business great. The fact that a man can make money off of what is in plain site in Corporate America is sickening.  <br /> <br />When a man's life and image are so closely controled by his profession that he has to project that image by being an avid ROCK CLIMBER, all I need to say is give me a break. However, if you're all for BS and mindless ranting, than this is the book for you. You'll love learning all of his cool acronyms including BHAG and his ever popular Hedgehog theory. Oh, yeah...great read...couldn't put it down.  <br /> <br />In all honesty, if you're an employer. Treat your workers like they're a second family. Reward them when things go well. Don't just buy them all a copy of this drivel. The atmosphere in the office will be all the better. <br /> <br />In conclusion, you don't make money off of the book you wrote.  You make money (too much money I might add) off of the companies that want to meet with you and bask in your glory.
B000777J2S|5.0|This is the kind of disc I know I will be listening to for decades to come. There isn't much more I can add except that I can't stop telling people about this CD ever since I purchased it. Compared to the first disc Antony released, this one seems to have gone a step further.  There are no hard edges here and only pure unadulterated expression.
B0000013GT|5.0|the title of this review may confuse you but i can honestly say this is the weakest outkast album. that dont mean nuthin tho, cos its still a 5 star classic, its just that their other albums are better musically and lyrically. this aint slouchin though. if you got all the other outkast albums and not this, you definetly need to get it. if you want the best kast joint then get aquemini first, then southernplayalisticadillacmuzik then get the rest. this was kasts transitional period between old skool southern sh*t and eclectic crazy musical, lyrical perfection. its dope but kast had funk on their debut, funky musical progression on their third and an extension of that on stankonia. speakerboxxx and love below is dope too but it also proves that both emcees are better together <br />p.s. <br />outkast is my favorite artists and aquemini is my favorite album of all time
B0000640VO|5.0|A great movie if you don't mind reading english subtitles.  I always like romantic comedies but I noticed that the recent Hollywood romantic comedies were getting boring.  Amelie is fresh and different. Nominated for five academy awards and I can't believe it didn't win a single award.  One of the most popular movie in Europe and I can understand why.  If you feel depressed and have a need to feel happy, then this movie is recommended.
B00005JL1C|5.0|Okay, so we all know the old formula--especially back in the 80s:  Boy wants girl who's out of his league while girl he only sees as a friend or doesn't know exists wants him.  Sometimes the genders were reversed.  Always, in 80s teen flicks, we see the same self-important oh-mi-gawd-type characters fill the screen in their high fashion and high hair.  Unlike so many of the decade's movies, however, this one is more timeless than, say, Sixteen Candles or Pretty in Pink which are very much of their time.<br /><br />What makes this movie effective more than John Hughes' direction or the script are very strong performances by some very talented young people.  The triangle of Eric Stolz as Keith, Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, and Lea Thompson as Amanda Jones gels on every level and breathes life into a script that might not have taken off with any other combination of the day's most popular teen actors.  It simply worked, and that is that.  If you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to check it out rather than give much away.  It is worth your time, and it will make you smile as much as it will move you.  I'm not saying this just because the movie is from my decade; it's truly a classic across the board, relatable regardless of gender or age, and definitely NOT a waste of your time.

0812932293|4.0|This is certainly a collection of amusing anecdotes. It'd be hard to find anyone who's led a more interesting or varied life. <br /> <br />Branson's stories of the music business, the days of \\"free love\\" in London, the many times when his businesses were within inches of going bust, the branching out from music to airlines, and the brushes with death in his ballooning and boating adventures. All of these add up to an amazing set of experiences. <br /> <br />My only comment was that they add up to a great collection of stories, but all are brushed over at a high level. So while they're a lot of fun to read, you'd have to search elsewhere for deeper lessons to be learned. This isn't a criticism, only a comment -- they obviously were going for enjoyable memoirs here. <br /> <br />Having said that, I certainly dug this book! If there's any lesson I took, it's that you can only make your mark by following your own muse and your own direction, and by pushing aside what you're \\"supposed\\" to do. Branson may have gotten lucky a few times, but he's certainy demonstrated that maxim in his own life.
0684803356|1.0|Well, I read a short-novel by Hemingway in junior high and thought it was really well written and interesting. So, as Hemingway is considered a great writer, I thought it was time to read one of his novels. I've read my share of war-novels. and this isn't a good one. for many reasons. the language. the history. the persons described (how one-dimensional can a person in a novel get?).  <br /> <br />the novel can be summed up thus: \\"i am a man, a silent, authentic man, a man who drinks for sorrow and a man who sleeps with women for joy and a man who loves violence for its own sake - allthough im saying something else to myself... to myself, a man. a silent man. a man who doesn't swear in front of the mucks of spaniards, the spaniards who fight. who fight for justice. i am a man who fights for justice. i love this woman - i truly love thee oh my spanish fullbreasted slim woman - till the earth moves, the earth did move - did it really move? yeah, it moved, it moved for me, the silent man - who still loves to drink and swear and sleep with women and shoot. yeah, me.\\" <br /> <br />And why couldn't hemingway just call robert jordan robert - i know it's robert he's talking about even if he doesn't write robert jordan. which he does. all the time. give me a break. <br /> <br />but what else could I expect from a man who went out all alone in a boat with a single gun to hunt down german u-boats... <br />

B00000AFWZ|3.0|For me, as I was in my teens when these songs arised, this is a goldmine of memories. Tried this and that in those years with the music all around. Many of these tracks never found their way to Sweden though, but I enjoy listening to the typical sound of the times. A little disappointing that  the tracks seem to be all mono(?). I am sure that there were some stereo tracks around at this time.

To think that someone would actually spend money on this is beyond me, I don't understand why fans don't see threw all the coporate motivies of these artists  who release previous material to make more money for something you've already heard! So  go ahead spend that cash on this crap and when 50 releases another re-re-release of this cd I hope you finally understand what they are doing and come to your senses.
0061015725|5.0|This was a smart book that was impossible to put down. My favorite science fiction helps explore what might come from technological trends. Who can say what might happen when nanotechnology advances? Above all, though, this is an addictive, fast-paced thriller.
B00001QEE9|1.0|This dvd has close captioning which cannot be taken off which is distracting to the kids.  It would appear that this isn't an original copy.
B00005JNTX|5.0|As a reformed comic book collector, I had never read any of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels but I had heard about them. And everything that I had heard had been positive. Then when I heard they were making a film based on a few of the novels and the it was being directed by Robert Rodriguez I was very interested in what would happed. But what really sold me on the film was hearing that Frank Miller himself would be co-director of the film. To think the man behind it all, the creator, would be involved in the film gave me very high hopes. Well after seeing the film I was not disappointed. This is one of the slickest pieces of film making I have seen in a long time. I love how the film is done all in black and white with color being used only when neccesary, mostly in the case of blood or the color of a character's eyes. The film reminds me very much of portions of the graphic novel that I have seen. In fact the whole film seems like the graphic novels come to life. The way each stories weaves in and out of each other reminds me of a comic book. This film has one of the most diverse casts I have seen. A unique blend of both old school actors (Rutger Hauer/Bruce Willis/Powers Boothe) and up an coming stars (Alexis Bledel/Jessica Alba/Rosario Dawson). But the stand out actor in this film has to be Mickey Rourke as Marv. At first you don't even recognize that it is Mickey ROurke but as the story proceeds you realize that it isn't Mickey Rourke, not anymore. Because he has truly become Marv and plays him well. It is as if Rourke identifies with the character which more than explains why he plays him so well. But I want to tell you this film is not for young children. It is a very violent film and contains nudity. In fact a friend of mine who is a die hard horror fan rented this film at my recommendation and did not finish it because she felt it was too violent. But do not let the violence scare you away from this film. It is all part of the plot and does not come across as unecessary. In fact it is integral in telling each story. I highly recommend this film and you will not be disappointed and I am looking forward to a sequel.
B000957O82|5.0|Remember when we were young (those of us over 50) and movies had a happily-ever-after ending?...I Loved this movie and We ALL Love Will Smith.  He has humor, class, and intelligence along with appeal!  MORE movies like this for WILL!!  Perhaps one with his wife would be a fun comedy.
B000002I2M|5.0|Well, maybe a little of both.... but the band was on fire, again. It seemed to most by this point that The Doors had sold out and had not much left.<br /><br />UNDERSTAND, there are no bad DOORS albums (except for maybe the ones recorded AFTER Jim died, but those are long out of print) this one here though, is the only one that matches the quality of the first.<br /><br />The Doors ditched their producer and did this one themselves. M The most bluesy of the catalouge definatley, with covers of CRAWLING KING SNAKE, and blues chargers like (oooh yeah) THE CHANGELING and (yes!) CARS HISS BY MY WINDOW and DOWN SO LONG. Plus the well known title track and the eerie cool burner RIDERS ON THE STORM. Throw in some trippy Jim stuff and you've got a hell of a package.<br /><br />If I've studied my history correctly this album wasn't released until after Morrison died, maybe thats why so much effort was put into this mix, either way its a must have for the DOORS collection.<br /><br />FIVE ALBUMS ARE EASY TO COMPILE, IF YOU LIKE THE DOORS STAY AWAY FROM GREATEST HITS, THERES TOO MANY GOODS TO MISS!
B00000G3PA|5.0|Bruce Willis is the best. This is his best performance since Die Hard.      Steve Buscemi is hilarious in this.  And the special effects are great.  Definite must-have for your collection.    Ed S.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I figured this album was getting a bad wrap. I guess not. These people know whats up which is good, because I often find this album to be underated.<br /><br />Huge SAB fan, especially OZZ stuff. First album is the best. Paranoid, is the over played but still a definate rocker peice.<br />Master and 4 slip a little in comparisson and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath always gets the credit that this one deserves.<br /><br />SABOTAGE is the one to put on to scare your parents. Nothing but POWER, this is the PEAK of the OZZY YEARS. They put down the synths to make one more GREAT album before the walls fell down.  THIS IS WORTHY OF A BREAKDOWN:<br /><br />HOLE IN THE SKY: speechless. Jaw dropping opener.<br /><br />DONT START: is just a segway...<br /><br />SYMPTOM OF THE UNIVERSE: This is WHY these guys are the godfathers of metal. LOUD with a big f'in D. Then the breakdown at the end, oh so sweet.<br /><br />MEGALOMANIA: I used to skip this one cuz it starts off slow. Big mistake, this epic goes almost ten minutes and it takes you to all new places. Maybe the best track on the album.<br /><br />THRILL OF IT ALL: A more mature peice. Still a rocker.<br /><br />SUPERTZAR: Another segway, this time a little too long...<br /><br />AM I GOING INSANE: ok, so a little synth. This is the best they ever did with that crud though. Still why it made the greatest hits over symptom is beyond me. *MAKE SURE THIS SONG IS PLACED HERE, MY INITIAL COPY OF THE CD PLACED THIS TRACK LAST AND CUTS OUT THE INTERLUDE BETWEEN THIS AND THE WRIT WHICH IS WICKED COOL<br /><br />THE WRIT: My other favorite, heavy and soulful at the same time. Ozzy had some crazy pipes in those days. Sometimes I forget.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why I can't say this is better than the first. It almost is. I guess cuz I'm not really a metal head but a hard rocker. I usually appreciate Sabbath for the early hard rockers. This album is one of the reasons why I can dig on METAL
B000002GJH|5.0|I sit and wait for the \\"Re-release\\" in hopes of some extra tracks, some remastering... liner notes.. all that. To this day, this record survives the years gone by. Its still a classic record and has accompanied me on so many down times and trips down memory lane. By far one of my all time fave records. I miss this time in music. Before everyone was using the \\"G- word\\", this record and this scene had everything missing in music. Now, years later its still so much to offer. Cheers. And please pray that Audioslave breaks up... ugh!
B000002I27|5.0|Doors part two. I've reveiwed all the studio albums this morning and I saved this one for last because, well, it's the most thought provoking of the bunch.<br /><br />My title should say it all. This is way darker than the first album and darker than any of the rest. It rocks and is definatley somewhere in my top 25 albums. (My top fives got DOORS ONE, top tens got LA WOMAN and top 15 got MORRISON HOTEL.)<br /><br />I could write a thousand pages on this and probably deep anylyze the hell out of every song but I won't. None of us got the time for that BUT like all other DOORS this is a must have.
1573223026|5.0|I wasn't sure how the subject of suicide could be humorous, but this book, while bringing out many emotions, really had me laughing most of all.  It was a fun read- highly recommended.
B000002KB8|5.0|There is so much that is cool about this album.<br /><br />Its dark at times, its sacreligious at times, its ripp rock at times and its even bluesy at times. (The last being a sound that Sabbath would eventually abandon.)<br /><br />This peice is a work of art and should always be considered as a whole and never broken up.<br /><br />BLACK SABBATH: The darkest peice ever.<br /><br />THE WIZARD: Very bluesy. Love that mouth harp over hard guitar.<br /><br />WASP/WALL/BASS/N.I.B: I love the fact that these all get squeezed into one track. N.I.B easilly stands alone but it blends so well with BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP that it just needs to be together. (I think there is a version of the disc that seperates these tracks if you really must have it that way.)<br /><br />WICKED WORLD: Another bluesy great. Hard, heavy, and solid.<br /><br />FINGER/WARNING: This track is just a ton of jamming out. Awesome though and the lyrics to WARNING are some of the OZZMANS best.<br /><br />FIVE TRACKS NO BULL<br /><br />DONT OWN THIS? BUY IT.
B00000DFSK|5.0|It's great if you love early U2. Some of there best songs are on here. Great sound and nice facts inside the CD book. Great buy totally worth.
B000002I2G|4.0|Things were a little rocky by this point. Sometimes (I don't know how you wanna justify it) bands get bored and have to try new things. Like (dear god) horn sections.<br /><br />Some songs still have not grown on me like \\"What the hell is this?\\" TELL ALL THE PEOPLE.<br /><br />The rest are to say the least, interesting, and some even hold the belt thru this fourth DOORS outing. The title track THE SOFT PARADE is easily one of the best (epic) Doors tracks around, and WILD CHILD and SHAMANS BLUES shouldn't be missed either. Even the swooning WISHFUL SINFUL is worth a couple wears.<br /><br />However, this album has a completley different feel. The production is way different, (sloppy at times) and the numbers are mainly sub par. Still, thats only compared to other DOORS stuff and so we still have a pretty great album here.<br /><br />Little interludes between songs are also pretty cool like \\"poor Otis dead and gone, left me here to sing this song, pretty littl girl with a red dress on, poor Otis dead and gone.\\"
6305311463|5.0|This is, no pun intended, one heavenly movie.  I greatly enjoyed the action-packed plot, witty and original dialogue, convincing and moving love story, and the nuanced performances by every single cast member involved, even the extras in the background.  The bonus features on the Criterion edition are worth the price of 786,849 other lesser DVDs alone.  When God cast forth his omnipotent digital media-creating godwaves into the minds of its earthly \\"inventors\\", he had this DVD in mind.  Thy will be done.
B000000W5N|5.0|To me, when it comes to the Stones, all you need is a few greatest hits packs and you are straight. You need HOT ROCKS cuz that has all the great sixties stuff, and you need the one that spawns the mid seventies thru the early nineties. There aren't any really great STONES albums EXCEPT for this one.<br /><br />I own EXILE and I gotta say I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I enjoy it when other people play it but I virtually NEVER touch my copy.<br /><br />STICKY FINGERS though, is a classic rock staple. Even if you don't like the STONES you will find something on this peice. You got your radio songs BROWN SUGAR and WILD HORSES, you got that speed taking CANT YOU HEAR ME KNOCKING with its killer extended jazz solo. You got BITCH, which has the best lyrics that ever came out of Mick.<br /><br />You get bluesy goods like YOU GOTTA MOVE.<br /><br />YOU GET SISTER MORPHINE WHICH IS A PISSAH MOVING POWER PEICE<br /><br />If you are looking to start a Stones collection well this is one of the few times I say get a hits package rather than a n original album. HOT ROCKS.<br /><br />If you are specifically looking for a classic get this. NOT EXILE.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Just imagine a few of the millions of events in human history which had to be fulfilled before this pinnacle of the human imagination could come to fruition: Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, the Romans conquered Palestine, Henry VIII broke from the Roman Catholic Church, Magellan circumnavigated the globe, the U.S. Constitution was ratified, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emanicpation Proclamation, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the Soviet Union collapsed.  But now, finally, all of mankind's long history has produced its singular and most profound triumph of spirit: 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\".  And let me tell you, I was absolutely blown away when I listened to it; overcome in a religious ecstacy from the first note, I felt the magic and deep-rooted tragedy of 50's soulful lyrics, the heartpounding and primal urgings of its gangland beats, the urban melancholy mixed with the unbridled passion of 50's rich and sensuous voice.  This is why I, and every other person living or dead, was born to this sweet, blue Earth.
B000003BD3|5.0|VH-1 pulled this out of the vaults about six or seven years ago and I can remember loving the special on TV. There is a DVD out now which I haven't seen so I don't know if theres anything new on it.<br /><br />The music is live but in front of a selected audience in an atmosphere made up to look like an actual circus.<br /><br />The cuts don't sound live, but for the most part are actually EDGIER than their actual studio cuts.<br /><br />BEST EXAMPLES ARE:<br /><br />JETHRO TULL: SONG FOR JEFFREY, I remember this because, this was the first time I ever heard this song. I went out and found it on TULL's THIS WAS album and I was extremely pissed. Actually the reason I purchased this disc was solely for the version of this song WHICH ROCKS!<br /><br />THE WHO's: QUICK ONE, this one sounds as if it were written just for this performance. Way better than the studio.<br /><br />THE DIRTY MAC: YER BLUES, in case you don't know THE MAC was compiled of John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Mitch Mitchell on drums. The Beatles album was brand new but since they were the biggest coveted thing on the planet, they weren't ever gonna be on this show.The Mac version is way full of sound. It's to bad this faux rock band only played together this one time.<br /><br />Then you got TAJ MAHALL and MARIANNE FAITHFUL doing some cool tracks and all THE STONES stuff at the end.<br /><br />Even though there is a lot of bogus clown music involved between tracks the cuts are so good that I will give it 5 stars.
B00006J3T4|2.0|This is not a very interesting album. Someone else wrote that it was the soundtrack of a movie and that's sort of what it sounds like. WAY in the background of a movie.<br /><br />He has a lot of better stuff. For instance, I like every recording on Shngri-La. Can't say that I will play this one again.
B000007S5B|5.0|The third outing for the doors had a lot of POP FRIENDLY tunes on it. Candy coated LOVE STREETS and swooning numbers like WINTERTIME LOVE. Not to mention HELLO I LOVE YOU.<br /><br />This may have failed the album somewhat but the balnce comes from some of the most tripped out psychedelic stuff the band ever did. Like (hold onto your FACE) NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH, the lizard kings anthem. Also SPANISH CARARVAN and my personal fave MY WILD LOVE.<br /><br />Some could easily say the album is entirely filler but you need an open mind for this one and easily its a classic. Not to many albums get that kind of respect.<br /><br />Make sure you hold your girl tight when the trip gets too intense!
B000A6T1KE|5.0|I thought that this movie was better than any of the Star Trek movies yet. We finally had a movie about the Romulans and the battles were amazing. I don't know why so many people ripped on this movie. Porbably the same people who destroyed Enterprise. So don't let them scare you away from such a great film.
B000002I2I|5.0|Ah ha! OOH! HEY BABY! Why don't you get into my car, I've just had a couple beers and listen to whats on the radio ROADHOUSE BLUES!!! OH YEAH! The Doors were hard psychedelic rock until this peice which is one of the most awesome gritty blues numbers I know of. This song alone will NEVER get old.<br /><br />The song WAITING FOR THE SUN was the reason I initially bought the album WAITING FOR THE SUN, extremely dissapointed when I found out I had gone to the wrong place. Oh well, next stop was MORRISON HOTEL the bands fifth. By the way, the mentioned track ROCKS YOUR SOCKS and now I'm having fun just thinking about the rest of this album.<br /><br />You may not recognize the rest of these songs right away except for maybe PEACE FROG, because none of them are ever on the radio, but this is a party album.<br /><br />In the few months between SOFT PARADE and this album JIM MORRISON aged about forty years, his life was spinning in dangerous directions and his relationship with the band had been rocky.<br /><br />Now, I think due to the previous album being critisized so heavily Jim and the boys decided to say F it and just have fun. Nothing on this album is forced, its all loose, and thats how it should be. THE MOST natural of the DOORS collection.<br /><br />Jims wear and tear is evident, but his songs are just awesome. All over the place at times (even at sea) ... (even on the moon)but I dig about everything here. My  faves are the highly underated last four tracks THE SPY, QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY, INDIAN SUMMER and MAGGIE MCGILL.<br /><br />LET IT ROLL BABY!
B00005JM02|5.0|this movie is one of the best animated movies in a long time. the plot is fantastic. unlike many other animated films, this movie actually has a moral. a very good one for kids. i dont know one person who doesnt admit it was at least very watchable. and i live in miami. the one of americas meanest and unkind cities. still everybody has seen it. kids will watch this movie till they know every word in this movie. adults will luv this movie too. well only if you dont mind animation.  <br />this is easily disney's top 5 movie in 30 years. <br />this is the miami reviewer.

B0007P3582|1.0|I popped this CD in w/ an open mind.  I tried to like listening to evry gangsta rap cliche in the book, but I just couldn't.  50 sux.  He tries to diss ppl that r way more skilled than him, like Nas.  He tries to act like hes the strongest foo on the planet.  None of the songs on here have any redeeming value at all.  Kids, if ur lookin for a rapper like this, plz get Casual's dope CD that came out Sept. 6th:  Smash Rockwell.  Casual has sum serious talent.  And also, I spent 78 minutes listening to this CD, and I never felt like I wasted time more in my life.  I rated evry song, averaged them all 2gether, and got a 1/5.  Do urselves a favor:  When u go to buy that new version of this CD, don't.  Buy Casual's new 1.  I give that 1 a 4.5/5.  Peace.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This is the best of Dylan. His early folk/protest was great but for sheer entertainment value and storytelling this is the one. <br />My favorite for sure and I have them all.
0143034901|5.0|From the very first page the book grabs you and takes you away to a time and place set 55 years ago through the eyes of a young, innocent, extremely likable and intelligent boy named Daniel who lives in Barcelona, Spain during the political upheaval and the problems of the area caused by the war and revolution.  Daniel has a host of very helpful characters around him including his father, a beggar, a blind older girl whom he is obsessed with, the writer of a novel that Daniel has read and loved as a ten year old and a host of other colorful, interesting and well described characters.<br /><br />The brilliance of the author is that he is able to give each character a very well defined and amazingly intricate role in defining Daniel's future, his relationship with women, his dedication to a cause, his sympathy for people in need and his hatred of those characters who are guided by revenge and selfishness.  There is a lot of clever and fun humor and precious insights from the philsopher beggar who becomes Daniels best friend and guide.  There is real love and passion from a father who is simple, hard working, has lost his wife (Daniel's mother) and is trying to do the best thing for his son.  And there is real feeling and coming of age love from Daniel toward several beautiful females who all help define his life and growth.  These relationships are real, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes sexual and always touching.<br /><br />The book also gets into the dynamics of the father and son role and how important that role is in guiding a young man into adulthood.  There are four different such relationships in the book each describing a different part of growing up both from Daniel's perspective and from the viewpoint of each of the man's love for Daniel.<br /><br />The book is literature.  It is a complicated, humorous, fun, serious, sometimes amazingly sad and serious work.  As others here have mentioned, it could be condensed a bit, but on the other hand, it is such an enjoyable read, that cutting any of it out would have been a mistake.  Real readers, be prepared to get lost in this world for a few days.  I think you'll love it.is such an enjoyable read, that cutting any of it out would have been a mistake.

1573223026|5.0|I've been a fan of Nick Hornby for quite a while and have read just about all of his novels. I was a little apprehensive when I first started this one because the story is told through the eyes of more than one main character. I usually don't like that type of thing, but Hornby's story is so good, and the writing so insightful and funny that it didn't bother me at all. He uses his characters to explore the idea of suicide and what it means to live. The characters are fresh and funny and some lines are laugh-out loud hilarious. This is definitely a good purchase; something you will read again and again (if are the type to reread--I am). <br />
B00006GFAB|4.0|Cold Gin, God gave rock'n roll to you, I was made for lovin' you, Rock'n roll all night, Detroit rock city, the works. Brings back memories from the times of my first drinks, trying to pick up girls with varying success and, being a general rebel, people trying to kick my arse 'cause Kiss is too weird. Those were the days and they're all on this album.
B000002LOE|5.0|Just to counter all the low star ratings out of time has recieved, this album is an absolute classic with out a single wrong note, there's not much more to say really, if you don't already own this album for gods sake don't tell anyone and get it quick before they notice!
B00005JNTX|2.0|The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books.  However, not having read these comics, the plot didn't make sense.  My husband had the same reaction.  I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity, but the continuous violence was a turn off.  Overall, I wish I'd stuck with just watching the trailer.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I think we have some strange critics here.  Jared Leto has definately matured in this second time around, and i think the machine is definately tighter and more open.  Their debut was definately amazing, don't get me wrong.  But there is always a need for change (can't have the same album twice, sorry guys).  The 'space rock' sounds are still there, and Leto's vocals have reached purity.  What a great song to start of this album too.  Attack is pulsating, and we get a hit of Leto that we've never seen before.  Right when i bought this cd, i had listened to it 4 times nonstop.  Even the hidden track on 10.  This is definately my favorite cd of the year, and i'm am definately impressed.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this book as a baby shower gift, because I remembered how much my kids and I loved this book when they were little.  The pictures are hilarious and the verses are very sweet.  Even though my kids are in junior high school now I can still recite this book word for word.  I consider it a classic, right up there with \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" !
0671015206|4.0|Interesting and useful studies on who & how of self-made millionaires and their families, including their legacy. Not too much of in depth How-To, but a good pointing in the right direction.  I am looking forward to reading the Millionaire Mind next.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Only recently discovered firefly.  After watching the complete series, pretty much glued to my TV for 15 hours straight, I was only more excited to learn that due to DVD sales Serenity the movie is coming out.  I have never had a television program has grabbed me like this one.
B0000029GA|5.0|Growin up in Queens , in 94 when Nas dropped illmatic it not only brought rap back to the origin of where it was born but brought rap back in a whole new level.

0553583182|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an acquaintance, a man in his 70s who still runs his own business. We had a conversation at a wedding in which my husband and this  man's wife were both part of the wedding party and we weren't. He told me a lot of interesting things about how this book had helped him and the last thing he said when we said goodbye was: The Power of the Subconscious Mind. It's by Murphy. <br /> <br />A couple of months passed and I didn't even try to find the book. But then synchronistically, events in my life made me recall our conversation and I decided to get the book.  <br /> <br />This book is very uplifiting. Sometimes life seems like it is not really within our control. This book enables its readers to feel like they do have some control over how things go.  <br /> <br />On one hand, my rational mind still pokes at me and says, You cannot really believe this. On the other hand, in the intervening months, I've gone from being a librarian type who wore baggy clothes and had no self-esteem to someone that people pay attention to. I am now routinely told I am beautiful when I walk to work in the morning. Yesterday a 23 year old man told me I was \\"hard to miss\\" because I was \\"stunning\\". (I'm 42.) It's not like I exchanged bodies with Angelina Jolie or anything, so what could be making this difference? I think it must be that a few months ago, I \\"knew\\" I was dumpy and had lost my looks and now I \\"know\\" I'm beautiful. I'm healthier and happier than I've been in years. I've even managed to improve my eyesight with the techniques in this book.  <br /> <br />Maybe it's just a coincidence. But I don't think so.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|my wife called it a guy movie. lots of action and no romance. It is more more philosophic and moody then most action films, something i like. Lots of room for thoughtfulness and threads to think about. But with things that go boom and hand to hand combat as expected from a comicbook character. Nice movie, worth regular price and buying the DVD.
0784010218|1.0|I must be one of the few people on the face of the planet that can't stand this movie.  I don't care about that fact either because nothing could convince me to put up with this boring old movie again.  I had the misfortune of seeing this some time ago, and even more misfortune of seeing the stage show.  Boring.  I'd rather pull my eyelashes out one by one or something equally as torturous.  I know I'm not going to convince many people about this mundane tired movie, but I feel better having said my peice and maybe I could save someone from the pain.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is by far SOAD's best. Its the most angry and heavy album of the four. I love the melodies to some of the songs. Great start to their sucess.     (+)Stregnths  (:))Favorite    1. Suite-Pee 10/10. Love the guitar in the beginning. It sounds a little like the Mario theme. It's a cool song really. The chorus is excellent, fast and to the point. The ONLY downpoint is the constant screaming by Serj after the second chorus. Fast drums and everything. Great opener. They were originally name it Sweat Pea, but because of Black Sabbath taking this title, they had to change it to Suite-Pee, which actually looks better.    2. Know 10/10. Cool drum opener at the beginning. Love the chorus. Fast screams and great guitar. If you think about it, it sounds like it should've been a hit. I love the repeating \\"Do you ever try to fly?\\" Great. Either a hit or miss song, whatever you make of it. If you liked Suite-pee, this is a pefect follow-up.    (+)3. Sugar 10/10. This is in the my top 5 favorite SOAD songs. I love the oddities of it. Its really fast and confusing. Its all about a guy who goes and kills people, and then realizes it. It sounds like Serj was playing a skitzo or something. Amazing track. Its about the effects of a cocaine addict, or \\"sugar\\" the slang. Crazy catchiness is what makes this song stand out.    4. Suggestions 10/10. I've had it. I have to give this song a 10. It's now one my favorites just because it works in every way it wants to. I like this song so much now since I've given it a try. Love the little acoustic guitar at the beginning. Small and bouncy verses, with an exploding chorus. Its a truly amazing song, unlike any other. The guitar after the singing in the chorus the second is kick ass too, it sounds like the guitar in Spiders. If you are into hilarity, there is a part where Serj has a cartoony voice. Its not too much of a cartoony voice, just high and twisted. If you don't like high screaming, its not for you. It would be a lot better with this out. Besides that, cool cool song. This is one of the songs which kind of has a storyline.    (+)5. Spiders 10/10. This is another hit and a big strong point in the album. It has a ballad touch to it. Its truly an amazing song. Its melodic and slow, but don't worry, it kicks ass. The guitar solo is cool too. If you aren't into holding long singing notes, you might wanna pass on this song. If you like slow ballads, give this a hear.    6. Ddevil 9/10. The only confusing thing is the name. Ddevil? Was this meant to be like Slayer's Ddamn? Whatever its cool. Its really bouncy, you can tell by the little drumline opener. Its got an up-beat little tune to it making it very awkward.  It talks about Shakespeare, and how modern writing has plagerized histories old books. Don't worry they aren't satanists, because Serj repeats, \\"The devil is so lovely.\\" It's a thought, but it isn't true. Oh well. The chorus is kind of stop and go. Another dark song, cool though.    7. Soil 9/10. The angriest song on the album. The guitar intro makes it seem like its all and well, but its cool to listen to. Its really heavy, and sounds like a mixture of other songs put into one. Fast verses, and there's not really a chorus. The snarling guitar riifs is very deep and angry feeding throughout the song. I'm almost positive its about a friend of his dying, the lead singer of the band Soil, because he says refrences to guns, and Serj says \\"Why'd you take him motherf'er?!\\" Good stress reliever song. Its hard to listen to it without throwing something at a wall.    8. War? 10/10. Why does the guitar intro of this song remind me of Rage Against the Machine? Whatever cool song again, and a meaning that is rich and clear just by the title. Catchy chorus which I love, and fast drum beat verses. It stops in the middle of the song, but it ain't over. The standout effect is the chorus, because it delivers the whole message. When I said earlier that it stops in the middle of the song, Serj still sings, justnot really any instruments, besides a guitar. I like it because its like an order or a speech. This is another stand out track. Be sure not to miss it.    9. Mind 8/10. Very very slow. I finally got into this song. The intro is so long, I sit there waiting and then eventually fast forward. After the intro, all hell breaks loose. A slow and fast tempo change is included here. The only song which I think doesn't hold its own. It could have more energy, but after the 2 minute intro you're already bored of it. I actually listened to it a few more times, and I think its not too bad of a song. It is very dark and strange. It kicks in, then decides to go slow again. Give it a try, its not THAT bad, but a 6 minute System song MIGHT be pushing the limit.    10. Peephole 9/10. Love the intro from its creepiness, and the carnivale theme. Love the slow guitar in the beginning. It makes you want to move your head to the beat. Bouncy and stop and go verses. It's got a melodic theme. If any of you know the band Mr. Bungle, it sounds like them in some of the parts. Creepy and eerie song. Its totally a song you would recognize if you were high. I actually found out that they admire Mike Patton, which is the singer of Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Tomahawk, Fantomas, and other side projects. This song brings back great memories.    :)11. CUBErt 13/10. My top song on the album, which I know people will disagree about. Its a short running time, but it can fill its potential in a runtime of 1:49. Cool guitar at the beginning which gives the video game feeling. Identical verses, then filled with drum filled mini's in between. Cartoony voice again, but it fits this song well. People say this song is about video games. Its actually about overpopulation. Well everyone's got their own opinion, I might be wrong!     12. Darts 9/10. This is when I come to a point where my brain shuts off and I just wonder. You think by the intro that its a heavy and a rock song. Listen to the rest. It is very very strange. Half the time you are wondering what he's saying, and he is yelling. There are hardly any lyrics and most of the time its screaming. I love this. Took me a while to get into. The chorus is what sticks out the most saying \\"Arise as did the gods ninti.\\" At one point he is saying gibberish. By the end of the song its just on to the next. Odd at its finest here.    13. P.L.U.C.K. 10/10. This is a great way to end this genuine CD. Really heavy. Fast with a dose of adrenaline. Lots of screaming so beware if you don't like that. It has its light side to it, but with all words aside, great closer. Bouncy little parts here and there with cool guitar riffs. It is about Serj's strong feelings about the Armenian Genocide of 1915.     This album is my favorite. We'll have to wait until Hypnotize releases, to determine if it can perfect this.
0808592777|4.0|Things Fall Apart is a tragedy of a man and his country falling into disarray.  Used for discussion in a classroom or book club, the novel can be viewed as a uniquely powerful, yet universal, story of the disasters that may befall us all if we are not careful and aware of our choices.  However, for sheer enjoyability Things Fall Apart is lacking, featuring characters that are not immediately endearing and a meandering plot, where individual chapters take place with little obvious correlation. <br /> Although not advisable for a \\"quick read\\" for the average reader, Things Fall Apart can be worthwhile if one does not consider oneself done with the book the moment the last page is turned.  A careful digestion of the book after it is read is essential to its enjoyment. <br /> As a note: no matter the reason it is read, the reader is encouraged to keep a list of character names if he or she is not well-versed in African languages and names, as Achebe creates an entire village.
B000093BDX|3.0|I'm afraid I am going to have to disagree with Nick Mackler when he says \\"This release features seemingly 30 of The Beach Boys best hits, all on one disc featuring some of the best pop/rock music of all-time. They space out the collection nicely and also found in this compilation are some of the original Mono versions of songs which is a great thrill to hear, and for some of us older fans, brings back very fond memories.  <br /> <br />It begins with the insatiable California Girls, a song which will always hold a spot on my list of song favourites. Moving along, we get some fantastic choices placed well, including the biggest hits and ones that were minor hits such as Surfin' Safari. The music is in top form sounding as clear and vibrant as ever. The first half of the Disc very much so concentrates on the biggest hits from The Beach Boys while the latter half find us hearing more of the minor, yet nearly equally impressive tracks. This is a wonderful buy for those of us who are casual Beach Boys fans, and is also essential for fans who maybe only own one album of theirs and are looking for some great hits on this \\"Best Of\\" compilation. I have only one minor complaint. They left out a favourite of mine. Where is the song \\"409\\"? I love that song and was hoping it also lied amongst these classics. However, it wasn't easy selecting 30 perfect songs and I'm sure others are still not quite satisfied with the song listing. Surprisingly, and effectively, the compilation closes out with Good Vibrations. This surprised me a little, because at first it the collection seems almost partially in order of how big a hit one particular song was. The essentials are all here: I Get Around, Wouldn't it be nice, God Only Knows, and Surfin' USA and they're still as fresh as ever. There should be no serious complaints about this collection, but as always, there's bound to be someone who'll lash out at this collection which is totally ridiculous.  <br /> <br />So, If you're a casual fan ofThe Beach Boys, looking for the best hits, or just wanting all the hits on one disc, this is the perfect buy for you.Despite 409 missing, it's great music which all rock n' roll lovers should appreciate. Buy it without hesitation if you don't own a Disc by The Beach Boys.\\" <br /> <br />I don't think he is right. <br />
0312995423|2.0|It opens with a murder. It features a resourceful and intelligent professor, a beautiful skilled lady, an unstoppable murderer (with little intelligence) and a fierce boss. It deals with a secret of some kind, and every character is running to disclose the enigma before the other party does.<br /><br />No, it's not \\"The Da Vinci code\\" nor \\"Angels & Demons\\". It's Dan Brown's first book, \\"Digital fortress\\". But if you have noticed any similarities with his previous books, this is no coincidence. Dan Brown has evolved as an author, but in this first book he looks like an amateur. After reading this book, it is possible to see that he has learned to develop his plots further, and his writing skills are surely better, but the premise is always the same.<br /><br />I won't even comment about his research and the editorial work done on \\"Digital fortress\\" - the ENIGMA machine weighed 12 TONS?? I don't know much about cryptography, but in my opinion it is simply impossible that the top code-breaking minds in the country can't see the evident connection between names like Tankado and Ndakota. This is treating the readers like idiots.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Digital fortress\\" is not a good book. Its plot is very weak. Its characters never seem real. The situations are far-fetched. If I were born in Spain, I would be outraged by how the author had treated my country. The good thing about reading Digital fortress\\" is that we can see that Dan Brown has learned how to write since then. \\"Angels & Demons\\" is much better than this one. And \\"The Da Vinci code\\" is in a much higher standard than both previous books. Stick to them instead.<br /><br />Grade 4.0/10
B000089CJI|1.0|You have to admire Worlds Greatest Air Guitarists brutal honesty when he says \\"Thi5 band really sucks, and I'm not just saying that. Only an old Backstreet Boys Teen Bopper would like this.\\" It was what we were all thinking wasn't it?
B000A88F22|1.0|I can't believe this is already coming to DVD/Video. <br /> <br />I had the television on one night while at work just so that I could have some background noise.  The announcer says that \\"Chaotic\\" will be coming on next so I decided to let it play and see how it turned out.  They should have called the show \\"Boring\\". <br /> <br />If you really want an entertaining video taken by a band that'll have you laughing the entire time, try the Pantera videos.
0790731479|2.0|Debbie Lee Wesserman claims that \\"the casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable\\". This is of course nonsense - the casting was an unmitigated disaster with the sole exception of Alec Baldwin who manages to salvage a second star for the film with a particularly memorable performance.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|If Jesse Cook plays anywhere in the state of texas, I will go see him, especially after listening to this live cd, it tells me he is as good live as his studio cd s are.  Find a comfortable chair and a good pair of headphones or sound system and enjoy, I'll be surprized  if you're able to walk away before listening to this performance in it's entirety!!!!  Hope you make many, many more musical offerings of this caliber, Jesse!!
0060763280|5.0|Excellent book if you have been reading other books on how to change your way of thinking.  Seems to tie them all together with great strategies.  I have already started sending this book to others that I associate.
0140177396|4.0|This novel surpassed all my expectations. It was assigned as summer reading and I'm so happy that it was. This is not a story with direct characterization that tells you everthing right away but a story of characters without names and forshadowing. This book can lead to a discussion for hours. It will make you reconsider your values and judgements.
B0000025D0|4.0|I'm 18 years-old and have started getting into the majesty that is Bruce Springsteen's music. I'm actually listening to \\"Prove It All Night\\" right now, which is kind of the mood i'm in these days, starting college, being away from home for the first time and trying to just prove to myself that i can get through it. Anyway enough about me, this album has clearly inspired many people and while different Springsteen albums have different standout qualities, \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town\\" is clearly an album full of the hard realism of middle-class suffering that many ordinary people can relate to, for example \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\" almost make me feel like i'm listening to my relationship with my father on CD. Bruce Springsteen clearly knows how to tug at people's emotions with his words. While there is plenty of Darkness on this CD, the fact that all of the characters present in the songs are still fighting and determined to get through whatever they have to get through, makes this album, at the end of the day, a work of redemption. While the E Street Band sounds incredible, particularly the guitar playing, what makes this CD is clearly the raw emotion that the Boss conveys with his voice and lyrics. Here's a song by song review: <br />Badlands 9/10 A terrific song to open up with, full of anger and fury with one of the most maddeningly catchy organ riffs you'll ever hear. <br /> <br />Adam Raised A Cain 8/10 Probably the hardest Bruce has ever rocked in the studio, extremely catchy, great guitar work, and a very relatable story line. <br /> <br />Something In the Night 6/10 A good song, but a little too long. <br /> <br />Candy's Room  7/10 A song full of urgency and longing, an interesting song structure, but solid nontheless.  <br /> <br />Racing In the Street 9/10  Ah one of Bruce's all-time classics. A great message in this song about outrunning your problems. One of the most memorable piano parts in just about any song ever recorded. <br /> <br />The Promise Land10/10 My absolute favorite song on this album and one of my top 3 favorite Bruce songs. A great message of hope and positive thinking with one of the most powerful bridges of any Springsteen song: \\"Blow away, the dreams that tear you apart, blow away the dreams that break you're heart, blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and broken-hearted.\\" Great number. <br /> <br />Factory 7/10 A good song, but it seems a little too short. Would get an 8 if it was longer. <br /> <br />Streets of Fire 7/10 Another solid song, the way Bruce shrieks in this song i have never heard come out of another human being before in my life! But hey, its Bruce can you really argue with it. <br /> <br />Prove It All Night 9/10 Fantastic song about proving your love and devotion to somebody. Really great lyrics that could hold true to anybody's life and a catchy chorus. <br /> <br />Darkness On the Edge of Town 8/10 Another classic and a great song to end with, perfectly sums up the basic theme of the album. \\"Yea, things are tough, but you know what? I'm still gonna be up on that hill with everything that i've got.\\" <br /> <br />This album is truly a gem. Anyone who's ever felt sad, depressed, or just jaded about their life's situation should buy this album.

B00005ATQD|5.0|I don't think it's possible to truly explain Eyes Wide Shut to anyone who hasn't seen it.  For some, it will be too darn weird, far too lengthy, and too abstract and open-ended to be enjoyable.  Others, however, will find themselves as fascinated as I was while watching this extraordinary film, especially after it transforms itself into something totally unexpected about midway through.  There is a sort of surreal atmosphere around everything that happens here, although I must say I sensed no dreamlike qualities to any parts of it.  I really didn't know what to expect going in - besides a bunch of nudity and the whole erotic Cruise-Kidman relationship - but that was a good thing (especially since the movie isn't really about those things).  Eyes Wide Shut is so unusual that it's probably better for the viewer to go in with no expectations whatsoever.<br /><br />I came to this film for Nicole Kidman, just as many probably came to it for Cruise.  It's really a Tom Cruise feature, I have to say, with Kidman scoring a lot less screen time than I expected.  Now, I love Nicole Kidman, and I was mesmerized by this entire movie, but I don't think this was one of Kidman's better performances.  Maybe it's just the fact that racy language coming out of her mouth just doesn't sit right with me, but I was definitely uncomfortable watching Kidman work her way through the more emotional scenes (which seemed a little overdramatic).  Cruise, for his part, is great, and the whole supporting cast (including Leelee Sobieski in a small but scintillating role) is excellent.<br /><br />Bill and Alice Harford have a complex relationship.  Following a strange party which finds them each flirting with other people, Alice starts a discussion that ends with her recounting her fantasies about another man.  Bill, who sits there with a blank look on his face throughout the uncomfortable scene, then gets called away to the home of a patient who has just died.  As you might expect, images of his wife with another man just keep running through his mind, and the unexpected advances of his dead patient's daughter sort of tip his precarious grip on reality a little too close to the edge.  Opportunity begins to become temptation, and he moves ever closer to infidelity.  Just when you think you have the movie figured out, though, it runs off like the Road Runner escaping the grasping hands of Wile E. Coyote.  Bill finds his way to an exclusive, secretive party of costumed men and women doing things that are far removed from the morality of the everyday world.  The whole scene is just amazingly surreal and weird - yet certainly exciting and stimulating.  The things Bill witnesses at this party set the stage for the rest of the film.  This is as much as I want to say about the plot, but I must emphasize just how multi-layered the story is.  It's a brilliantly complicated film that touches all sorts of emotional buttons.<br /><br />In the end, Eyes Wide Shut is a movie about relationships, particularly marriage, with infidelity and jealousy standing as the touchstones of Kubrick's elaborate exploration of the most intense and vulnerable of emotions.  People wear all sorts of emotional masks, they indulge in fantasies and sometimes give in to temptation, and Eyes Wide Shut plays extremely well on these themes.  Kubrick really weaves all sorts of disparate elements together in the most mesmerizing of ways.  I can certainly understand why some people just don't like the movie at all, though.  Daring, complex, surreal, intellectual, visionary motion pictures usually divide critics and viewers, inspiring either love or hate.  I can barely begin to do the movie justice here, but I personally feel that this is a brilliant motion picture that will garner more and more critical acclaim over time.r man just keep running through his mind, and the unexpected advances of his dead patient's daughter sort of tip his precarious grip on reality a little too close to the edge.

B000777J2S|1.0|I had always thought i had an understanding of a wide spectrum of music, but this left me totally bewildered, this has to be the worst collection of material i have ever had the misfortune to listen to,and those so called experts who awarded the mercury prize to this grossly undertalented individual should find a new career path. dire,dire,dire
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This is a great musical. If have the chance to see it, go. The Broadway sound track is very good but we saw a great performance in Chicago and what we remember are those voices so it doesn't seem as good because of that.
B000059HAI|4.0|This is a great depiction of what happened at Pearl Harbor.  It even gives an inside look at Japanese intentions and war strategies.  The battle scenes are true to life and are excellent considering when this movie was made in the late 70's.  If you like war movies, this is a good one to own.
0140177396|5.0|At 17 years old, I have had to read too many assigned books for my liking. The books are always loved by teachers, hated by students. <br /> <br />Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is one of two books that I've actually enjoyed reading (the other being Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte). I first heard of this book when my sister had to read it for school and then watched the movie with her when she rented it after finishing the book. I read the book when I was in the 8th grade. It wasn't assigned to read in school until the 11th grade. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the parallels that were scattered in the story. My favorite parts of the book are the beginning chapter and the end chapter. The beginning shows a peaceful place full of life and nature. There are birds and water and plants. When men finally come into the picture, it's to trample on that. At the end, they show the same setting, but fill it with how men have destroyed it and bring death into the picture, foreshadowing the future. <br /> <br />For those who haven't read this book, I implore you to read it. <br /> <br />For those who have and didn't like it, I hope you give it a second chance.
B000002KIE|3.0|So I was bored one day and started reading through the reviews of this album. And i found ABOUT 1 that is about the music mostly. everything always has to be about how INFLUENTIAL they were, how they founded punk, how they were so hardcore, and if i see one more damn person have to include that people nowadays like hot topic and every once in a while a pop-punk band, and act like they are some form of scum, i might throw up. so now that i have bitched and become a hypocrite by talking about something other than the music, here goes <br /> <br />The Music: fast and brutal punk anthems with a voice that tears open old wounds and creates new ones, this cd has everything a punk could want in a cd. Its fast, its rebellious, and it has anthems that anyone can love and relate to in a way. BUT...by the end of the cd a lot of the songs sound the same, like most punk records, and the song progressions dont do to much for the listener. SO based on the music alone, it is ok in that it is a good punk record, but it was never more than that. if you are into this, then check out some ramones and clash and even some modern day punk. no, it isnt a sin to like something other than the \\"founders\\" of punk. try out the misfits, afi, tiger army, green day, rancid, and whatever else you want. hmmm i wonder how helpful people will find this....
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  I haven't made a purchase in years that has brought me to tears due to it's sheer brillance and beauty.  I wept the first time that I listened to \\"Illinois\\".  You must own this album now.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|It was a great deal. Not to mention Gia Unrated is hard to come by. It took a little longer to get it then most of the DVD's I have ordered, but it was worth the wait.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I have been a fan of Musicals since 2nd grade and have heard, and enjoyed singing along, with classics like Showboat, Oklahoma!, Les Miserables, Damn Yankees, etc.  Rarely do I have the same reaction to contemporary musicals as to those classics. <br /> <br />I first heard Defying Gravity through an online radio network and, though it was about 95 degrees in the room, I had chills from that song.  Sure, the lyrics are semi-cheesy, but it's a combination of amazing, talented voices and decent written material.  I don't know, really, what it is, but I like what I've heard and am buying a copy of the book & soundtrack.  <br /> <br />I haven't enjoyed new Broadway this much since Rent!
B00080ZG10|5.0|It has actually been about a week since a saw this film and it is just as fresh in my mind now as when I first saw it. That is a sign of a good film in my opinion; one that just stays with you and haunts you for days after you view it.<br /><br />Sadly, I knew very little of Howard Hughes before this film. Viewers are given the opportunity to get inside the head of one of the greatest geniuses and most eccentric men of our time.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to delve into the plot in this review; 261 other reviewers have that covered. I do want to say that I thought the acting was absolutely amazing in this. I have never been much of a Leonardo DeCaprio fan. I'm one of those strange women who don't go for the pretty boys; and I always viewed him as such. Therefore, I never took his roles seriously. He completely changed my view of him in this film. He does an absolutely phenomenal acting job. He just completely embraces this role to the point where I question if he was really sane while filming this. I actually wept at the end of this film simply because the acting was so darn good, not because of the plot and the tragic story of Hughes sickness...because Leonardo was just so moving.<br /><br />This is a must see film.
B0007OASII|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS <br />------------------- <br /> <br />WOW, what an excellent release!!! <br /> <br />If you like Power Metal, this is one masterpiece you wont want to miss out on. I've just recently become a fan of Kamelot, and I must say I'm very impressed with the direction this band like to follow. It's got an old-school feel to it, with powerful vocals, melodic guitar solos, and excellent production.... <br /> <br />I first discovered Kamelot after listening to Conception's first two great releases \\"In Your Multitude\\" / \\"Parralel Minds\\". This was vocalist Kahn's first Metal outfit in the early 90's, and I must say I love both of those releases. Kamelot just takes it a few steps further than Conception was capable of. That said, Kamelot has a huge future in Metal.... <br /> <br />I would also have to say \\"The Black Halo\\" is one of the very best Metal releases of the year 2005. No question about it, and five star effort.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0757302661|5.0|I think this book is such a great read for any expecting mom. I thought the idea of hypnobirthing sounded a little bit strange when I was first recommended the book by my cousin. She said it helped her so much with her labor and delivery so I assumed it would only benefit me to read it. I have always wanted a natural, drug free child birth so this book really backed up my beliefs in doing so.  <br />Whats great about this book is that it doesn't talk about \\"hypnobirthing\\" the whole time. It takes about how labor is a natural process that we shouldn't fear. It goes over many important aspects of pregnancy, labor, and breastfeeding that any pregnant woman should know about. It also gives great breathing exercises and focusing techniques that are similar to lamaze techniques.  <br />I am due in 7 weeks and I can't wait. This book has made me excited and confident for my labor. I know that I am capable of having a natural childbirth and this book has really helped me get mentally prepared for this joyous event in my life.

B00070DK14|5.0|this album is absolutely fantastic &amp; the overall package very well put together, visually &amp; musically.<BR>the music is so melodic, catchy &amp; foot-tapping.<BR>his voice is pure folk with a growling edge (like a lamb that swallowed a lion!) - <BR>The songs themselves: the tracks all flow together, <BR>&amp; the inteligent lyrical content of a superior high quality.<BR>fave tracks include &quot;Beastie&quot; - easy to identify with, amusing in a wry way; &quot;Clasp&quot; - sad, but true! - &quot;Seal Driver&quot; has the sound &amp; lyrical description that you are out battling the waves with ian &amp; his crew!  &quot;fallen on hard times&quot; sounds like a traditional folk song from 100s of years ago! - (you can just imagine all the villagers skipping along the path playing lutes &amp; mandolins) with a matey verbal message of &quot;chin up&quot;!.  &quot;Cheerio&quot; - rounds it off nicely with ian elegantly taking off his hat &amp; making an elaborate bow to the listeners.
0312330529|4.0|This was a wonderful novel layered with many stories and personalities. I lived in Bombay and this novel gave a very detailed and accurate description of many of the sights and smells of the area. This writing took me right back to the chaos and culture of Bombay. (or Mumbia now)
B00064MW6K|1.0|After last years dismal reviews from critics and most \\"movie laity\\" alike and with the info that this catwoman had no relation to any of the Batman incarnations, I decided to wait, until a moment when I may see it for free. Well, that days was today, and let me say, I'm glad I saved the price of admission, although I cannot get my hour and forty-five minutes back.<br /><br />Almost every clip of film is a mistep. First, Halle Barry was poor and to sex her up (why they took this step is beyond me, she is naturally gorgeous), they cut up the outfit and put her in a \\"bra.\\"  Her first appearance as Catwomen was sexier when it was less revealing.  secondly, her movements were poor and the CGI overly amatuerish at best (compare to Spider-man or X-Men and one gets the point).<br /><br />Next, Sharon Stone is just a bore.  Stone really has only one good acting performance to her credit (The Mighty - she was terrific).  While attracive, she has always been overated, or she just may be making poor role choices.<br /><br />Bratt is the only bright spot, but the script and direction is so poor, one doesn't care. Actually, maybe I should give the actors a break and charge the producers, director, and writers with a felony.  This movie is that bad and it makes Batman & Robin as well as Breaker-Breaker, look like masterpieces. Save your time and if it is Catwomen you want, by Batman the Movie (1966), Batman Returns, or any of the appearances in Batman, the Animated Series (actually, great Catwomen stories in this cartoon).  For a great graphic novel series involving her, read Batman:Hush - all of these are available here on Amazon.
0156027321|5.0|Life Of Pi could be considered the best book written in the 21st century, thus far. Our story starts off in a small town called Pondicherry on the coast of Tamil Nadu, south of Madras, which had been the capital of French India, with our protagonist Pi Patel. Pi is young man whose livelihood is cut short when he is shipwrecked and finds himself in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat in the company of five zoo animals including a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger. This book is the most fantastic story I've read in my entire life, and in this day and age where 90% of stories are easily predictable, Life of Pi is a refreshingly absorbing tale that never ceases to surprise you. Martel's writing style is unparalleled and is truly deserving of the awards this book received. Though I still don't quite understand how this is a story to make you believe in God, Life of Pi is unrivaled as my favorite book and I hope you will enjoy it as much I have time and time again.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Oh my, i just read a review below that made me laugh almost as much as the movie itself. Titled \\"Right-wing political propaganda posing as comedy, July 26, 2005\\" The reviewer claiming that this movie lies and is propaganda.  Come on, that's funny.  This movie is made with puppets...um, it's a movie...um, a comedy, um fake.  For laughs I recommend this movie...and I also recommend you read that review...it's hilarious.  <br />The irony...he/she probably thinks that Michael Moore's films are honest and full of integrity.
6305949980|5.0|It's ironic I couldn't find this at any local store and had to go for online -- the special edition is a nice quality update for a classic movie. I wouldn't go so far to say it's worth buying it if you already own the non-special edition, but if you're looking for a brand new Nightmare Before Christmas, this is a treat.
B000069AUI|4.0|I am hooked on COLDPLAY, they sing from their heart and are the BEATLES of this generation....listen and enjoy the message.
B00005JL96|2.0|The DVD \\"stutters\\" in several places, for a fairly significant time in one place. Hardly \\"very good\\" condition, as described.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Frankly, I don't know how to start describing OK Computer, Radiohead's masterpiece, surely a landmark album and one of the best of the 1990s (the reason why I do not call OK Computer the best is Tool's Aenima, an equally fantastic record which, however, is less accessible). What could be said in general is that here the group sonically combines their perfectionist modern guitar rock of The Bends-era with touches of electronica that only make the songs more moving and hauntingly beautiful. <br /> <br />The other thing, of course, is that this is perhaps the start of Radiohead as conceptual art-rock band further developed in their latter albums, particularly the follow-up, Kid A. The theme of OK Computer might sound as depiction of our cold and mechanical (COMPUTERized) modern world. However, this is not all pessimism nor escapism. The album contains a sort of story, at least it tells how the emotions are changed in a thinking man's mind, and it ends not on desparate, but on a positive, even self-consciously happier note (track 1: the introduction to the narrator's mind with the prophetic line In an interstellar burst I'm back to save the universe\\" which points at the more positive end of the album; tarck 2: a depiction of modern ambitious society; tracks 3-6: escapism and feebleness; track 7: analyze and understanding how hollow the whole thing is; track 8: anger and sharp criticizm of society; track 9: again feebleness, almost losing one's mind; track10: finding solace and beauty in private matters; track 11: feeling happy; track 12: again analyze and understanding that things can't be changed, so one simply has to go with the flow\\"). Thom's lyrics paint pictures in your mind further stressed by the album's cover art and of course the music itself. <br /> <br />And the music is so brilliant and inventive; it doesn't lose any of the Bends' greatness and excellent guitar play but enhances it with new spacey (Subterranean Homesick Alien), haunting (Exit Music), or brain-damaging effects (Karma Police, Climbing up the Walls). The diversity of OK Computer is also one of its characteristics; just listen to Paranoid Android to get a hint of what you may get with this album. <br /> <br />Each song is stunning, a gem of its own (and remember, they form a whole and flow into each other!). My favourites include Airbag with its epic but modern sound; the aforementioned Paranoid Android with superb lyrics and mood changes; Exit Music, a sad song that may turn you to tears with its climax; the hysterical Electioneering with its hyper-inventive guitar work; Climbing up the Walls, the loneliest song here; the beautiful No Surprises and imho the album's best track, Lucky (this one is a real rock masterpiece and Radiohead at their expressive best, you will feel lucky if you listen inside the song). As you see, there are quite many of them, and the other tracks are just equally brilliant. <br /> <br />Go buy it and listen, I believe soon you will call it one of your favourites.  <br />
B0002Y4T92|3.0|i bought this dvd as a big eric johnson and bb king fan. i am not a fan of eric clapton. i consider him a great songwriter. he does not carry any distinction in his guitar playing, guitar tone, or style (at least these days). although a lot of my favorite players are on this 2 disc set, most of what you get to see and hear is eric clapton hogging the spotlight. in fact, the only time you actually see bb king is when eric clapton is playing alongside him, ruining it. my opinion. im sure there are many clapton fans this would be great for. they should have titled it \\"clapton and friends\\". in over 4 hours of footage, eric johnson, like everyone else, gets ONE measley song. big deal. eric...you have pushed me away one more time...
0793518326|4.0|I wish I'd bought this when it first showed up on bookshelves in the early '90's.  My eyesight was better then! <br /> <br />Good collection, well orchestrated, but as others have said - very fine print.  Adding the full orchestration compounds the problem by spreading the songs over too many tiny pages.   <br /> <br />I also own \\"Beatles: Complete\\" published by Warner Music in the mid-seventies ($12.95 then).  While it is much less accurately transcribed, and lacks the scoring, it is MUCH easier to read.   <br /> <br />This book should come with a gift card good for unlimited enlargements from your nearest Kinko's.  Once properly enlarged, I'd give it five stars.
B00004XPPB|4.0|I think what makes this movie so powerful is the sense that the viewer is discovering things at the same time as the main character , Donnie . The sense of danger throughout and the relative lack of Hollywood cliches help to keep the whole experience more true to life . <br /> <br />The viewer sees and feels what is at stake for Donnie mentally , personally and professionally . The point is made but not laboured .  <br /> <br />There are few more effective mobster movies than this one . <br />For me , it is up there with the first 2 Godfather films and Goodfellas . <br /> <br />The film is well made and will not disappoint . The DVD also has an informative documentary as well as other features .
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|This greatest hits collection has a very mixed collection of shania's different country music styles, personally i have prefered the more soft rock influence in her tracks and the more modern country song with the last 2 albums, there are 2 new songs \\"party for two\\" which was a good new song to include, but unfortunately the other - \\"Don't!\\" isn't very good, its a ballad, and usually shania does this very well but this is no \\"forever and for always\\" or \\"From this moment\\", its quite a boring song that doesn't go anywhere. Apart from that a good selection, i would recommend it to people who haven't got all of shania's songs from other albums, otherwise don't buy it just for the 2 new tracks.
B0000067L2|5.0|The word 'psychedelic' applied to music can mean over indulgent and meandering , with strange audio effects taking the place of solid songs . <br /> <br />The word applies to this album , but the music gets to the point straight away . You have three distinctive players and two singers , Jack and Eric , who know how to make the songs work . Ginger the drummer also sings his own composition , Blue Condition .   <br /> <br />If only most albums made today were this fat - free . <br />An essential album , for the songs and crisp production .   <br />I would recommend this and Jack Bruce's album called SONGS FOR A TAILOR .
B0006L16N8|4.0|This the 3rd album from coldplay was always going to either establish themselves even more so worldwide or was going to be a huge disapointment following up the previous album. Fortunately they did make a very good follow up, in ways sounding simular to previous material but very catchy melodies.  <br />Track by track:- <br />\\"Square one\\" - didn't grab me at first but a definate grower after a few listens, its a very soft ballad with simple backing 7/10. <br /> <br />\\"What if?\\" is one of the best, again, simple but very effective, a very good chorus that you can't but hum or sing to every time you hear. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"White Shadows\\" sounds typical coldplay, the first track with the band doing there best, sounds a bit like something U2 would have done. Very effective tune with the same feel as \\"Speed of sound\\". <br /> <br />\\"Fix you\\" is another mellow track, but is a very good mellow soft song that again has a very catchy chorus 9/10. <br /> <br />\\"Talk\\" is one of my favourites, it has some excellent instrumentals that coldplay do so well, and is one of the tracks that is more the whole band, then chris martins vocals throughout. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\" the main track that has been released, took a while to grow, thought that it sounded to simular to previous releases, was initially disapointed, but is a grower 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"A message\\" is a mellow acoustic song that is ok but lets the album down a little 6/10 <br /> <br />\\"Low\\" is an ok track, it is not either a ballad or anything energetic, not a favourite but again a grower 7/10 <br /> <br />\\"Hardest Part\\" is quite a nice ballad, gentle rythems 7/10 <br /> <br />\\"Swallowed by the sea\\" has very simple lyrics, but is a very effective ballad which is very catchy, one of few i instantly liked 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Twisted Logic\\" ends the album with a mid tempo feel, not the best to end on but is ok. 7/10 <br /> <br />Overall a generally ballad setting, although some very good highlights and catchy hooks that won't escape your head.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|If you can still see Batman Begins at an IMAX...do it!!  It makes the movie at least ten times better, if that is even possible.  Watching this movie with the rumble in the seats, over 10,000 watts of glorious sound, and a screen 4,500 times larger than the average TV is mind-blowing.  It is a once in a lifetime chance so don't miss it.   <br /> <br />I know the IMAX in NY (Lincoln Square) is still showing BB.  Its worth the extra eight dollars for the experience.  Batman is the best superhero of all time and now has the greatest superhero movie to forever guarantee that verity.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Folks, The dvd pictured here is the real deal! No more nasty Trashy looking copies. Paramount Pictures is releasing this, right from the Wayne estate vaults. THANK GOD!!!!
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I have been under the hypnotic spell of this album subsequent to the third or fourth listening.  It's outstanding, beguiling, mesmerising.  Certainly a departure, but not as dramatic a departure as the first few cursory listenings might initially suggest.  HOWL is a bold work that makes some demands on it's audience, demands that will most likely divest it of a some of it's fan base.  Standing on the precipice of widespread market appeal, BRMC has taken a step away from a potentially gigantic commercial break towards an edgier, more interesting and unique sound.  HOWL is destined to become a seminal album in the genre now known as \\"indie rock.\\"  It's a morsel that becomes more and more delicious the more bites you take!
B00009KO08|5.0|The pianist is a film based on the life of Wladyslaw Sziplam, a Jewish pianist. It is set in <BR>German labour camps and the Warsaw ghetto. The ghetto is populated by Jews who have been placed there by the Nazis during the Second World War. The ghetto is basically a prison, with no one being allowed to leave, and is surrounded by German guards. I found this film very sad at times and caught myself with tears in my eyes on more than one occasion. This film made me feel quite emotional.<br /> It never ceases to amaze, sadden me and even<BR>give up hope for mankind when human beings commit such atrocious, brutal,  sadistic  and inhuman acts such as those committed by the Nazis during the second world war.<BR>Maybe the saddest thing of all is that such acts continue today in the 21st centaury, and that many countries ignore blatantly ignore what is going on around them because there is no political or financial gain to be had. That is of course unless oil is involved.<br />The only thing that gives me hope is the absolutely incredible strength, courage, tenacity, ingenuity and resilience demonstrated by mankind when faced with adversity.  Adversity at times it seems, brings out the best in most people ( not all) in terms of caring and sharing.<br />If only we could all live in harmony and share.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I use to be a huge fan of Britney Spears and I loved this album. I have to admit, I loved \\"I'm a slave for you\\" and \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\\" and did you know that JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE sings along with Britney in her song 'What It's Like to Be Me?'If you were a fan you need all her albums. Especially this one.
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond has written a wide-ranging and provocative discussion of our impact on our surroundings and the relationship of that impact to human survival. While this is a great read for anyone interested in the environment, it is also a splendid read for anyone who likes history or who loves to travel.<br /><br />  In the beginning of his book, Dr. Diamond explores in detail six societies: Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island, the Anasazi, the Classic Lowland Maya, and the Greenland Norse. These societies no longer exist, at least in their most advanced forms. Dr. Diamond explores the fascinating questions regarding the reasons for the demise of these groups. He discusses the environment of each of these societies and the changes that each group made in their own environment. I found his explanations and speculations fascinating. For example, he explains \\"dendrochronology,\\" the study of tree rings and its useful applications in giving fairly precise estimates of the age of wooden beams in an ancient man-made buildings.<br /><br />  Later on in the book, he discusses societies that have succeeded to survive in spite of environmental problems. He uses as examples the New Guinea Highlands, Tikopia, and the Tokugawa era in Japan. Just learning about each of these cultures was fascinating and thinking about their strategies for survival was encouraging.<br /><br />  Towards the end of the book, he discusses environmental issues of great concern to us now and reflects on decision-making and motives both on corporate and individual levels. I found his examples of modern decision-making in Rwanda especially poignant and informative.<br /><br />  On the whole, I thought this book was a remarkable read for anyone with broad interests in history and current human relationships with our planet.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I was skeptical when I read all the great reviews of this album in various music magazines. Just about EVERYBODY loved it. In fact, as I type this, \\"Illinois\\" is still the album with the highest cumulative score (91 out of 100) of 2005 (...) an invaluable website that combines many reviews into one composite score. That being said, I was unfamiliar with Sufjan Stevens and was doubtful a CD full of songs about Illinois by an \\"unknown\\" with a hard-to-pronounce name could be that satisfying. Boy...was I wrong! This is one of the best albums I've heard in the last 10 years, let alone in 2005. Every song is melodic as hell. This guy is a heckuva songwriter. And who would have thought that one of my favorite songs of the year would be a beautiful piece called \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\"??? That song alone is worth the price of this CD. After falling in love with \\"Illinois\\" I rushed right out and bought Sufjan's Michigan CD. It's almost as good. Buy \\"Illinois\\" today. You won't regret it.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Plans is a wonderful album. Not nearly as emotional or put together as Transatlanticism, but there are some beautiful songs on there that I know, according to Death Cab's evolution over time, could not have been made on any previous album. The only song that strikes me as odd is \\"The Stable Song.\\" I kind of just don't like it. But who knows, maybe I'll grow to like it, just like I grew to love \\"Natural Anthem\\" (Postal Service). Actually, I would've preferred if DCFC made an EP instead of a full-length...I feel like there's this pressure to fill a quota so some songs are rather pretty but also pointless (i.e. Different Names for the Same Thing). <br /> <br />For those who shop by song, I recommend the following: <br /> <br />    * Marching Bands of Manhattan <br />    * Soul Meets Body <br />    * Summer Skin <br />    * I Will Follow You Into the Dark <br />    * What Sarah Said <br />    * Brothers on a Hotel Bed <br /> <br />Marching Bands and Soul are probably the most talked about songs thusfar because their sound is the newest for DCFC. Lovely, in-love lyrics (Marching, I feel, has a tinge of the unrequited with it's \\"Your love is gonna drown\\" -- beautiful words by the way). I was elated about Soul Meets Body because there are simply not that many in-love songs being written now. <br /> <br />The real gems of this album, however, must be What Sarah Said and Brothers - retaining the simplicity of Transatlanticism, even transitioning into each other in one recording a la Tiny Vessels --> Transatlanticism --> Passenger Seat. What Sarah Said is definitely my favorite right now. The piano part sweeps through your headphones (yes, new Death Cab fans, DCFC is only fully appreciated with decent audio equipment), climbing high, starting low in one ear and flying off into the other, quickly so that your closed eyes follow it like watching birds take off one by one. And then the ending. Oh wow, the ending - easily reminds me of \\"I need you so much closer. So come on.\\" Myfavorite lyric of the album so far: <br /> <br />But I'm thinking of what Sarah said, <br />That \\"love is watching someone die.\\" <br /> <br />So who's gonna watch you die? <br /> <br /> <br />Sarah dealt a lot with death, and the first verse is pure genius. <br /> <br /> <br />And it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to Father Time <br />As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409 <br />And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself that I'd already taken too much today <br />As each descending peak of the LCD took you a little farther away from me <br />(Away from me) <br /> <br />Yet Brothers is definitely the more beautifully composed of the two - starting off slow and then surprising you with a beat you'd think to find in a trance mix. It will definitely hit a chord with most, more so than Sarah, especially if you're like me and suddenly realize while listening to Sarah, \\"Hmm, but [significant other's name here]'s not dying.\\" Brothers is a little more mellow, a goodbye that makes you sad but you've accepted it.  Also, I can relate to it a bit more. <br /> <br /> <br />And I have learned that even land-locked lovers yearn for the sea, like navy men <br />'Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides <br />Like brothers on a hotel bed <br /> <br /> <br />I think the major difference between Transatlanticism and Plans is that Transatlanticism was much slower. The pace gave you time to absorb each note and every word to its full emotional potential, in turn using all your breath when you sang along. The theme of missing someone seemingly an ocean away in itself is just a much slower feeling, much more empty, so it makes perfect sense for one instrument to do its thing at a time, simple and true. I feel that the emotions that Plans wants to convey are much more complex in themselves and so the million parts at once makes sense, an attempt to recreate that nostalgic, yet full feeling in your chest. Plans is definitely fasterpaced, with Sarah fit for a walking pace and Brothers good for a leisurely stroll. (Transatlanticism was intended for a state of rest, otherwise something would have conflicted - your heartbeat with the drums.) <br /> <br />Transatlanticism, having the luxury of covering a relatively simple emotion, was able to work with that and create the rollercoaster: the intro with The New Year, gradually laying out the story and the mood, until it suddenly hits you with Tiny Vessels, where your heart drops and you're a goner. If played at the right point in life, you're an emotional wreck from Tiny Vessels to Transatlanticism, and then comforted with every song afterwards - namely Passenger Seat and A Lack of Color. <br /> <br />Plans could not do this. <br /> <br />So Transatlanticism is indeed the stronger album but I don't think it's because of a lack of ability - as seen in the key songs of Plans - but because of the lack of focus. <br /> <br />A blessing in disguise, though. Those who had difficulties listening to Death Cab in the past (and yes, Transatlanticism was quite a hard album to listen to and appreciate) will find their work done for them with Plans. It is incredibly easy to listen to Plans, easy to see wonderful lyrics and hear pretty music. <br /> <br />For me, Plans could be a letter I sent to someone today, perfectly applicable, strategically timed in its release date (\\"Then Labor Day came and went and we shed what was left of our summer skin.\\")
0884271153|4.0|This is a great next book after \\"The Goal\\".  While \\"The Goal\\" was pretty well centered on operations, anyone can use the tools presented in \\"Its not Luck\\".  I think that this book is can help most in forming strategy or analyzing market conditions. <br /> <br />An excellent read that for anyone.
B00005JGAF|5.0|This was the third, and final, shot over the bow of rock music by the Ramones. Sadly, it didn't work for their career but it did help change rock music (along with their first two albums). After this, they would just tread water as lesser bands capitalized on their pioneering sound. This is the last great Ramones studio album, although they released some fine live albums and decent studio albums later.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I have seen so many 1 star reviews for this cd, that i felt it was my duty to post my thoughts to help reassure those considering buying this cd.  I would have given it a 4/4.5 star rating, but it needs to recover from all those 1 star shots! Firstly, this cd is different than other A7X cd's, there is little screaming on this album!  I bought this cd the day it came out, after really getting into \\"Unholy Confessions\\" and \\"I Won't See You Tonight, Part 1\\".  And while at first i was a little baffled, i have grown to love the cd.  So, here is my breakdown... <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot - 10/10 - A great start to the cd.  While it is a little odd at first, it will hook you. <br /> <br />Burn It Down - 9/10 - Another awesome fast paced song. <br /> <br />Blinded in Chains - 9/10 - Yet again, keeps up the intensity of the cd.  sweet tune <br /> <br />Bat Country - 100/10 - Yup, people have said it before...AWESOME SONG!  First time i heard it, replayed it 3 times just to let it sink in.  The chorus is just so effin catchy, and the drums are beautiful...not to mention a sweet solo.  No surprise this one hit the radio! <br /> <br />Trashed and Scattered - 7/10 - Okay, maybe it is just the pleasure of following Bat Country...but this one doesn't really do it for me.  I like it up untill the slowdown for the \\"trashed and scattered\\" part, i just can't feel that part. <br /> <br />Seize the Day - 10/10 - Really a beautiful song, love it! <br /> <br />Sidewinder - 9/10 - Got a really weird feel to it, and i dig it.   <br /> <br />The Wicked End - 8.5/10 - The lead in this song is just sweet! <br /> <br />Strength of the World - 9/10 - Just have to be in the mood for it.  Nice song, but an epic.  They definitely called up the orchestra on this one, but it fits nicely! <br /> <br />Betrayed - 9/10 - Really awesome song.  Took me a few listens to really get into it, but it's hot. <br /> <br />M.I.A. - 9/10 - A great song to end the CD, and a great song period! <br /> <br />So, there it is.  I suggest buying the CD, but that's just me.  Now, i know most people always suggest similar bands to look into, but i have a very varied taste, and i am going to just name a bunch of cool bands.  Yes, i am sure everyone will hate atleast one of them, but oh well! (CHECK OUT: Breaking Benjamin, Tantric, Minus The Bear, Dredg, Porcupine Tree, Coheed and Cambria, In Flames, Codeseven, and Blind Guardian)

0446310786|5.0|It is a sin to kill one, for, the mockingbird brings no harm to others. Compelled to read Harper Lee's novel in 8th grade, recalled enjoying it very much. Picked it up a few weeks ago to re read it now that I've been out of grade school for thirty five years or so...good God, it's brilliant. Miss Lee's evocation of her hometown places you right there in Alabama, you can smell the clover and feel the humidity,the characters are alive and the events are compelling. Atticus Finch is a genuine hero, complex and humane, a good father and a sage for his children. I wish the world was populated with more of these decent and inspiring individuals- but, maybe it is, it's nice to be reminded of what a dimensional human being should be. Great stories and great characters, suggest you return to Scout's town and reaquaint yourself with Cal, Dill, Jem and of course Atticus Finch and Mr Boo Radley.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|WOW... This was like having the Eagles in my living room! These guys are such talented musicians & singers. As a guitar player & singer myself, I respect anyone who can put the guitar down & play a piano or drums just as well Like Frey & Henley...(singing & drumming simultaneosuly is NOT easy at all). Joe Walsh ads a nice touch with his stage presence, awesome lead guitar work & his voice on 'One day at a time' was very good. Whoever thinks the sound quailty isn't good on this set needs their hearing checked: I'm also an aspiring audio engineer & mixer & this DVD is a sonic masterpiece! My friends were over & we watched this in 5.1 surround on my Sony home theater & agreed we all felt like we were there... The sound is amazingly crisp & the stereo mix is just excellent.. the drums roll form the front to the rear. The horns & the crowd roar from the rear as well...Add in classy packaging & liner notes & this is simply a must-have. Also, a few words about that \\"Other Guitar Player\\" some people on here are shamefully criticizing. As I said, I've been a guitarist almost 20 years & he did every lead faithful to the original recordings along with some great improvisations. His name is Stuart Smith... He's super-talented & deserves to be on that stage. He's one of those great guitarists not everyone knows about only because he was in many obscure alt-country bands... remember popularity doesn't always measure quality... Prime example: 50-cent sells millions of records  can be a fun listen, but what REAL MUSICAL talent does he possess? Can a McDonald's ultra-processed 'billions-served' hamburger hold a candle in terms of quality to one from a good unknown local Irish Pub...never! Smith is analogous to the pub-burger in the world of Mc-Guitar players...  For a little musical education: He's a long-time crack Guitar player for a great popular & alt-country artist - Rodney Crowell - who also has a terrific voice & great country-rock sound like the Eagles. Smith & Crowell werepart of the famous Country-Rock Notorious Cherry Bombs in the 70's, which spawned the careers of country-pop greats like Vince Gill & Ricky Skaggs & MCA-Nashville producer-extraodinaire, Tony Brown.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It makes me want to rip my hair out when this album is referred to as either a disappointment or not as good as their debut. \\"Room on Fire\\" is superior, in every imaginable way possible, to \\"Is This It?\\" Here's an overlong, irrefragable, and completely accurate explanation why:    To begin with, one needs to remember the musical landscape into which the Strokes' debut album was released. The years 1999, 2000 and 2001 comprise the absolute nadir for rock music in America in my lifetime, and quite possibly since the invention of rock itself. Too grand of a statement? Feel free to head over to rocklists.com and compare the year-end hit lists of KROQ, the nation's most powerful alternative/modern rock station, from these three years to ANY other year listed. (To save you a trip: the top three songs in 2000 were by Papa Roach, Incubus and Three Doors Down.) If you're older than 22, you'll probably remember these as the years your friends claimed they could no longer listen to the radio. It was into this post-apocalyptic rape-rock landscape that the Strokes' debut album was released. \\"Is This It?\\" sounds great on its own; against a backdrop of Limp Bizkit it sounded like manna from heaven. This is the reason the Strokes were the single most hyped indie band since, like, ever. You know how they claim there can never be another Beatles because there's simply too much music out there for any one band to dominate it so thoroughly? A slightly shifted analogy applies to the Strokes: there can never be another band as hyped because music will probably never be that bad again. And why did music get good again? Why are indie bands going platinum and dominating the airwaves? Because the Strokes made it that way. No, not on their own, but their importance in saving rock radio cannot be overstated. They, alongside the White Stripes, comprised the bulk of hope for fans of non-horrible rock only four years ago.     There were two things you could guarantee people would say about the new album when it came out: one was that it would not be considered as good as the debut. You could have bet the farm on that one. Hipsters tend to get embarrassed when anyone agrees with them, and the universal acclaim for \\"Is This It?\\" insured that the same people who loved it would over-correct for accidentally enjoying something that everyone else did by immediately turning their back on a band they championed as soon as the opportunity presented itself. The second criticism you knew would be levied against the follow-up was that it was too similar to its predecessor. If \\"Room on Fire\\" were free-form jazz produced by Aphex Twin, people would be complaining that the Strokes had simply copied the first album instead of writing a new one.    Let me refute both points. I have listened to \\"Is This It\\"? at least 200 times, and the most obvious criticism of the album is that it is divided into good and great songs. No one ever mentioned this when it came out because they were overjoyed to have anything good at all in their CD player and didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it's true. The great songs are \\"Is This It?,\\" \\"The Modern Age,\\" \\"Someday,\\" \\"Last Night,\\" \\"Hard to Explain,\\"  \\"Trying Your Luck,\\" and \\"New York City Cops.\\" Unfortunately, that last track was excised from the American version in favor of \\"When It Started,\\" which is simply very good, alongside the remaining four songs. This does not mean \\"Is This It?\\" is only a half-good album. It means that \\"Is This It?\\" is a half very good, half truly great album. Most masterpiece albums follow similar divisions. This is one of them. It is still a masterpiece.    \\"Room on Fire\\" contains nine absolute gems and two songs that are slightly less so. Those songs are \\"Meet Me in the Bathroom\\" and \\"The Way It Is.\\" Like their counterparts on the previous album, they are very good. The other nine songs - no need to type them all out - are all perfect. Any one of them could have functioned as a lead single. There'snot much more to say beyond that. It will simply turn into effusive babbling. And as for the criticism of repeating themselves: anyone who says this has not listened to the very album they're criticizing. How can an album that contains \\"Reptilia\\" be accused of ripping off \\"Is This It?\\" The breadth of styles, complexity of guitar interplay, and quality of hook on any random song on this album outshines that of any on the first. Julian Casablancas once stated that the criterion for a song's admission into the Strokes' playlist was that it had to be better than anything they had previously written. That's exactly what these songs are. The Strokes grew immensely from the first album to the second. Growing isn't copying.    A lot of Amazon reviews end with \\"If you like ______ , then get _______.\\" I'll do that right now. If you like good songs, get \\"Room on Fire.\\" You will get an album of exactly that. Better yet, you won't get any bad songs. Even better that than, the good songs aren't the type of good song that only has a \\"good part\\" - the whole song itself is the \\"good part.\\" If it were possible, I would get even less articulate to make this point. Perhaps you can picture me pointing at the album and smiling.    Get \\"Room on Fire.\\"
B00005JLK1|2.0|Ghost Ship (Steve Beck, 2002)<br /><br />My first time through this movie, Saturday night, I fell asleep about fifteen minutes before the end. (In my defense, it was two-thirty in the morning.) At that point, I was wondering why on earth this movie has gotten such uniformly horrible reviews. I immediately put it on hold at the library so I could catch the final fifteen minutes and review it.<br /><br />I got a chance to watch the final fifteen minutes last night. Someone please reassure me that such a high-powered cast had had the climax of the movie kept from them, because I can't imagine them actually getting involved with a project whose payoff is so phenomenally awful.<br /><br />The basics: A pilot named Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington of Wrong Turn) hires a salvage crew after spotting an abandoned ship drifting in the Bering Strait. The salvage crew, who are (this is Hollywood, after all) the best in the business, are intrigued, and decide to go see if there's anything on the ship worth rescuing. When they find it, Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), their leader, recognizes it as the Andrea Graza, an Italian luxury liner that went missing forty years ago, vanishing without a trace until, presumably, it showed up in one of Ferriman's photographs. The team head onto the ship, where, of course, nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />It has been noted that the original script for Ghost Ship actually was for a straightforward adventure picture about a salvage crew who go somewhat stir-crazy and turn on one another, with no supernatural elements involved. That shows promise. And in fact, most of the first three-quarters of the movie (with the exception of the first scene, which is the movie's best) runs just along those lines. It's deceiving you, you see, into thinking that's what it actually is. The crew start fighting amongst themselves over little stuff, the kind of thing you'd expect when a bunch of people have been in one another's company for way too long. And in that regard, the movie works; had it just been an above-the-arctic-circle-in-an-abandoned-luxury-liner version of Das Boot, it had every chance of working. But then you get to the inevitable \\"no, I'm really a horror movie!\\" climax, and everything goes way downhill way fast. I find it hard to imagine anyone actually watched the climax without (a) thinking of The Abyss (though not in the way you're thinking) and (b) laughing hysterically throughout. It's possible they had a few million left in the effects budget and wanted to blow it, but I get the feeling that whoever rewrote the script to add the supernatural elements had been waiting a long, long time to see his particular vision on the big screen. Well, he got it. And I can't tell you how badly it sucks without revealing huge plot points, so watch this turkey and see for yourself. After all, it's a ninety-minute film, and the first seventy-five are actually pretty good. **<br /><br />Oh, and I have to ask-- did anyone else wonder how so many crew members managed to survive for even a few minutes in the Bering Sea without contracting hypothermia? I mean, really.hat regard, the movie works; had it just been an above-the-arctic-circle-in-an-abandoned-luxury-liner version of Das Boot, it had every chance of working.

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I won't suffer <br />Be Broken <br />Get tired <br />Or wasted <br />Surrender <br />To nothing... <br /> <br />        The opening words to the newest album from Jared Leto and company.  The follow-up to 2002's S/T debut is a lot more than a stanza of poetry, but the line sums up the albums meaning pretty well.   <br />  This is an unrelenting album that not only showcases the bands musicianship, which is top notch for a rock band of this caliber, but also their penchant for writing huge choruses with great hooks.  Forget about solo's and thirty minute epics, this album is about tight song writing- songs with punch that say what they mean and get out before they're welcome is worn out. <br /> This is a departure in sound for this band that could, formerly, credit most of their influence to bands like Nine Inch Nails, Stabbing Westward and KMFDM.  It sounds like Leto has been listening to a lot of NIN still but has also mixed in some My Chemical Romance and The Used as the sound is more abrasive on this album.  While Jared Leto is still on vocals, his voice is less produced and more natural, with cracks and screams all over the place that give him a new sound and life. <br /> Giving nods to contemporary rock acts like The Used doesn't mean they've ripped that sound off but it does means that if you liked the first album, there is no guarantee that you'll like this album.  The lyrics are more personal, giving the album much more warmth then the industrially laced S/T disc.  Leto emotes much better on this disc and finally shows the ability to capture an audience not only with his previous acting career, but finally, with vocal lines that bring an audience closer instead of pushing them away.  <br />  The album loses none of the aforementioned punch throughout, though the first three tracks on the album are probably the best; i.e.:  Attack, Beautiful Lie, The Kill. <br />30 Seconds bills themselves as a progressive rock act, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them that.  They've got the rock part down... but why bother going down the progressive road when you can write an album like this?   <br /> <br />For fans of: Nine Inch Nails, The Used, U2 (yeah, they really have all those sounds) <br />

0375422307|5.0|Persepolis is one of those rare books that allows you to glimpse into another culture and obtain a completely different perspective. It's funny, poignant, refreshingly honest and political, all at once. The heroine is intriguing, flaws and all. Paired with part 2 of the series, it makes for a wonderful gift.
0156027321|5.0|I thought this book was incredible and definately worthy of the Booker. Many of my friends feel the same and we have had long debates about our various 'theories'. In saying that I currently have a friend who just cant get through it - yes it seems a bit pointless at times, even a bit ridiculous ( a tiger in a boat !)but people if you dont get to the end you miss the WHOLE POINT ! It has a brilliant 'oh my god''moment' right in the last few pages - so seldomly found(successfully) in many novels. Very clever - thought provoking, you may need to go right back to the beginnning. To those who didnt like it I would guarantee you DIDNT FINISH IT!

B000A7Q2DM|1.0|I have been a hardcore 30STM fan and Echelon member for something like 4 years now, and I was counting the days to this album release. Sad to say I was VERY let down. I wear my wristband inside out now in shame.  <br /> <br />30STM's first album was amazing. The guitar was heavy, there were ambient electronics and sounds coming from all directions, the lyrical content was ambiguous yet off the wall and interesting, and the drumming was stellar, with the electronic sound thudding through.  <br /> <br />Beautiful Lie basically has NONE of the aforementioned elements that made them unique and made me a fan. The guitars are dull, the vocals sound more mainstream, especially his half screams, the drumming is mixed way back so you can barely hear it, and almost all of the ambient electronic sound that made the last album sound so spacious and epic is sadly missing.  <br /> <br />This album feels like a really bad attempt at getting radio airplay and a spot on the Warped Tour or something. Too much touring with Chevelle and the Used seems to have infected the band with a terrible case of SUCKASS.  <br /> <br />I hope to god they can redeem themselves with a third album that returns to their once great and unique sound. Until then I will continue to listen to the debut release and despise this one.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Five years ago, Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan formed a second band and made an album which might be the best debut ever released by a side project. And even though 2000's \\"Mer De Noms\\" was very good, it still, inevitably, drew a few Tool comparisons. Fortunately, with their 2003 follow up, A Perfect Circle step clear out of Tool's shadow. Some songs (i.e. \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"Pet\\") are moderately heavy, but, for the most part, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is sheer beauty. It's easily the prettiest bunch of songs to be released these past few years; it has layers upon layers of beauty, and most of the songs seem very carefully planned out and well written. A fair number of the songs subtly, almost seamlessly, work up momentum and gain speed until the beat is fairly strong and moderately fast. (\\"The Package\\" is a good example of this song structure.) Other standout songs include \\"Weak and Powerless,\\" \\"Blue,\\" \\"Vanishing,\\" and the breathtaking album closer, \\"Gravity.\\"<br /><br />Songs like \\"Weak and Powerless\\" and \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" make it clear that, for this album, Maynard was largely inspired by his battle with drug use. (\\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a play on words; the album title is a reference to the Twelve Step program.)<br /><br />This isn't a perfect album, because some of the songs (like \\"The Noose\\") kind of go nowhere, and \\"Crimes\\" is a filler track if I've ever heard one. But the album as a whole is pretty enough to make up for these duds. Musically, this album is divine. The guitar strings are usually very light, dwindling, and eloquent. Combine this with relaxed and atmospheric drum patterns, and the result is 12 harmonic songs with very spacious and ominous atmospheres. Vocally, Maynard never fully detonates, but he moans, whispers, and sings cleanly in such a way that he pulls the listeners in and mesmerizes them. And the aforementioned \\"Gravity\\" is one example of Maynard's great vocal hooks.<br /><br />In conclusion, A Perfect Circle is, now, much more than a side project. This is a band which have definitely found their own sound and they've made an excellent work of art that anyone can enjoy.band which have definitely found their own sound and they've made an excellent work of art that anyone can enjoy.
0060751967|2.0|I guess I was expecting a book with alot more humor then this one had, although this book did have some humor.  The vampire hero was so ordinary.  He could have been any succesful business man in any harlequin novel. It was very slow paced and it took the heroine forever to figure out the hero was a vampire. Roman and Shanna were just not that interesting as a couple.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I really enjoyed this unusual movie, part sci-fi, part love story.  I found it nostalgic and adorable but I'm older than most of it's target audience so I don't know if it will be appreciated for what it is or thought of as \\"old fashioned\\", not enough blood, gore and noise for younger crowds.
B00005JMUA|3.0|This is the most dangerous review I've ever written--to me at least--and I'll keep it sort of brief; you don't walk through a cultural minefield without sweating a lot. I'm a big fan of all those splendid B and C movies that Herr Tarantino also loves. Just last month Bava's incredible \\"Danger, Diabolik\\" was released on DVD and I set off fireworks to celebrate the event. His \\"Planet of the Vampires\\" is probably one of my favorite films. Yet, I'm not a cult film/B-movie \\"head.\\" My true loves are the films from the silent era on that combine the best of everything. B-movies became a draw when I realized some time ago that highly talented directors often got stuck in places where they had minimal budgets. It's also interesting to see how small resources sometimes dictate stylized or ritualized plots. Then there's craftily working with and around mediocre acting talent.    This movie is interesting, but it's not nearly as interesting as many of the films that Tarentino allegedly pays tribute to. As hard as he tries, he never seems to reach the levels of sweaty tension of great spaghetti western, he lacks Bava's art directorial and camera genius (in fact he really needs to study and understand cinematography better), his action is lukewarm and oddly linear compared to nearly any classic martial arts product, he consistently fails to get top notch performances out of his people and those performances vary directly with the various talents of his actors (Carradine is decent here and so is Daryl Hannah--a very under-appreciated actress--but Thurman lacks range and depth and always has). Throughout this strange and disjointed film Tarantino seems to show that he saw the limits of a lot of his favorite films but barely grasped how those limits were often transcended. Tarantino never seemed to grasp how others made lemonade out of lemons.    Add to this Tarantino's strange inability to make each and every shot potent and meaningful (again, he needs to study Bava and Leonne better) and ultimately his awkwardness in making the whole (and the storytelling) greater than the sum of its parts. He seems to think primarily in terms of a series of cool things he'd like to see on the screen, which, regrettably, is not first-rate film-making. I'm sorry that many people, including the director, aren't noticing this and I blame lack of familiarity or true understanding of his source material, perhaps even a certain amount of patronizing attitude toward the products of other cultures.    What this movie comes across as is kind of \\"kids at play\\"--in Tarantino's specific case \\"playing\\" at being a film director, which, given his background, may be more than he cares to admit about himself. I'm not really trying to trash this guy and his work, I'm just upset that he's ransacked the genius of many Asian and European talents, made something up that's considerably less than what he's stolen, and allowed it to be presented to the world as some sort of tribute or summation of all this earlier work of other people when in fact it's kind of a self-indulgent \\"toy\\" movie.    Tarantino embodies a problem that's affected most of American culture in the last decades. Bluntly, we've become shallow and superficial, we've lost our ability to discern the inner workings of things, to grasp the sublime, to understand nuance, to notice and appreciate genuine genius, and to manage anything beyond our \\"specialty\\". \\"Craft\\" is beyond us since we now do everything on PCs and have lost the distinction between working with reality and working with pixels.     Few are outside of this problem and it shows up everywhere: from the inept response to Hurricane Katrina, to the spate of bad movies coming from Hollywood, to the idiocies of the political Right and Left, to our inability to make anything sensible happen in Iraq. Makeup is perfect, everyone reads their lines well, all those lines are spell-checked, every shot is perfectly lit, every set is flawless, every logo and buzzword \\"pops,\\" but beneath the shiny surface there isn't much of anything of any value any more--the best we can say is it has no merits but lacks obvious flaws. What the United States of America excells at right now is marketing images to people with no depth. We are the world's con-man. It's frightening to look at earlier products of American culture and encounter far greater talent and far better thinking.    \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" is an old movie that is better than \\"Kill Bill\\" on many major counts. \\"Crouching Tiger\\" is a contemporary film with better action, far better acting, much better cinematography, and a better script. Think of films like that and then think of the opening of this film where a dramatically (or even ironically) out-of-her-depth Uma woodenly delivers \\"her story\\" in a clumsily-written monologue. I've seen undergrads doing projects direct better and act better.    If I'm not \\"getting it\\" then what precisely am I not getting? As a tribute, this film is insulting; as parody, it's not funny and barely ironic, as straight film it's amateurish. I'd like to give it two stars but I'm not interested in taking an even worse \\"Not Helpful\\" beating from Tarantino fans who realize that all this criticism reflects on them a bit. Maybe a few will check out what I'm saying here, look harder and respectfully at source materials, and realize their idol has been feeding them Pablum. With a great director and a better cast imagine what these films could have been.
B00007GZR5|1.0|I myself am a big fan of Robin Williams.  But this movie is the worst in his career.  He does a good job with his role but the movie itself is slow, boring and could have been done in under an hour and a half easlily.  If you are looking for a Robin Williams movie that is worth the while, see Mrs. Doubtfire or The world According to Garp.  If serious drama is more your style, see One Hour Photo.
B0001I55OC|3.0|<br /> <br />\\"I'm absolutely happy that they made another one of Michael Crichton's books into a movie. At first I thought this movie would be a total blow because Paul Walker was in it and it was all about him, but to my surprise the movie did not revolve around his character. The plot was something new (excluding the time-travel scenario) and I found myself enjoying the onscreen presence of Paul Walker but only because he was not the \\"focus\\" main character. The action was good as was special effects, the acting was alright on the Male actor's part (Mainly Gerard Butler). However, Frances O'Connor and the guy that plays Walker's father--- is lacking talent, they're characters were lacking in serious likability and personality. This movie is short since it revolves around a certain incident that occurred in 1357 and only major downside to this movie was that the would-be modern-day villain or rather anti-hero in the movie wasn't around long enough for you to actually hate him. I haven't read the book yet so I'm intrigued and want to read it. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes a good time-travel movie with a certain twist to it.\\" ----The year was: 2003 when I wrote this. When I first watched this movie, I was skeptic from the get-go. After learning of its exsistence throught a Gerad Butler website, I was almost excited, but then I watched the \\"TIME MACHINE\\" movie and while I enjoyed it, I was right tired of time travel movies and didn't want to see another one of them. The more and more my mother mentioned it was based on a Michale Crihton Novel I never heard of, I kept rolling my eyes and basicly knew the movie would suck because of one denominator. \\"I'm so bad in 2F2F\\" Paul Walker who couldn't act for scrap. When I watched it --- well it turned out to be a different story. I liked a lot. At one time. This is basically the aftermath of watching it 3 times.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I'm a little less enthusiastic about movietized novels (except for LOTR) now and I'm beginning to see the flaws of the movie. And this was after I read the book when I borrowed it from the library. I gave it 3 stars at best, although I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the movie --- NOW anyway. I noticed that Richard Donner changed quite a bit within the existing storyline and the characters, and the editing for the movie was H-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. You could practically see where they deleted scenes out of the movie due to its tendancy to fly through every scene. One minute they're running and the next they're climbing over a wall and escaping the burning village. The entire primese of this movie was \\"Everybody runs\\" and that's just what they did. They ran and ran from the british. There was no time for explantions as to why everything in the movie was happening like it was, not enough time for Chritons famous complex explanations for everything he describes he in his books, and too much running throughout the entire movie. Even when they weren't running there wasn't enough of Chrihton's story to keep it interesting. For instance Professor Johnson or whatever his name was, was not Chris' father (although Chris did have a sort of romantic relationship with the female character Kate, but she never objected to it in the book and Chris wasn't oogling over her and bugging her about starting a RRS \\"Romantic Relationship\\"), Gerard Butler's character Andre Marek ---I was currently watching YU-GI-OH! so the mention of the name made me laugh--- was more over indulged in the movie then he was in the book and was a bit too \\"jumpy-jumpy\\" about his love for the past for my tastes. Kate was all in all the annoying character in the movie. She was played out as though she were one of those \\"I wanna do this my way\\" type of woman, so she is constantly shown objecting to all the guy's plans of escape or commencement. The French character Francois, had a minor role in the book and didn't join the group on their trip to the past (thus enabling him from being killed).Richard Donner did a good job with the first 3 Lethal Weapon movies, but when it comes to full blown science fiction movies he better leave it to someone who has a little more experience in this area. The acting/dialogue is the run of the mill B-movie type. The only saving grace for this movie aside from Gerard Butler is former \\"Xena's Warrior Princess\\" actor Marton Csokas, who plays the rouge De Kare (all they were missing was Karl Urban). When the movie reaches its' end, the action consisting of the \\"British vs. French amries\\", its really lackluster and doesn't have the same flare as several other war battles before it. The end of the movie was a let down. So all in all this movie isn't what its cracked up to be to me anymore. But if you're looking for a good B-movie, \\"TIMELINE\\" is way to go. ---- [a 3 out of 5]

6304039506|5.0|I have watched this video 40 times and each time I get more out of it for being so shockingly real. Williams is a genius in psychology and how human systems create insanity in  all the nuances of the collision between the gross and the fine, the male and female elements, gentile and vulgar, the delicate and the course, the inward and outward.  What female or sensitive male has not experienced this collision and been unable to explain it? But human systems create and maintain insanity and this video shows it the best. Stanley overheard Blanch downputting him to his wife Stella as \\"common and vulgar, like an ape\\" and he became vindictive, aiming to be rid of her.  This story unfolds around that plot and her grips on reality dissolve accordingly.  Initially hypersensitive and convalescing from a young marriage ending in suicide, Blanch is again confronted with sorrow in adapting to her brother-in-law and her zvengalized sister.  As Stanley becomes more ruthless, she seeks protection more from \\"Mitch\\" his buddy.  Then Stanley finds out that in her town of \\"Oriel\\" she was a prostitute.  Female psychology shows that early female promiscuity is often just a seeking of protection from the male element, and an inability to \\"just say no\\" is from fear of reprisal and lost protection.  But society doesn't see it that way and she escaped Oriel to her sister's domicile.  She wants Mitch for the same reason \\"just to finally relax--I am so tired of fearing.\\" Such women go from man to man for protection, and since it doesn't work regress more with time and as they are labeled whorish their sink into insanity is next. She was thrown out of the first town because of her affair with a 17-yr old boy, duplicated in a scene with the newspaper boy who was superbly kind, gentlemanly, respectful and gentle (in direct contrast to Stanley) and so here again, she kisses him as a link to gentile reality, and confirmation as a lady. The most ruthless and cruel contradiction is when Stanley rapesBlanche and soon after commits her to a mental hospital.  The \\"kind doctor\\" arrives and takes her away on his arm, and she seems in love, \\"always dependent on the kindness of strangers.\\"  The viewer is left to wonder what happens next--does she link to the kind elderly father doctor, and does Stella really reject Stanley for good, transfering her love to her baby?
B00000JLWW|5.0|Yes, that's quite a heavyweight title to place on a film from the late 1990's after decades of cinema's great romantic gems like CASABLANCA, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, LOVE STORY and even THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. <br /> <br />However, after all three hours is said and done, and the ship has finally sunk, I have never seen a love story's couple more committed and devoted to each other through absolute turmoil and tragedy.  I can remember seeing TITANIC (twice) when it was released in 1997, sighing, and thinking, \\"Nobody will ever love me that much.\\" <br /> <br />Happy to say, when I met my wife, I proved myself wrong. <br />Hooray for me...I mean us.
B00005JM0B|2.0|The big problem with the 3rd part of this series is the original characters should have been in this.  It almost seemed like a different movie without the original cast.  I don't know why, maybe they wanted too much money, but, I think this particular installment fell flat because of that reason. Too bad, because I really liked this series, and I'm not a big fan of Sci-Fi movies in particular.

0393317552|5.0|This book is amazing. It explains reasons why everything has happened the way it has for the last 13,000 years. It tells why it is not based on the racist belief that, who conquers who is because of race such as the English or the Egyptians but that it is based on many factors such as food production and geographic location. The book explains everything in a very precise way so that you will understand why the aborigines didn't turn into a thriving metal-using gun-toting civilization or, why Europeans and the Chinese didn't stay as cavemen still using stone tools till modern times waitting for some other more advaced civiliztion to take them over.  <br />      The book also in the beggining, enlightens people to the fact that we evolved from monkeys (surprisingly people still don't know that fact or don't want to believe it for that matter). It Helps to explain where we orginated from (Africa) and that there are five differents \\"types\\" of humans four of which still reside in Africa today. It will help you to understand how humans evolved to become tribes than chiefdoms and so forth. It will also help you to understand the importance of domesticated animals in the rise of civilization.  <br />     There is so much to say about this book. It is hard to explain completely without typing the whole book into this review. There is so much that this books explains and helps someone understand that it cannot be written down in a short review or a long one for that matter. It cannot be summarized in the regular sense because there is so much important information on every single page. Just know that if you purchase this book, which I highly reccomend you do, get ready for a eye-opening mind-blowing possibly life-changing experience that will leave you stunned at how much knowledge and understanding that you've just gotten from this single important book.
B00005JODA|2.0|I think in this day and age we sometimes go to the movies with this clandestine idea that some movies are good for us.  Especially foreign films.  If Alec Guiness proved anything by playing Obi-Wan Kenobi, a British accent can make any amount of bad dialog, and half hearted plot points sound like their Shakespeare. Monty Python made a career of making  fart jokes seem ivy league.  As an American I've always found British cultural to be a bit high brow.  Fernando Meirelles new film THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a highbrow film that pretends to be good for you, but in the end is all together cheesy.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a British diplomat who falls for Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a young student who becomes his wife.  When she is found dead on the side of the road brutally murdered Justin uncovers a mystery that challenges his friendships, and threatens his life.  What was Tessa involved in?  Was she having an affair with a young doctor?  Who's involved in her murder?  Was it an accident?  All these questions will be answered.  But I didn't buy the story at all.  So no amount of platitudes for the direction and acting could ever let me recommend it.<br /><br />Because the film is half baked.  It's got brilliant performances, tight and interesting direction and editing,  it's timely, and it has a polish and sheen of an Oscar caliber film.  But I kept asking myself why?  Why go through the trouble of crafting such an intricate mystery, only to bungle it with a half hearted and empty ending.  The film does a great job of showing some of the horrors that are going on in Africa and then ends on this note of preachy self-righteousness.<br /><br />I could rave about the performances for a whole page.  Fiennes and Weisz are fantastic.  Their chemistry works so well, almost too well.  Weisz is now becoming one of my most favorite actresses because she picks parts that have a lot of meat on them.  She could probably do a bunch of romantic comedies and be the British answer to Julia Roberts but hopefully she will chose not too.  Because there is an Academy Award waiting out there for her if she could just get the right part.<br /><br />As for Fiennes he always great.  I wanted to watch him in this film. Had THE CONSTANT GARDENER  been a movie more about the relationship and romance between Justin and Tessa I would have embraced it.  I would have praised the film because this is the only thing the film gets right.  But alas, the story gets in the way, and we're bogged down with content that supposed timely and important.  We get a mystery that depends on so many people,  the film has so many small characters we have to try and keep track of, and the conspiracy that is involved in the film is so convoluted and in the end it so mundane.  That you're left wonder just what was the point?  I left the theater saying to myself \\"Who cares?\\"  If I wanted to be preached at about the horrors of corporations and how they're killing the third world, I'd go to a DNC Meeting or turn on Air America.<br /><br />A film can be timely.  A film can build a mystery.  A film can even attempt to showcase the horror in the world around us.  In the case of THE CONSTANT GARDNER a focus on human passion and heart was sorely missed.  Many people will like this film, they will praise it for what they perceive to be there.

044022165X|5.0|John Grisham never ceases to amaze me at how well he writes his novels. This one once again is a winner with some of the best characters i have ever read. This also has a great plot with a superb ending that i was not expecting and especially the fact this actually does have some comedy added to it. Something you don't normally see in a Grisham novel. Never read a Grisham Novel? Read this one immedeately and you will see why John Grisham is one of the best writers today.
B00000J7SS|1.0|I was particularly interested to read the review entitled 'A Bad Acid Trip' - my suspicions confirmed, and that part of me that didn't want to believe it forever converted. My understanding of Miles Davis was that he was great at taking other people's ideas and using the superior marketing etc. at his disposal to make it sell. So many blind Miles fans just can't hack the fact that some of his stuff wasn't original, or even that good. If you really love jazz then move beyond this drivel - try some Albert Ayler or some Sun-Ra if you really dare to go out there. But then this is Amazon, and you probably have to buy a Coldplay album too, just because it was recommended to you...

B000002JS6|5.0|Yes, the wonderful band that brought everyone \\"Highway to Hell\\" is back. AC/DC one of, if not the best known bands of all time. Although their lead singer, Bon Scott died shortly after the recording of \\"Highway to Hell\\", AC/DC carried on. And boy did they! Nobody else could've done this CD like Brian Johnson did. His singing is part of the reason this CD did so well. Of course it also helps when your band has great guiarists, an excellent drummer and not to mention one heck of a bassist.  <br />As soon as the album starts and you here \\"Hells Bells\\" you know your in a a ride. It's rare when you can put a CD in and listen through it all the way and this CD just happens to be just like that. If you want AC/DC at their best, this is the CD to buy.
0440213525|5.0|John Grisham really hooked me into this story from the beginning with two boys just doing boy things at their age like sneaking into the woods and smoking. But then BAM they see a man who is trying to kill himself and while they try to help him out one thing leads to another and WHAM one of them is caught and thrown into the car with the guy and he confesses everything. When the boy finally escapes a chain of horrific events happen to the boy, his mother, and his brother. The FBI wants information and the MOB wants him to shut up. What happens next? Go buy this book now and figure it out. This is definetely not only one of my favorite Grisham books ever but is ceratinly one of my favorite stories of all time. This novel immeadetley made me want to go out and buy another Grisham novel. Read this book you will not i repeat will not regret it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&M takes a different view of metallica's sound, obviously through the use of the S&M orchestra. Odd combination, but it works brilliantly.  <br /> <br />Hetfield's vocal performance is a standout; he hits his notes cleaner than usual live performances. Hammett, Ulrich and Newstead are all at their best (as usual); in fact, the only problem i have with this album is their song choices. For example, \\"Sanitarium\\", \\"Fade to Black\\" and the \\"Unforgiven II\\" would have been perfect with the orchestra, instead of the below average tracks \\"Hero of the Day\\" & \\"Devil's Dance\\". <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the album has too many highlights to overcome this problem. Classics such as \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Fuel\\" and \\"Battery\\" feel right at home, and certain tracks such as \\"Of Wolf & Man\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\" & \\"for Whom the Bell Tolls\\" are actually a good deal better than their originals. \\"One\\" is the highlight of the album, as usual, although master of puppets comes close. Overall, a brilliant listen.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is one of those films where the cast and the plotting are strong enough to survive some extremely bad direction from Paul Greengrass. Former documentarian Greengrass might be overcompensating for what is in essence a pretty commonplace revenge story, but it seems far more likely that he's inadvertently done his best to sabotage his own movie by over-rationalizing each scene without realising that when they're all put together his mixture of shakeycam incomprehensibility (often in scenes where there is no emotional or narrative need for it), redundant shifts of focus, overediting and overly dark photography just makes him come across as an unimaginative Michael Bay wannabe hack rather than creating an illusion of reality or placing the audience in his amnesiac hero's confused shoes. Indeed, he's giving the audience even LESS information and frequently obscuring the action because he's forgotten that just because HE knows what's going on doesn't mean the audience will. On the plus side, this is much less of a problem on the small screen than the big screen, where motion sickness and whiplash were real possibilities, but it's still disappointing considering that one of the great joys of the original was Doug Liman's old-school direction - it was genuinely refreshing to see action scenes where the director was showing you the scene instead of drawing attention to himself after so many years of MTV incomprehensibility. After the problems on the first film, there was no possibility of Liman returning. It's just a shame they couldn't hire a competent director<br /><br />With such a handicap, it's surprising that it works so very well - especially since there are few narrative surprises (you can guess the villain long before a trusting sacrificial lamb gives him a crucial piece of information at the cost of his life simply by scanning out the cast list and looking for the first likely typecast suspect to jump out at you). But then the fun of the first film wasn't what it did, but how it did it, particularly the practical ways Bourne evades and eludes his pursuers: the first car chase exists in a credible milieu, constantly thwarted by traffic jams and crowds. The film even manages to find an environment where Joan Allen's eternal humorlessness actually seems appropriate, and it's a genuine surprise that the film's climax is an emotional scene that effectively damns its hero even as he tries to unburden himself of guilt. Impressive stuff despite the problems.

B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a ditzy, yet intelligent sorority president and fashion major with the perfect, handsome, and smart boyfriend, Warner. When Warner dumps her because she isn't \\"the serious girlfriend he needs\\" to advance his career, her whole world comes crashing down around her.  After weeks of friend's concern, manicures, and moping Elle realizes that the only way to get Warner back is to become a serious girlfriend, meaning starting a career in law at Harvard. Elle actually manages to get into Harvard, her specialty being the history of polka dots, with a high score on her LSATs, and with an original admissions video in which she showcases her talent for using legal jargon in everyday life and her ability to recall facts quickly, such as the previous day's soap operas. So Elle gathers her possesions, most of which are pink, prepares Bruiser, her miniture short haired chihuahua, and sets off for Harvard.<br /><br />This movie was not what I expected, but I loved it! It's a great chick flick to watch with a group of friends and has memorable characters. Elle teaches us that all we need is determination (and good fashion sense!) to achieve our dreams.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Having never listened to the orginal version of the album Let it Be, I know nothing of how Paul changed the sound of it. But what I do know, is that it's an ok album. If you haven't bought the Let it Be album yet, yeah I'd go with this one. The special second disk sounds much cooler than it really is though. The nice little Beatle practices you get to hear are pretty cool. But when they're talking, forget it... I usually can't catch much of what they're saying. But it's still cool to have I guess. If you just have 20 minutes to waste time that is... <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars because it's nowhere near The Beatle's best.

B000268QB2|5.0|I just got this album and I'm just simply amazed at the songwriting. The music reminds me of Coldplay, Travis, Aqualung, and the Posies. It's as good or better than Coldplay's Parachutes. I was surprised to learn that they are a three-piece band because their sound is so full. But I love that the piano--for a change--is center stage in the music.  <br /> <br />It kind of reminds me of the Posies without the wall of guitars. They've got that kind of melodious, gorgeous sound.  <br /> <br />Tom Chaplin's voice is amazing. It's so full and unwavering and sexy. I hate to say it, but I love it better than Chris Martin or Matthew Hales. It's so refreshing to hear a singer who's not afraid to belt it out with all of his soul. I LOVE that. <br /> <br />Very authentic band and incredibly polished music. Definitely recommend buying it.

B000053VBL|4.0|Truffault brilliantly brought to the screen Cornell Woolrich's outstandingly paranoiac thriller, The Bride Wore Black. And who but Moreau could have played the role of the relentless avenger who finds so many inventive modes to destroy those who killed her husband. On the church steps! I like Truffault's ending better than the novel's contrived ironic one. The novel, though fine, lacks the melancholic and weirdly comic quality of the film. It is a film that puts one in the uncomfortable position of rooting for its murderous heroine though one of her muders is especially distressing to both her and us because the victim is endearing. But see for yourself.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|When a group of talented musicians get together to formulate ideas for music, something magical happens.  And when the magic is just to our taste, they begin to be heard.  Death Cab's previous album 'Transatlantacism' was this exactly.  A perfect combination of the slow and somber and the happy and catchy, it caught itself enough attention for the band to be given a bigger label.   <br />     With Ben Gibbard still at the helm, Plans is an excellent CD all in all.  It opens with strong with \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\", a classic Gibbard-esque song.  The album continues on with a steady and happy pace, until #5, when it slows down to a beautiful acoustic composition with \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark\\"  Emplifying the whole albums idea that is trying to be put across.   <br />     \\"Love is watching someone die.\\" <br />The Rest of the album contains more catchy songs and I am excited to listen to it again.  Only 4 stars because it hasn't yet captured my heart like 'Transatlanticism,' but still an amazing album.  Make Plans to pick it up.  <br />
B000063UR2|2.0|Sure the set pieces look great, and the characters all look interesing...but that's about where it ends. <br /> <br />The story (if you can call it that) is lacking, there is almost no character development, and it gets boring many times through out the film. At the end I found that I didn't care one bit about the characters or the story, that's not what's supposed to happen in a good movie. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if Ridley was high while making this movie or not, but I'm guessing that he was. <br /> <br />As for so many people liking it, my guess is they saw it when they were younger and remember with rose colored glasses.

0380778556|4.0|For those of you who enjoyed Jane Eyre, this is a wonderful book to read as well.  Although it is practically a classic, it is very easy to read and the 400 pages go by fast (once you're past the first 100).
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I adore this movie. I know people in my life who could easily end up like these characters have. It's sad and pathetic. You feel for these people. They're addicts but they're human too. I hate when it's automatically assumed that addicts are horrible people - they're not. This movie shows how it can be anyone - even you. You can't lump addicts into one category - they're all different people.<br /><br />This movie is NOT for anyone who likes to turn their eyes away at the site of suffering, struggling people; anyone offended by drug use; or the squeamish. Also note that you will probably cry.<br /><br />I know one thing is for sure, this movie certainly makes me never want to do drugs again. That is, until a few hours later.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an amazing story you will never forget.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This soundtrack is beyond rating, like the movie it is a passionate, thrilling ride. I love the movie, and oviously the album as well, but I must say that if you didn't like the movie, dosn't mean you won't like this. It has wounderful tunes and the Japoanese flute is amazing, in all I give it a 1000-10!
B00006LI4S|5.0|After forty years of making some of the most popular music ever recorded David Gilmour has earned the right to kick back his heels and relax a little. Gilmour is no longer interested in the radical experimentations of Pink Floyd's early years or the conceptual epics of thier seventies hey-day. His performance on 'In Concert' is laid back and stripped down. The arena bombast of lasers, flying pigs, and exploding props are thankfully gone. The concert was filmed in a small theater and has a back-to-basics 'Unplugged' type feel, as Gilmour plays most of the songs on acoustic guitar. Casual fans expecting the hits will be dispointed. Gilmour includes some of Floyd's more popular songs like 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Comfortably Numb'. But his radical re-working of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' from its thickly layered synth prog-rock into an intimate, acoustic workout, touching on folk, classical and Spanish guitar, and even funk, demonstrates that Gilmour, now in his early sixties, still abounds with fresh, creative energy. He spends most of his performance playing songs by Pink Floyd founder Syd Barret. While I'm sure that most Floyd fans know who Barret is, I doubt they have ever listened to his music. Gilmour plays some of Barret's best work, like 'Fat Old Sun', 'Terrapin', and 'Dominoes'.  Hopefully after this introduction they will seek out his excellent solo albums. Gilmour includes obscure but sweet songs by Richard Thompson and his fellow band mate Richard Wright who joins him onstage for a number. The DVD includes some special features. The highlights include rehearsal footage and a performance fron the early 90's with singer Mica Paris where Gilmour plays some scorching blues guitar, reminding us of his mastery of the instrument. <br />    You have to admire him for his discriminating track selection.It would have been easy to just play a dozen songs from 'Dark Side Of the Moon' and 'The Wall', yell 'thank you very much goodnight', and cash in on classic rock nostalgia. But Gilmour appears beyond the point of caring about what's trendy or profitable. I've always enjoyed when world class musicians, usually late in life, no longer have to worry about making money or advancing thier careers and are free to  indulge themselves in the music they really want to play as opposed to the music they have to play. <br />    I do have some minor complaints. Since this performance is largely acoustic there are no red-hot solos. Gilmour truly is one of the greatest soloists ever, on par with Clapton and Hendrix and aside from the mournful blues number with Mica Paris his virtuoso soloing is nowhere to be found. Even the famous outro solo on 'Comfortably Numb' is way too restrained for my taste. I kept waiting for him to deliver the other worldly guitar pyrotechnics I loved from previous tours but instead he choose the minimalist approach. I also couldn't help but wonder how this music would've sounded supporting Roger Waters lyrics and concepts. Gilmour and Waters always sounded better together than apart. <br />If your a fan of the atmospheric, ethereal sound of classic Floyd you'll love 'In Concert'. If you're looking for the hits try the complilation 'Ehcoes'.
0880389052|5.0|This is truly amazing literature. From the first page you're immersed in the traitorous world of the drow, and so Drizzt is born. You actually feel like you're growing up with Drizzt. The some of the later confrontations get you extremely worked up. <br /> <br />The confrontation with Drizzt and Zaknafein(the last one) is one of the most emotional things i've ever read through in my life. Then there is the sacrifice which almost drew me to tears, it was so awful. <br /> <br />Seriously, if you are salvatore fan, you HAVE to read this masterpeice.

0345350499|5.0|This book was the greatest!! Don't listen to the negative reviews. They just can't appreciate a good Arthurian Legend. Bradley's interpretation was great!! For once I was not reading \\"Oh Lancelot saved this maiden!\\" or \\"King Arthur saved that maiden\\". The reader would read the story from the womens point of view (mainly Morgaines and Gwynefars). I injoyed every last bit of it and am reading the prequal to the book and the sequal. I hope this helps.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|A great DVD to have if you are a Michael Jackson fan. Worth every dollar I spent on it. There is a varying choice of familiar songs and a rewarding,committed and fulfilling stage performance from Michael Jackson.
0812550706|5.0|Just for frame of reference I am 15 and an avid reader, I read about 2-3 books a week depending on the size and I've got to say, this book is excellent. I actually heard about it in a forum and everyone was raving so I thought \\"I have to read this book.\\" so I ordered up a copy off Amazon. I was suprised, it was definately one of my favorite books of all time. <br /> <br />It starts out very good from the perspective of Andrew(Ender) Wiggin, a very young, small, and extraordinary boy. He is tormented by his older brother Peter and loves his sister very much, Valentine. He has loving parents but everything is turned upside down when he gets a device (that monotors his every move) removed. His first day another kid starts bullying Ender with a bunch of his friends. Ender has great intelligence and realizes if he doesn't hurt this kid bad enough the rest of his \\"gang\\" will beat him up. He ends up accidently killing the kid.  <br /> <br />He is then selected to enter a training program in space, little does he know he is their number one pick for the captain of the elite unit to kill another race called the Buggers. He is swept up into this extreme training and meets a lot of people along the way, he has some interesting conflicts as well. <br /> <br />Overall this book is written brilliantly by the master of Sci-Fi Orson Scott Card. The way he writes it you can really feel Enders pains and triumphs throughout the story. He also develops character very well, for supporting roles in this and later books in the series. <br /> <br />The best part of this book was the ending, it was like the ending of a book in the thriller genre. I loved it. I actually loved every minute of this masterpiece, finishing it in one day. I highly reccomend this novel to sci-fi fans or just the average reader. Oh and although it may seem to be for younger children due to the concept, parents don't be fooled it's a little violent for the average under 11 reader. <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker

0812550757|5.0|3000 years later and Ender is still as interesting as ever. This book is the sequel to the masterpiece Enders Game, this is the 2nd book in the Ender Wiggin Saga. <br /> <br />First off I must say, this book is a lot more advanced than Enders Game as far as the concept is concerned. Orson Scott Card does not hesitate to relate what he believes is correct about touchy subjects: war, politics, and religion. It's not quite as straight foreward as the first and has very interesting symbolism the first novel lacked. <br /> <br />Now lets dive right in. Orson Scott Card is a brilliant author and he proves it again with Speaker for the Dead. It takes place 3000 years after the first book ended and Ender is a full grown adult. Most of the book takes place on another planet full of an alien race called the pequeninos.  <br /> <br />In the book Ender is not thought of as a god as he was at the end of the first book, 3000 years is a long time and now, after Ender himself wrote The Hive Queen and The Hegemon, he has made people see that what he did, eliminating the buggers, was an aweful thing to do and now he is known as Ender, the Xenocide. He is also known as The Speaker for the Dead, as he traveling from world to world speaking about individuals lives after they die.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I don't want to give away too much, but I must say this book is one of the best. Not quite as good as Enders Game but then again, what is? <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker
0440419514|5.0|Given, these books are aimed towards a younger audience, but adults should find them enjoyable as well.  Pullman creates a unique, fantastic universe for his characters that is interesting and diverse.  It was very nice to read fantasy that was in no way a Tolkien spinoff!  I am particularly fond of the bear king.  Books 1 and 3 were better than 2, in my opinion, for overall plot and writing panache.  For those worried about the books being an \\"attack on Christianity\\" or any religion, for that matter, I think perhaps these books are best read by those willing to accept that different viewpoints are valid, that questions sometimes *should* be asked, and that a set of fictional books, while introducing new ideas, are not \\"making\\" a given young person think differently.  If anything, Pullman leaves the deductions up to the reader, and does not engage in preaching.
0743454537|5.0|Anna is a thirteen year old girl who grows up knowing that her older sister Kate has promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unlike most kids, Anna has to mature really fast to deal with everything that goes on in her family. The family has to live their lives day by day just waiting for Kate's cancer to relapse. Kate's type of cancer is the kind that spreads quickly through the body and targets nothing in particular, because the cancer is in the blood. Before Anna was born, her parents had a vision of Anna saving Kate.  When the parents decided to have their third child, with the help of pre-implantation of genes, they were hoping the third child would be a specific genetic match to be a donor for the older sister, since Jesse(the oldest son) was not. At birth all that Anna was suppose to give was her umbilical cord, then Kate relapses and Anna becomes the sole donor of blood tissue and other things. Anna struggles between trying to find herself, trying to be an independent person and knowing that she is the only one that can save her sister. Anna has to deal with being Kate's donor and with her sister's cancer and knowing that one big decision can affect everyone in her family. This novel is told not only by Anna's point of view, but also by her family's and two other people. Seeing so many different points of view really helped me in knowing how everyone in the novel handles the situations that is going on. The novel My Sisters Keeper really gets you into its setting and captures you so you don't want to put the book down; this novel is written for entertainment yet with compassion and family love.
1881273156|5.0|This book really helped me and my husband communicate our love to each other.  After 11 years of marriage, we didn't really know what was wrong just that our relationship wasn't going well. It turns out we were running on empty.  Using the book to identify each others love language made it easy to fill each others \\"love tank\\".  This book made all the difference in the world to our relationship.  It saved our marriage by helping both of us communicate our needs.  It also showed us how to fulfill each other's needs. We are more loving and happier than we've been since our wedding day. <br /> <br />Lastly, if one or either of you isn't a big reader... it is short and simple.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I bought this movie on a whim because I had heard that it was good and \\"different\\".  Well, it was both good and different.  My husband, especially, and I enjoyed it although it was a bit confusing.  Eventually, we were able to understand what was going on and piece everything together.  Very creative, original, and meaningful movie.  I think many viewers could get different messages from this movie, mostly based on love, time, and experience.  My only but BIGGEST gripe was that the dvd was messed up at one part and we couldn't see one scene.  We had to go past one scene and rewind backwards towards that lost defected bit to watch the movie!!!  However, for the movie, overall, I'd recommend it for those who want something out of the ordinary hollywood flick.

B0009PVZWI|1.0|Articles in the papers and Sony-owned media outlets are telling us that this and a couple of other albums released with this abominable copy protection are selling as well as forecast. What they're not saying is a lot of these sales are to people like me, who bought this album without realizing that it wouldn't play on their iPod or some of their CD/DVD players.  I have a 3-hour commute every day and can't even enjoy this CD (that I forked out 30 bucks for) because I might potentially, conceivably, and within the realm of possibilities be a thief. Did I just purchase this CD or rent it?      Sorry, Foo Fighter guys, I love your stuff but I wouldn't have touched this release if I had known it would be so user-unfriendly. What did The Who say?  \\"Won't get fooled again.\\"
B00008OLYN|4.0|opeth is my favorite band out there... and yet i give this four stars, not five, like all their other albums. dont get me wrong, this is a wonderful album in its own right. however, theres something missing: diversity. i would be saying the the same if they did an all \\"heavy\\" album, with no clean guitar sections or serene vocals. what i like about opeth is that thier songs are constantly changing, always keeping the listener hooked to what will come next, and they never disappoint. they broke that with \\"damnation.\\" but really, ho hum. they tried something new, and theyve done a VERY good job. my only criticisms are my own personal little gripes which, sadly, hold me a back a little from this album. anyways, this is brilliant, this is OPETH.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|A film to watch over and over.  The haunting quality of many of the scenes have stayed with me for years. (I have the VHS version).
B0009UC7HA|5.0|By accident, I caught an advance screening of this movie last night in DC. I'd heard negative reviews, but thankfully did not let that cloud my judgment. The chemistry between Matthew McConaughey & Steve Zahn is palpable. I didn't think the chemistry between Penelope & Matthew sizzled, till the end. But since we all know now that they're together...I find it amusing. Good for them! The location shots for this movie are phenomenal, esp Morocco. I'm bringing ALL my Moroccan friends to the movie when it release. It's similar to \\"National Treasure\\", but not as slick.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To the casual SciFi fan, Firefly might not seem like much, especially with it getting the axe so soon.  I had never heard of Firefly until a friend asked me to watch her DVDs so she had someone to obsess with.  I never got into Buffy, nor Angel, but my friend assured me that I would like it based on the fact that I liked the anime series Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Outlaw Star.  I was blown away.  The writing was witty, the characters are pretty (and the actors recognizable!), and the concept was believable!  I was very disappointed in the fact that this show was cancelled.  I don't watch too many shows on television due to them all trying to be bigger, better, and more dramatic.  Firefly was all about the underdogs trying to get by.  \\"Keep Flyin'\\" is the term. <br /> <br />The upcoming movie Serenity has given the story in Firefly a new life, and I'm counting down the days until it's release on September 30!
B00005JLPK|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until my girlfriend brought it over for us to watch. Reluctanly, I agreed to give it a shot. I was very impressed with what I saw. It is an emotional roller-coaster with excellent character development. I especially enjoyed Alfred Molino's performance. I don't recall her name, but I remember being surprised when I learned that this film was directed by a woman. That got me thinking...it's not often that you see a female director.
0060751967|5.0|Dentist Shanna Whelan is a woman with problems - she's in a federal witness protection program and working in a 24 hour dental clinic on the graveyard shift.  On top of that, after witnessing a brutal and bloody crime, she can no longer function well as a dentist - fainting at the mere sight of blood.  She needs to stay hidden and normally, she sat around by herself with very few patients coming by during the middle of the night.  The most dangerous part of the job would be dying of boredom!  With the ring of the phone, Shanna's peaceful world was about to come tumbling down - she'd been found by the bad guys!  It couldn't get much worse but after locking the doors and getting ready to run, in walked Roman Draganesti - a vampire with to his mind, an even bigger problem. He'd lost a fang after biting something he shouldn't have and had to get it reattached before dawn and his natural healing ability closed the wound forever.<br /><br />After convincing Shanna that he wasn't there to kill her - showing his bloody mouth and having her promptly pass out - Roman spirited her out, before the hit men busted in.  In Shanna, Roman had discovered a mortal who could block him out as he tried to manipulate her mind, and though SHE wasn't quite sure what HE was - other than a little bit odd, and enormously sexy - Shanna thought here was a man who she felt safe with and he just might be able to save her life.  Then again, maybe NOT, after she realized that the `wolf tooth' she had re-implanted was really a vampire's fang!<br /><br />***  This was an appealing, sometimes funny, and sometimes serious paranormal that I found enormously entertaining.  The lead couple was very likeable with the requisite sexual chemistry between the two, YET the plot was robust enough not that it didn't have to rely on heavy sensuality to keep the readers attention.  Roman, was not only one sexy vampire, but a brilliant scientist whose creation of synthetic blood saved not only mortals lives but kept vampires satisfied as well as he tried to create a world where vamps and mortals could live together in peace.  All of the characters from the leads, to a plethora of secondary characters, their backgrounds, and motivations were expertly drawn and kept the action fresh and lively.  I found myself chuckling out loud over the sexy double entendres, and totally enjoying `vampire sex'.  This was a true delight and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next in this highly entertaining vampire series. ---- Marilyn, for [...] ---sfied as well as he tried to create a world where vamps and mortals could live together in peace.

B0006419J6|5.0|Will Smith has posted a few turkeys in the last couple of years, but this is not one of them. It is easy to forget there is an interesting storyline here with all the explosions going on, but that being said, the scene in the tunnel is right up there with the Matrix assault on the government building where Morpheus is being held. You can re-watch just that scene over and over to enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing.
0783240287|5.0|With catchy tunes that stay in your mind long after the movie is done, \\"Joseph\\" is a delightful blend of musical styles ranging from classic rock to calypso to French cafe music.  The colorful, imaginative staging is just as much a treat for the eyes.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Can I just say that I love the Killers? They are awesome. To the people who claim that they're \\"sell outs\\" or \\"too commercial\\"... well, what's wrong with catchy, danceable songs that are performed by talented artists? Nothing!!! It's like the unbelievable dance music of Duran Duran and David Bowie re-surfacing for the next generation.  <br /> <br />The original Hot Fuss was a really great CD, one that you could just listen to over and over again without getting tired of it. Definitely the best songs are, \\"Smile like you mean it\\", \\"All these things that I've done\\", \\"Believe me Natalie\\" and \\"Midnight Show.\\" <br /> <br />With the addition of the three bonus tracks, this CD just gets better. \\"Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll\\" and \\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" are good listens that fans will appreciate, but \\"Under the Gun\\" has to be one of the best songs that I've heard all year. I think it may be even better than the radio singles \\"Somebody Told me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\".  <br /> <br />This CD is great. Enough Said.
0385510454|2.0|More of a spy thriller than a law thriller. This is one of his weaker efforts to date. He pretty much phoned this one in. <br /> <br />The problem with this book was not the amount of detail about Italian language, architecture, cusine, fashion, coffee, etc. It was the fact that so much detail was in at the expense of plot and character development. Sure, learning about Italy is interesting. But not the reason I picked up this book. I trust I could get a much better travelogue from another author. I don't need Grisham to do it for me. <br /> <br />***SPOILERS*** <br /> <br />After reading pages and pages on various Italian sights, I still have lingering questions. <br />- Who was the letter for that the Redhaired woman threw away at the airport? Did Marco simply try to send 2 copies of coorespondance to Neal to hedge his bets? <br />- If the CIA couldn't take out Marco since they can't target an American, how did they take out Critz? <br />- What happened to his friendship with Rudolph? Was it dropped after Marco used him for a mailing address? <br />- Why did Luigi and the other language tutor start to lose interest on one page, then on the next page, Luigi is surprised that they are moving to the next phase too quickly? <br />- One of the CIA agents was shopping for a copy of Marco's bag to switch. Grisham abandoned this plotline and just did a smash and grab. Subtle. <br />- What happened to the Chinese assasian? What happened to the CIA agents who botched it? What ever happened to the pardon bribe scandal? So many dangling plotlines. <br /> <br />If Grisham does attempt a sequel, I won't bother with it. But I don't think he was setting up for a second book. I think he was so impressed by his Italian knowledge that he wasn't willing to cut it back. When the book got long, he abrubtly ended it. A good editor would send it back. But really, before this book, who would have thought Grisham needed an editor? <br /> <br />

B000084T18|4.0|Ah...the ever so anticipated debut of the now well known New York rapper 50 Cent.  Straight from the streets of Queens this rapper made his way up by hustling in the streets and doing whatever he could to get his hands on some green.  He sort of wanted to get up off the streets so he tried to make it rapping.  He ended up signing a deal with Columbia and released a few albums which never gained mainstream attention.  Well all of his street activity eventually led to him getting shot 9 times including 1 shot to his jaw..amazingly he survives the shots he had taken.  After the shooting Columbia drops him from their label and now he was basically back on the streets.  Eminem and Dr. Dre later signed him to Shady/Aftermath, spliting the profit that 50 made.  Then in 2003, 50's debut was complete and ready to be released with a very big single behind it, 'In Da Club,' which was produced by the greatest producer of all time, Dr. Dre. <br /> <br />The album starts off with a little 5 second pointless intro of someone dropping some change and popping in a tape in a cassette deck.  Almost every track on the album is inspired by the streets.  The topics get very repetitive as the album goes on with only a few going off topic talking about different stuff.  The track '21 Questions' is a great track but it seems out of place on the album, it doesn't seem like this type of track belongs on an album like this.  The whole attitude of the album is..'Yeah I got shot but look who still came up and made it.'  The production on the album is amazing..Dr. Dre doing some of them including 'In Da Club' and 'Heat.'  Even Mr. Porter a.k.a. Kon Artist from D12 created a hot beat for the track 'P.I.M.P.' where 50 talks about his pimp game.  Lyrically, 50 isn't nothing special but he does come nice on a few songs like 'Heat,' 'In Da Club' and 'Like My Style.'  The last 2 tracks on the album are previously recorded tracks that were on 50's old albums he did with Columbia.  'Ur Not Like Me' is areal hot track, 50 is spittin' nice rhymes with a hot and catchy chorus.  The other one was alright, nothing special though.  The choruses on the album are all dope, most of them catchy.  The guest appearances all do real nice jobs with their verses, especially Eminem..he had hot verses on 'Patiently Waiting' and 'Don't Push Me,' making 50 Cent look like a Kindergarten rapper.  The infamous diss to Ja Rule, 'Back Down,' is a catchy tune but in my opinion an overrated diss that was placed at the #20 spot for the greatest diss tracks of all time by the XXL Magazine. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album to kick back and listen to.  There's nothing special about it, it's just something to relax and vibe to.  50 Cent was really dropping some nice rhymes and some people underrate him back in 2000-2003.  I will however admit that \\"The Massacre\\" was a huge let down and sophomore bust for 50 Cent.  I would suggest this album to almost any hip hop fan, it's worth your money only if you really like this type of rap.
B000002JAX|5.0|I have both Dreamland and Careless Love in my car CD player. I find Madeleine Peyroux's voice and style captivating. I didn't realize how much until the day I went to wrap-up a simple detail on a building permit. What should have been quick and easy instead brought yet another obstacle, just one of many I'd already encountered. It was the last straw! I stormed out in frustration. Steaming, I got in my car and headed for home - muscles tense, mental arguments flying. Dreamland was playing. Before long I felt myself relax. By the time I got home I was soothed and able to work through the obstacle... cool, calm and collected. <br /> <br />I hope to see much more from Madeleine Peyroux in the future. <br />
B0001YRVN4|4.0|I was very happy with the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD in general. I loved how clear the picture was and how they got rid of the black outlines on the AT-ATs and the rancor. However, the special edition (the only kind in the DVD trilogy) has a lot of digitaly added scenes that don't seem to fit very well with the more realistic set and puppets. In A New Hope, Mos Eisley is riddled with pointless digital add-ons (a robot hitting a probe droid out of it's way, jawas falling off the back of a large animal, ect.) that would have been right at home in Episode I The Phantom Menace. In the cantina scene in which Han Solo shot Greedo from under the table, Greedo never got a chance to shoot (in the original). I don't know if someone was complaining about Greedo not getting a fair shot or what, but now Greedo shoots first, then Han. Greedo fires, Han does some wierd dodge (more like a twitch) and shoots back. That aside, the DVD trilogy also has a good amount of special features which includes a large library of production photos, all of the original theatrical trailers, a very long documentary on the making of the original trilogy and three smaller documentarys: The Birth of the Lightsaber, The Characters and The Force is With them: The Legacy of Star Wars. There is also a short documentary on the recreating of Darth Vader in Episode III.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|This is my favorite concert movie from seeing it at the midnight movies to capacitance disk if anyone remembers them. And was the first tape I bought for my VCR. These are the best versions of some of there earlier music. The background clips as they record dark side of the moon.  They also let you into there life as they argue the point of producing there own albums. I practically like the recording studio fight between roger waters and David Gilmour over the volume level of his guitar. suggest you watch the original version before the directors cut both Included on the disk. BUT!!!! this DVD has completely reedited to just the concert and new eye candy and the studio stuff is bonus stuff get the VHS

B000001Y42|5.0|\\"Three Dollar Bill, Y'All $\\" was Limp Bizkit's debut album, and it rocks the house down. A lot of people will tell you that this album is Limp Bizkit's best work. I disagree. Listen to \\"The Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1\\" - brilliant music, their best thus far. It's also their latest album, and like fine wine, Limp Bizkit just get better and better with age. <br /> <br />But back to Three Dollar Bill... it is by far Limp Bizkit's heaviest, most raw-sounding album.  <br /> <br />TRACK LISTING IN ORDER, AND MY THOUGHTS:-  <br /> <br />1. \\"INTRO\\" (weird, almost creepy, and sets the tone for the rest of the CD).  <br />2. \\"POLLUTION\\" (Wow! Best song on the album: heavy, angry rap/rock/metal. Fred Durst's vocals are out of this world on this track. My favourite song on Three Dollar Bill).  <br />3. \\"COUNTERFEIT\\" (Unique sound, more rap than rock but still great. I love the way it starts very quietly and gets progressively louder/heavier).  <br />4. \\"STUCK\\" (The very start is brilliant, and the rest of the song is equally as good. Gets VERY heavy, great music!) <br /> <br />I can't go through them all or I'll be here for ages, but the rest of the tracklisting is:-  <br /> <br />5. \\"NOBODY LOVES ME\\" <br />6. \\"SOUR\\" <br />7. \\"STALEMATE\\" <br />8. \\"CLUNK\\" <br />9. \\"FAITH\\" (Remake of George Michael's original of the same title). <br />10. \\"STINK FINGER\\" <br />11. \\"INDIGO FLOW\\" <br />12. \\"LEECH\\" <br />13. \\"EVERYTHING\\" <br /> <br />######################################################## <br />BOTTOM LINE: A great rap/rock debut from the greatest band of all-time. Any true music fanatic will appreciate Lmp Bizkit. \\"Limp Bizkit: Better Than Everyone\\" -- it's true, too!  <br />######################################################## <br /> <br />CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS HERE ON AMAZON.COM FOR: <br /> <br />- Limp Bizkit: SIGNIFICANT OTHER <br />- Limp Bizkit: CHOCOLATE ST*RFISH AND THE HOTDOG FLAVOURED WATER <br />- Limp Bizkit: NEW OLD SONGS <br />- Limp Bizkit: RESULTS MAY VARY (Former member of the band \\"SNOT\\", Mike Smith, joined LB at this point after Wes Borland [Limp Bizkit guitarist] temporarily left the band.  <br />- Limp Bizkit: THE UNQUESTIONABLE TRUTH, PT. 1 (Wes Borland returns for Limp Bizkit's latest musical venture!)

B0006IUDXA|5.0|I bought both the first and second seasons of MacGyver for my boyfriend's birthday and he LOVES them. If you grew up watching MacGyver in all his craftiness then go out and get the DVDs- its fun (and kind of funny) and clever and now you can cater your MacGyver watching to your preferences. MacGyver fighting crime in the big city? MacGyver fighting international terrorists? MacGyver using orange juice to develop film? It's all right here. Also I'd recommend \\"The Unofficial MacGyver How-to Handbook: Actual Working Tricks as Seen on TV's MacGyver\\" (buy it \\"used\\" which buys it from the publisher itself and is actually brand spanking new) to go with it so you can go on your own MacGyver adventures.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|If you have been listening to any rock stations as of late, you would have had the pleasure of listening to a band that has totally reintroduced themselves. I'm talking about the band Theory of a Deadman. They just released their second album Gasoline this April. It has been a three-year drought since their first album Theory. Why has there been a dry spell for this band? When the band first came out onto the scene, they released their first single \\"Nothing Could Come Between Us\\" which sounded like a song that should have been sung by the band Nickelback. So everyone listening to the radio thought that it was Nickelback even though it wasn't. So it seemed like Theory of a Deadman didn't become as popular as they would have wanted. So what kept the band from dropping off of the charts completely? Their love for music and their want to supply the world's youth with meaningful music, probably kept them going. It was also the three-band members ability to write songs about how people have to put up with love and the pain it can cause everyday. The first album only had a few songs that would fit that bill. So they figured that since those songs became decent hits, they would make the whole next album about the hurt that love can cause. So they released a CD jam packed with thirteen tracks, hopefully launching them into super stardom. Then that great day in April of this year they released their first single \\"No Surprise\\" and that was just it. The song became a smash hit. They would no longer be the opening show but the headliner. Starting mid summer they went on a huge tour with Submersed, which launched them further into super stardom. This band is becoming loved by more and more because of their wide variety of music playing and they use lyrics that mean something to them. Not to mention, just about every person on the planet can relate to the pain a broken heart can cause. Lead singer Tyler Connolly does an excellent job of making you believe that he is singing aboutyou with great lyrics and he does it with a distinct voice that resembles the great voices of Scott Stepp of Creed and David Draemon of Disturbed. Most people have to deal with heartbreak and these three men of Theory of a Deadman do an awesome job of putting feelings you would have, into words. Not only is this CD great because of it's powerful lyrics, but because the band uses different tempos in the songs to keep you on your toes. You can go from the heavy hitting guitar riffs in \\"Hating Hollywood\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\" to the tear jerking rhythm of \\" Since You've Been Gone,\\" \\"Santa Monica,\\" and \\"In The Middle\\". Not to mention you can get your adrenaline rushing with their blood rushing single \\"No Surprise\\". I feel this disk has a plethora of lyrical greatness and melody that can make you happy and cry in the same disk. Hopefully we will be hearing new stuff from them in the future. Until then grab yourself a copy of Gasoline and listen to the next Beatles caliber band, because they get two thumbs way up.
B000777J2S|5.0|The album is great and the Mercury Prize folks seem to agree.  The album beat out the likes of the Kaiser Chiefs (Employment), who were considered the favorite to win, Bloc Party (Silent Alarm), and even Coldplay (X&Y).  The Mercury Prize is given to the best British or Irish album of the year and albums are based on quality, not commercial sales or popularity, which is obviously the case this year.  Last year's winner was Franz Ferdinand.  My opinion is surely not enough to make you buy it, but hopefully the Mercury Prize will make you but it, because you should.
B00005JODA|5.0|Star Wars was good (thank god) War of the Worlds was overrated and Batman Begins did redeem itself after the last two crappy Batman films. What we did not have this year was a film that grab you and shock you to the core with its issues. A film that has superb acting and a great visual sense of self.  Well, we finally have one and it's called the Constant Gardner. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give the best performances of the year in a story that will disturb you and scare you at the same time with its issues about corruption, evil and the power of love.  Fiennes is great as a man searching for the reasons why his wife was murdered and discovers treachery at every corner and Weisz is amazing as his late spouse who in flash backs tries to fight for the people of a small village who are being victimize by a big pharmacy company who does not care about how it's treating the people as lab rats for it's experimental medicines. The story is a compelling look at one man's fight to find the truth and find his faith again in the person he loved the most in his world and find a way to redeem himself in her eyes. Fernando Meirelles directs this movie in such a flawless manor that it often feels real in some aspects and the characters by Weisz and Fiennes will leave a mark on your heart after the move ends with their grace and their humanity.  <br /> <br />I was genuine moved by this film and I suspect that you will to.  <br />
0385486804|1.0|this is not even a book, its so hard to understand and there at least 20 different people that are focused on, this is just a huge essay, DONT GET IT!!
1400032717|5.0|This is one you don't want to miss. The narration is from the point of view of a kid who has Asperger's Syndrome. In fact, the idea is that this child, Christopher, is writing this book himself to recount certain events. It was a very different and interesting perspective. Christopher has an extremely logical mind and does not feel emotions like a normal person would, and the author did a great job of reflecting this in the narrative. Christopher is also a whiz at science and math, and he frequently goes off on tangents about various scientific topics. (I personally loved these tangents because I like science--I thought they were fascinating!) Mr. Haddon really made me understood how the mind of a person with autism/Asperger's syndrome might work, and I have really learned a lot about the condition. <br /> <br />Christopher's lack of emotional attachment to anyone really surprised me. I felt very sorry for his parents in this regard. It must be sad to have a child that you love and protect who doesn't really show his emotions about you at all. I also felt a little sad for Christopher. He had big plans of going to university and having a career as a scientist, but I'm not sure he'd be able to do that, just because he had a lot of trouble even functioning normally in the train station, for example. Perhaps he could, but not without a lot of help. <br /> <br />Although the 'plot' of the book was about Christopher's investigation to find out who killed Wellington, the book was really about Christopher and what he learns during this time. He accidentally uncovers a secret about his family that his father has kept from him. There is a great deal of irony in the fact that he discovers the situation surrounding his parents' marriage and forces everyone into highly emotional situations without really feeling any emotion about this himself. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book told from an original point of view. <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Fantastic! I know every song by heart. The songs are strong enough to stand on their own even if you are not familiar with the story. Both Menzel and Chenewith have perfect voices to sing the power balads. My favorite song is \\"For Good\\".
B000000ZKD|1.0|This album is not funky nor is it soulful.  Lame.  Unhip.  It is a travesty.  They had so much to work with and put together so little.  If you like 70s elevator music, you'll love this.  I listen to all jazz and funk...this album is rancid.  I love the Beatles, this is a disgrace to both r&b and the band.  They should have all been white for all I could hear.  Maybe they were looking for more coke money...they sound spun(and deaf.)  All I can say is shame.  They get one star for the cover.  Talk about an over rated hackfest.  HACKFEST.  HACKFEST.  TERRIBLE HACKING HERE.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|I haven't listened to a CD more since Jagged Little Pill.  Through a friend of a friend, the name James Blunt was dropped in the conversation so I decided to buy the CD, having heard it was great. <br /> <br />That person was wrong.  This CD is fantastic!  It is so incredibly heartfelt.  I listen to this CD over and over and over, and it being only about 40 minutes long, that's not hard to do.  The shortness in length is my only complaint.   <br /> <br />The songs \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Good-Bye My Lover\\" actually gave me chills when I listened to them the first half a dozen times, and the feeling has diminished only slightly after hearing them countless times by now. <br /> <br />I can't say enough for James Blunt as an artist.  His lyrics are wonderful and actually meaningful, which is a rarity indeed in today's music business.  His voice is rather high, but now I don't even think twice about it when I hear him sing, it takes only a short while to get used to. <br /> <br />I don't think a CD can ever come more highly recommended.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I got to give them credit for deleting &quot;Perfect lover&quot;, from the original issue, and adding &quot;The Pinnacle&quot;, &quot;The Devil Game&quot;, and &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot;. &quot;Perfect Lover&quot; didn't really fit into the KANSAS style anyway. I can never figure out why they never include &quot;Hopelessly Human&quot;, in any of their compilations, because that's my favorite song of all-time. KANSAS has gone a little compilation crazy over the last few years. They put out the boxed set (which should have been four or five discs, instead of just two), the ultimate KANSAS, Sail on, and a handful of others official and unofficial. But adding those three I mentioned to this release, really make this album a lot more attractive. Those three are definately some of my most beloved in the entire KANSAS discography. If you really love KANSAS, I wouldn't settle for just this best of, but aquire at least all the studio albums that the original group released. I sometimes like the songs better that don't ever appear on their compilations. One big mistake they made on this best of collection is they cut out over a minute of the song &quot;SONG FOR AMERICA&quot;, this was totally unnecessary. It just ruined the song because you can tell exactly when they cut that part out. It's just very glaring too me. Hopefully they can put &quot;SONG FOR AMERICA&quot;, back in without being cut, but I won't hold my breath. I guess I could care less because I have all of their studio albums anyway. I think some day they should put out a real boxed set, with maybe five discs instead of two like they did over ten years ago. If you still would like to buy this after my gripes, then buy and enjoy!!!
0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber is the best thing that ever happened to the small business owners of this world.  Reading this book changed the way I thought about business.  Today I am a marketing coach for professional service firms and small service business owners. One of the first books I recommend they devour is The E-Myth. Actually, I recommend everything Gerber has written.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|I remember shopping at a music store way back in November of 1986. I was shocked to see a new KANSAS album because I had heard that they had disbanded back in 1984, but I was quite pleased to hear that Steve Morse was now in the band. I had heard some of his previous work with the DIXIE DREGS and really enjoyed it. I knew that he was one great guitar player, so I eagerly bought this superb album. He didn't disappoint. This is a far better album than it's predecessor DRASTIC MEASURES. &quot;Musicatto&quot; is just a superb instrumental. I don't think they had done one of those in a long time. I also really like the track &quot;Three Pretenders&quot;, &quot;Tomb 19&quot;, &quot;Silouettes in disguise&quot;, and &quot;We're not alone anymore&quot;. Steve Morse just blazes through this superb rocking album. I also liked Steve Walshes vocal contributions as well. I saw the great tour for this album, and boy they didn't disappoint in the least. The very start of the concert was great because they started it in the dark with the song &quot;Musicatto&quot;. I just had goosebumps all over my body. It was just amazing. I had to go see them again with my friend Randy about 2 weeks later. The concert was that good. I never would have thought that Steve Morse would ever be the lead guitarist in my all time favorite band, but unbelievably it actually happened. Just buy this underated gem, you'll be glad you did. ENJOY!!!!
B00008OLYN|4.0|With all the reviews of this album I have not heard one objectively negative thing from a fan (hardly).  This is a good album, sure.  I do prefer the albums that have a mix of heavy and mellow opeth but this is good nonetheless.  BUT...I was expecting more out of this cd.  In my opinion the songs on here generally don't match songs like \\"To Bid you Farewell,\\" \\"Credence,\\" \\"Face of Melinda,\\" \\"Drapery Falls,\\" \\"A Fair Judgement,\\" \\"Atonement,\\" or \\"Isolation Years.\\"  Everyone says this is mellow so it is different then other Opeth albums and then they do not venture to compare it to other Opeth albums.  It is in fact legitimate to compare this to other Opeth albums because they have done mellow songs on all of their albums since morningrise.  This is good but it could have been better.
B000002Q88|4.0|This album only really deserves a 3 and 3/4 star rating, but it's far from a total dud. I really only pull this out to play maybe four or five songs. I thought that &quot;Inside of me&quot;, was a great candidate to be put out as a single, but I won't cry too much about that. The track &quot;The Preacher&quot;, is really one of their most rocking songs in their career. Two other great tunes are &quot;One big sky&quot;, and &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, but really this was the first KANSAS album that had a lot of filler material. I really wish that Steve Morse would have stayed for another few albums, but I guess that's just wishful thinking. They really could rock live with Steve Morse. I saw them two times during the POWER tour back in 1987. They were so great the first time I had to see them again. Steve Walsh had to have surgery on his vocal cords and they had to cancel back in 89', so I really missed another good show. Have a good one!!!!

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears hit the charts in late 1998 with her No. 1 smash, Grammy-nominated classic \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and has since ruled the roost of pop music.  Her fourth studio release, the 2003-2004 smash hit In the Zone, shows us the pop princess heading into more unfamiliar ground as an artist.  Reminiscent of Madonna's Ray of Light, this heavily dance-oriented record has all the makings of what listeners have come to expect from Britney: fun, funky, sultry music.  Sure, there's heavy reliance on technified bleeps and whistles but that really doesn't matter; In the Zone is a great adult-veered album.  Grammy-winning \\"Toxic\\" is the definite standout track, 2004's best single and showcases Spears' surprisingly strong -but always throaty- vocals, but \\"Everytime,\\" her self-penned ballad about Justin Timberlake, is a close second.  Opening track and first single \\"Me Against the Music\\" is a worthy entry in any club, as is \\"Boom, Boom\\" and \\"Breathe On Me.\\"  Britney also co-wrote or wrote (as in \\"Everytime\\"'s case) many of the 12 tracks on Zone, proving this girl is more than just a pretty face.  Call her overtly sexual, raunchy or say she's gone too far, but Britney Spears is here to stay, whether you like this pop super-superstar or not. <br /> <br />Personal Note: Saying Britney's gone too far is stupid. Just listen to rap music or some of today's hottest hip-hop.  Look at what they're wearing and what they lyrics contain (bleep this & bleep that) and what they are about (eg. \\"I kissed my wife with my fist\\"). Riiiighhhhhhhhhtt....and Britney's gone too far.  & if you don't like Britney don't say anything. This is to fairly review music, not bash the person behind it.

1592400876|2.0|A ninth-grade English schoolmarm might slap her plaid-clad knee and cackle with glee at this book's contents but the rest of us will probably have had enough of Ms. Truss' one-joke inside humor by the bottom of page seven. If you suffer through her lessons in punctuation, you can, if you're so inclined, learn a few things. (I guess.) Goodness knows modern America is none too literate and Lynne Truss' effort at raising the national consciousness about the proper use of the comma helps.<br /><br />Would possibly have been better without the attempts at mirth.
B0009UC810|5.0|I had forgotten how enjoyable this movie is, and with added scenes, it is better the 2nd time around.  My favorite scene in the movie is John Lee Hooker, this version has the complete BOOM BOOM, as raw as you will ever hear blues short of Maxwell treet and Robert Nighthawk, the extra little additions makes The BLUES BROTHERS grittier, more musical, speaking of which, I didn't expect the sound track to be much, man was I wrong.. its as good if not better then many new DVD's I have, much better. Kudo's to the engineer.  Did you know Jack Nicholson was in the front row during the great stage performance with Cab Calloway and The Blues Brother band.  Incidently, you probably know that the members are real bona-fide musicians, some playing with Paul Butterfield, Sleepy Le'beef, on and on. I saw Hooker many times but never with this raw  Maxwell sound which is where he is playing, take a good look, most of Maxwell Street has been mowed down, too bad, Muddy Waters, Houston Stackhouse, Howlin' Wolf.. most of the icons payed there dues on Maxwell Street.  I'm not a big R&B fan, Dirty ole' nasty junky blues is my occupation and enjoyment, but, the combination of styles give the R&B a back bone that you won't hear any place else and with Belushi and Ackroid together, it is up there with any combinations of comedians from the Marx Brothers to the THREE STOOGES with a sound track of juicy tunes.. listen to what I say.. I'm On A Mission From Gawd.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park might be the only band I know of that is considered a joke by many true audiophiles,  but loved by quite a few people who could be considered music elitists(you know the kind of person that leans toward iconoclasticism, thinks that vinyl is sacred, and that anyhting new is inferior unless indie label).    Well, I think it can be attributed to the rapping along with the popularity amongst the younger ansgty teens.  The rapping has its moments where it can be PRETTY cheesy.  This almost lost me.  And in my opinion this is the only valid excuse for not likeing LP.  It took me almost until the 2nd album came out to go from laughing at them to liking them.  I started cranking the album up as a joke (it was my room mate's).....and next thing I knew there were about 7 or 8 songs I really liked.    Its sometimes cheesy, but sometimes very inspiring and it can be fun at the same time.  What I don't understand and would like explained to me is what makes people think that these guys are in any way fake or applying a sell out formula because thats not what I hear and I've heard a lot.      But here's the real irony.  Most of the people who hate this band probably consider themselves open minded and think that the fans of LP are trend-following sheep.  But this is a SOCIAL rule to come to the determination that LP is a worthless band (i.e. \\"once its a trend you're a sell out and not creative\\").  Using such a social construct to determine what you like is the very opposite of opening your mind.  So who's the sheep?

B00001NFCY|1.0|Anyone with more than 50 CDs should know that Scott Stapp is a total joke.   Actually the sad thing is that the melodies could be part of a decent CD.  But what an idiot.  The Eddie Vedder thing is so transparent and pathetic.   <br />If you really like Creed , I can name 10 great bands you've never heard.  And I bet you can't name one that I haven't heard.  What does that tell you.  That you're musically retarded.
0679731725|5.0|This book is simple and eloquent with an undercurrent of humour.   On one level it is an illustration of the conflicts between duty and desire that most people experience.  At another level, it really is about a man reminiscing about his life - the choices he has made and what he has forsaken. We all reminisce in varying degrees about the past, and this is where I think the book strikes a chord with most readers.   It is an excellent read, that I highly recommend.

Does anyone know if the sountrack is likely to be reissued?  I would LOVE to have that!!!  The only \\"bad\\" thing about this film is that Jim Henson is not the voice of Kermit in it.  :-(

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I was very frustrated because I kept catching snatches of this program on PBS and never heard the show in its entirity until I ordered the DVD. I sat spellbounded. <br />     What wonderful voices and the adaptations were fantastic.  Enya's music is so intricate that it would be difficult for any artist to sing her songs and do it justice.  The Celtic women on this DVD came closer than any I've heard so far.  I think Enya would give them a nod of approval. <br />     Personal favorite?  Chloe Agnew's \\"Nella Fantasia, Walking in the Air, Someday, and Jesu Joy of Man's Dersiring.\\"  Her vocals are pure and soar magnificently. For one so young, one wonders what she will be like in ten years. I've listened to it over and over again and still, I'm amazed.  <br />     \\"Harry's Game\\" by Orla was haunting, \\"Suil A Run\\", and \\"Si Do Mhaimco\\" were great as was \\"The Soft Goodbye\\".  The compilation on \\"One World\\" was a blend od perfect harmony. <br />     Will enjoy it for years to come.  I think this one is a keeper for my media library and hope for another by the Celtic women soon! <br />
B0007O38F8|4.0|Now Get Rich or Die Tryin is a tough album too follow up on but 50 was stuck with the task of doing it.  Now this album is hot and I listen to it a lot but it is merely average compared to Get Rich or Die Tryin and that is why I was dissapointed because one should always get better no matter how good their last album was.  I actually give this album 3.5 stars but you can't give half stars so you're supposed to round up from .5 so that is how I came up with 4 stars...(sorry about that sounding like a Math lesson)
0618477977|5.0|The polar express gift set which includes a hard cover color illustrated book, an audio CD and an audio tape and of course a silver bell, well maybe not silver but a bell with a red ribbon with polar express written on it, is definitely an excellent memorbilia gift for any child.
B0002OERI0|5.0|With this album it's as though Green Day finally figured out why everyone loves Time of Your Life so much and decided to commit an entire album of its always scathing, insightful lyrics to melody and rhythm instead of focusing merely on creating an almost impenetrable wall of sound.  The results are astonishing.  Jesus of Surburbia, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Are We Waiting, Give Me Novacaine, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and Whatsername all are powerful, strong, hard, and eminently listenable.  It might not be too much of a stretch to say that American Idiot is this generation's Exile On Main Street: a cultural anthem for a moment in history.  At the very least, it's a great rock album that will leave anyone jamming and dreaming of a world in which anything is possible--which is the best, rarest promise that music can give us.

B0009ML238|5.0|This CD is for progressive rock fans ! Absolutely beautiful sound ! The guitar sounds great and the progession from slow to hard rock is excellent. All fans of Dream Theater, take a close look at this CD, it's really worth it !
B0006399FS|4.0|Altough this isnt as good as the critics say it is, its still a very  nice album with many good songs, and even some classics! <br />The classics: City of blinding lights, Miracle drug, Sometimes you cant make it on your own. <br />Good songs: Vertigo, All because of you, Man and a woman, One step closer. <br />The rest of the album is sadly not that good, but still its a fantastic record from the worlds biggest band.
B000063DFN|4.0|Another Maiden album that is part of a whole line of albums that most consider \\"classics.\\" Relentless touring for this album made Iron Maiden much bigger than they were before, especially in America. \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" is arguably Maiden's best known song. \\"Aces High\\" is one of my favorite of Maiden's shorter songs, with great vocals and guitar solo. The title track is one of the greatest mini-epics that Iron Maiden has written (along with \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\"). I wish Maiden had done more songs with an actual riff; the Egyptian themed riff is awesome, and the guitar solo section in the middle is one of their better interludes. \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is based on the epic poem of the same name, except, unlike the poem, this song is actually interesting. This is probably one of Iron Maiden's more accessible albums, making this a great album to get into their music.

B0009MAO46|5.0|I only had this one on VHS as I'd somehow missed the original DVD releases of the first two Toy Story films. I'm glad I had to wait for this version. The video has been cleaned up with a higher bit rate (the original looked super to begin with!) and the sound is much improved with new options that weren't available before now. <br /> <br />The only negative I can see is the failure to include a short and I'm not even sure it's worth mentioning. I remember all of the Pixar films having a short except for maybe this one. The VHS release didn't have one but the original DVD release had one called \\"Tin Toy\\". Was this one even released with the movie or just on the original DVD? Try for the life of me, I just can't recall. I checked it out on the Pixar site and it sure didn't look familiar and we sure aren't missing much but it sure seems weird to have included this in an earlier DVD release but to leave it out from the 10th Anniversary, 2-disc version. It just makes the package seem a little incomplete somehow. <br /> <br />Other than the minor omission of a short, this excellent package should be in everyone's collection, even if you don't have kids or grandkids! If you have an original DVD release, pick this one up too. There are enough improvements and new features to make the extra $16 worthwhile.

B0007Y08IS|3.0|Team America isn't a bad movie, though it's not really a good movie either.  On the positive side I liked how politically incorrect it was and how anti-Hollywood as well.  Parker and Stone can also be given marks for originality by the whole theme of the movie which is a spoof of action movies using marionettes a la Gerry Anderson.  The bad side is the same thing that made the South Park movie disappointing.  The fact that they milk one joke over and over again for 90 minutes.  In South Park it was cutesy cartoons swearing, in Team America it's puppets swearing, killing one another, etc.  A puppet using the F word is a pretty dang funny idea the first few times you hear it, but grows stale very fast, like back in school when you'd ask some chick if she wanted to join the Pen15 club.  It's got it's share of clever sequences like the Montage spoof.  The Team America theme song is  a funny spoof of the kinds of theme songs you'd hear in 80s cartoons like GI Joe.  All in all Team America may try too hard, but you do have to admire the against-the-grain approach.  Plus you have to give it credit for not being a remake of anything.  Buy it along with The Incredibles for a family movie night!
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I saw Michael during his concert in Tampa so watching him on the DVD was exciting.  Enjoyed learning more about him as a person as well as a entertainer.  He is awesome to watch.  His band is outstanding.  A CD and DVD, what a great package for the money.  The CD is played at home and at work.  Buble has it all; great voice, great music, it's a must have to enjoy again and again.

0446607274|4.0|In the post-Rodney King and OJ era, race is a huge factor in the affairs of the LAPD. When a vociferous police critic, black lawyer Howard Elias, is gunned down on an LA trolley, the Angel's Flight, racial tensions come to the fore. Detective Harry Bosch knows that damage control is a top priority when he is assigned to the case with his two black partners, Rider and Edgar. But his actions are constrained by the IAD and the FBI being assigned to the case, with Asst Chief Irving being apprised of every move.<br /><br />Since Elias' current case involved police brutality, it is widely assumed that a cop gunned down the attorney. Bosch has to walk a tightrope in avoiding a rush to judgment and following the trail left by Elias. From a series of anonymous letters, the situation in which Bosch finds himself veers in the direction of pedophilia as the cause of a young girl's death, with ramifications for Elias.<br /><br />The book moves slowly at first, with much time devoted to getting warrants and searching offices, apartments, etc. In the midst of all of this, Bosch's new wife (see Trunk Music), Eleanor, decides that she prefers a world of gambling to that of a policeman's wife. Justice is finally served, with deserved high costs to a leading LA family and not-deserved costs to a cop's family.<br /><br />Bosch is his usual skeptical self, daring to question assumptions and superficialities. He is able to obtain a measure of justice for the community, while his personal affairs unravel. Another good Connelly book, but not the best.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Style, pure style. Frank Miller's blood sweat and tears have paid off greatly with the release of this wonderful film. I love it when films become instant cult classics purely based upon the originality of the media - bad or good. To see his world transferred to a feature film was quote \\"A dream come true\\" It seems that a wide range of viewers actually dislike the films dialogue and plot transfer. I believe that this is due to the direct script from the original comic book. At times it can read rather dull, but if you have seen any of the Sin City graphic novels, you can quickly understand that it is all part of a stylish flow which can be easily accepted once understood. <br />A long time coming, this film could have probably turned out to be an easy disaster for both Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, going the way of other comic to film transfers. Luckily with full control over the production (a rarity in this industry) both were able to sculpt the feature into a beautiful mold of dark comedy, ultra violence, sex, and all that good stuff. Both directors show us that it is not about the content specifics, it is how you go about using them. My rating for this film would have been perfect except for the script transfer, however that is how the cookie crumbles when jumping directly from Comic to Film. A must see for any cult film enthusiast, however I strongly recommend reading at least one of Frank Millers books to grant yourself a better understanding of the \\"flow\\" before simply diving into this twisted dark tale, or better yet - collection of dark tales.
B0002OERI0|4.0|It's not often that you pick up an album with back to back strong tracks. That is what Green Day provides with American Idiot. At the same time, this album is a shift from the early sound of this band, and in some ways all over the place with a rock, pop, metal, grunge feel to it at the same time. Radio-friendly tracks like \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" are packed with darker tunes like \\"City of the Damned\\" and \\"Give me Novocaine\\". In some ways, American Idiot is reminiscent of early Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and definitely indicates that these guy are going to be around for some time. American Idiot is solid rock gold.  <br /> <br />
B00006J3T4|5.0|It has been a long time since an album has effected me the way this one has. The guitar is so fantastic combined with Knopfler's voice and subtle intonations is un-matchable. These elements plus the incredibly thoughtful and skilled songwriting skills are something I'm happily trying to convince everyone to listen to. Honestly, I've been playing it for months and I never tire of it. The images the lyrics conjure up are satisfyingly rich with sentiment and suggestion. I hesitate to buy another album for fear it will pale in comparison. I'm also excited to learn that he doesn't use a pick  and is a leftie playing right handed - which may explain why there's something familiar sounding about it to me. Coming from a classical guitar background I find his style amazingly musical and keep asking myself \\"how does he make that sophisticated twangy sound?\\"<br />Bravo!
1572814349|5.0|I can't tell you how many decks I have looked that just didn't \\"resonate\\" with me!  The traditional Rider-Waite was just too ugly for me, and some other decks were just too weird or out there for me.  This deck combines my love of art with tarot, and it is perfect for me.  The box that it comes in is perfect to keep the cards in (no need for a different box or tarot bag), the book that comes with it is thorough and she gives ideas for spreads and what the cards mean in both upright and reversed position.  She offers a lot of insight into the cards and the process of their creation.  My only complaint (no big deal to me) is that the cards are hard to shuffle.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|I don't understand all the good reviews for this movie.  Weren't these people who gave good reviews noticing the bad acting, bad dialogue, bad english subtitles.  Not once did I laugh at anything. The character that becomes \\"The One\\" spends the whole movie being a villian and then converts to good after being hit in the head a few times by the Beast.  <br /> <br />The references to other movies were so pathetic:  The Untouchable reference - \\"What are you preparing to do\\" should be \\"What are you prepared to do\\", the english subtitle translator should have actually done their job properly and learnt english. The - Gone with the Wind reference - standing in front of a Gone with the wind movie poster is not a reference.   <br /> <br />Scenes like the road runner scene were so pointless and stupid and irritating.  <br /> <br />The 1 star I gave is for the fight scenes which are the only good aspect of this movie. <br /> <br />To the makers of this movie and the people who gave this movie a good review, watch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and see how a martial arts movie is supposed to be made.   <br /> <br />Kung Fu Hustle is Kung Fu Crap.

0792164903|3.0|I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. And I think he is long overdue for the best actor Academy Award.  Certainly Depp is very good in this part. My problem is not with Mr. Depp.<br />  One of the most delightful and also one of the drollest of American characters, Ichabod Crane, is here thrown completely away and replaced with what? Yet another of  Burton's arrested and disturbed innocents. Depp can play this role in his sleep, though this is of itself not necessarily bad - the same might have been said of Cary Grant during his run of sophisticated comedies. Obviously the star and director have a great deal of simpatico to judge by all the films they turn out together. Just now witness Willie Wonka, though I found that film's send off on Michael Jackson a different type of scream.<br />  This telling of Irving's tale has no interest in Irving's subtle and sly story. The original was carried along on some of the finest lyric prose ever penned by anyone. Burton never for a second catches Irving's delight in everyday human nature, the charm and whimsy of an author's happy bliss as he creates a great comic character - Ichabod. Instead he has latched with a death grip as it were to the macabre and can see nothing else. This annihilates more than the hapless victims of the rampaging ghostly horeseman. It also twists the sunny side of the story inside out turning everything into one long nightmare. Unrelieved by not one iota of the original's gentle humor the story unfolds as a black study of witchcraft and violent death -an historical slasher movie.  Gone with the humor is contrast and complexity. Is it possible few modern reviewers can appreciate just how wonderfully Irving juxtaposed the scary legend with one eye giving a very broad wink?<br />  What is perhaps more appalling in the overwhelming majority of the reviews here on Amazon is the non-chalance before the ridiculous number of scenes showing human beings suffering beheading. Counting the earlier battle scenes there must be well over twenty! Yes, I know there's a headless horsemen, but after a while the mayhem is just plain tawdry. Perhaps someone might be reminded - not a single person is beheaded in the original - Ichabod simply disappears from town. Is the American movie-going public considered so base and vulgar that directors have to completly revamp (sorry) the story of Sleepy Hollow into a chainsaw bloodfest?<br />  Personally I don't think children of ANY age can profit by such indiscriminate slaughter.  This is not lightheartedly revelry folks. Some of this stuff is repugnant. I certainly did not let my 15 year old watch this stuff - it's revolting. If a director wants to use such a moment he or she had better use a little restraint or after a while...there were good reasons why the Greek plays had violence offstage.<br />  In sum, absolutely not for impressionable young children. Tim Burton enjoyed revamping the story in his own image, and took, as always, the easy self-indulgent path.  Nothing lacking in the foreboding side of the story. Maybe someday a more mature director will return to this wonderful story, and we can enjoy Irving's fabulous story in a wiser and more fully mature reading. For now, unfortunately, this half-filled glass, the ghoulish half of the story, will be all Hollywood will deign to present.suffering beheading.

1577314808|3.0|Review of The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle. 1999. ISBN: 1-57731-480-8. Paperback, 235 pages.<br /><br />The Power of Now has been a #1 New York Times bestseller. An endorsement by Oprah Winfrey helped to increase sales, and over two million copies have been sold. The author, Eckhart Tolle, was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. He does not claim to be a member of any specific religion. He uses principles from Christianity and Buddhism, A Coarse in Miracles and The Bible. Tolle's message of the entire book appears in the title. The book is divided into ten chapters, plus the introduction. Tolle uses a question/answer format to anticipate reader reactions.<br /><br />From the beginning, Ekhart Tolle assures the readers that \\"You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are!\\"<br /><br />In chapter 1, Tolle states that \\"you are not your mind\\" and that the greatest obstacle to enlightenment is the mind. He claims that identifying with what's on our mind creates a barrier due to labels, images, and judgments that cross our consciousness. Tolle tells the reader to remember that \\"you are one with all this is.\\" In reference to this oneness, Tolle says that the mental movies complete with inner-voice soundtrack is a \\"result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you inherited.\\" Tolle encourages the reader to be in the here and now, to be alert and aware but not thinking, just like in meditation. He states that success with this practice can be measured by the degree of \\"peace that you feel within.\\" In order to achieve enlightenment, Tolle tells the reader to \\"rise above thought.\\" Simply \\"say yes to life, and see how life suddenly starts working.\\"<br /><br />In chapter 2, Tolle tells the reader how to recognize the ego, which feeds on external things, such as possessions and social status. Tolle ends the chapter by giving the reader a riddle: \\"Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret to life is to die before you die, and find that there is no death.\\" The book cover states, \\"Tolle uses simple language.\\" The language may be simple, but the concept about the secret to life is complex. In other chapters, the principles are obvious: \\"The more you are focused on time, past and future, the more you miss the now.\\" Tolle gives the reader a powerful lesson on time: \\"Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now. Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now.\\" His book is a dichotomy of his beliefs: He tells readers to pause between chapters to mull over the concepts while telling us that our troubles arise because we think too much. He says we analyze too much, then tells us in chapter 4: \\"Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation.\\" Isn't that analyzing?<br /><br />Chapter 8 could cause controversy. Tolle says that \\"women are closer to enlightenment\\" than men because \\"it is easier for a woman to feel and be in her body.\\" Tolle dares to explore the menstrual cycles as painful due to the collective consciouness of being subjugated and exploited by men. Furthermore, Tolle states:\\"The number of women who are now approaching the fully conscious state already exceeds that of men.\\" How is that measured?<br /><br />Many books are written about the power of the present (versus reflecting on the past and/or planning for the future); about embracing the journey (versus focusing on the destination); and about enjoying the process (versus focusing on the product.) O: The Oprah Magazine endorses that this book can \\"transform your thinking\\" bringing the reader \\"more joy, right now.\\" The point is made in the title: The Power of Now.<br />review by Lynn C.

B00012QLQ4|4.0|Well for starters, I have to explain this, Akira was originally released in 1985 and you can really see the dating in the movie. However, this doesn't stop this cult classic from being the amazing anime that it is. For anyone who is into anime, the name Akira should stand clearly in their heads, as it was the first true anime to explode into western civilization. The movie starts off with an introduction to the characters, Kaneda, Tetsuo and the rest of their gang who fall into a fight with the Clown gang, a rival motorcycle gang. The introduction jumps back and forth between the gang war and a man trying to save what looks like a young boy with blue skin. Then the two connect and the story really gets good. Tetsuo has an accident while trying to avoid hitting this blue kid and is taken away by the military for observation. The story revolves around an almost apocalyptic event caused by a child named Akira, after his accident Tetsuo has an incredulous transformation into Akira and becomes hell bent on making Akira a part of him. To say anymore would tell the story of the movie and I couldn't ruin it for anyone who really wants to watch it, however I can say this, for anyone who thinks that they would like to get into anime features, this movie is a gateway to the anime world.<BR>If you like the style and flow of this movie make sure to check out also, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, and Ghost in the Shell. There are of course several other animes to watch after this but, as said before, Akira is the door to the anime realm.

6305754969|4.0|I enjoy most John Wayne movies and this is no exception. Although not as good as \\"Red River\\" this movie is worth 2 bits to see it.  A story similar to \\"Rio Bravo\\" John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are good together.  And I believe James Caan is better than Ricky Nelson although not as good a singer. Grab a box of popcorn and a soda, settle in for a return to yesteryear, and enjoy.

Keep it up babygirl! 10/10 <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - All I have to say is AMENNNNNNNN!!!!! Nobody BUT GOD. lol Mariah took it church with this track! The vocals on this song has to be THE BEST on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />BTW.....Don't let the haters discourage you lovely people from purchasing this BEAUTIFUL album. Some of them have numerous amount of names and they spew hate all over Amazon. :-)
076113719X|5.0|This calendar is perfect! It has 5 columns, one for mom and 4 others left for your husband, children, pets, etc. There is plenty of space to write on. I keep track of who goes where, appointments, bills...I have been purchasing this calendar for at least 4 years. My kids love Sandra Boynton's art as well.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I saw only the middle of this flim to the end. Its very funny. Jamie lee Curtis is outstanding and very funny. She made this movie work and is the reason for 5 stars. Im a 21 year old actor (professional not famous yet) and Curtis proves to be a well trained actress that can pull off some great comedy. Lohan on the other hand (not being a good actress) does a decent job and this is big coming from an actor who thinks way to may girls get movie parts for their looks like lohan. I think Miss. Curtis should make more comedies. She's funny and sexy especially for a woman at her age. I almost rated this film 4 stars and was due to casting lohan. She has a voice, and looks but no real talent whats so ever, how ever she did a decent job but does not deserve 5 stars. curtis is the 5 stars for this film
B00012BSHG|3.0|it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol  it's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot  of water. it's just hard to dump it all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and NOT on the bottom of the pool.
B000001FKY|5.0|A great collection of their best songs.  I enjoy it as much as I did when I bought their album!
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Good stuff!  I only wish some of the songs were a little bit longer.
B000002UAU|5.0|I dont know how to start this review of probebly the most important record in history of music. I'll start by saying that this album is The Beatle's Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is regarded by many to be the most influential painting of all time, same with Sgt. Pepper with music. It's the most influential record ever and the towering album of the 60s generation. It's full of musical ideas and concepts that it's not hard to see why it's praised so often due to its revolutionary concept album form. While I still pick \\"Revolver\\" as The Beatles overall finest moment. But Sgt Pepper is easiely their most famous and enduring. A landmark recording for sure, I can't imagine anyone not owning this masterpiece.
0451197968|1.0|this is a very disturbing book. it's pointless, with a horrible ending. it might have turned out good if it weren't for the ending. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! it's terrible, awful.
B000002I25|5.0|One of the best rock albums from one of the best and most innovative bands in history. No other album today sound like this and no album ever will. The songs are all excellent classics. \\"Break On Through\\" is a classic doors anthem with poetic lyrics. The mysterious \\"The End\\" is one of the best songs The Doors ever cut. \\"Light My Fire\\" is their biggest hit ever and one of the best Songs in history. Everything already been said. If you're a fan of Rock N Roll, this is a must have.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I first listened to Death Cab for Cutie as The OC featured their music. Perhaps it was the overload (they were everywhere), but I admit I was not too thrilled about them at the time, except for a handful of songs from their \\"Transatlanticism\\" album, but I did keep them in the back of my mind.<br /><br />In 2005, Ben Gibbard's Death Cab for Cutie won me over! Their \\"Plans\\" album lacks nothing and carries so much emotion that it is bound to become a timeless classic alongside others such as REM's \\"Automatic for the People\\" and The Cure's \\"Wish\\". I find it hard to pick a favorite track, but if pressed to do so, \\"What Sarah Said\\" and the closing track, \\"Stable Song\\" move me every time I listen to them.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  <br />Now, I was a child in the early 80's and I hated it then.  <br /> <br />The movie only served to exasperate me: No plot, no conflict, no resolution. Only the insecure faux-machismo and mouth breathing of \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" and cast. The acting was bad, the setting was terrible, there was absolutely no point to this movie. It embodied yet another film, trying to capitalize on the wave of \\"jump in the wayback machine\\" B-movies and shows. \\"That 70's show\\" worked. This didn't.
B00068NVI4|3.0|I saw YES twice during this tour. The first time in San Jose (the second night of the tour) and the other time in LA (last night of the tour)so I was keen on getting a DVD of the show. Early in the year bootleg DVD's began appearing all over Ebay, so I got one. And while the video wasn't the best, the sound quality was \\"very good\\". I DO know that this DVD was delayed and delayed again. And now I know why. The sound is messed up - defective. The video shots are all the best. But the sound is flat and dull - a disappointment - Find a bootleg on Ebay instead - I know that \\"Classic Rock\\", the people who produced this DVD, had to release the thing to recoup their investment but it's a dud.

B000002J27|3.0|I saw Genesis in concert after this was released and there was a big buzz about Bill Bruford playing with them. It was BORING - just like this album. Genesis had just come off \\"The Lamb\\" and a follow up to that may have been difficult, but if this was the best they could do , they should have waited  (like Peter Gabriel did).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about this when it was on FOX. I read about it in magazines on Sci-Fi genre. I didn't believe it until I saw the first episode on the Sci-Fi Network, (after getting hooked on Battlestar Galactia Season One).<br /><br />I'm watching TV again after a long, long, long time.<br /><br />If you want a good series with awesome character development, witty dialogue, and all of it in a Sci-Fi setting, buy this DVD set. You will be waiting in line when Serenity hits theatres on September 30th.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I know that everyone is pretty uptight about the \\"Copyguard\\" - but once you get over it - this is an awesome album - just put it in , turn it up (to 11) and ROCK!
B000222GMQ|4.0|Kokusai Eigasha (Movie International) and the Korean arm of Toei Animation adapted Hideko Mizuno's 1966 manga into an anime TV series in 1981, \\"Honey Honey no Suteki na Boken\\" (Honey Honey's Wonderful Adventures).  Part of the series was dubbed into English and received limited video distribution across the U.S. courtesy of Sony, but its greatest success outside of Japan was probably in Italy, where it was screened on TV in its entirety with the heroine renamed \\"Fiorellino.\\" I only managed to see the first episode which I rented from my local video store during my phase as a child when, raised on \\"Superbook,\\" \\"Mysterious Cities of Gold\\" and \\"The Little Koala,\\" I was seeking out and devouring everything anime.  The tape I rented only had the first episode, and I thought it was a ripoff - I wanted more.  So be advised: the U.S. release was only one episode per tape!  Our story begins in Vienna in 1907.  It's the day of the lovely Princess Florel's birthday celebration, and she is boredly interviewing potential suitors for marriage.  The princess hides her precious gemstone, the Smile of the Amazon, inside a fish and throws it out the window, declaring to her suitors that she will marry whoever finds the fish and returns it to her.  Meanwile, Honey (Fiorellino), a teenage girl who was abandoned as a baby and raised by nuns, is working as a waitress in a nearby restaurant.  Honey's cat Lily spies the princess's fish and greedily devours it, thus swallowing the ring!  The gentleman jewel thief Phoenix meets Honey afterwards and tries to charm Honey into selling him her cat, but Honey refuses and  attempts to escape by jumping into a hot-air balloon.  Thus begins a series of adventures that take Honey and her pursuers - Phoenix, who wants the ring for himself, and the princess's suitors, who want to get the ring so they can marry the princess - all over the world.  *SPOILER* The story eventually evolves into a \\"Cinderella\\"-style fairy tale, with Honey marrying Phoenix andlearning that she is really a princess herself - Florel's long-lost twin sister. *END SPOILER*  The U.S. dub wasn't too bad considering that in America, anime wasn't taken all that seriously in the 1980s - in fact, the translators didn't even bother to replace the Japanese writing on one sign in episode one with English words, perhaps because the technology wasn't readily available then? - but the series itself seems to be a nice mix of adventure, drama, and more than a little comedy.  (Just watch the opening animation, where Honey is decked out in evening wear and dancing with a handsome guy who proceeds to spin her into a table, resulting in her spilling punch all over herself.) The animation is also pretty good considering the series is now nearly a quarter-century old, and is actually better than that of \\"Superbook,\\" \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" and other better-known shows on Japanese TV at that time.  Phoenix is a '60s-looking hunk, complete with the huge sideburns, and Honey is really cute, a blonde who looks like a cross between Dolly Parton and \\"Sailor Moon\\"'s Usagi.  The English theme songs were also really catchy - especially the very-'80s-disco-ish ending theme - and still stick in my head all these years later.      Overall, an entertaining and enjoyable shoujo series, especially for young girls (of course, that's what \\"shoujo\\" means).  Worth picking up if you can find it on VHS, but good luck, as what of the series that was released in America is out of print and will likely never see the light of day on DVD.  Apparently Enoki Films USA owns the rights to the show in America now, but I'm not sure what, if anything, they plan to do with those rights.  Information on the series in English is very hard to come by, so you'd probably do best to search for information on \\"Fiorellino,\\" the Italian dub.
B00006D295|4.0|I could not find this movie for rental in local rental chains.  I searched Amazon and found it and bought it.  Its a great cult classic that I saw as a teen (its where I first started listening to Meatloaf-my favorite singer).  Of course seeing it now...yes its corny from special effects (but what movie from that time isn't compared to current special effects).  It brought back great memorys and a good see.
6305784116|5.0|Being a cat lover, this is my favorite Disney movie.  The plot is quick paced and very funny.  I find myself quoting this movie on a regular basis, just for fun.  \\"I dinna mean to rough you, squeaky.\\"
6304498969|5.0|This is a terrific performance.  The DVD arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran were a part of the early 80s New romantic movement, with their flashy image comprising make up and loud hair cuts, clever videos (which won them two Grammys in 1983; best long form and best short form video), very danceable synthesized new wave sound, and Simon Le Bon's big, slightly off kilter voice..<br /><br />`Greatest' is a good overview of the group's music, showcasing their sound and evolution from `Planet earth' in 1981 to the dizzying razor sharp synths of the excellent `Electric Barbarella in 1997. The songs are not arranged chronologically however, still a fab introduction to new Durannies.<br /><br />Featured here are most of their biggest hits; the dramatic horn laden Bond theme song `View to a kill' (US #1), the beautiful ballad `Save a prayer' (US #16), `The reflex' (US #1), the camera snap filled `Girls on film', `Rio' (with a great sax break), (US#14) `Union of the snake' (US #3), `New moon on Monday (US #10), the Nile Rogers produced funk/rock of `Notorious' (US #2 and sampled by none other than P Diddy himself, and featuring excellent guitar work and a stuttered No-no-notorious), the drum machine demolishing `Wild boys' (US #2) with its glorious sung/chanted chorus, the funky `I don't want your love (US #4), the tender `Come undone' (US #7), and the ballad `Ordinary world' (US #3) to name a few.<br /><br />Duran Duran's influence can still be heard today in bands like The Killers, The Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand to name a few.<br /><br />Crashing drums, pulsing synths, big voices and hair. Aaah, the sound of the 80s..
630463949X|5.0|This is our 3rd DVD of this title.  Guests have seen it at our home and liked it so much we gave them ours.  We think they were at their best on this DVD.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album is mind blowing, ignore all negative reviews, I just love the 42 minute title track. The first CD has its strong parts also, Songs like Blind Faith and The Glass Prision (The beginning of Portnoy's saga about alcohlism, continued by \\"This Dying Soul\\" in Train of Thought and \\"The Root of All Evil\\" in their newest album release, Octavarium,) are marks of Dream Theater's leading ability, In the second CD, I fell in love with the Grand Finale, into a powerful sound equipment, I could almost feel I was surrounded by a full orchestra, it took tears out of my eyes it's simply amazing!!!! the most spectacular and majestic finale I have ever heard. A great piece of work, done by Proressive Metal masters, thanks Dream Theater, for giving us another Mark of superiority and skill like no other.
0719062683|5.0|Wow.  I bought this book when I was in college, but I never got around to reading it until this past week.  I am absolutely amazed by how good it is, and I wish I had read it earlier.   <br /> <br />If I had read this before going to college, I swear I would have aced all my English courses.  Why am I so confident that this book would help me?  Well, basically, this book gives you something like twenty different approaches to reading literature.  After finishing the book, you will be more attuned to what you are reading.  You should be able to say to yourself, \\"well, a stylistic critic would approach this book X way, while a postcolonial critic would approach this book Y way.\\"  Imagine your professor's astonishment when you hand in your first essay and the title of it is: \\"A Lacanian Approach to Jane Eyre.\\"  Provided you are able to follow Barry's model for what Lacanian critics do, and you make some decent Lacan-influenced points, you are almost guaranteed to receive an \\"A.\\"   <br /> <br />Of course, many potential readers of this book are out-of-college and, like me, will never get those college literature courses back.  This book has utility for us also.  It is great because it can give us new angles from which to explore books we have read before.  I'm tempted to re-read Hamlet now that I understand the Freudian interpretaton of the play.  I want to go back and decide for myself whether the Freudian interpretation is tenable.   <br /> <br />Some posters have criticized this book for not probing deep enough.  What rubbish!  The title of the book is \\"Beginning Theory.\\"  Its intended audience is either people who are new to literary theory, or people who have not been able to make sense of the bombastic critical essays they have been assigned for class.  The book serves its purpose extraordinarily well.  It is clear, it is to the point, it provides excellent summaries of the major critical theories, and it even provides lists of suggested reading for people who want to read more about the various theories.  In short, it is everything you need to get started learning about literary theory.  It is a tremendous work, easily one of the best books I have ever read by an English professor.  Thank you for writing such a cogent and lucid introductory work to this difficult subject, Professor Barry! <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish's most recent release, Once, proves that they are capable of writing some of the most epic and melodic pieces to hit today's music scene.  Going from the softest whispers of to Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan to the relentless and powerful chorus of Higher Than Hope, it is clear that this band has an enormous range in their pieces.  Actually it's more than a band, it's a whole entire orchestra in the background.  The amazing orchestral arrangements combined with pure heavy-metal create a feeling of immensity in the pieces.  Also, there's over a dozen metro voices to back the already beautiful vocals of Tarja Turunen, creating a dazzling vocal performance as well.  My favorites off the album would have to be Nemo, Wish I Had An Angel, Planet Hell, Higher Than Hope, and the best off the album is the epic 10-minute Ghost Love Score.  It's no wonder this band is so successful in their native Finland and I hope they continue down the path that they're on.
B0006L16N8|4.0|If you're already a coldplay fan, you'll love this album. It's consistent with the band's previous records, and by that, I mean it sounds almost exactly the same. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is essentially a \\"Clocks\\" re-hash with a semi-new chorus. The tracks vary, but only slightly, as most of the band's new stuff sounds kind of like the b-sides to \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". If you're not a Coldplay fan, though, this isn't the album to buy; new users will have a lot more ease with their older, more genuine albums, like \\"Parachutes\\", or the aforementioned \\"Rush\\". If you haven't heard the song \\"Yellow\\", or did, but didn't like it, you're probably named Jethro and are married to your cousin. But in any other case, the track to break into Coldplay with is definitely one of their earlier ones. Those have a much rawer quality, and seem more like the band wrote them because they wanted to, as opposed to being contractually obligated to churn out a new pop hit. Thanks for reading. <br /> <br />--b

B00001QEE9|5.0|I have nothing but praise for this truly great Walt Disney classic.  <br />Of course the animation and music are superb and excellent.  I am glad it is available on DVD.  It should be made readily available for future generations to treasure and enjoy.
B0006B29WA|5.0|There isn't a single bad song on the cd. it defintely deserves to be the top cd of 2004. the bonus disc makes it even better. AMAZING, MUST BUY CD.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This is the disk that could push Nu Metal into the drainage vortex and bring guitar rock back to the forefront of hard rock with a \\"Vengeance\\". In fact, City of Evil may have the best Heavy Metal song on it that I've heard in years with Bat Country.<br /><br />If you've been an A7X fan or you are at least familiar with their past work like their last disk Waking the Fallen, prepare yourselves for a somewhat new sound. Out is song after song of the angry shouting so typical in speed/death metal, and in is City of Evil with a disk of singing by M. Shadows that is a metalhead's dream....Clear with great vocal harmonies.<br /><br />The music is hard. Spectacular drumming by TheRev that seems to be preformed effortlessly but precisely. Head banging guitar solos and driving bass, put together with vocal melodies that move away from the death/speed metal sound of A7X's past efforts to a sound that I can listen to with my wife in the car...well...almost.<br /><br />The songs are epic (all well over 5 minutes each), complex but very tight. A fair analogy might be early Bruce Dickenson Iron Maiden meets Guns n Roses meets A7X's own style of unique speed metal.<br /><br />The jewel of this disk is track 4...the radio played Bat Country. But there are several standout tracks here. I think that there were only 3 tracks that I said that I probably wouldn't rip to my library. Pantera fans will want to give track 10 (Betrayed) a listen; I think that it's kind of the story of the last days of the late, great Dimebag Darrell (see my review of Damageplan's New Found Power). Tracks 7,8 & 9 also shine.<br /><br />City of Evil brings a refreshing, somewhat newish sound to Metal fans, and it is most definitely worth having in your collection if you're into the genre. Give it a try.<br /><br />Edit 12/27/2009 - RIP James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan. Rock the Heavens with Dimebag and Davey Williams!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|21 songs in all and some of them are brand new.  A few of the songs are \\"re-mixes\\", but all in all, an excellent purchase.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I must admit that Opeth is not my favorite band, but it should be.  In Flames remains my favorite melodic death act, but they are faltering now.  Angra is my favorite power metal act.  And the progressive spot is pretty much dominated by Opeth.  Let me tell you that if you are new to this band, it will require alot of interpretation, its music you can't headbang to while playing video games.  You will love this earcandy but only if you focus with it.  With that said, I will say that I truly believe that Blackwater Park is the greatest choice for a new Opeth fan.  However, this album strongly reminded me of Still Life.  I love this album.  It is far more complete than Deliverance, although Deliverance is my favorite album by them.  In Ghost Reveries, you get a bit of everything.  Also, they add extremely mellow moments that belong in Damnation.  I can't say much more about the album without going into detail.  It's what you would expect from Opeth.  Not much has changed, but something clearer has sparked.
0812589041|5.0|Enders Game would have to be the firts book that I have ever read, and it has goetten me completly huked on reading. I first picked it up in one class in grade 7, some ten years ago. The whole story of a world in a population crissis, alowing only the select few to have a &quot;third&quot; child and in a fight for its vary survival agians a insect species. The whole book revolves around a young boy Andrew Wiggin, (who his sister calls Ender). As a child he is implanted with a monterign device to tell if he is one of the few super geniuse kids. Thes children are sent off to a space station to learn the art of war, so that they could one day fight and kill the insect enimy. The story also go into the mind of Ender, as the stress from classes and &quot;battle games&quot; gets to him.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I was very frustrated by the lack of credible reviews, so I hunted down a review from the UK Observer newspaper: <br /> <br />\\"Bob Dylan is a private man who is notoriously camera shy. The TV interview he gave around the publication of his autobiography, Chronicles, last year was his first in two decades, so there was some surprise when Martin Scorsese announced he was making the definitive TV biopic with the man's full co-operation. It seems that in his sixties, Dylan - who has spent so much of his career laying false trails and telling downright lies about himself - has decided it's time to set the record straight and get his version of his life and times on the record, both in print and on film. And Scorsese, who directed The Last Waltz, the 1977 film about Dylan's former backing group, the Band, was the obvious man to do it. <br /> <br />Almost four hours long, No Direction Home deals only with the early part of Dylan's career, ending in 1966 and the tumultuous world tour on which he was booed by folk purists unable to accept his new-found rock'n'roll ways. It airs on BBC2 next month and is a riveting piece of film-making that draws on wonderful contemporary footage, much of it previously unseen, as well as revelatory new interviews. Scorsese and his team also turned up a treasure trove of unreleased music, which constitutes the latest volume in the 'official bootleg series' Dylan launched in 1991 to combat the pirates who have conferred on him the dubious honour of being the most bootlegged artist in history.\\"

0446677450|5.0|The people that gave negative feedbacks on this book are ignorants. He gave some really good advice. Robert K. didn't just became a millionaire and quit. He went on to teaching others his knowledge. In order to get something, you got to first give something. So he teach others and at the same time he's learning. Getting to where Robert K. got wasn't easy and may not be for everyone, but he was telling people how he got there through this magnificent book. Full of great experiences and advice. I learned many things from this book and he made lots of point. I love it when he tells people to \\"listen because that's how you will learn. That's how god created us with two ears and one mouth.\\" Also ignorant people are the least to succeed. So true. I know many people who are very old fashioned, unwilling to listen to others. Results did show that everyone got way ahead of them leaving them and their ego behind. Robert K. educated himself in every way he could, he invest a lot of time and money into knowledge. He went to many seminars and worked in different jobs.  Now he's summarizing everything to us in just a simple form of a book. I love it.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|If on first listen you can't quite grasp this album, give it time.  That has been the case with me.  First time through, I was reading a book and listening through the album to get a feel for it.  This is the first album i've not been able to do that with.  I put the book down and started over at track one.  Second time through, this album started growing on me, and it gets better at each consecutive listen.  Songs that really caught me were \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr\\", \\"The Predatory Wasp...\\", and \\"The Seer's Tower\\", although there really is something for everyone.  So many instruments, and so many played by Stevens, it's just interesting to listen to.  This guy is bringing another layer to the exploding genre of folk rock.  If you liked this, try The Decemberists \\"Picaresque\\".
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I have watched it countless times and every time it brings tears in my eyes. It combines humour and drama in a unique, masterful way. If you are a parent you HAVE to watch this movie, it is inspiring. I watched it after i had my son and it was a whole new experience. Movies like this prove that the power of will and love can conquer all, even the most evil things. The only thing I wonder is whether Benigni will ever be able to bring out a better movie than this one.
0385338082|5.0|What is not to love about this book?  This is the most fun and hilarious book I've read in a while.  This helped me survive a long flight overseas and couldn't put it down no matter how tired I was.<br /><br />The heroine, Emma Corrigan, is absolutely endearing. Her insecurities, which made her lie to her boyfriend about her real weight, or how she felt very small and rather worthless next to her very successful cousin makes her so \\"real\\" and just grabs you right from the start. As for the hero, well Jack was great too.  I loved how he stood up for Emma and tried to boost her confidence.  It was also great how he made Emma feel that she is a very desirable woman regardless of her insecurities both physically and professionally.<br /><br />Sure, some things might seem far-fetched, but they are also hysterical and made for some real light and fun read.  I was laughing so much the first time the main characters met when Emma, thinking that they were headed for a plane crash, started spilling all her secrets to the handsome stranger next to her, only to survive the flight and later found out that he was the owner of the firm she works at! You won't be disappointed and will surely love reading about Emma's escapades and how she finally gets her man in the end.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|In my opinion this will be  a cult classic in the same eschelon as Rocky Horror Picture Show.   the extra features were fascinating. Not for kids
B00068NVI4|5.0|I went to two different concerts during this tour.  This is just like being there again. I loved the fact that I got to hear them do songs live that I had never heard them do before.  \\"Turn of the Century\\", \\"Mind Drive\\", and \\"Every Little Thing\\" were done to perfecton.  A must have for all YES fans.
B0006FFRW0|2.0|I thought that this album was very boring. Though at rare times it was very good, (closer, piggy, man with a big gun, downward spiral), the rest of this album is just extremely repetitive and boring, in my opinion. Most of the songs sound the same to me. I suppose that you could compare that desciption with KoRn's title album, a lot of them just sound the same. Sure, you can flame me for hating a \\"Great\\" album, but i was extremely disappointed.
B0006GAI6Y|1.0|Rather than typing out a long explaination behind my \\"oh no,\\" let's keep this short and sweet.  Basically, about half way through the movie I got bored and started surfing the net.   <br /> <br />But at least it opened up some some time for me to bookmark some stuff for my Amazon wishlist, write an overdue email to Mom and update my blog. <br /> <br />On a side note, Richard Gere's lack of facial expression was a bit alarming. <br /> <br />Only watch if you think you need an excuse to free up some time for internet surfing.
0679735909|4.0|We're a book club of 7 ladies (\\"XX\\") from the Philippines.  Our book club is over five years old.  We took up \\"Possession\\" this last June 2005. <br /> <br />Possession means being consumed.  Certainly, all of the characters were obsessed with something.  They were obsessed sleuths, due to the letters.  There were characters obsessed with money, power and control.  All of them were possessed in different ways, even Mortimer with his collection, Beatrice Nest over Ellen Ash's diary (\\"chasing after someone else's life\\"), and so on.  A.S. Byatt is a genius.  Even though we waded through the poetry and not everyone could grasp its richness, the book was engrossing, until the touching twist of an ending.  Bound to be a classic.  Our average rating:  4.0 out of 5.0.
6305181810|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, but not quite what I was expecting.  Lots of this movie centers around court room drama and what centers around the main case.  Many people might have heartfelt feelings towards this movie since it deals with a wrongful death claim.  I have not read the book, but many people rave at how close to the book this movie is.  If you like Grisham or good court-room drama then you will like this movie, while not my favorite of Grisham's work, it is still worth at least one viewing.
B000A2H812|5.0|This album sits rightfully in its place on the evolutionary chain of progression for Gogol Bordello.  There is less sax than heard on the beginning album, Voi-La Indturder, but far more violin ripping its way into a chant.  Some of these songs will stay in your mind for days and as you repeat the riffs and inspiring, revolutionary lyrics on your lips, you will rise and begin to dance...There is a version of \\"Start Wearing Purple\\" different than that on Voi-La Intruder.  I thought that composition and magic of Multi Contra Vs. Irony would be impossible to beat, but it has competition.  If you are an existing fan of Gogol Bordello or if you have never been exposed to gypsy punk cabaret, then pick this album up, you will not regret it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. The dialoge, the cinemomatgraphy, the acting, the Jessica Alba, it was all GREAT! Now, You know the plot, so I'll just tell you about the expierence. When I first started watching this film, it was breathtaking. I got really giddy, knowing/not-knowing what is to come. The movie is so amazing, I could barley contain it all. I couldn't talk for 30 minutes after the film had ended, because i could not believe what i had seen. Some say this is violent, but it isn't. The violence is stylized and cartoony, not graphic. And, whats more shocking than the \\"graphic violence\\" is its moments of heavenly grace and beauty. Seeing such a desolete city, and then seeing a gorgeous angel, it is very stimulationg. But, do not get this DVD, because Sin City:Directors Cut, will be coming out in the winter (i'm not sureabout the exact date, but there will be a Sin City:Directors Cut coming up). So, rent this, then if you even so much as liked it, buy it, because the special features will be Awsome! <br /> <br />
0393324818|5.0|Moneyball is a hard book to put down, even though it's all about statistics.  In a real twist, Lewis shows how the best baseball isn't the stuff of Field of Dreams or The Natural or Bull Durham, but of your college intro to statistics class.  Lewis provides fascinating stories about how Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland A's, has bucked the conventional wisdom and made one of the poorest teams in baseball one of the winningest teams by evaluating players on a myriad or performance data, not on physical appearance, hunches, or traditional scouting measures.  This book is sure to please the baseball fan, statistics nerd, or anyone who just likes a good story.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Jonny Deep is the PERFECT Willy Wonka! The oompla-loompa looked to plain though, but this was an excellent remake. One of the best of 2005!
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Citizen Kane of kids' movies!  I loved Goonies when it came out.  It had enough teen appeal, adventure, kids saving the day and overcoming the fetid stench of corporate corruption to keep us coming back over and over.  A bunch of kids from the Goon Docks, a middle class coastal town, are to enjoy their last Goonie weekend together before the wealthiest man in town sells it all off to put a golf course in where their houses were.  Miracle of miracles, as well as in an effort to save their home, the Goonies discover a treasure map and decide to go off looking for pirate treasure rumored to be burried in the town. <br /> <br />This is ridiculous, as we all know, but to believe in hope and crave adventure brought us together for this wonderful children's classic.  The humor is silly and insulting, the way kids are.  This was just before the politically correct 90s, where we would not be allowed to use fat jokes (Chunk's truffle shuffle), making fun of the physically or mentally disabled (the disfigured Sloth being locked in the basement by his ashamed family), or racial sterotypes (Data).   <br /> <br />What really made this a great DVD was the special features commentary.  Bringing back the original cast to comment on it together made it a truly wonderful experience, as those kids are all about my age, and I lived it once again through their eyes.  They all went different directions - lawyers, actors, stunt coordinators, and Corey Feldman - but it was wonderful to be back again.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Two actors in \\"The Brown Bunny\\" may not survive the ordeal, so be warned: career suicide is never pleasant. Chloe Sevigny actually has a career, appearing in such films as \\"Boys Don't Cry,\\" \\"American Psycho,\\" \\"Dogville\\" and \\"Shattered Glass.\\" She's now with Bill Murray in the indie \\"Broken Flowers\\" (2005), so she may have a chance. As for that ill-tempered rebel bad boy Vincent Gallo, he's solely to blame for the infinite boredom of this film. He's its star, director, writer, producer, editor, publicist and photographer.    Gallo's adroitly cast 1998 indie \\"Buffalo 66\\" stirred some interest, but only that. Previously he had bits in a good film (\\"Goodfellas\\"), a bad one (\\"The House of the Spirits\\"), and a dozen you never heard of; he's now got three in the pipeline you also may never hear of. In any organized effort, after \\"The Brown Bunny\\" we never would expect to hear from him again. But independent moviemaking is disorganized. Anything can happen. And although nothing happens in \\"The Brown Bunny,\\" Gallo might yet resurrect himself.    It's about a moody motorcycle racer driving a minivan to California. He's moody because of a life-traumatizing episode we learn about at the very end. Until then, he drives across America, rain or shine, on freeways and through towns. That's it. Sleeping, showering, pumping gas, buying Cokes or take-out, chatting with stray women, these are major events in this movie. In a motel room, Sevigny performs oral sex on him, a gratuitous but explicit act (no faking here) that is the film's real reason for existing and it's only excitement.    And also its only suspense. Will the self-indulgent star of \\"The Brown Bunny\\" (how to phrase it?) rise to the occasion? Hey, it's cool. The writer, editor, publicist, photographer, producer and director all told him to stick to the script. I'm not making any of this up, you know.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I love this movie.  The silence of the desert.  Henry Fonda as a serial killer.  The camera work.  Everything about it creates an amazing mood.  Leone at his best.
B00006399Z|4.0|'Welcome to the Canteen' is a live album with all the important original members of Traffic in attendance, especially Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, and Dave Mason, plus visiting firemen Chris wood, Rick Grech, reebop Kwaku Baah and Jim Gordon. There are but five Traffic songs performed, ending on the sixth track with that great old Spenser Davis chestnut, 'Gimme Some Lovin'.<br /><br />If this were a performance by any ordinary band, or even s superior band such as Spooky Tooth of The Zombies, I may be inclined to give it five stars, but this is TRAFFIC, one of the two or three premier bands of the second British invasion, along with Cream, Led Zeppelin, and Jeff Beck.<br /><br />So how am I to rate this disk, as every number appears on an earlier Traffic or Spenser Davis disk.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I enjoy listening to this album over and over again, dragging it out at least once a year when my cycle of listening comes around again to Traffic. And that's all you really need to be concerned about. So, I give it a hearty four stars, since, if you have CD's with all the numbers on other releases, this disk can be passed over with little loss.<br /><br />Recommended for Traffic fans.
B000002KO3|5.0|I have always loved this Album. Way ahead of it's time, it probably owes much of its success to Brian Eno's fabulous production. 'Once In A Lifetime' is the best known track on the album & still sounds original even today 'David Byrne's' lyrics lending themselves perfectly to the music's off-beat rhythms. I find that the whole album plays like a slow-burn funk. Wonderful African influenced rhythms permeate the whole album slowing occasionally for such deeply powerful tracks as 'Listening Wind' an ode to pain of the American Indian. The vocals on this album are also stupendous. David Byrne's insistant voice as well as the back-up vocal work also on tracks like 'The Great Curve' really made an impression on me. My favorite track must be 'Houses In Motion' with its jumpy jangly tempo it's such a catchy track and instantly burns itself into your brain. David Byrne's most colorful lyrics turn up in 'Seen And Not Seen' a reflective track on the human condition.<br /><br />All in all I would rate this as the best Album of 1980 & 'Talking Heads' best Album ever. Like many bands of the late 70's & early 80's they peaked early never really achieving the artistic heights of their formative years. This is my No. 1 favorite Album of all time. Not just in my top 5 or 10. It's my favorite. Not an album for that mystical Island where people take their favorite album but for this Wacky World - the one we live in this one is No.1 for me. Get it please or you're really missing out.
6304119046|5.0|Welles's first film is an absolute tour-de-force.  It didn't break as much new ground as some have claimed, but Citizen Kane builds on the best of what came before, particularly the deep-focus photography & fluid camerawork of the great 30s films by Jean Renoir.  That Welles raised film to a new level at age 24-5 is astounding, but his precocious work in radio gave him a different perspective on the medium and allowed him to use sound in experimental and expressive ways (that have yet to be equalled, really).  Of course, Welles does not deserve exclusive credit for this achievement: H. J. Mankiewicz contributed some of the best material in the screenplay, Gregg Toland was the top cinematographer in the business, Bernard Herrman contributed one of the finest scores ever written, and there are many other important contributions, not least from a very talented cast fresh from the stage (Everett Sloane's Mr. Bernstein I'd single out as the most remarkable performance next to Welles' own . . . both of them are aged so convincingly, and Sloane does it almost exclusively with his odd-bird looks and acting skill).  This is a towering achievement and will obviously always be recognized as such by those who take an interest in the art and history of cinema.  It's also a great story, told through a series of complex flashbacks, about a man who had everything except what mattered most. <br />
0689835604|5.0|This book has beautiful illustrations that babies and adults can enjoy together.  It's great for teaching simple body part vocabulary and my daughter loves the peek-a-boo aspect.  The panels have withstood lots of pulling and attempts at tearing them out.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Another classic example of how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I frankly think that this is one of the best crime films made in a very long time and makes for an excellent morality story. The ending is just grand!
B0006Z2KIY|4.0|The Notebook is set in an old Southern rest home for the elerly, the film follows four individuals through their respective life journeys. An older man (James Jarner) has volunteered his time to read to an infirm elderly woman (Gena Rowlands). The story he chooses to read her tells about the love of a young couple (Reachel Mcadams and Ryan GOsling) seperated first by social status and later on by war.<br />As the film progresses the couple (Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling) form this amazing emotional depth to the story that simply makes you fall in love wiht the movie. This story definetely opened the tear ducts. My favorite part of the movie ws the ending which really struck me and this movie will probablly stay with me for the rest of my life.  <br />This is a mature story about enduring love, sacrifice commitment and appriciation of you life partner. I think this movie presnted a good message in every day life which is the power of believing and those who really love and believe nuthing can be impossible.
0783226845|5.0|A most surprising movie that sneaks up and enchants you. With a most improbable plot of a Blind Army Lt. Colonel taking a weekend trip to New York and coming to the aid of a new found friend. This movie is one of my all time favorites and is a great morale builder. I don't want to give any more away but I can recommend this film most highly! I am just sorry that I can not give it a higher star score.
B000022TSV|5.0|The musical performances, acting, directing, and cinematography are first-rate.  One of the few successful film renderings of opera.  Even non-opera-lovers will like this.
630469654X|5.0|If you like the Middle Ages of Europe with a dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure. Then you might like to consider this film. The premise of a doomed lovers that are close but far away, an evil Bishop, a some what honorable thief, a crazed with guilt monk and the story comes alive before your eyes. Couple this with some excellent special effects, photography, realistic fight scenes, strong cast, great locations and the viewer can't lose. A wonderful movie!
0375507256|3.0|I honor the idea of what David Mitchell was trying to accomplish in this book. The idea of \\"nested narratives\\" is an interesting one, as long as there's a reason the book must be written this way and not simply as a traditional narrative. However, in its attempt to revolutionize the novel (perhaps the way Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius revolutionized the memoir), Cloud Atlas is unsuccessful, largely because Mitchell focused too much on style and not enough on content.  <br /> <br />Halfway through the book, while I was mildly entertained by each of the six stories, I was starting to suspect that I was not going to find any justification for the bizarre structure of the novel. In the second half, there is an attempt to say something about the continuity of the human desire for power, the fact that it can manifest itself in any place or time. However, this was simply not enough for me, and even this less-than-revolutionary theme was not fully developed. In the end, the six-story plot turned out to be little more than a gimmick. <br /> <br />I was personally disappointed by this book.
B00026YO36|5.0|Aside from Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace,\\" there have been only a handful of albums that seem to stop time once the first few notes start coming out of the speakers.  I'd never been a big Screaming Trees fan, but I kept reading reviews about how masterful Mark Lanegan's new album sounded.  One night I decided to give it a try and...<br /><br />Night seemed to come on even though it was mid-afternoon.  Time stopped completely.  It was as if I were on some ancient train that only rides through twilights, midnights, and rainy days, a train that doesn't ride easy, that might not take you where you want to go, yet you know the journey will be spectacular.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best album of 2004.  It's an odyssey of death, drugs, and oblivion, all kept in check by the deep layers of Lanegan's vocals and lyrics.  Guest stars from QOTSA, the old G N'R, and PJ Harvey only help in revealing the album's beautiful dark core.  It's grunge stripped of its familiarity and seasoned with Goth and blues, making a record that will always be lurking the back of your mind like some weird, calm demon.  It gets better with every listen, and it hasn't left my CD player since it came out in 2004.  A must-buy for anyone who likes the dark...
B0001BKAEY|3.0|For being in \\"excellent\\" condition the case was all scuffed up as well as the case and the DVD itself was covered in rental stickers. The center of the DVD also has a small crack in it. The DVD does work and has no play glitches
B000AY3KN0|5.0|People that did not grow up watching this on Sunday TV matinees may not appreciate this movie as much. Anyone born in the last twenty years probably thinks Star Wars, Blade Runner, or some other SciFi is the best of the Century. I myself must vote for King Kong. My reasons are simple. I have probably seen about every SciFi movie made in the last seventy plus years, and none were so well done for their time as King Kong. This movie influenced many people in the industry to strive for their best in the genre.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen who was the best stop motion animator was greatly influenced by Willis O'Brien's work in this movie. Ask directors like Peter Jackson, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg and they will tell you it had a profound impact on them. Everything seemed to come together in this 1933 movie. The acting although a little corny has a nice appeal. The music is a nice touch of glitz in the city and foreboding danger in the jungle. It's the adventure the movie takes us on that we love most. The sets were done masterfully and the big ape himself was remarkable. The creatures truly frightened people many years after it's original release in the theater.<br /><br />This set includes many extras like a theater guide, poster, documentary, et cetera. I am very pleased with the care Warner took in the reproduction of King Kong. The picture and sound quality are excellent. I have complained for many years that this movie should have been put on DVD. I am glad to see it is finally released. The last remake of King Kong was not very successful, it will be interesting to see if the Peter Jackson remake becomes a classic.
B00008H2LB|5.0|What I can't seem to get my head around is the people saying that Linkin Park are 'washed up' and mpty MTV promotional garbage'. Never have I heard anything more false. I bought this album because of their music, not any promo junk, considering that none of that went on here in Australia.  <br /> <br />I bought this CD after Breaking THe Habit came out because of the complexity yet catchiness of the song. After listening to the album, I was completely blown away! From 'Don't Stay' (an awesome guitar driven punk spectacular) to 'Numb'(one of their singles and almost the most specatcular punk/nu-metal ballads of our generation). Everytime that I listen to Numb i get a shiver up my spine. Not only because of the ballad style chorus and hypnotic backbeat, but because of the way that the emotive lyrics convey an incredible message that (unless we stuble upon a Utopia for ourselves) will almost always be recognizable by young people. Chester's amazing voice has never had so many awesome platforms to perform upon than in this album. Tracks such as Faint, Figure.09 and Lying From You really highlight this. <br />Mike Shinoda's rapping has it's own fantastic place on this record and shines through. <br /> <br />Even from the perspective of one who doesn't like DJ music, Session is a gem. It's just so eerie and complex... <br /> <br />Well, I think that you should buy this album, even if you didn't like Hybrid Theory
6304366027|2.0|Martin Scorsese has always put his demons on the screen and they are usually somewhat shallow and always brutes. New York, New York is no exception.  In 1977 when the film was released I thought it was pretty great, however time has passed and we have see DeNiro's character in one form or another in just about every MS film since then.  The nostalgia for the 1940's music and styles were at a peak in the late 70's.  Musical groups like the Manhattan Transfer did their best to ride the nostalgia wave for example. NY, NY in 1977 seemed fresh, fashionable and brilliant for it's re-visionist approach to make a 40's 50;s style musical with characters and lives that had a 1970's realism.  Unfortunately thirty years later this ambitious idea looks just that and instead NY,NY is dark in drama, dark in comedy and the musical \\"half\\" of the film which MS was I believe paying tribute to fights a losing battle against the abusive relationship played (very  well) by Liza Minelli, and (very much over the top by) Robert Deniro. Strange how time weeds out the greats from the failures and NY, NY, is proof that director Martin Scorsese's obsession with violence (so well realized in Raging Bull) can rot a film from the inside out.
068987474X|4.0|Greg has definitely expressed the many excuses and alibis we hear from both partners involved in relationships.  <br />I am tired of hearing sad stories from my friends of why doesn't he want me. Now, I just recommend this book!  <br />Another small piece of advice, Discharge them from Booty Duty the first time you see warning signs. \\"Don't Get Caught Up\\" in the mix.  <br />   <br />
B000006OAM|5.0|This music takes the listener to magical places.  Each song realizes an almost seemingly private moment that Natalie wants to share.  I have listened to this album dozens of times and it never gets old.  If you like like light Jazz, quiet vocals, great studio musicians, and a relaxing journey...I would recommend Ophelia.
B00005RYL9|4.0|As of 1986 the fantasy genre was really not producing much in the way of entertaining stories for adults, most were aimed at children or teenagers.  Then, little-known director Russell Mulcahy delivered adult audiences what they had been missing, a fantastic tale of immortals locked in an eternal struggle, their goal, to win the coveted 'prize' and live the rest of their lives in peace.    \\"Highlander\\" is the fantasy/sci-fi tale of a Scotsman named Connor Macleod (Christopher Lambert) in modern-day New York.  Connor seems to be an average man who makes an honest living selling antiques, however, all is not as it seems.  Connor Macleod is really hundreds of years old, and when he was in his mid-twenties his clan fought in a battle against a warring clan in Scotland, and during the battle Macleod was fatally wounded and left for dead.  Later, Connor awoke and was driven from his home by his own clan, who believed him to be demonic, and forced to wander the world not knowing how or why he is still alive.  That is until he meets an Immortal named Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches him about the ways of the 'Immortals', which Macleod has become, and of the eternal struggle the Immortals are locked in as they strive to gain the 'prize'.  Now, Connor must use all he has learned from Ramirez to defeat an Immortal who has been hunting him through the ages.     \\"Highlander\\" is a fun, well-written and well-acted movie, that gave audiences an interesting mix of the present-day, with flashbacks of the old highlands of Scotland, and the harsh life that was endured in that time.  \\"Highlander\\" though not too well received by critics, it managed to find a cult following that has grown immensely over the years.  Due to the popularity \\"Highlander\\" experienced among most audiences, it was no surprise that sequels were soon to follow.  Although, to most fans the sequels were generally inferior to the original, in my opinion, \\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\\" was a sub-par sequel, but thebest sequel is \\"Highlander: Endgame\\", a sequel that some believe ignores both \\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\\" and \\"Highlander: The Final Dimension\\", personally I think it just ignores \\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\\", because it flows fairly well from \\"Highlander: The Final Dimension\\".  But regardless of the quality of the sequels, \\"Highlander\\" is a great movie, and is still as enjoyable today as it was in 1986.    \\"Highlander\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.
B000001FKY|3.0|Hysteria is what everyone references Def Leppard to. I cant disagree that it is a one of the best rock albums of all time. The title track 'Hysteria' is one of the few songs that i think still holds up today. The others were over killed on radio but still well crafted songs with great hooks. My only complaint with Hysteria is that the production really kills the feel of the songs. If you caught Leppard on there 'Slang' tour in 96' you really could hear the songs the way they should have been recorded, stripped down and they really had feeling. Great album nonetheless, but i would rather listen to the alternative Def Leppard and listen to Slang.
B00004U2GH|5.0|This album is just fabulous.  The atmosphere in San Quentin that night must have been incredible and I'm really pleased that they chose to record it and make this wonderful album.  This really is Jonny Cash at his best.
B000001DV2|2.0|Def Leppard should have released the rariteis album Retro Active and used these filler songs for the b sides. This album is weak. The only reason i give it two stars is for the only two songs on the disk that are not filler. Those songs would be 'White Lightning' and 'Tear It Down'. This album did well but it was just a poor attempt to recreate 'Hysteria'. Pick up Retro Active instead.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|Lets face it you purchase a Clapton CD to hear him rip away with some blues, but alas on this CD he tries to do much and that leads him astray from his roots.  The result is a big dissappointment.  I would much rather have had a CD come out of the Crossroads Guitar Festival (DVD) then this and I am really looking forward to the Cream reunion CD that is scheduled to come out next month.  Skip this CD and buy just the good songs on iTunes
B000001E21|5.0|I have been a huge Leppard fan for years and have never quite understood there thinking regarding some of there releases. It may have been the fact that there management really advised them poorly , atleast that is my personal opinion, atleast they recently parted ways with the for lack of better word \\"useless\\" Q Prime. On too the album. This album starts out with possibly the greatest Leppard back to back song pairings. 'Desert Song' is without a doubt one of the best written songs in Leppard's catalog. This should have been the proper studio album instead of the dreadful Adrenalize. This was a blueprint for the terrific 'Slang' album. A much more organic sound , no booming programmed drums and the backing tracks actually sounded like humans singing instead of computerized robots. The only negative thing i can say about this album is one to many versions of 'Miss You In a Heartbeat' three versions is really too many, but they were clearing out the vault so to speak so i am not going to complain. This also includes the vastly underrated 'From The Inside' a Zeppelin influenced sort of folk song. It would be refreshing to see Leppard go in this direction on another studio release.
B00003CX9E|5.0|A lot has been written on Citizen Kane and there is therefore probably nothing to add. It's an impressive, intelligent, highly original movie. What I truly remember however, is how devastated I felt by the final scene of the movie and the revelation of the \\"Rosebud\\" mystery. There is so much expressed in just one word. A deeply moving and unforgettable ending. I do not wish to say anything more to maintain the suspense for those who will watch it...
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting the release of this double cd. Dave Grohl is arguably one of the best musicians of the last decade. <br />Disk one is what you would expect from the Foo Fighters, well crafted melodic rock. There is not a weak track on the first disk, the highlight is the song Resolve, this song will do well if released as a single.  <br /> <br />The hidden gems are on disk 2. The softer side of the Foo Fighters really showcase how much Dave Grohl is underrated as a vocalist. It really is hard to pick a favorite. The song Friend of a Friend was penned back in Dave's Nirvana days, written about Kurt Cobain and Chris Noveselic, it also has a Nirvana type of vibe. The sleeper on this disk maybe the track 'Cold Day In The Song' which features drummer Taylor Hawkins on lead vocal, Hawkins vocal really fits the song. I think this song will also do well if released as a single. To conclude this is the best release thus far this year. The fans still stuck in the Nirvana years still whine that the Foo Fighters success is solely based on the fact Dave Grohl was in Nirvana. That is the farthest thing from the truth. If anything this cd proves that without a doubt. Pick this one up today.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|I'm not huge on folk music. I like Dylan more for his electric sixties days and his experimental seventies days.<br /><br />But songs that span rapidly from sweet, to extreme bitter, to soft, to funny, to fun, to just a good feeling album all done by a guy and his guitar and harp make something that I DARE you not to like. Even love. Thats right, I said it.<br /><br />THIS ALBUM STANDS ALONE THROUGHOUT HIS 40+ YEAR CAREER AND IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET DOWN WITH FOLK MUSIC THEN YOU REALLY GOTTA TAKE \\"THE FREEWHEELIN' CHALLENGE\\" ITS A GREAT ALBUM!
B000002AGM|5.0|I find myself always going back to the music of Miles Davis.  It's ironic that a saxophonist would consider Davis his favorite jazz musician, but at the same time, his body of work is tremendous.  This album, technically the second involving Gil Evans and the first to involve him completely, is definitely a high point in the whole catalog. <br /> <br />The fact that it was mastered to sound as if the whole album is one piece, showing how important to both the LP format was as an art form.  Each song complements each other, and although there are definite standouts, the fact that each song has room with each other is amazing.  Jazz albums tend to be more song-oriented than album-centered, so it is a definite plus to find one that concentrates on both. <br /> <br />The definite highlights, \\"Springsville,\\" \\"Miles Ahead,\\" and \\"Blues for Pablo,\\"  have a flavor all of their own.  \\"Springsville\\" is such a cheerful song with its uptempo and flugel runs.  \\"Miles Ahead\\" is a masterpiece of jazz; the composition itself plays like a jazz standard, and the band perfectly complements Davis' solo spots.  \\"Blues for Pablo\\" hints at what was to come with Porgy and Bess and conveys the blues a way a big band should: with subtlety and affection. <br /> <br />Kind of Blue will always be my favorite Miles Davis album and jazz album in general, and it is difficult to truly find my second-favorite Davis album.  Miles Ahead is the one I've considered the most, just ahead of Sketches of Spain and 'Round About Midnight, for that coveted spot.  It's beauty lies not with just what was on the album, but to what the album led.  It made possible Sketches and Porgy, and it was a counterpoint to Davis' modal evolution, namely Milestones and Kind of Blue.  To have that stance in the entire Miles Davis catalog is enough reason to recommend this album to all jazz enthusiasts, but the sheer strength of the album and compositions gives me reason to recommend this to the casual jazz listener.  Start withKind of Blue, but buy this soon after.
B0000062FL|5.0|Me neither. But in the days when I seeked out a little \\"mind expansion\\" this was one of my favorite soundtracks.<br /><br />To think this was recorded in 1969 is incredible. The sound is so rich.<br /><br />I don't think that Santana had any other albums that were as close to perfection as this.<br /><br />I may prefer the vinyl over the cd for this one but this re-master won't dissapoint.<br /><br />THIS IS A START TO FINISH ALBUM, you can't skip tracks, heres why...<br /><br />The first track is instrumental and very cool it fades right into BLACK MAGIC WOMAN, which works its way perfectly into OYE COMO VA. These are the two big radio songs, but ones that never get old. The next two songs are very funky numbers that close the first half.<br /><br />The second half opens with two gritty blues tracks, MOTHERS DAUGHTER, and HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER. The instrumental sandwiched between them SAMBA PA TI is some of the most beautiful guitar work you've ever experienced, you can literally feel Carlos' Soul channeling through his playing. After that you have one more track to cool down, and with this disc a few more bonus cuts to stretch out the ride.<br /><br />ITS ALL GOOD, TAKE THE TRIP!

B000002KKS|4.0|Don't tell me that Dio did it better than Ozzy. Just don't. I like Dio, but he's just a silly dude. His lyrics are silly and his voice even more so.<br />STILL, HEAVEN AND HELL is one of my favorite songs in all the SAB catalouge and the rest of this album is pretty rockin' stuff (although after years of listening to OZZ, this stuff takes a little getting used to.)<br /><br />Think of it like having a new girlfriend, no wait thats a weird thought.<br /><br />DIE YOUNG used to be dedicated to my principal in junior high. Mr. Young. Get it? Now its dedicated to Bug D for much different reasons.<br /><br />Dio did it best with Sabbath, though he has lots of rockin stuff. You can't compare these albums with OZZ stuff, it's a whole different rollercoaster.<br /><br />MOB RULES is better as a whole.<br />LIVE EVIL is laughable because DIO tries to sing OZZ stuff and he sounds like a FRUITLOOP!<br /><br />The album cover for HEAVEN AND HELL is the BEST!
0062502182|5.0|From the mind of a great writer comes an extraordinary novel that explores the theme of following your heart. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an inspiring story of a young boy who leaves everything behind and, literally, follows his dream in search of a treasure hidden in the pyramids of Egypt.  <br /> Surrounded by failure and hardships, Santiago manages to continue on with his journey, never giving up, meeting people who influence his beliefs, for better or for worse. <br />       Coelho's genius use of metaphors fills the novel with inspiring passages. The concepts are simple, yet enlightening. For people who are concerned with the human spirit, this book holds the power to change lives. It reminds us of the simple things that can bring us happiness and give us a new perspective on life. <br />      After meeting the Alchemist at last, the boy reveals to him \\"My heart is afraid it will have to suffer,\\" and the Alchemist replies \\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. No heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\\" <br />     A book that makes you consider your own path in life is surely a book that will stay with you for years to come. <br />
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This digitizing of a film Blockbuster is perfect in every way.  While plot seems a little shallow, the entertainment value of the production cannot be denied.  Anyone watching this movie will be removed from the day to day stresses and come away happier.  There may be some insight into a bygone generation as well.
B00005JN5X|1.0|In 60 years, this could be the worst movie ever made.  There was nothing redeeming, whatsoever, about this movie.  The story was confusing, uninteresting and sloppy, with no plot at all/  The acting was abysmal.  I can't tell you about the very end because after, I don't know how long (seemed like days), all 4 of us finally walked out with about 3 minutes remaining.
B00079018K|5.0|Wow. I heard one song, rushed to get the rest of the album, and now I can't stop listening to it. I have it in the car, I have it on my computer, and I have it all loaded into my mp3 player.  I love it. All the comparisons to The Verve, Lo-Fidelity All-Stars and others are totally spot-on.  <br /> <br />Personal highlight is \\"I.D.\\" Hauntingly tripped-out.

1400095913|4.0|Dexter is a charming, witty, attractive and successful blood splatter expert in Miami Florida. The perfect catch. Except he also happens to be a sociopath who occasionally veers off the road of sanity and dismembers someone. The plus side is that his victims are always the dregs of society; Child molesters, and monsters who prey on the innocent. So in devine retribution, Dexter preys on them. What makes this book stand out in a densely populted genre, is the voice of the charming and often hiliarious anti-hero. Showtime is developing this character for an original series starring 'Six Feet Under's' Michael C Hall, who just might be the perfect casting choice for this wonderfully witty and twisted character.

0099483556|5.0|Reading Atonement was a wrenching experience. Once begun, I was driven to finish. The growing tension of the story made it impossible for me to stop reading until the advent of a new course of action and I was released me until the next time.<br /><br />In the innocence of childhood, precocious talents are encouraged, applauded. But by the next stage of development, adolescents are often capable of spite and revenge, and exhibit a certain primal sense of justice. Things are black and white, not mitigated, by circumstance and inside a clever young mind, a twisted labyrinth of perplexing ideation emerges. Simultaneously the ripe possibility of consequence is irresistible, hanging suspended, the flash of guillotine glinting above the prisoner's exposed, perhaps innocent, neck. When the blade descends, imagination prances about, dressed as truth and clearly believable. The young girl, Briony, is so perfectly realized that I recognized myself in her, caught in the consuming greed for notice, compelling the adults to admit the correctness of her new-found maturity, rather than the unstable perceptions of a child. All is contained in the moment, not the consequences, for Briony is immersed in her own self-importance. She is incapable of perceiving the degree to which lives are altered, incapable of such consideration. I can barely forgive her this hubris, no matter what her age.<br /><br />Two other characters are drastically affected, their lives irrevocably changed: Cecilia, Briony's older sister, and Robbie, grown son of a family retainer. Helpless to change the course of events, Cecilia bitterly carves out a life she can endure, unwilling to meet with her sister for years. Eventually, as Briony truly matures, she begins to fathom the nature of her misdeed and the moral burden she bears. In her guilty angst, Briony is humanized and made available as just another flawed human being. There is an indictment, through Briony, of the class-consciousness that enables accusation and judgment without the need of adequate proof. The lower classes of 1935 London are, in Briony's perception, simply incapable of the finer instincts of her class and therefore culpable by default. Social acceptance by virtue of birth or background creates a false sense of entitlement, eroding the society that gives it credence. By the end, I felt in need of redemption myself. But then, isn't that the point? pp Luan Gaines/2005.usation and judgment without the need of adequate proof.

B000000ORE|5.0|Ohhhhhh man, I heard some new Tesla stuff a while ago. So I've really been getting into Tesla as of late. Just bought \\"The Great Radio Controversy\\" since it looks like their best. Oh man, so happy I did. AMAZING CD. Even now, it still holds up with some of the newer cd's. I'm 15, and LOVE this cd, non-sexually, but man it is great. It's almost impossible to find a CD that beats this one out, it's just that great. I'll do a track by track breakdown. <br /> <br />Hang Tough: One of the best Tesla songs EVER, imo. I love this. Everytime I hear the opening riff, I know what's coming next. Jeff Keith's raspy voice \\"Took a shot to the chin, looks like you just can't win, in this do or die situation...\\" Such an amazing track, worth half the price of the CD. <br /> <br />Lady Luck: Oh man, we all know how luck works. But how many of us sing about it? I constantly find myself singing to this song, despite not singing much. Jeff Keith can do that to you... just an amazing track. Not as good as other tracks, but it's up there.  <br /> <br />Heavens Trail (No Way Out): Everyone talks about how great this song is and how it's the best. I wasn't impressed after listening the first time. Or the second. Or the third. Fourth time I noticed something... not sure what... but something. Fifth time I had to listen again. It really is that amazing. From the guitars, to the vocals... the chorus makes this song.  <br /> <br />Be A Man: I'll be honest, I haven't listened to this much, just because I'm 99% sure I'll be biased against it. I don't think Jeff Keith can match up to Randy Savage. I'll always be partial to Randy's song \\"Be A Man.\\" <br /> <br />Lazy Days, Crazy Nights: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh man. Great party song. This song always gets me in the mood to go out and hit the clubs. Sure I can't get into the clubs. But still, this song gets the place rocking. If you don't feel amped up after this song, I'll personally pay you $100. <br /> <br />Did It For The Money: I honestly don't getwhy people don't like this. This song is one of those songs that will get in your head, and just will not leave you alone. It's just in there. \\"MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!\\" Although considering this is one of my favorite tracks on the CD, I don't mind hearing it over and over. I'm sure you won't either.  <br /> <br />Yesterdaze Gone: Honestly, this track doesn't stand out much to me. I've only had the CD for 2 days, so I'm sure that'll change soon. But for now, this is just an amazing song, that really doesn't have anything \\"Special.\\" It's still better then anything out now though, so it's still a nice listen. But it's hard to know when it comes on. <br /> <br />Making Magic: Same deal as Yesterdaze Gone. <br /> <br />The Way It Is: Oh man. This song just ended. Such an AMAZING song! Jeff Keith lays down the law in this, and you listen. The lyrics are just, the kind of stuff you want to say. This chorus really just hooks you. Getting to the chorus, it sounds like another generic Tesla song, but the chorus sets it apart.  <br /> <br />Flight To Nowhere: Another great song. Really not much to say about it, but it's amazing. Every Tesla song is amazing. It's just about standing out. This song will amp you up though, not like \\"Lazy Days, Crazy Nights\\" but it'll still get the blood flowing. Like all good music should. <br /> <br />Love Song: Tesla's biggest hit. No where near as good as \\"Did It For The Money\\" Or \\"Lady Luck\\" or \\"Hang Tough\\" or even their early stuff in \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" but it's Tesla. Can't be bad. It starts out somewhat soft. Not Barry White like, but a very noticable change of pace. A very much needed change of pace. The end really picks up though, and that's where the song gets it. <br /> <br />Paradise: PARADISE! When listening to this song, you'll feel like you're in paradise. Amazing vocals, lyrics, and guitars. Like normal. It's expected from Tesla. <br /> <br />Party's Over: A great ending track. I love this song. It's just put together so well.No flaws in it. No complaints. Jeff Keith and crew really pull out the stops to make this an awesome cd ender, to get you to buy their next cd.   <br /> <br />Overall, this cd is around $10. How can you pass up? One of the best CD's of all time. If \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" was on this CD, I swear this would be the BEST CD EVER. There's no question about it. But it's not, so this is just an amazing cd. You don't find stuff like this anymore. Certainly something any rock fan needs. The alternative for the main stream crap they call rock, like My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and that other junk. If you buy this, and don't like it, I don't know what's wrong with you. You might need your head checked.  <br /> <br />
B00005Y84D|5.0|I will not dispute what the other reviewers here have said, it's all that and more.  Oh, and FORGET that hideous \\"We Are The World\\" crap, it was just an ego-trip for B. Geldof.  OK, that being said, please allow me to just highlight my favorite part of \\"Bangla Desh\\":  Leon Russell's rendition of \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" (giving the Rolling Stones at least perfuntory \\"exposure\\" here) coupled with that GREAT old Coasters' chestnut, \\"Youngblood.\\"  It's great, seeing Leon kind of jumpstart the other musicians with a most uptempo number - but my very favorite part is the segue between \\"JJF\\" and \\"Youngblood,\\" and then - especially then - seeing and hearing ex-\\"Mother,\\" Don Preston, almost unrecognizable with straight hair, sing the \\"bridge\\" in \\"Youngblood,\\" the part where he sings, \\"Hey, crazy little stuff...\\"  THAT is Rock And Roll, folks.

0743487583|5.0|This is an immortal tale about hybris, love and hate, justice, racism and the responsibilities of scientists.<br />Its fundamental question is: 'Had I the right to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? ... future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.'<br /><br />The 'unhallowed arts' of Frankenstein produce a 'filthy mass that moved and talked', but it is nevertheless a human being with normal human aspirations: 'Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good, misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'<br />But, Frankenstein is a 'painted bird': 'Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.'<br />His reaction is : 'If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear.'<br /><br />Mary Shelley's vision of mankind is far from rosy: 'I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.' 'A man was considered, except in very rare circumstances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few.' 'Was man yet so vicious and base? I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow.'<br />Her world is one of resentment, racism and jealousy: 'religion and wealth had been the cause of his condemnation.'<br />But, 'how strange is that clinging love we have of life, even on the excess of misery.'<br /><br />Frankenstein is the scion of the evil principle, the invention of a man-scientist and a 'painted bird', who is therefore not accepted by the rest of the human race. His reaction is revenge.<br /><br />This is a great text by an 18 year old.<br />As Oscar Wilde said in 'The Critic as Artist': 'For when a work is finished it has as it were, an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say'.<br />Some texts become even more important and luminous with time, like this masterpiece.<br /><br />A must read.nto its lips to say'.

B000002A3T|1.0|This album is a disaster.  If you can imagine the sound of slow rock/jazz mixed with new wave and done in the suckiest way possible . . . it would still be better than this album.  While earlier albums were genious, this is a wannabe album in that same pattern.  The songs sing a bunch about nothing, whereas when you listen to earlier albums, you can almost see a mysterious land and/or concept that many songs allude to.  After listening to this album once, I immediately had to pop in ummagumma (an earlier album) and listen to \\"The Narrow Way\\" just so I could hear brilliance once again after that crap.  This album is almost slanderous to the great name of Pink Floyd.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Black Sabbath comes to mind when \\"Your Time Has Come\\" rips apart the inner wiring to my car stereo. Muffled guitars and booming drums just scream \\"heavy stoner-rock from the '70s\\" while the bass leaves any passenger's brains on the dashboard to clean up later. But who's to complain? Rock is supposed to do that -- headaches, near deaf experiences, sudden concussions -- all part of the American rock 'n' roll dream.<br /><br />On the contrary, this is not Black Sabbath and this is not from the 1970s. \\"Your Time Has Come\\" is simply the opening track to Audioslave's sophomore release, Out of Exile. A rock marriage between ex-Soundgarden front man Chris Cornell and guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk of the late Rage Against the Machine, their wedding (or just self-titled debut) climbed Billboard charts in 2002 with singles like \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Show Me How to Live\\" and \\"Like A Stone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Be yourself is all that you can be,\\" Cornell chants over and over again on Out of Exile's first single, \\"Be Yourself.\\" This sounds more like the anthem to an Army advertisement than a chorus to a rock song. While the single's lyrics are dreary and the chorus is rather remedial, the song is catchy. Cornell's vocals echo gently over the Spanish riffs played by Morello and the rhythm section run hand-in-hand till the end. This song may be the single, but it's somewhat disappointing and unjustly represents the rest of the album.<br /><br />Fortunately Out of Exile has songs like the aforementioned tour-de-force, \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" and the grandiose, riff-rioting \\"Drown Me Slowly.\\" The song starts silently then quickly builds as Cornell stands up on his lonesome to preach: \\"I've got a will this time / don't care what you say / I've got a feeling / this will all go away.\\" But this is a duo act, and Morello speeds it up with a \\"turntable\\" solo that paves the runway for Cornell's voice to land on.<br /><br />Once on the ground, Cornell takes off and flies again, albeit a bit slower, with the ballad \\"Heaven's Dead\\" -- think of a southern rock twang but with a trademark bass sound provided by Commerford, and you're already hearing it. For those disappointed with Cornell's lyrics in \\"Be Yourself,\\" many will be pleasantly surprised by this song's second verse. Cornell nearly mirrors the lyrical styling of former FSU student Jim Morrison as he sings: \\"Shipwreck the sun / I'm on your side / an army of one / onward we'll ride.\\" As this continues, the ballad finishes up with a fitting solo unlike anything Morello has played before -- pleasant, yet tragic and melodic. It strays from rather than follows Morello's usual guitar sound.<br /><br />A personal favorite on the album, \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" spreads vibes of the '90s alternative era. Between Morello's solo that could easily be mistaken for Stone Gossard or Mike McCready of Pearl Jam and a \\"follow the bouncing ball\\" chorus, this song takes care of everything any rock fan might have written on their checklists. Uplifting, head bopping and total car stereo material, \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" is the sound the band was going for and has delivered.<br /><br />On the downside, Out of Exile is at times at odds with itself. For instance, the aforementioned single \\"Be Yourself\\" is strong musically, yet fails to make a connection lyrically, becoming rather repetitive. In the album's title song, the exact opposite happens when the music is underwhelming, but the lyrics stand strong. Since this happens early on in the album (tracks two and three, respectively), its flow starts rather awkward. Fortunately, the remainder gains momentum and glides evenly.<br /><br />What Audioslave accomplished is what makes Out of Exile important and successful. The major problem with rock super groups is their ties with the past and the inability to leave their previous formats. Out of Exile finds Audioslave finally breaking from its previous names and leaving its own heritage. Listen to \\"Heaven's Dead\\" or \\"Dandelion\\" and hear the harmonies or the guitar melodies that stray far, far away from anything that both Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine have ever done before. Clearly, Audioslave has come about, the touring honeymoon is over and its back.<br /><br />I'd like to see Velvet Revolver attempt to do that. Well ... maybe not.'s Dead\\" or \\"Dandelion\\" and hear the harmonies or the guitar melodies that stray far, far away from anything that both Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine have ever done before.

B00005JNTX|3.0|Robert Rodriguez make good children movies.  Sin City is not very different from Spy Kids in intelectual delights or graphic innovation.  The violence (that is only strong for American viewers  that don't watch world cinema or, let's say, news) is relentless and a little pointless (I mean, there is no use to it, no interesting commentary about it, it simply exists).  The CGI backgrounds are well used this time (vs. the well-received and far-from-good \\"Sky Captain...\\") but some of the shots (for example, when travelling in cars) are so stilized that take from the possible force of situations all the tension: in a fantasy world, the world of videogames and C-movies Rodriguez and Tarantino grew in, you never die even when you do and so there's no danger.  The non-linear screenplay ala \\"Pulp Fiction\\" also takes out of the film its share of interest, and so we are left with the esthetics and the gorgeous girls (and maybe that was the intention of the auteur).  I don't know if the film is going to survive the relentless advancement of technological eye candy (that makes fx made for fx wonderment some years ago look like, ahem, garbage) but the undoubtful interest of Rodriguez in his material and the efforts put in the realization makes this film at least a candidate to top the comic adaptation sub-genre for many years to come.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|As far as music goes, 2005 has been pretty nice. With releases from about every band you can think of, there shouldn't be any pestering or whining coming from any camps, from any fans. At beginning of March, everyone was treated to The Mars Volta's Frances the Mute. By the end of March, anyone who was still on track four of Frances, was treated to a new release from Beck with Guero. Come April and May, bands just kept dishing out disc after disc. About around this time was when I read the letter from my personal hero, Dave<br /><br />Grohl.<br /><br />News of the Foo Fighters' fifth studio album peaked over the horizon. Grohl made headlines about the double-disc delight, In Your Honor. Then and there, I almost forgot about every release thus far, except for Frances, considering track four still wasn't through yet.<br /><br />But was I excited? I was in over my head. So what happens? The album leaks online. Thousands of fans electronically dove on it like those starving barbarians on a can of Spam in Waterworld. I was one of them. You might say I played the role of Dennis Hopper's character.<br /><br />This album is the equivalent of Powerade on a hot day--necessary and totally refreshing. I haven't been this thrilled with an album, especially a Foo Fighters release, since I heard them on their first self-titled release approximately a decade ago. It's that good.<br /><br />\\"Can you hear me?\\" screams vocalist/guitarist Grohl. \\"Hear me screaming? / Breaking in the muted sky?\\" This all coincides with a screeching riff echoing over an amassing ocean, ready to break into a large wave. Drummer Taylor Hawkins kicks it off, nearly mirroring the sounds of a Led Zeppelin's legendary drummer John Bonham. This track (In Your Honor's title track) is uplifting, entrancing, enigmatic and everything that makes up a rock anthem.<br /><br />From here, the band jumps head on into \\"No Way Back,\\" one of the most rocking songs since the band's days of \\"Monkeywrench\\" or \\"I'll Stick Around\\" singles on rock radio. The song's aqua riff stems in fluid motion with the drums, as the lyrics surf off the hook--eventually becoming a hook itself. Everything about this song is what record executives want and what fans pine for. \\"No Way Back\\" is a perfect medium, a perfect opening to Foo's pinnacle album of their career.<br /><br />In Your Honor's single, \\"Best of You,\\" is an interesting choice for radio play, since there is no real riff that is catchy. The hook is in the vocals and Grohl just sets his throat on the microphone. \\"Best of You\\" is a great single, but is also deceiving, considering the rest of In Your Honor sounds nothing like it.<br /><br />\\"D.O.A.,\\" with its sticky guitar and killer drum patterns, has potential to be Foo Fighters' next single, if they opt for another rocker. The hard rocking \\"Free Me\\" comes in defiance to anyone who dismisses Hawkins as inferior to Grohl behind the kit.<br /><br />So if you're feeling hoarse toward the end of In Your Honor's first disc, the band succeeded. With the heavy rock over, the gentler acoustic portion begins, a musical aspect of The Foo Fighters that many fans have been waiting to see for years.<br /><br />\\"Still\\" starts the second disc and the listener is soon in the woods, far from the rock 'n' roll arena the Foo Fighters recently took them to. It's nothing but harmonies, duets and an intricate collaboration of both all the Foo Fighters have to offer now and all they hope to create in the future.<br /><br />\\"I've got my hands on a miracle,\\" Grohl serenades the listener on \\"Miracle.\\" By making bedfellows (in the studio) with Led Zeppelin veteran bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, Grohl is amidst happiness and glory. Considered to be his best-written song (Grohl said so himself), the song doesn't scream, but simply whispers excellence.<br /><br />\\"Friend of a Friend\\", a personal favorite, is a song from Grohl's Nirvana days. Carried over from his older demos, Grohl brings to the album something that'smore personal than anything else. Whether it's about he and his past friend (you-know-who) is up for the listener to decide and for Grohl to know for sure.<br /><br />A cool bossanova groove on \\"Virginia Moon\\" features acclaimed jazz vocalist Norah Jones. The song isn't anything stellar, but separates the band from the usual sound it adheres to. Instead there's an eccentric guitar upbeat with synchronization between Grohl and Jones' vocals. On \\"Cold Day in the Sun,\\" Taylor Hawkins puts down the drumsticks and actually belts out on a Foo Fighters record. Grohl and guest guitarist Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal) chime out the lullaby \\"Razor.\\" Anyone looking to a follow-up to \\"Everlong\\" (possibly the Foo Fighters' best known radio single), this is as close as you're going to get.<br /><br />With all of this in the course of an hour and twenty-three minutes, the Foo Fighters take a daring step in releasing a double album. Where Nine Inch Nails failed in 2000 with the release of the double-disc catastrophe, 2000's The Fragile, the Foo Fighters succeed with In Your Honor.<br /><br />There is nothing dismal, nothing tragic nor anything wrong with this album. This is a long ride on a memorable wave that any music-surfer dreams about--a wave ten years in the making.album something that's more personal than anything else.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is by far my favorite CD!!!!!!!!! <br />They have the most peaceful and soothing voices . I listen to them everyday at work!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|My in-laws refused to see it in the movies.  They wouldn't rent the DVD.  I bought them Chinese take-out with the priviso that the meal was attached to a viewing of Kung Fu Hustle.  They reluctantly agreed.  They were shocked by the beginning, roaring with laughter in the middle and sighing at the end.  They offered to pay for the dinner.  This movie is great!
B0009MAO46|5.0|Toy story is one of Disney's best movies and is the first cg movie that has paved the way for movies such as Shrek and Finding nemo and seems as though all Cg movies are smash hits Every single film from Pixar has been an it all started with this one.  Had Toy Story bombed at the Box office I doubt there would be any Pixar today and Disney would not be scrambling to resign Pixar becuase they know Every movie from Pixar is a hit so Disney is stupid not to resign Pixar.  Disney needs Pixar as much as Pixar needs Disney. Just look back at the Past few Years Disney has not released a Blockbuster Hit since Mulan the only hits they have had has been the ones with Pixar.  Who would have thought it all statrted with a movie about toys. Toy Story is great for all ages 5 stars I never got the chance to own Toy Story on dvd it was back in the vault quicker then they could turn the key. <br /> <br />I own this dvd bought it on Day 1 the picture is crystal clear it looks awesome.  The sound is much improved. They have really made this movie shine.  Hard to believe this movie is already 10 years old.If you are a disney fan this is a must own.  If you own the previous versions to me 16 dollars is worth picking up this edition.  It looks much better then the previous dvd release and has some new features.  I guarantee if you like Disney and pixar movies this is the movie to get.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I have always gotten good service and merchadise from Amazon. Also promt delivery.
B0000251WA|5.0|What else is their to say.  IRON MAIDEN LIVE FROM DONNINGTON.   Any Maiden fan will appreciate this live album.  This is the final album before Bruce Dickinson left.  This features all their major hits FEAR OF THE DARK, RUNNING FREE, IRON MAIDEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME and many more.  All Maiden fans should get this one.<br />IRONS UP
B0000035E7|5.0|Bleach is a great album, but not many people know about it.  All of the time people refer to Nirvana's \\"2 albums\\", they had 3.  This is their best, In Utero is a close second, and the box set has some great stuff too.  I HATE Nevermind.  I can't listen to it anymore.  It's too popy.  It's barely even rock, let alone punk (grunge is the 90's version of New Wave: everything was shoved into that catagory, so I don't believe in it).  That's why In Utero is so raw and aggressive.  Kurt hated being famous (maybe why he comitted suicide), and made In Utero to show he is NOT a \\"Radio friendly unit shifter\\".  Once I started listening to Bleach and In Utero, I will never go back to Nevermind.  Nevermind \\"Nevermind\\", get this one.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I think it is the best one of the year, but it's not what I expected when I walked into the theater.  I have always loved Sim City, in fact I have every version of it on my computer dating back to the original Sim City all the way to Sim City 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack, but I don't see how they got the material for the movie from a game with no violence or even characters to speak of, much less tortured anti-heroes like in the movie.  Ah well, it is still a fun and thrilling movie.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This is an alright album, I'm giving it four stars because like most reviewers I'm partial to the S/T, however change is a good thing, and Battle Of One sounds like the best of the S/T so all is well. The most prevalent issue of the album is the copyright protection. I found a way around it and you all should as well. <br /> <br />1) Copy the tracks using the program the disc gives you <br />2) Burn it using any software other than the discs software, even WMP can do it <br />3) Rip it back to your computer using the CD-R copy, and hand the CD-R to someone who hasn't heard of 30STM or put the original on the shelf and use the CD-R for road trips/car listening <br /> <br />And you now have unprotected mp3's available for iTunes, iPod's or anything otherwise without worrying about those hidden drivers. Don't forget that shift key trick, and make sure you check C;/Windows/System32/Drivers for the most recent driver if it did. If it's around the same time you popped the disc and you're sure of it, delete the driver; but if you aren't sure, don't even do it. But that's your failproof way to get your own mp3's that YOU BOUGHT.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Although Rob Halford (who still possesses a ferocious voice) dips perhaps a few too many times into his own bag of classic lyrics (\\"Stained class,\\" \\"Sad wings of destiny,\\" \\"Under blood red skies,\\" i.e.), the band delivers a fantastic slab that stands aside any of Priest's classic 70's material.<br /><br />To be honest, I lost interest in the band for most part after Defenders.  But when i read about this new release with Rob back aboard, I had to 'ave a listen - and am I glad I did!<br /><br />There are a ton of cool riffs on this album. Although occasionally the whole thing does get a bit Spinal Tap (who of course Priest loved, and so do I), the chops displayed by all five musicians, combined with an amazing enthusiasm undimmed by decades of playing heavy metal music, ensure that you never get bored.  This stuff plays like the best Judas Priest - generally good and fast, sweet guitar tone and some choice solos by both Glenn and K.K., and the rhythm section is especially solid.<br /><br />If I had to choose between this and Hell Bent For Leather, I'd go with Hell Bent... but, this is a really good album.
B0009UC810|3.0|In 1975, \\"Saturday Night Live\\" premiered and made stars of the Not Ready For Primetime Players.  In 1978, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE made a superstar of John Belushi.  Even after Steven Spielberg's 1941 (called a \\"$40 million turkey\\" by Rolling Stone) in 1979, Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were still a hot item and ready to become the next Abbott & Costello or Martin & Lewis.<br /><br />THE BLUES BROTHERS hit screens in the summer of 1980.  They already had a number one album the year before with \\"A Briefcase Full of Blues\\" and the characters of Jake & Elwood Blues were already stars from SNL, so the movie was bound to be a hit.  I saw the movie several times, I bought the soundtrack (on 8-track!), everyone got into it.<br /><br />But I never thought the movie was that funny.  I still don't, but I ran out and bought the 25th anniversary DVD to watch all the extras.<br /><br />Aykroyd admits that he had no idea how to write a screenplay when he sat down to write this movie, and John Landis admits that they didn't have a completed script when shooting started--so I guess it turned out pretty good!<br /><br />The \\"extended version\\" includes a few short scenes that weren't really missed.  Watching the movie again, I noticed Belushi's nasal voice in different scenes--which is sad if you've read Bob Woodward's WIRED (Stay way away from the horrid movie version, despite a great performance from THE SHIELD's Michael Chiklis as John).  I just remember someone saying that \\"Thank God he had to wear sunglasses the entire movie.\\"<br /><br />Look for Paul Ruebens (Pee Wee Herman) as a waiter in the restaurant scene and Steven Spielberg as the Cook County assessor at the end.  And look real fast for John Landis as a state trooper in the cruiser during the mall demolition chase scene (as \\"Trooper La Fong\\").  And Judy Jacklin (Belushi's wife) and \\"Saturday Night Live\\" writer Rosie Shuster as cocktail waitresses in the Murph & the Magictones/Holiday Inn scene.

0887307280|4.0|Great book to get you thinking about your current small business or one that you are planning.  This book takes you through the three types of people : technican, entrepreneur, and manager.  Guess what you have to be all three and in good balance.  Gerber then discusses how to apply the thinking behind a franchise to your own small business even if you have no intention of ever franchising it.  He helps you think about your business from a systems point of view.  Gerber spends the rest of the book talking about the business development process, which includes your primary aim, marketing strategy, systems strategy, people strategy, management strategy, etc. I have run a small consulting business for 5 years and I wish had read this book years ago.  Oh well, never too late to get on track.
B000002KZA|4.0|This is Depeche Mode's most idealistic outing. 'Shame', 'The Landscape is Changing', and '...And Then' feature lyrics concerned about human misery towards itself and it's home planet. And for a moment it seems that a smile and the will to avoid littering and forest fires are the solution for everyday's issues. After Construction the band became way more pessimistic (Some Great Reward's 'Blasphemous Rumors' comes to mind).<br /><br />The collection of songs sound very basic and you can easily hear the effects, production tricks and things that became Depeche Mode's trademarks starting to take form in this one. 'Told You So' is a damn fine masterpiece with its strong lyrics and sudden rythm changes, as well as 'Shame' and 'Everything Counts'. Though I like the 101 version way more because it sounds really powerful and the one featured in this disc lacks that punch.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is a nice start for a DM newbie, but once you become familiar with the bands musical approach it would be a nice touch to see where it all started, and it actually started with this... Or you can do yourself a favor and get Some Great Reward, which is something like this but vastly improved.
0152023984|5.0|The Little Prince  I'm Jung, Yang-Jin. Algonquincollege student in Ottawa.         I read the little prince 2times 15years ago and a few days ago. If I choose two beautiful words, I choose the words `love' and `tame', which may have the same connotation. When we tame others, we become responsible for them. I think It means \\"I love you\\". Relationship needs patience. When we meet others the first the first time, we are nothing to one another. But if we tame each other, we recognize happiness and joy in ourselves. It means that we become meant for each other. Besides, we think that we are valued friends, because we spend our time for each other. And we are responsible for each other. Taming each other would be a really beautiful thing. The little prince's rose was just one of five thousand clusters, and he was bitten by a snake for his tamed rose. Even though his body is gone, his mind remained. How pure he is! I saw a hat in prince's painting which he painted for boa constrictor digesting an elephant as others. Also, I couldn't see any sheep inside the box. I am no longer innocent. I have already lost the purity of children; however, this book helped me reflect on my juvenile mind. Adults can only be understood by seeing or knowing things. I recommend this book to all the adults who forget the most important things in modern civilization.
B00005221M|4.0|Yes girls, we all get that pulse-quickening feeling at the sight of Hawkeye, smoldering and sensual in his buckskin pants, shouting insistently: <br /> <br />\\"I WILL find you!\\"  <br /> <br />Well, certainly he will find her. With those rippling muscles and flowing hair, he can't miss.  <br /> <br />Of course, in the book version, he doesn't find her, and she's stabbed to death by Indians. But never mind that! See this movie instead of reading the book, for an extremely satisfying, romantic, all-ends-well story. Just don't try to use it as a substitute for the novel by James Fenimore Cooper. You're gonna flunk that book report.
0515125024|3.0|Jack Reacher is wandering along the streets of Chicago when he sees a damsel in distress . . . and soon finds himself being kidnapped.<br /><br />From that chance encounter, Lee Child builds a dramatic story about paranoid militias that will both make you laugh and cause you feel a little uncomfortable. Both are intentional.<br /><br />The book is pretty much one attempt after another to thwart the villains before they do another dastardly deed. Most of the episodes are reasonably entertaining. But the writing needs work. Most of the characters don't have much substance to them, and there's a weapons' focus that's a little unnecessary. Sprinkle that with lots of gruesome gut-wrenching violence, and you've got a book that's less pleasant to read than it might have been.<br /><br />If you liked Killing Floor, you may like this book as well.<br /><br />Lee Child is good at thinking up plots and interesting situations. I'm sure his writing will improve with time. He has a story teller's instinct for what will grip the reader.<br /><br />Enjoy these last days of summer with this page turner.
0060751967|5.0|if you read most of the reviews (heck, including mine), you've ready most of the book already. but you should still read it... because - how often do you run across a hot sexy physically virgin vampire who'd commit to a big house with a big yard and a big dog and willing to get his DNA implanted into a boogy sperm to make sure the mortal love of his life would be his wife, mother to his children, and soulmate? <br /> <br />i normally don't reread my smaller paperbacks but i have a feeling this will be in my library of favorites. it was spunky, feisty, saucy, and all around fun. and - like some of the other reviewers - i am eagerly anticipating a series based on this book. heck, i'd be happy to read more about roman and shanna. <br /> <br />infact, sparks can call the next sequel \\"how to domesticate a millionaire vampire\\" for the sequel. perhaps followed by \\"how to raise mini half vampires\\".  <br /> <br />...it should be interesting trying to spoon a vampire in his sleep when he's dead cold, no?
0880389052|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend and was doubtful, so I went to the library to check it out and couldnt put it down until I finished.  The most in depth characters of any book I've ever read and the detail of the story is top notch.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
1400032717|2.0|I found this book to be odd and not very interesting.  It is written in the first person as a 15 year old boy with autism. This was believeable.  As a person with very little time to read, I would not have choosen this book (it was chosen as the first book for a new book club).  It was a fairly quick read.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 was my introduction to Rush, and in my opinion, there's no better way to be introduced to them.  I first heard this album in an art class in high school where the teacher allowed the students to bring in their own music to play during class.  We were working on black light posters on that particular day (this WAS the 70's, remember?) and I was busily working on my contribution while the music provided some barely noticed background noise.  Then something exploded.  Peart's drum fill in the opening shattered my world, and for the next 20+ minutes I forgot all about my supposed art project.  Toward the end of side one the teacher suddenly noticed that I had made NO progress on my piece and came over to deliver a lecture on wastring my time and hers.  I mumbled an apology, something about losing myself in the music and the story, and her whole attitude changed.  She pulled up a chair and sat down, wanting to know if I was kidding and, if not, what it was about the music that captured my undivided attention.  I didn't have the vocabulary to explain it, but she knew anyway.  From that day on, I was a Rush fan, and listening to Top 40 radio made it seem like I was cheating myself out of something.  To this day, 2112 can still stop me dead in my tracks, and I owe it all to a failed art career that stalled in high school.
B00007ELEL|5.0|i think i have laughed so hard only for a few movies,  <br />\\"Return of the Pink Panther\\" is one that comes to mind! <br />literally, i got stomach cramps because i was lauching so hard! <br />jeff bridges was in his element in this one, he was flawless in this movie, and i hope he does a part 2 for this movie, because it will be a blockbuster.
B00005JN5X|1.0|The Brothers Grimm had to be the worst movie I have seen all summer.  This movie's plot seemed to be a weak combination of Van Helsing and Lord of the Rings with a little twist, but most of the elements in this movie could be found in the two mentioned movies.   <br /> <br />If I ignore the bad acting, bad comedy, and the bad character development, I found the worst part of the movie to be the plot holes.  Most of these plot twists seemed to mostly revolve around a girl named Sasha (the girl that looked like a boy).  It seems like bad supernatural things kept on happening to her, and then in the next scene you would see her again back to normal.  This happened after she was eaten by a horse, swallowed by the gingerbread man, and also in a few other spots.   <br /> <br />I also had a problem with all of the bad French sterotypes that were in the movie.  I understand that the french were one of the bad groups of characters, but the sterotypes were over the top, annoying, insulting, and unnecessary <br /> <br />I did like the idea of incorporating all of the Grimm characters, but it wasn't good enough.  The Brother Grimm storys should remain children stories ment to terrify children into behaving.
1400032717|5.0|The most amazing thing about that book is the emotional charge conveyed through seemingly emotionless, logical narration of the autistic boy. Mark Haddon lets you into the boy's head; lets you see the world through his eyes with all its inconsistencies, unpredictability, chaos. The book reads like a detective novel. What starts like a crime puzzle, however, develops into the boy's methodical unlayering of the maze of human souls. The plot has great twists and plenty of moral baggage. A very moving read.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Downs best. No other metal band sounds like this. They are a nice mix of in your bleepin' face intense metal/totally goofy and insane with their vocals. \\"Suggestions\\" is the first awesome example for this band getting insane/goofy with vocals and on following albums they do the same thing here and there, but they also get quite dark and dramatic with their vocals on the following song \\"Spiders\\" my favorite of their big hit songs. Awesome metal album for anyone who loves metal.<br /><br />They are a unique turn for metal and keeps it alive and kicking with mind crushing guitar riffs, crazy freakin' vocals and some oddball funny lyrics. Lots of crazy headbanging fun from start to finish in a new and always in your face sorta way. The most fun you'll ever have with heavy metal.<br /><br />System of a Down makes Disturbed look like The Brady Bunch.

B000035P7X|4.0|I recommend this dvd for all music lovers.  Not only does it give a rare view into Dylan's private life, but it also provides a glimpse of a very different time period.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed this series when it originally aired on Fox.  Firefly is by far the best science fiction series I have seen.  I've never liked Star Trek and saw through Star Wars as a giant marketing platform.  Firefly is something entirely different.  There is originality here; its not the cookie cutter outer space science fiction bred in the 70s.  This is a series that I think anyone who likes action, in depth characters, superb acting, and good special effects would thoroughly enjoy.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|I think the latter. I apologize if I offend Vincent Gallo/Vincent Gallo Fans, but this was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever experienced.  I loved Buffalo 66, but what the heck was this?!  One hour and 15 minutes of Gallo's character driving across country. You could watch this movie in maybe 20 minutes if you put it on fast forward, while using the subtitle option on your DVD player.  There is little to no dialogue of any importance. The whole movie is summed up in the last 15 minutes of the movie, when we finally see Gallo's monster phallus and Chloe Sevigny servicing it. The story itself is very sad, and really could've been done better with a rewrite (including some freaking dialogue) and a few extra likeable characters. I really wanted to like this movie, and I felt kind of cheated.

1878424114|5.0|The fact that this little book has received 135 reviews and counting is because so many want others to share in this.  Profound yet simple. Life changing. Contrary thinking to our unsuccessful ways. When Deepak Chopra tells us to quit wasting energy trying to convince others of our opinions, I will need some time to implement that into my life. I know it will come, because now when I am done trying to convince others of my point of view, to no avail, I think back to his advice, and realize I need to acquire it as a natural trait. Realizing each time how much time and energy I just wasted. This just scratches the surface.<br />The other profound lesson that is changing my life is that the question we should be asking ourselves, is \\"How can I help, How can I serve\\" instead of \\"What's in it for me\\" Combining that with giving freely, in line with the laws of nature, is giving me a new foundation for forming a company I am working on. It completely shifted my focus to helping, instead of demanding. I know that by serving freely the interests of my patrons, I will receive like kind in return. Not because I require it, but rather because that is the way it flows; even to the point of concentrating my efforts now on helping the maximum amount of people, rather than making them customers.<br />All of this is predicated on the necessity to meditate to get in touch with your inner... as he calls it, the embryo of your God self. Which is a part of the infinite potentiality, the essential energy of all things. In so doing, making the unmanifest, into the manifest. Some say that all of mankind's problems can be reduced to his inability to sit still, quietly, for 15 minutes.<br />Deepak Chopra and Dr Wayne Dyer co-authored a book. I thank Dr Wayne Dyer for showing me how to meditate by simply lying down or sitting, and gently letting all thoughts leave my mind. Each thought is tied to an emotion. When all thoughts finally leave, a profound change occurs. I arise feeling completely renewed. Deepak Chopra is now introducing me to new ways to utilize this new domain, to bring my desire and intention into fulfillment. (As long as my desire is in keeping with helping and serving)<br />Please read this book. It will profoundly change your life, especially if you read it again, and again. Not just reading, but also examining your own life, in relation to the new, profound, simple truths that you wish you knew all along, and all of the time. I am already beginning to experience some of the bliss and joy that he has taught me how to acquire. I see others and wish I could share it with everyone. I know it would sound fairy tale like to some, but I know the incredible knowledge this book contains to be the truth.<br />I wanted to say that although this book is based on his other work, \\"Creating Affluence\\" I like \\"The Seven Spiritual Laws\\" better. It is a more practical, put it to use approach. Creating affluence is less profound, and earth moving. A great book, but be sure and get the Seven Spiritual Laws.<br />I hope this review helps to make others buy this book. I can't say enough about it. Highly, highly recommend.

B00000099Y|2.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I wish I would have borrowed it from him first. I will admit, there are 2 or 3 good songs on here, but even those are too artsy and weird, and it isn't an organic weird, it sounds forced. I think, personally, that if you don't like at least 75% of a CD within the first couple of listens, it isn't worth it. I've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me, but I still think it is not that good.
0689865384|4.0|I let this book sit on my shelf for awhile, figuring that I already knew after a few glances what it was about, and that it was so long it was bound to get preachy on the prettiness theme.<br /><br />Once I started reading, however, I was hooked until the very end. The scenery was varied, new characters were introduced often enough to keep me interested, and the ending is a great setup for a sequel. I especially liked how the futuristic technology had definite rules and limits: they made the action sequences all the more exciting and suspenseful.<br /><br />I give this book four stars instead of five because we know right from the first chapter who the good and bad guys are, and where right and wrong lie in the book. I would have liked it to be a little more ambiguous for me, as it was for the main character. What if the \\"policers\\" weren't so obviously cruel and controlling-- what if their paternalism was a little more convincing, because they believed they were doing what was best? That would have added more complexity to the book, and put me in a mental space more like the main character's.<br /><br />This book was long without running out of ideas. There's a short excerpt at the back from the next volume, and it's intriguing. I'm long past teenagerhood and enjoyed \\"The Uglies\\" a lot.
B0009X7664|5.0|The word \\"classic\\" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote (\\"Lonesome Dove\\") that doesn't pander to the audience makes \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.<br /><br />Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, \\"Mockingbird\\" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes \\"Mockingbird\\" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.<br /><br />Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..<br /><br />The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's \\"Scott Remembers\\" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.<br /><br />The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. \\"A Conversation with Gregory Peck\\" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.<br /><br />Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.<br /><br />A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.ry\\" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie is absolutely incredible. Outstanding acting (especially the lead character...give that man an oscar), directing, story line, camera work, etc. I guarantee you won't see anything like this compared to what Hollywood puts out which is ironic since I hear they're going to make a US version (if they do, guaranteed to be a disappointment). Oldboy is completely sick, twisted, taboo yet beautiful at the same time. Your emotions just go on a rollercoaster throughout the movie. From the minute the movie starts it just grabs you, never a dull moment in this one. The story is so gut wrenching you won't be able to get it out of your head...when the movie ended I just sat on my couch stunned thinking I can't believe what I just saw. Then I woke up the next day thinking the same thing. I've seen this a couple times now and each time its been awesome so its definitely one to buy. I don't like to hype up movies too much but this one deserves it all and more...a true masterpiece. <br /> <br />
0385338686|5.0|I was a little disappointed with the last Shopaholic book (Shopaholic and Sister), so I was a bit tentative when I first started reading Undomestic Goddess.  Ms. Kinsella certainly got out of the Shopaholic rut with this new book! <br /> <br />Who hasn't thought at one time or another of chucking their career and moving off to a place where no one knows your name (sort of the Anti-Cheers :) )???  It's appealing at times when the day to day grind starts to get to you.  There were times when I could really relate to Samantha (although I do know how to cook and clean for myself, despite being an attorney).  In an engaging and entertaining way, Ms. Kinsella addressed the deeper subject of finding what is really truly important in your life and taking the direction that makes you most happy - even if it's unpopoular or if others don't understand.  Who can't relate to that?   <br /> <br />And, honestly, who hasn't fantasized about a relationship with the sexy gardener at some point?  :) :)

B0000WN0VY|5.0|Have you seen the movie Closer yet, if not watch the movies and listen to the song being played throughout the movie. Then do what I did, find out who sang this hauntingly beautiful song, and buy the CD. The Blowers Daughter, is one of the best songs that I have heard in a long time. The song sticks to your mind, body and spirit, if this song does not get to you, there is something wrong with you. Then after yoy have played that song, sit back and listen to the others songs that will grow on you too. I agree with some of the other who have reviewed this CD, you will not be diappointed,this is one not just a good CD,it's a great one.
B000002GB2|5.0|Styx played at my school, Lambuth University (700 students!) in the spring of 1974. They were not known at all nationally yet, but I have to say that show in our small auditorium remains to this day the best concert I ever saw. And at age 53, I've been fortunate to see virtually every great band from '67 to '83. The opening, in complete darkness, had the William Tell overture soaring through the crowd as they hit the stage. Styx went on to great pop heights over the next few years, but I still think Equinox is the best album. Every song is tight,well written, and simply cooks. Don't miss this overlooked rock classic.
B000A88F22|5.0|This show got a lot of flack for being too choppy, too real, too sexual, and to in your face. I LOVED IT! If you want \\"staged\\" reality tv check out Newlyweds. If you can handle \\"real\\" people get CHAOTIC! Its AMAZING! I love the way Britney showed us her real side. Without the makeup, without the hair being \\"did\\" and without the worry of who is going to say what. \\"Controversy, its what they want!\\" TWO HUGE THUMBS way UP for Britney and Kevin: CHAOTIC!
B0006L16N8|4.0|I think it's extremely inappropriate that metalheads who have no taste for this type of music are writing reviews here. I mean, there's a reason why I don't review a lot of overly mainstream artists/albums, because people of my cohort also realize it's worthless probably and  <br /> <br />Now, for the review! <br /> <br />\\"X&Y\\" is possibly the best of Coldplay's three albums to date, all of which I enjoy to a certain extent. All 13 songs are good. The songs are memorable, and the first five tracks are possibly the greatest ones on the album. I love the atmospherics and structure of the aural bliss of \\"Square One,\\" \\"Fix You\\" is one of the group's greatest ballads, \\"White Shadows\\" shows they have edge, \\"Fix You\\" is a slow-burner track, and then \\"Talk\\" comes in with a cool Kraftwerk riff. None of the songs are really bad, though, and even though their lyrics can be trite and simplistic, that's doesn't completely stand up as a criticism. Kind of like how the cover art is simplistic yet brilliant. Give it the time to listen to it. They might be overhyped but are one of the better mainstream artists around.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This film has achieved what no other comicbook superhero remake film has ever achieved. An intelligent plot and an interesting script. Even though this film depends largely on it's amazing and unique special effects the script does not fail in intising the viewer either. At first the film would appear to be one that appeals to the effect loving star-wars fan, but after watching you will be pleasantly suprised to see that it has quite an intelligent plot. What this film managed to achieve is a completely lack of the glamour which makes nearly all remakes terribly predictable, I could describe the film as a visual interpretation of a Tom Waits song.  <br />So if you're looking for a film that finally gives that goodie 2 shoes superhero a slap in the face, this is it.
B000002KHH|5.0|And to tell you the truth, I'm a fairweather fan of metal at best, but if it's done in a way that I would like, then I go for it. I'm more into stuff like NIN and the Smashing Pumpkins in general, but listening to older works by the latter and listening to this shows that there was an influence of this on my favorite bands as well (Tool are a good example of a favorite of mine with a great Sabbath influence). There is a reason why several songs on this album, as the editorial review says, ended up on the greatest-hits album: Every single track on this album is a classic. And some artists will sometimes even release 3 times as much and not have the ideas executed nearly as well. <br /> <br />There is nothing but talent executed on the record, and rather than sound like a trainwreck mess that is directionless (that happens sometimes with actually talented bands), they turn in for some great songs. I particularly love \\"Electric Funeral\\", a great example of a track which uses the \\"wah\\" effect to put an interesting atmosphere. I really love the bridge and guitar solo where the tempo changes in it. I assume you've already heard \\"Iron Man\\" if you're looking here. Well if you haven't then go familiarize yourself. Even if you don't like the album I have no idea how you couldn't at least respect the music for what it did. And it's quite a bit different than Led Zeppelin in fact. I love that band too, but this is darker and more metal. They've got a great bassist in Geezer Butler that hearing is part of why you'd buy this. Even the straightforward and simple \\"Paranoid.\\" doesn't fail in its delivery. Then towards the end you get to the lesser known songs, and neither are any less good. Where Ozzy's vocals usually goes with the guitar and/or bass, that starts to change when you get to \\"Hand of Doom\\", one of the greatest bass tracks on the album. \\"Rat Salad\\" is an interesting track to say the least, almost like an intermission between \\"Doom\\" and \\"Jack the Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\\". I don't know if it's very easy to say much negative about the album. I feel like while you can say hard-rock totally existed before Black Sabbath, and metal bands were around, Black Sabbath were the band where the genre finally became itself. However, it would not have mattered if the musicianship and songs weren't as good, and thus wouldn't have been near as much of an influence. And the album is just proof of that, and you are not going to need to be convinced by some person just making an attempt to say something that they think of certain albums. <br /> <br />**Side note: Don't take many of the negative reviews seriously. Although I can't believe that some people would say some of what they did. They might be jokes but that joke stopped being funny halfway through. Skip over this and decide to buy the album if you haven't already, by the way.**
B00003CX5P|1.0|As always in Star-Wars, this film fails over it's plot. Time after time SW movies have shown the amount of holes a plot can have as long as the movie has good special effects. A fair amount of people look beyond the plot of the movie and enjoy the the effects and perhaps a floppy joke here and there but in the end of the day, a movie cannot exist for an intelligent audience without a truly interesting and complex plot. <br /> <br />If SW Ep.1 was considered a childrens movie, I would have given it a four star mark, though seeing as it's an \\"all ages\\" movie, the expectations from the script are much higher. If we could compare for a moment, Pulp Fiction and SW, we would notice that the dialog of the entire SW Ep.1 movie amounts to about 5 minutes of Pulp Fiction's smart script. This is where we separate picture book from novel. <br /> <br />Less of a film, more of a demonstration of graphic technology today sprinkled with a few good actors.  <br /> <br />If you're buying it, get it for your children and not for yourself.
B00000IYWH|4.0|The 6 bonus tracks are well known to ELVIS fans;they were all included in ELVIS'S GOLDEN RECORDS VOLUME 3.Those cds who had added tracks in 1997 are so good that you may wonder if you need an original album.ELVIS IS BACK is worth buying if you are an ELVIS collector.MAKE ME KNOW IT is a good swingin' opener while FEVER does not beat PEGGY LEE's version;THE GIRL OF MY BEST FRIEND is vintage ELVIS and so are DIRTY,DIRTY FEELING,SOLDIER BOY and SUCH A NIGHT which is a nice showcase of ELVIS's vocal range;GIRL NEXT DOOR WENT A WALKIN is also pleasant.The surprize of the disc is RECONSIDER BABY,a commanding blues.I WILL BE HOME AGAIN(the guitar echoes ONE NIGHT),THE THRILL OF YOUR LOVE,IT FEELS SO RIGHT and LIKE A BABY are the fillers.It was a nice comeback from THE KING who matured as a singer but also becomes less infuated with rock'n roll.It was the shapes of things to come in the future.

B0000AUHOH|5.0|Maybe I'm too much of a Star Trek geek for my own good, but I must admit that the Final Frontier has always been one of my personal favorites. First we find out that Spock has a half brother, and this selfsame half brother is trying to take over the Enterprise in search of God. The outer reaches of space never seemed so dark or mysterous as the crew battles their own personal inner demons on the way to helping Sybok destroy his own.<br /><br />Yes the romance between Scotty and Uhura seems rather sudden, but I found it rather charming, its time someone apreciated her.<br /><br />The banter is as humerous as ever as the holy Trinity (Spock, McCoy and Kirk) start of the movie sitting around a campfire, introducing Spock to Whisky and song. Row Row your boat for that matter, while Spock synthesizes marshellow's to roast.<br /><br />In short, I guess what I'm trying to say that this movie is wonderful, and a definate must see.<br /><br />Let it take you into realms where no man has gone before

B00006GFAB|4.0|When confronted by the sheer number of KISS compilations that have been made over the years, one can be forgiven for walking away with a sense of disgusted futility. However, all is not lost, and there is hope for a whole new generation of KISS freaks.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best of Kiss\\" is a 21-song, hour-plus CD that covers songs from as far back as 1974 right up to 1992. Some of my own favourites are \\"Deuce\\", \\"I Stole Your Love\\" and \\"Detroit Rock City\\". Of course, most of the others are fantastic as well.<br /><br />For a good overview of KISS and their evolution over the years, this CD is a good one. It will give you a very broad idea of what the KISS phenomenom was all about, and what their music can be like.<br /><br />Just as a final thought, I was really impressed with the variety of guitar work in the music, and the different styles used between songs.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best of KISS\\" is a great first step to meeting some gods of rock and roll and a time when gaudy costumes ruled the stage and generous chest hair was considered sexy.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I have watched this dvd many times and find it to be good but not great.Erics guitar playing stands out as the highlight of the whole show,John Mayer was a very pleasant surprise and Joe Walsh still has it,Robert Crays tune was another highlight.I enjoyed the playing in the dvd but it did not seem to have an over all continuity to it and sometimes it was easy to lose interest,the inclusion of Jeff Beck would have been a big plus,so if you buy it you will enjoy it but you will probably flip around alot like I do.

B0009UC810|4.0|The extended version of \\"The Blues Brothers\\" (147 minutes) has long been available on DVD, but the theatrical (132 minutes) has never been out there. (Universal, in an odd retro move, put the films on flip sides of the same disc.)<br /><br /> Viewers who are in it just for the comedy probably could do without the extra 15 minutes, whose add-ons include a dubious scene of Elwood Blues quitting his day job and a drawn-out ending. But music lovers strike it rich -- a good chunk of the added time goes to expanding killer performances by James Brown, John Lee Hooker and Cab Calloway.<br /><br />It gets better: The Dolby Digital 5.1 remix is a monster, about as good as it gets with pre-digital-era movies. Clear and strong vocals, fun surround action and big-bottom bass. (The theatrical version is in stereo.)<br /><br />Brown's turn as a soul-stirring preacher goes from high to higher, the action stretched out a minute and a half. It's an astonishing sequence, probably the best in the film, as dance and gospel fuse in a spiritual frenzy. Brown's scorching vocals were recorded live. Turn it up and behold.<br /><br />At full length, John Lee Hooker's street performance of \\"Boom Boom\\" will knock you right down. Originally slashed to 1:15, the number gets its due over full 3 minutes. Hooker is joined by Walter Horon and Pinetop Perkins in the film's only authentic blues.<br /><br />The new version of Cab Calloway's onstage fantasy \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" preserves one of the century's best song-and-dance bits, all class and sass. The performance jumps from 2 minutes to 5. Director John Landis recalls that Calloway was \\"very unhappy\\" when told he couldn't perform his new disco version of the classic, but finally got into the spirit.<br /><br />Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles' numbers are the same, with the lip-synching on the sloppy side, but with plenty of soul power. The performances are delightfully juiced by the new audio. Landis says these artists never perform songs the same way, making dubbing a nightmare.<br /><br />Most of the brand-new extras on the 25th year set aren't much. There's a lousy concert clip of Jim Belushi fronting the band in 2005. Get a load of Dan Aykroyd's 23-second intro to the movie, in which he says exactly nothing.

If you were driving at night and were lost , this would not be the music to have playing .  <br /> <br />Beacuse a lot of the music is instrumental , the listener can conjure up mental images .  <br /> <br />It is intense and I recommend you hear it first before buying .
B0002RQ2T4|4.0|This film is one of the few anime films I'd *remotely* consider showing to somebody who is unfamiliar with or uninterested in \\"Japanimation\\" (cringe).  It is not a perfect film, but it has alot of very appealing elements. <br /> <br />Visually, it is brilliant, as everyone has noted, combining CGI with cell animation and some other stuff I forget.  It really is a great-looking animated film.  Anime purists may bash the dubbing, but it in fact quite good; it certainly isn't the unintentional bad comedy that many dubs are (e.g., Godzilla).  For normal humans, the dub does not detract from the film at all, and would simply be considered good voice acting.  The film has slam-bang action, an interesting premise, a convoluted plot, and an excellent soundtrack (though the Japanese song vocals *can* be grating to my American ears).  If nothing else, that means that it trumps 90% of the live-action action movies you've ever seen. <br /> <br />The film does have its weaknesses.  The plot is hard to follow, not so much because it is complicated per se, but because it throws alot of things at you at once right from the get-go.  And it certainly has what seems like gratuitous nudity (or *apparent* nudity: in most cases, she's actually wearing a skin-colored body suit, e.g. her \\"thermoptic camoflage\\" scenes.).  Sometimes the philosophical rambling seems to go nowhere, though in fairness it never gets as dumb or boring as the philosophical rambling in the \\"Matrix\\" movies. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent movie.  The Special Edition gets you a new digital transfer, more and better audio tracks, but not alot else worth noting compared to the old version (which still had good English 5.1 sound and a good picture).

0385510454|2.0|Although this book has made me want to go to Italy in the worst way--where else can you linger all day with an espresso, watch people & experience thousands of years old history?, I would highly recommend something else to read on the plane ride over there. <br /> <br />In fact I found myself at times saying, \\"When is this book going to end, and by the way, who are half these people that are chasing Marco?\\" <br /> <br />There are way too many sub-characters, and not enough intrigue.  If you want a really good Grisham, pick up The Street Lawyer.

B000AADYYO|5.0|What can I say. Its just another glowing review of the epic masterpiece known as Ghost Reveries by a band that just do not posses the ability to disappoint. <br /> <br />There is no need to sell why you should buy this record. This is Opeth at their finest. This is music that transcends music and becomes art. Beautiful, haunting, dark, uplifting, spellbinding, brutal, epic. These are all things that define Opeth, and these are all things found on Ghost Reveries. Opeth is ear candy for those listeners that demand MORE from their music. It challenges the senses and above all it makes you FEEL, just as any good music should. <br /> <br />As a long time hardcore enthusiast of extreme music, I'm overjoyed  that there still are bands that can move me. It doesn't get any better than Opeth. <br /> <br />Album of the year no question. Support true artists and those that think outside of conventional means. Buy this record and join the collective.

B00004VVNB|5.0|I've been a fan of this movie since it came out in the 70's.  Logan's Run is my favorite SciFi movie and having a chance to own it on DVD is a treat - the movie is still great and the DVD quality is very good.  If you are a fan of this genre, I recommend this DVD.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|When I found out about the new SATC boxed set I was insanely excited AND furious!! I mean, It took me a while to save for the first six seasons... INDIVIDUALLY! I JUST bought part two of season six!!! I hated the \\"extra\\" content on the old dvds. Hopefully the new ones will have cool deleted scenes or a gag reel or something!!! I rate this item  a cool 4 stars as I anticipate more advanced dvd content and for it's chic design. I am a HUGE fan so of course I'll end up buying it but I sure hope it's worth the 200 bucks!

This isn't the end for 50, his cd/dvd just came out on the 6th, it's  amazing i saw all the videos alot of them are to his coming up video game 'bulletproof' which looks amazing because while playing bulletproof you can also listen to any one of 50's songs. Buy This cd. G-UNIT!!!

B000A7S4B0|5.0|BRMC has been one of the most exciting bands in LA for years. They were part of the new rock revolution that conquered the UK four or five years ago, along with The Strokes and The White Stripes. A lot of that spirit has died and faded. Many of those bands have done unadventurous records or have just done the same thing for years. People have just moved on and have heard move sophisticated music. BRMC has also been stuck in the mode of Jesus and Mary Chain admirers. BRMC has also in the past year broken up and changed labels. They took a lesson from history. Do they want to be a band that sticks around for the long haul, or do they just want to do another tribute record? This record does have a divisiveness of Led Zeppelin III or The Clash \\"London Calling.\\" Many of the teenage fans may be gone, but a lot of old blues purists may be jumping on board for this one. Many of us who had seen BRMC in the summer of 2004, heard some of these new tracks. This album was called the \\"Americana LP\\" for a while. \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\" is one of the older tracks. It is an acoustic thumper for people who want to slap their knee. It is followed by the darker \\"Howl.\\" This record goes back to Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash for inspiration, as can be heard on \\"Devil's Waitin'.\\" The song that works the best is probably \\"Ain't No Easy Way.\\" This is a total revolution in their sound. You couldn't think that BRMC were capable of such music. A few quieter acoustic numbers follow. The drumming of Nick Jago is absent from these tracks. This leads to the expansive sounding \\"Promise\\" which has a big piano sound (gasp), and sound distinctly like The Band. Did they alienate all their old fans yet? There is a cool sounding song \\"Weight of The World\\" which is more like their previous stuff. Of course two religious inspired tunes \\"Restless Sinner\\" and \\"Gospel Song\\" follow this. All this is more in tune with Jason Pierce and Spiritualized, rather than the gospel according to Elvis. Another familiar tune by Peter Hayes \\"Complicated Situation\\" comes this way and dazzles. The singing of Peter Hayes and Robert Been sounds more defined on this record. It ends with a double song. This album is generous and daring. Another career changing album that evoked The Band and Neil Young and company that I am reminded of is Mercury Rev Deserters' Songs. That was an epic album for that band. You can barely remember what they did before it. This album Howl may be that sort of album.ter Hayes \\"Complicated Situation\\" comes this way and dazzles.

B00006JMXH|5.0|This Japanese version of Nirvana's 2002 self-titled \\"best of\\" compilation contains two songs not included on the American release: the MTV Unplugged versions of \\"Something in the Way\\" and \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\\" Whether you're willing to spend an extra $20 to obtain two songs you probably already have, albeit remastered, is up to you. I will say this, though: having \\"Where Did You Sleep\\" at the end of this disc makes it seem far more \\"complete.\\" It's funny how much difference one song (or two) can make.  <br /> <br />In case you're wondering, this version contains the same ENGLISH liner notes etc. as the American release. The only difference is that it comes with a bonus lyric sheet, in both English AND Japanese, containing the words (sometimes inaccurate) to all 16 songs.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I Robot is a solid all out intense unrealistic action/sci fi movie from Alex Proyas. For those of you who don't know him as a director, I'm not sure how to classify him. I saw Dark City first which was brilliant and then saw The Crow and couldn't believe that it had come from the same director. (That means that it's bad) Well, now this, and here Mr. Proyas has decided to make an all out insane action movie which is actually fun and worth owning to rewatch the cool action scenes. On top of it, the robots are really cool looking. <br />Anyway, this is about detective Del Spooner played by Will Smith in the near future. In this era, robots are everywhere, used to facilitate everyday life. But Spooner is fishy about them. And when a new shipment of them comes out, he is nervous. But robots can't be bad as that would be breaking their 3 laws. But obviously they're evil and Spponer goes to kick their buts. <br />This movie sadly could have been a fantstic Blade Runnerish movie if it would have been R, and also a suspense movie and not the everyday shootout PG-13 movies. Also, it would have needed a different serious actor. Anyway, it could have been a lot better if they would have made it serious, but t works fine as it is, an explosive blockbuster like every summer movie! But, hey, it works!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Here's a version of Tunnel of Love, The studio version which <br />is slightly the best is got a great sound quality. Then there's <br />other songs that are hits. Romeo And Juliet, Skateaway, Expresso <br />Love, & Solid Rock. These are all great songs this album has <br />created. And I own 4 copies of this album. You will read my reviews and say that I am one heck of a Dire Straits fan. <br /> <br />
076790592X|5.0|I feel sorry for you cold and disconnected individuals.  If this book did not touch your soul, or move you to tears, I would be concerned about your ability (or inability rather) to empathize.  This was one of the most sincere, honest, and poignant books I've ever read.  It was well written - short and sweet.  Morrie never claims to be philospher!  He is simply a wise, gentle, and enlightened man who shares what he learned throughout his lifes journey.  We should all be so lucky to know a Morrie in our life, and I thank Mitch for writing such a touching and compassionate book.  This book is a MUST read.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The O.C. allows a sane average girl like myself to venture out into the rich, overly dramatic, \\"fabulous\\" California life. The characters are so real and the relationships are easy for me to relate to. Yes, the O.C. plot is not 100% realistic but honestly what T.V. show's plot is?

0739310097|5.0|I am completely in love with this book!!! Everytime I opened it up to read another chapter I couldn't help but laugh out loud. The sense of humor is cute and sophisticated. Every scene in the book you could picture in your head which made it all the more amusing. It's fun and whitty, Once you have the book in your hands and you start reading it, you will not be able to put it down! Every moment in this book is so real ...or at least Sophie Kinsella(author) makes it seem like it could be real. Emma Corrigan is an unforgettable hilarious character which I feel you become attatched to, like a good friend. Can You Keep A Secret is a comforting make you feel good about your own life kind of book...Poor Emma goes thorugh some life changes that she struggles throguh brilliantly!<BR>I am so happy I got the chance to read this book, and I am looking forward to start reading Confessions Of A Shopoholic!

0316172324|3.0|I really liked this book.  Much of it is plain old common sense.  Trust your intuition.  Your first instinct is often correct.  But there are times that we can't trust our initial impressions because of inherent biases and Gladwell discusses these instances.  Sometimes it's hard to get past the barrier of physical looks, race, age, etc. for us to make a sound decision.<br /><br />I do take issue with the idea that speed dating is just as effective as any other kind of dating.  If that's the case, we certainly are falling in love based on some very superficial reactions!  Speed dating seems crazy to me unless we want to find out whether or not we have an attraction or chemistry with another person.  But how could we have any idea of what a person is really like or how we will click with them after talking to them for four minutes in a stressful situation?<br /><br />The book was interesting, illuminating and well-written; however, it was redundant.  Gladwell continued to make the same point throughout the book and to hammer it home with various examples.  Also, at the end, I was confused about whether or not I really could trust my intuition because of all of the different variables that come into play in certain situations.  So, in many ways, I felt as though I was back to square one when I had finished reading it!<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br />Author of D'Amour Road<br />[...]
0515123447|5.0|While the premise of the story does hinge on some unlikely coincidences, this in no way detracts from the riveting action in this gripping book.  I enjoyed it from page one until the very end.  Not for those who cannot handle graphic violence.
B00005GL0M|5.0|The promotional launching of this historic quartet had without doubt, a solid support. In despite of the fact the previous promotion devices to internationalize Elvis Presley throughout films without major importance but that worked out as the initial concept of Video clip in 35 mms, found in the case of Beatles a true cult movie as effectively occurred  in this case. It is important to refresh the social feature at that age. Andy Warhol was a fundamental personage in this sense. The pop art opened a niche in the market. And the possibility to watch for the first time to far audiences who had no chance to assist to their Concerts, increased their status all over the world.<br /><br />With this song - A hard day' s night -, The Beatles reassumed the role of the ancient jugglers, substituting the lire by the electric guitar, and horses by airplanes. Once more the myth installed in the collective unconscious. They expressed the quotidian penuries of the media class and the aspirations of a new generation who definitively was tired to listen about the War; as natural response or compensation mechanism in the social body.<br /><br />It's extremely interesting to remark the fact that, from the ashes of the most wounded and bombed country in Europe as England was, the social embryo was creating the nest of the most creative rock. Somehow the social environment in the Fifties jumped ahead respect to American society. In the other hand, while the rock figures in USA were composed by individuals (Little Richard, Jerry Lee and Presley) , in England on the contrary were formed by bands, and that defined a different approach and meaning about the rock in both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />This album was the definitive consolidation and undeniable evidence the Liverpool Quartet was not a simple rock band, but a true pioneer as motivational resistance factor and protest. Jack Keruac and Allan Ginsberg among others responsible of the Beatnik underground movement were relegated to literary encounters; now the sun, bikinis and the movies displayed its enormous influence around the world.<br /><br />In this sense, this album was the real keystone. So when you buy it you will be acquiring also an important element of live history.<br /><br />On the other hand the scene was prepared to receive to the Rolling Stones, the other side of the coin, but certainly this is another subject to deal in other review, my appreciated reader.legated to literary encounters; now the sun, bikinis and the movies displayed its enormous influence around the world. <br /> <br />In this sense, this album was the real keystone.

The British accent and voice inflections made it even funnier.<br /><br />Hornby is immensely talented and I couldn't help but viewing Hugh Grant as Rob, the thirtysomething, antiestablishment, rock snob who is trying to make sense of his disastrous love life.  We laugh with Rob, we cry for Rob, we root for Rob.<br /><br />The book has a message, even if it is a bit clich&eacute;, and it was a wonderful read.  I highly recommend it.

Listen to it all the way through without skipping songs to get the full effect.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|This will be brief.  I am a fan of all film types, although I tend to avoid mainstream films.  Ok.  Hmmmm. I have been rewatching this film over and over and I can't put my finger on why.  I do understand some finding it boring.  I won't claim that it is a masterpiece.  I can respect some finding it repulsive...yet there is something within all these aspects that I find fresh, haunting and beautiful.  I don't feel that Gallo had in mind a narrative story, obviously...more a feeling.  We can all relate to loss and pain...when I watch this I find myself thinking of the crap in my life and the regrets.  It evokes emotion.  I was surprised myself , a fan of Buffalo '66 , but by no means a Gallo diehard fan.  As for the final scenes,  I agree with the main review \\"totally useless, but effective in putting this out of the mainstream\\" which is refreshing.  I must still have that teen angst side in me...not as harsh as years ago but nice to visit once in a while.  Thanks Gallo for the trip into the past.  I thoroughly enjoy this film!

B000002X1O|5.0|This album is typically grace slick and paul kanter with shades of \\"hijack the starship\\".  Howevever, White Boy tells the timeless story that involves the haunting mythologies associated with the Avatars that allegedly taught mankind, cross culturally and over the eons, the \\"ways\\" of civilized livieng that were often corrupted by greed and self-serving ideologies. White Boy speaks to all of us in a haunting and mysterious way and reminds us that we are visitors on this little blue planet and our fate and future is still being determined!  Grace Slick's semi-vocal echoes are memorable and gives the song an extra special quality that is timeless and priceless.  However, this is probably not for everyone!  If you connect, you will be richly rewarded by this disc.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is the best of the toon/live action movies.  I still crack up when I see this movie.  It's hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old!

B000002H6C|5.0|For as long and hard as Metallica worked to get to where they are today, it's been very sad to see them become part of the music industry equivalent of \\"the system\\" - putting out albums that go further down in quality each time, catering to the bandwagon jumpers (posers), and actually suing fans for sharing their music online (yet have nothing to say about music company execs who charge the public $20, on average, for one CD  where a person *may* like two or three songs, max).<br /><br />...And Justice For All was Metallica's last great stand.  There are classic jams with this CD, my fave which is \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" (everybody automatically picks \\"One,\\" might as well be different).  This is Metallica doing what they did best: At the top of their game, just being them and jamming.<br /><br />In the 80's, they were legendary because of their refusal to do videos.  It was big news when they released their first video for the single \\"One\\" (with scenes from the Dalton Trumbo film, \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" {adapted from Dalton's book of the same name}).  The band steadily went downhill quality-wise and disappointed their true fans - the folks who were there for them from their club days and early albums.<br /><br />No, nothing can remain the same but the band apparently seems to forget where they came from.<br /><br />I still have great respect for Metallica because of how hard they worked but they have disappointed me with them suing their fans - the people who allow them to live the way they do today.<br /><br />PS Best Metallica album?  Master of Puppets.  Hands down.

B00005JODA|5.0|You know, it funny to read some of these reviews from people who don't like this film for reasons being either that it's too political to the very stupid reason that only film students will like it. The reason a lot of people like this film and are showering it with praise is the fact that it's the first film of the year that treats it's audience like adults and its story is pacifically written for thinking people who will appreciate it's intelligence other than to be treated like an idiot. Rachel Weisz gives a groundbreaking performance that is in my mind the best performance of the year with a character that is probably the most complex character in modern cinema. Her performance is a veil of secrecy, bravado, strong will and humanity. Her character would have been one note in any other actress's hands but Weisz gives a real human touch to the character that is refreshing and real and it drives the story in this disturbing journey. Ralph Fiennes further establishes himself as the most underrate actor of his generation with a quiet and somber performance that packs a lot of emotional punch. He journey of truth and self discovery is heartbreaking and liberating and it will give you such an emotional jolt. Fernando Meirelles does a great job in not only furthering the emotional landscape of the characters but giving the landscape of Kannia a real chance to shine as well. Making it just as much a character as the rest.  <br /> <br />Hey, if you want to have a great time with a movie that will make you feel and think about what you just saw, be my guess. If you have personal hang ups over your stupid politics or the fact that you would rather be treated like an idiot for two strait hours, do us all a favor and skip this movie. It's probably will go over your head. For the rest of us who are tired of being rip off by bad movies, this is the film that will put your faith back into movie making.  <br /> <br /> <br />

6305364648|5.0|I saw this movie a while back and I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  We can all identify with the characters of the wife and husband for what they \\"seem to be\\" and the marrital delemas they find themselves experiencing.  Key words here are \\"Seem To Be\\".  In actuality the husband is NOT the boring Lugg his wife thinks he is NOR is the wife just a simple Little Woman.  Both bring Surprises, Action, Laughs and make us not only wish but Belief (at least for the duration of the movie) that We Too could be Adventurious, Mysterious, Beautiful and FUN!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Michael is so truly amazing! He is the greatest entertainer of all time! This concert is great, I've seen it so many times & I never get tired of it. My favorite parts are \\"Wanna me startin somethin\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"She's out of my life\\" & \\"Beat it\\". I really envy that girl who was brought up on stage with him. How lucky! It never fails to amaze me how energetic he is on stage. It's no wonder he's so thin! This DVD is a must for all of his fans.
6305280762|4.0|There are a lot of things to like about the Towering Inferno.  Although some effects (especially long-shots of the tower on fire) are dated, most of the action is realistic because it involved real sets with real fires - none of the computer-animated crap that passes for action these days.  The authenticity this gives to the film helps emmensely - it turns out to be the best of the old-time, big-star disaster movies (better than Posiedan Adventure, Airport) and is also superior to the Michael Crichton-penned modern disaster films like Jurassic Park and Twister. <br /> <br />It's true that there is little character development.  But really - how much character development is there likely to be when all the action takes place over one night, and most of that time the people are either fearing for their lives or trying to rescue those trapped on the top floor.  The two main characters, Steve McQueen's fire chief and Paul Newman's architect come perilously close to assuming the attributes of superheroes, but other than that, there's nothing to complain about the characters.  In light of the cookie-cutter modern disaster films there are two points that stand out: (1) there is no stock bad-guy character obstructing and otherwise artificially delaying the evacuation attempt because he's worried about bad publicity/how much it will cost/how bad it will look politically/etc.  (b) There are 11 or so main stars, all played by readily recognisable actors.  One of those 11 dies less than half-way through, and several others die before the end, and some of the deaths are surprising for their suddeness.  This makes the action all the more tense because you're not sure who the filmakers might decide is next to go! <br /> <br />I first saw this film on VHS sometime in the early 90's, and enjoyed it emmensely.  When this DVD came out, I decided to purchase it because of the low price (there are no extras on the disc, so the price is appropriate).  The video is very nice (can't comment on the sound because my sound system is quite primitive, but it does seem clear of background noise that plagues many '70's films).  However, a modern viewer will likely find some sequences very hard to watch in light of the Sept.11 attacks on the World Trade Centre towers.  There are some eerie similarities - people jumping from the tower to flee the flames, the firefighters knowing they are being put into untenable situations but doing it anyways, etc. <br /> <br />Although the action scenes themselves are pretty standard, although there is little character development, although there is nothing special on this DVD, I still recommend the film.  It is well-played, tense, and of good picture quality (much better than the old VHS version).  Those that are still sensitive to reminders of Sept. 11 might want to steer clear, however.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith has all the elements of a summer blockbuster.  Pitt and Jolie are beautiful people with great chemistry and there is a lot of action.  Unfortunately, there is no plot or no common sense to this movie.  I didn't know how to take it.  Is it supposed to be a realistic spy story?  Is it a cartoonish shootout?  I just don't know.  How can a couple that love each other try and kill each other then make love in the next scene?  Hard to care about the characters when the act in 2 total opposite directions.  How can I take the plot seriously when Pitt and Jolie single handedly kill 100 armed killers by themselves?  There is no bad guy, there is no plot.  Just a lot of violence and confusion.
B00008DDXC|4.0|While I'm (im)patiently waiting for Goblet Of Fire to come out in November, I'm having fun watching the movies. I got the fright of my life when I started watching & Daniel & Rupert's voices had broken! They sound so strange! It's like when I left school, I remember a lot of the guys still hadn't hit puberty. But now they sound so deep & grown up! But I still remember some guys' voices breaking at school, so I asked my boyfriend the other night. They also seem to have shot up a couple of inches, and poor Emma, is still toddling along after them!<br /><br />Chamber Of Secrets really was an excellent movie, on a par with the first, even though I hated the first book, and loved the rest after that. But I have to say I hated a couple of the characters in this, particularly Professor Lockhart played by Kenneth Branagh (not Richard, why did I say Richard?) and Dobby. They were pointless characters in the books, and pointless characters in the film. Dobby annoyed the hell out of me, what was the point? One of the worst characters that JK has written so far.<br /><br />We get to see a lot more of Draco Malfoy & his dad in this too - how freaky is that white-blonde hair with the dark eyebrows? Both are getting meaner, and I swear it's only going to get worse as the movies/books go on. There's potential for the dad to get a lot worse.<br /><br />How sweet are all the Weasleys? With Julie Walters playing the mum & the stuttering guy from Shakespeare In Love playing the dad, and lookalike Rons, it's a terrific family! Thankfully we get to see a lot more of Dad Weasley in the later books, so hopefully he'll appear more in the films.<br /><br />There's a little bit of the love story between Ron & Hermione incorporated into this film, even though JK has admitted in the extras to not featuring it until the fourth book. It's a shame Hermione disappears for most of the film, from about halfway through; she's not there anymore. Aw, what a shame. You know, the thing about Hermione, is she's nothing like how she's described in the books. Her hair is so calm, and not bushy as described.<br /><br />And how weird was the flying Ford Anglia scene? There was something not quite right about that scene.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the lack of screen time some of the teachers get. I had a small moan about the lack of screen time given to classes in my last review, and it's the same again. But what you have to remember, is that this film is what, over 2 hours long? Things have to be cut, and judging by the amount of deleted scenes also, it seems Chris Colombus found it quite difficult to cut scenes.<br /><br />The extras on this were slightly better than the previous one; we actually get interviews with the entire cast, rather than the crew like in the previous one. Unfortunately, nearly all of them are interviewed on the set (I always find it more interesting to see them interviewed out of character), only Alan Rickman isn't filmed on set. (He's definitely got a lot of makeup on, either that or it's the hair!) I still haven't managed to get through half the games, but at least they're less annoying than the previous game.<br /><br />This has to be a film to be seen, but not if you're scared of spiders. Who else had flashbacks to Eight Legged Freaks or the Arachnophobia film? (I haven't seen the latter, and don't plan to either - the former was bad enough.) Hopefully in the later films, the director will choose to cut Dobby. Seriously, NOT a good character.scribed in the books. Her hair is so calm, and not bushy as described.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The Bourne Supremacy is a good movie, but not as good as the Bourne Identity because the action scenes are so choppy and disjointed that any possible suspense is killed. <br /> <br />Still, Matt Damon is a great actor and all of the other stars in the movie do a great job.  The plot gets lazy in the revelation of the traitor at the CIA (Bourne just knows and we don't know why), and the climax is kind of a let down. <br /> <br />Still fun to watch, but not groundbreaking (as a retro-thriller) like the Bourne Identity.

B00003CXIP|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and has been since I was a little girl. I bought this DVD so I could have both the DVD and VHS and I still watch it often. This movie is amazing, timeless, and never gets old. Many can relate to the relationships between the four 12 year old main characters of the film. In addition, I have an obsession with River Phoenix (Chris Chambers) so that never hurts.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I love parachutes and the previous EP brothers and sisters. i thought Rush of blood to the head was a bit to hard for what they were going for but still good for some listening. also, i love war and under a blood red sky by U2. i found a copy of achtung baby also by U2 around the same time that i got a copy of X&Y. the similarity in the fall was striking. they both went completely against why they were good. i mean,the insturmentals in this album are really dull and the lyrics arent catchy or intersting. really it all goes downhill from square one (pun intended) the best song on the album, which is sad because it is a definite 3 out of 5.similarly U2 went all...flaky. like parachutes but bad. well, i allready have 2 albums and an EP to be happy with. stick with those. Or make your own band. best of all go read a book. or write a book. the point is i wouldn't advise buying the album.
0786856297|5.0|I work in the junior room of a public library and we are always in dire need of a good book to recommend to kids who have loved all of the Harry Potter books. The Lighning Thief, thank goodness, is such a book. Full of magical adventure, nicely paced, written with intelligence and wit, with a winning mix of the fantastic and the realistic (the first person voice of the protagonist, a kid, is utterly believable, which helps the reader suspend disbelief with respect to some of the more incredible aspects of the plot). And if this weren't enough, this book is even educational -- readers will learn a lot about Greek Mythology. I'm hoping for many more books in this promising series.
0060922583|1.0|I was profoundly disappointed by the book.  I was expecting something that took an analytical view of an intriguing theory and explored its implications.  Instead, what Talbot provided was a general overview of holography, some broad statements about its implications, and then tons of anecdotes about psychic phenomena that he claims are \\"explained\\" by everything being a hologram.  Sadly, that's not science, nor is it compelling writing.  Even had I been expecting a book of paranormal anecdotes, I would have been disappointed, because everything is so poorly organized.  Oddly enough, the book looks like it would be much more coherent, with frequent endnotes citing sources.  As a reading experience, what I get out of it more than anything is that Talbot is extremely excited and enthusiastic about his ideas.  That's great, but it doesn't make for a good book by itself.    Talbot also indulges in one of my personal pet peeves, which is citing someone's unrelated history when using them to support his ideas.  He describes someone who was head of some institute that investigates paranormal incidents as a former NASA employee, even though nothing that was being talked about had any relevance to the person working for NASA.  Talbot should know that emphasizing a detail like that could be interpreted as him attempting to lead the reader to give his source greater credibility than is really warranted.      I'd love to read a more objective and organized look at the same ideas.  As it is, the book has more ambition and enthusiasm than substance.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|After all the popularity that Stargate: SG-1 received in its first six years on the air, it was only natural that the creators would want to expand the story with a spin-off series.  As SG-1's seventh season was going on, Stargate: Atlantis was being developed.  Using a plot twist that was introduced at the end of SG-1's seventh season, Atlantis got its start. <br />After searching throughout the Milky Way galaxy for the fabled Lost City of the Ancients (the ancients are a very advanced race of beings that died out long ago), Stargate Command realized that it is on Earth... or at least it was.  The city, which comes to be known as Atlantis, was built on Earth millions of years ago.  The ancients, who as I said are extremely advanced, ot only made it a city, but also made it a spaceship capable of intergalactic travel.  When a great plague hit Earth, some of the ancients evacuated in Atlantis to the Pegasus galaxy, where they plan to start a civilization similar to the one that they had in the Milky Way. <br />Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) of SG-1 eventually finds the correct gate address to Atlantis and an international team of explorers is put together in order to go to and study Atlantis.  The expedition will be led by Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), a civilian who was very briefly in charge of the SGC.  The Chief Science Officer is Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett), a civilian who has helped out the SGC in the past, the head surgeon is Dr. Carson Beckett (Paul McGillion), a Scottish MD and biologist, and the head of military operations is hardened Col. Summner (Robert Patrick). <br />In order to work most ancient technology efficiently, a rare gene is required, and while Dr. Beckett has it, it isn't pronounced enough to matter.  In comes Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), a hotshot air force officer with insubordination issues.  Even though he could be a liability to the expedition, he not only has the gene, but can operate the ancient technology almost flawlessly, so he comes along as well.  The last major character is Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Franks), a young officer who looks up to Sheppard (and tragically was born without a personality). <br />Upon arrival in Atlantis, the team realizes that the power is nearly gone, and in order to survive, the city must use the electricity that was powering the defenisve shield to power life support systems.  This also means that they cannot use the gate to go back to Earth, since an intergalactic wormhole requires much more power than normal. <br />Soon, the team begins exploring the city (which is immense) as well as the planets in the galaxy.  On the first planet they visit, they meet Teyla (Rachel Luttrel), a young warrior woman who protects her tribe from something called the Wraith.  When Teyla learns that the visitors don't know who the Wraith are, she begs them to return to where they came from.  Soon, the Wraith show up and a lot of bad things ensue.  The Wraith are a race of beings that actually gave the ancients a good fight!  They are humanoid in build, but they are stronger, faster, and more resistant to harm than any human could hope to be.  Also, humans are their food; they literally suck the life out of people.  Fortunately for the people of the Pegasus galaxy, they only come around every half century or so (most of them hibernate for long periods of time).  Unfortunately, in an act of heroism, Sheppard accidentally causes the entire Wraith population to wake up and begin to feed all at once. <br />That is the pilot episode.  After that, the series becomes somewhat similar to SG-1, where Sheppard and his team go to different planets to make alliances, trade for food, and help people escape the Wraith (I will say that for such a powerful race, Sheppard and co. don't have too much trouble fighting them off).   <br />A few story arcs develop this year.  One of them has the Atlantis expedition team get into a bitter rivalry with another advanced race of humans, which leads to an attempted coup on Atlantis.  Also, Beckett begins to study the Wraith and finds out how they came to appear human and how they were able to amass such great numbers. <br />I want to say that even though I'm giving this a 4 star rating, it is definitely a low 4.  The stand-alone episodes were usually moderate; some were good, some were just terrible, but on average, they were just ok.  The story-arc episodes were pretty good, and they showed that Atlantis has a lot of potential as a show.  While there will be a lot to work on, such as writing, character development, and stand-alone quality, after watching the first part of Season 2, I must say that I am very much enjoying where the series is going.  If for no other reason, this set should be watched in order to know what's going on in the later seasons, which so far, appear to be leagues ahead of this one.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|before listening to this album, i must admit that i had very low expectations.  i was not an avenged fan. the first time i heard it, the only thing i could think was \\"its about time, someone finally put out a metal album.\\"   <br /> <br />it seems that most people are put off by the vocals, as they are quite \\"power-metal\\" sounding.  i, too, am not a big fan of this style of vocals, however avenged makes it work.   <br /> <br />this album reminds me a lot of iron maiden with a bit of pantera thrown in the mix.  many shredding solos, powerful driving riffs, and some excellent singing.  it all comes together in a very melodic and (gulp) good way.  if youre closed minded about music (espically if you think there is a certian way metal \\"should\\" sound) and wont give anything without growls and constant double kick a chance, this cd probably isnt for you.  if, however you are in to melodic music that harkens back to metal's greats (past and present) you should give this cd a try <br /> <br />also, to clear something up:  the lead singer did have throat surgery, however, that is not the reason the vocals have changed; this was a conscious decision by the band.

B00005JNX0|3.0|As a big fan of special effects and animation in general, I must say that we're hitting a \\"dry Patch\\".  We went through this in the middle 90's when everyone was making feature length 2d animated features.  The thinking of the day was; \\"Disney's making bushels of cash with them, so should we!\\"  Not bad thinking, but un-original.  We simpley O.D.ed on Disney-style animation.  A great art form, but too much.<br /><br />Of course, there was this little thing called \\"Toy Story\\" that came along and really changed everything.  And we got many great CG animated films such as all the Pixar films, Shrek, Ice Age (shrek Jr.), Antz and even Jimmy Neutron.  Unfortunately, now all the participating studios have forgotten past lessons.  But there is a difference this time.  This time, corporate greed has exceeded it's quota.  These CG films are so filled with trendy music, product placements, and so-so actors that they are losing the one element that makes great film;  STORY.  And though the films still make money, they nolonger feel \\"special\\".  Soon enough, they will nolonger make money either.<br /><br />Here's some things that make \\"Madagascar\\" no better than 3 stars in my mind:<br /><br />-All of the voice actors are very trending and(to me)extremely annoying.  Ironically, the no-name voices are the entertaining ones.<br /><br />-I consider The yellow bar on the DVD case that says \\"#1 family film of the year\\" as a warning that when translated reads; \\"Bare-bones DVD inside.  Forced promotional spots included\\".  (See Shrek2).<br /><br />-\\"The Incredibles\\" (the last really good CG film) has everything \\"Madagascar\\" does not; Great stroy, great characters, great imagery and not the least bit trendy.<br /><br />-Madagascar is so heavy with trendy, sales oriented gimicks that it will become dated very quickly.  Not as bad as \\"Shark tale\\" but trendy none-the-less.<br /><br />-Caracter development is thin.  Each character has their gimmicky \\"thing\\" but it does not help you like or care about them.<br /><br />-The penguin side story (voiced by animators)is actually more funny and entertaining than the \\"lead\\" characters' story line.  Their arival \\"home\\" is a classic \\"cartoon\\" moment.<br /><br />-Chris Rock, David Schwimmmer, Ben Stiller...  ... I can't think of three, more annoying actors.  Stiller, as a voice, is non-descript.<br /><br />-Kids do enjoy this movie, but they like \\"Shark Boy and Lava Girl\\" too.<br /><br />-Lemers epitomise this whole story; Self-serving, annoying, loud, obnoxiuos, gimmick-laden and cheeky.  The little song they sing is kind of ammusing though.<br /><br />-The style of the characters was actually pretty cool.  A very cartoony, exagurated look.<br /><br />-My wife and I left the theater basically unaffected.  Can you think of a worse thing to say about any film?<br /><br />-I Think I would have enjoyed the film much more if the animals never talked.  There were enough \\"cute\\" moments to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />After all this, I ask myself (you may have wondered too) \\"how on earth did I give it 3 start instead of 1?\\".  I guess it is because I really do enjoy animation on all levels.  A lot of artists put a lot of themselves into this production.  I guess I'm dissapointed in the overall feal of the film.

B0000DBJ2B|3.0|During a recent illness, I had a friend recommend two films to me. \\"Fierce Grace\\", featuring Ram Dass, and this one.  After watching \\"The Dark Crystal\\", which I hadn't seen in years, I realized that my friend was telling me that life has its dark side and its light side; it is only when the two are balanced and working together that we become who we truly are.  Thanks, Emery; I owe you one.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|Rented this video assuming it would be superior to the remake, and was frankly disappointed. It has a \\"cut and paste\\" feel: perhaps that was the filmmaker's intent; a sort of real-time, cameras-are-rolling sensation. There is no character development, and I didn't really care whether the crooks got away or not, truthfully.<br /><br />Michael Caine has the throw-away charm that he's known for; Noel Coward plays himself... It's harmless, good for a rainy afternoon as a substitute for cartoons. The frantic energy of The Chase seems to be the whole point of this one, whereas the 2003 edition paid more attention to the plotting/devising.

My mom got upset at us because we tried to skip meals so we wouldn't miss a second of it.  \\"What's so great about it?  All war movies are the same.\\"  Lo and behold, one week later, she, too, found herself glued to the TV as she watched the series from beginning to end. <br /> <br />The footage is clear and scenery is amazing.

0790731509|5.0|Paul Newman as the misfit serving time in a Southern prison camp. He keeps escaping and they keep dishing out the punishment after they catch him and drag him back. To his chagrin, the other prisoners look up to him as an idol; he sees himself as someone who just can't find his niche in life. A great star performance for Newman, who plays his part to the hilt. George Kennedy as his prison crony is also excellent (he won an Academy Award). There are some classic scenes in the movie: eating 50 eggs on a bet; Newman singing about \\"the plastic Jesus on the dashboard of his car\\"; and that great line, \\"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\\" Superb entertainment.

B000AADYYO|5.0|In short, \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is great, which comes as no surprise. However, it is also less consistently excellent than its predecessors, as well as less immediate in its impact. For that, I \\"blame\\" the band's decision to produce the record themselves. Though it sounds as gorgeous as always, it could have benefitted from some external directing force. Instead, a couple of songs have something of an unfinished feel to them; for example, \\"Under the mire\\" just fizzes out rather unceremoniously, marring an otherwise great song. <br /> <br />Having gotten that off my chest, it is time to look at the positives, and there are a lot of them. One is that the songs grow over time; another is that they are all superb. Mikael kerfeldt has never sounded better, and neither has the band; this is the sound of a dominant band flexing its muscles. I dare anyone to find a better opening track than \\"Ghost of perdition\\", which just explodes out of the speakers, leaving the listener slack-jawed and awed. The follower \\"The baying of the hounds\\" has the coolest riffs of the album, as well as great structure and crunch; it is the best track of the album and should be a live mainstay for years to come. \\"Under the mire\\" and \\"Atonement\\" are both less than perfect, but are still very good; the Middle Eastern vibe to \\"Atonement\\" jars a bit at first, but it grows over time. \\"Harlequin forest\\" is another highlight, with great energy and arrangements; the coupling of the hyperkinetic riffing with predominantly clean vocals makes for a cool change of pace. \\"Hours of wealth\\" is beautiful and atmospheric, while \\"The grand conjuration\\" is another showstopper, with its stop-go riffing and super-atmospheric arrangements. It is a future encore number. Finally, \\"Isolation years\\" is a melancholy little closer. <br /> <br />To sum it up, the four main tracks are absolutely fabulous, while the supporting material is a notch below. As such, it is about on par with the Opeth album it most resembles - \\"Still life\\", as well as \\"Deliverance\\". It is not quite as good as \\"Blackwater Park\\", but remains a superlative piece of work. Album of the year, hands down.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|There's something about the opening that really gets to me.  I feel that this isn't just a holiday film but it's an all-year-long-feel-good movie.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because I really think that the porn references were totally unnecessary and keep this from being a movie that you can share with the younger crowd in the household.  Too bad-it's an excellent film with a superb cast - great music too.  Buy the soundtrack while you're at it!
0783116934|5.0|This is a great drama.  Although it is about a serial killer it is handled with class, not cheapened with excessive blood and gore.  The characters are strong and elicit emotion.  I believe that if you liked Shawshank Redemtion you would like this movie.  I recommend it for a mature adult audience looking for a movie with sincerity.
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|\\"In Absentia\\" was an impossible act to follow, one of those once-in-a-lifetime events that an artist almost has to overcome in order to be allowed the freedom to move on. \\"Deadwing\\" is up to the task. It is a brilliant piece of work, a powerful and very compelling next chapter in Porcupine Tree's ascent to stardom. Keep listening, these guys are going places.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I can't wait for this gift edition. I have never bought SATC on dvd, I was also disappointed that season six was split into two parts. I felt that was unfair for HBO to do. I have noticed that studios these days rush to put their movies or tv episodes on dvd, and then six months to a year or so later they release a collector's edition or a gift edition or a criterion edition. I usually like to wait and I'm happy that I have. I will be buying this when it comes out, and it looks like it'll make a perfect gift for someone who doesn't have SATC yet. For those who feel that you were taken advantage of, why don't you just sell the SATC dvds that you have? You could sell it on Amazon.com or other sellers on the web, or to a used bookstore. Then buy the collector's giftset because that'll be one that's worth owning.
0743454537|5.0|This is the first Picoult book I have read and I will certainly be looking for more to read.  The story line keeps your interest, brings you to tears with it surprise ending.  It makes you question yourself about what you would do in this situation.  Great book.

B000777J2S|5.0|A gorgeous, powerful record. Can't really add a whole lot to the Amazon review, except two things. First, all this business about \\"deep wounds\\" and \\"troubled desires,\\" while true, obscures the album's best feature: it transcends the darkness, giving it the same redemptive, cathartic power of gospel music and past classics like Astral Weeks. Heck, it even ends triumphantly; you feel like you've come through the valley with Antony, and that everything's gonna be alright, more or less. Second, don't let all the talk about how pretty the album is mislead you--for the most part, this isn't some frilly chamber orchestra piece. Not that there's anything wrong with frilly; the record has several beautiful string arrangements, and much of it is kinda quiet. But it's also a step better than that; like Nina Simone's best stuff, its beauty is rawer, and there are many moments when it rocks, particularly the awesome \\"Fistful of Love,\\" which just keeps building and building with the help of Lou Reed and some fat, fat horns (and yes, the Nina voice comparisons are apt, though Antony tends to push his range a bit more, in a good way, and his music is completely different, more in the family of rock). Easily one of the best things I've heard in the past couple years!
0399226907|5.0|My son received this as a baby gift 19 years ago...and, we read it over and over and over...  Then, when he learned to read HE read it over and over and over...<br /><br />Now, I give this book for baby gifts.  It's colorful and \\"hands-on\\" with the holes in the pages.  Kids can learn days of the week, numbers, names of foods, and even a science lesson about how a caterpiller turns into a butterfly!  If you're 9 weeks or 90 years--you'll love this one!
B00005NP04|5.0|This CD is AWESOME! This is a MUST HAVE for any Martina McBride fan. NOBODY has a voice like hers!
1400032717|1.0|This book was so lame, but I couldnt stop reading, it was like a car wreck where you just cant look away. Afwul! I thought it was going to get better, but it doesn't! SAVE YOUR MONEY! It was basically a story about an autistic boy who screams when anyone touches him & cant stand crowds or yellow. That's basically it. His father is also a freak & his mother leaves, which I so cannot blame her!
B00009V7T2|5.0|It's not very often that I discover a band that convincingly blends so many genres I enjoy into a mindblowing cocktail. TMV explore everything from hardcore punk, funk and ambient jazz to fiery latin rythms. I started off with \\"Frances\\" and worked my way backward, comparing the two doesn't do either justice as they are two vastly different albums in terms of concept and sound. Although TMV,s lyrics are cryptic (as many reviews have pointed out), Cedric's vocal delivery will stir you emotionally and immerse you fully in the universe they have created in the narrative. The instrumentation is also so multi-layered that it may take you several listens to uncover its subtle genius. TMV took my taste in music to a whole new level.Try it! it may do the same for you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have read all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of the best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airbone, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to all of them. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt. Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander.

B00004VXF2|1.0|Visionary accomplishment! Masterpiece! Majestic symphony in four movements! Move over Mahler! Eat this Ligeti! <br />OK, let's cut the crap. MMM is indeed nothing more than some type of static or 'white noise' if you will, slightly resembling what we usually call 'music', but it's got this peculiar, recognizable atmosphere. Lou Reed has always been a man made out of one piece, who's at the real source of the pop & rock-awareness and his fingerprints are even traceable in this selfindulging sadistic sonic storm. I'll be glad to add MMM to my (nonexistent) cd-collection..if i can get it for free. Cheers!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I'm soooooo tired of hearing people hate on this beautiful woman. Her voice and music creativity is beyond measure. So many say her music sounds the same and too ordinary. That is just nonsensical. The Emancipation of Mimi is her most soulful R&B record to date. Every album she has released has been musically different from the other. She continues to reinvent her style and image, which seems to be the result of her continued success. Who wants to see a good artist do the exact same thing every album and every year. That gets too boring. With this new record she approaches her songs with calm, relaxed vocals. She realizes that every song doesn't have to display her 5 octave range to be successful or worth listening. I certainly don't want a big voice like hers shouting at me all the time. Soul is good but too much soul is ear rattling. Anyone judging her for anything other than her vocal and musical abilities needs to get a life. Most importantly, get to know your friends and family first and the artist SECOND.  <br />

B00005JODA|4.0|In a year full of bad movies that are made up of old TV shows, bad sequels, and really bad comedies, it's a real honor to have a film that does not pander to the lowest common denominator. Fernando Meirelles creates probably the best political thriller in the last ten years with Top notch performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes that make the viewer not only be captivate by their characters and their tender love story but be outrage by the horrors and the corruption that surround them both. The Constant Gardner is a potboiler of suspends, intrigue and gritty drama rolled into a political thriller that is terrifyingly real. Weisz gives the performance of the year with a character that has so many sides to her that you really don't know what to expect Intl the climax of the film and Ralph Fiennes is mesmerizing as a man driven by grief and lust and a desire to find out the truth about the woman he loved and the people he thought he knew. This is smart filmmaking and Fernando Meirelles does the story and its actors justice with a gritty and beautiful portrayal of the African landscape that exposes its beauty and horrors all at once.  <br /> <br />Its good to be treated with some respect and this film does it by treating you with a smart and captivating story that will stay with you for some time to come.  <br />
0440180295|5.0|I had seen the movie first and then HAD to buy the book. I figured it would be a difficult read (going by the story of the movie) but my curiousity set it. The book was awesome and a quick read! I love both versions equally and suggest them both.
B000069HK2|2.0|How do I start? What can I say? I guess to sum it all up, The Used has the potential to be a great band, but are flawed by what seems to be the heart of their music. I am, of course, referring to the godawful vocals by Bert McCracken. The lyrics are immature and childish. He is clearly trying to appeal to the entire cutting emo group. I took interest in this group when I heard the song \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" on my local radio station. The chorus was annoying, but something about the verses grabbed my interest and led me to buy the CD. Unfortuanately, that honestly was the only good part of the album.  <br /> <br />Maybe Memories - 7/10 <br />Interesting music, awful vocals. Ruins the song completely. <br /> <br />The Taste of Ink - 4/10 <br />The band's first single. Just awful lyrically, and even musically. I just can't stand it. <br /> <br />Bulimic - 5/10 <br />Simply annoying. The chorus which repeats \\"Good Bye to You\\" maybe one hundred times gets old after the first time Bert squeals it. <br /> <br />Say Days Ago - 6/10 <br />A simple excuse for Bert to scream about an unsatisfactory sexual relationship. Shut up already. <br /> <br />Poetic Tragedy - 6/10 <br />Bert's attempt at being classy. It's honestly an annoyingly pretentious song.  <br /> <br />Buried Myself Alive - 8/10 <br />I like this song. The verses are nice, the chorus is passable, and the screaming has depth. Unfortunately it ends here. <br /> <br />A Box Full of Sharp Objects - 4/10 <br />This song is a disgrace to music. Bert should be ashamed of himself as an individual for trying to cash in on these people's emotions. This say on big bright words \\"Cut yourself to become rich and famous!\\" <br /> <br />Blue and Yellow - 8/10 <br />Another enjoyable song. It's passable and interesting. It was very easy to cherry-pick this song's quality from the rest of the album's garbage. <br /> <br />Greener with the Scenary - 7/10 <br />Interesting verses, but a childish and laughable chorus. One of their better, but that's saying next to nothing. <br /> <br />Noise and Kisses - 5/10 <br />These lyrics show Bert's true character. A lame and boring song about giving up on a relationship because the girl won't succumb to his sick sexual wants. <br /> <br />On My Own - 6/10 <br />A softer song. It's an easy listen which is a good break from the heavy screamo that's been going for a while. It seems to be simple filler. <br /> <br />Pieces Mended - 5/10 <br />Filler at it's worst. This song has absolutely nothing interesting at all.  <br /> <br />There is a bonus track, as well as a recording hidden on the same track as \\"Pieces Mended\\" but long after. At 8:00 a recording of Bert's birthday comes on. This is sick. They have some overweight woman give Bert a lapdance. How immature, sick, and perverted can you be? <br /> <br />Choke Me - 4/10 <br />Complete screaming garbage. The lyrics are about how drugs pretty much stole Bert's life. I'm not surprised.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is an awful album with an even worse personality. Many people compare this group to My Chemical Romance. If I was in MCR, I would be embarassed at such a claim.  <br /> <br />RECCOMENDED INSTEAD:  <br />Say Hello to Sunshine by Finch <br />Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge by My Chemical Romance

0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs is a wildy funny movie. It's fast moving, but there's never a dull moment. As the movie should be, it is completely ridiculous. I'd recommend Spaceballs to anyone who likes comedies.<br /><br />Spaceballs is basically a spoof on \\"Star Wars\\". Of course, there are a few others included in the mix such as \\"Star Trek\\". I really love how they made fun of the characters from those movies. Although the characters are different, they're obviously similar to the ones they are making fun of. I think it's perfect for what the movie is trying to say.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES:<br /><br />I was somewhat impressed with the DVD. It doesn't have many features, but it has a few. The features are; an audio commentary by Mel Brooks, behind-the-scenes footage, and the trailer. In addition the DVD is double sided, giving you both wide and full screen formats.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I think Spaceballs is a spectacular movie. Anyone who hasn't seen it is really missing out.
0553282980|4.0|Although it makes me smile to say this now, when I was in middle school, I used to leave this movie in the VCR and watch it almost every morning as I was getting up for school. Something about its 1950's New England setting and cast that all came together to make it important to me. I loved its message of unconventionality and personal freedom of expression. I liked the new worlds the teacher, Mr. Keating, said poetry could open up to a reader. Time passed, I kind of got away from DPS (a film I sadly outgrew) and it wasn't until many years later as I was cruising the book section of a thrift store that I came upon the novel to this movie. Remembering the way this timelessly inspirational story used to make me happy, I bought the book and read it in one sitting. For anyone who was ever touched by Dead Poet's Society I recommend this book. To anyone else, skip it, there's not a lot here for you: no new characters, same sad ending, same time, same place. Dead Poet's Society the book reads exactly like a director's cut extended version of the Peter Weir movie, including in its length a handful of scenes the film never contained. It also has a few lines that were spicier than the dialogue in the motion picture and there's a stronger suggestion of exactly what Charlie 'Newanda' Dalton got up to with those college-age girls from town he brought to the Dead Poet's meeting that one night. I still have this little novel and I'm glad I bought it. I only wish I'd owned it back in the day when Dead Poet's Society was among my favorite movies.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I don't have a particular fondness for the \\"chick flick\\", despite be being female.  I've always preferred the belly bursting comedy (ex...Old School) or the charged up action/adventure (ex...Gladiator), but around Oscar time last year, I did hear the buzz about this film.  Feeling a bit bored one night I sorted through some loaner DVDs and decided to watch Whale Rider, just to see what the previous hype was all about.  I would say about 3 minutes into the film, the first watery nuisance made an appearance.  I began to blink as if my life depended on it, but I couldn't hold back that first slippery track of tear which, annoyingly, I flick away as it rolled down my cheek...the flood gates opened after that.  This movie has a very original concept which draws you in, I cried throughout the whole thing.  I went to work the next day singing its praises to anyone who would listen, truely suprising even myself as I rarely recommend movies to the masses.  This movie made me feel so good I bought it 2 days later.  So, if you're in the mood for a feel-good type of movie with one of the sweetest endings, then get Whale Rider.  If you're not in the feel-good mood, get it anyway.  A wonderful film to add to the collection...oh yeah, it's perfect for kids too.  Cheers.
B0009X7664|5.0|&#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; premiered in U.S. theaters on Christmas Day 1962. Those who were lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen that December 25th came out of the theater with another Yuletide gift of sorts -- they had just watched one of the finest motion pictures ever produced (IMHO).<br /><br />There probably aren't enough glowing adjectives in the dictionary to describe the loveliness of this film. A truly fabulous piece of American cinema -- all the way through -- with a tender and bittersweet ending that always leaves one of those &#34;trying to hold it back&#34; lumps in the ol' throat.<br /><br />The cast is ideal, with each actor seemingly molded for each of their individual roles. There's &#34;Scout&#34; (Mary Badham), &#34;Jem&#34; (Phillip Alford), &#34;Dill&#34; (John Megna), &#34;Boo Radley&#34; (Robert Duvall), and &#34;Tom Robinson&#34; (Brock Peters).<br /><br />And &#34;Atticus Finch&#34; (Gregory Peck), one of the truly most memorable characters ever brought to the screen. And it's hard to think of how Mr. Peck's Academy Award-winning portrayal of that southern lawyer and father could have possibly been any better than we see it here. Peck always seems to have that &#34;controlled&#34; quality in his movie performances that are always a pleasure to watch. And never more so than as the low-key &#34;Atticus&#34; in this film. I doubt that it's possible to watch this movie and NOT admire the strength of character and unwillingness to stoop to such levels of vulgarity after Atticus is spat upon by &#34;Bob Ewell&#34;. It's one of several scenes in the film that illustrates the type of man Atticus is, and the type of example he's setting for his young children. Some might be apt to call Atticus a coward in that scene. But they'd be wrong.<br /><br />This film offers up many highly-memorable moments indeed --- Atticus sitting in front of the jail reading by the light of his living-room stand lamp. .... The mystery of Jem's ripped pants. .... Boo Radley's spooky house. .... Atticus impressing his children when he shoots the rabid dog. .... That old hollowed-out tree that keeps filling itself up with all kinds of cool stuff. .... &#34;Stand up, your father's passing&#34;. .... Plus, that beautiful and stirring Elmer Bernstein music score. Utter magic.<br /><br />There's also a good deal of humor residing in this screenplay. I always get a good healthy laugh when viewing the scene which has dinner guest Walter Cunningham Jr. drenching his dinner in syrup, to the shock and dismay of Scout  --- &#34;What in Sam Hill are you doin'?! He's gone and drown-ded his dinner in syrup and now he's pourin' it all over!&#34;. :)<br /><br />And possibly the most memorable quote comes at the end of the film, when Atticus says to Scout: &#34;Miss Jean Louise -- Mister Arthur Radley&#34;. With these few words, Scout's fears of &#34;Boo&#34; vanish forever. The dignity with which Atticus &#34;introduces&#34; Arthur (&#34;Boo&#34;) to Scout is what makes this quote memorable for me.<br /><br />Universal Studios Home Video, on September 6, 2005, issued a beautiful-looking new Two-Disc DVD version of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;, which comes with a bountiful helping of bonus supplements, as well as the very first &#34;enhanced&#34; (Anamorphic) Widescreen transfer of the film on DVD.<br /><br />Packaged under its &#34;Legacy Series&#34; banner, this 2-Disc Set sparkles in virtually all respects, especially the video quality of this iconic black-and-white film. It looks very nearly perfect to my eyes. Very few distracting artifacts can be observed during the running of this 130-minute main feature (which is presented in its intended 1.85:1 Widescreen framing here). And the nighttime scenes are rendered in fine fashion, with next to no video annoyances visible at all. The film passes the &#34;Freeze Frame&#34; test as well -- i.e.: you can &#34;pause&#34;/&#34;still&#34; an image on screen in virtual perfect clarity, without the image blurring at all, which I usually take as a pretty good sign that what I'm seeing is a darn-good transfer of the material to DVD.<br /><br />There's a choice of five separate audio options for the feature film on Disc 1 -- with one of the five being a Commentary Track with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, which was recorded for the first DVD edition of &#34;TKAM&#34; in 1998. Tragically, Pakula was killed in a freak auto accident in November of 1998, not too long after he recorded the commentary track for the DVD. He was 70 years old.<br /><br />Other audio options for this two-disc edition include the original English Mono (in 2.0 Dolby Digital), a French 2.0 DD Mono track, and two newly-created multi-channel 5.1 Surround audio tracks (a Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a DTS 5.1). The DTS track isn't listed in the specs on the packaging, however. But it IS on here.<br /><br />Audio tracks cannot be changed &#34;on the fly&#34; (as the saying goes) while watching the movie (unfortunately). You must go to the &#34;Languages&#34; Sub-Menu to switch the audio. To switch to the Commentary Track, you must access the &#34;Bonus Features&#34; Menu on Disc 1. There's no &#34;Commentary&#34; option available from the &#34;Languages&#34; Menu (for some reason).<br /><br />Subtitle options: English, French, and Spanish. .... These subtitle choices are also ALL available when viewing any of the Bonus Features throughout this two-disc DVD set (including even the movie's trailer).<br /><br />A bonus item that was originally scheduled to be a part of this set, but was ultimately not included, is a replica of Gregory Peck's &#34;working script&#34; (with handwritten notes by Peck). That bonus was evidently replaced by the 11 &#34;Theatrical Poster Reproductions&#34; that are included here. These poster art copies are very nice, being re-printed on high-quality paperboard stock, which have a glossy look to them. Included are a few USA poster copies, plus several from foreign nations, like Argentina, Japan, Italy, Poland, among others. The artwork's country of origin is printed on the back of each of these reproduction prints. A well-done extra bonus, IMO. (Although I would have loved to have had Mr. Peck's working TKAM script too. But, oh well.)<br /><br />Also in the envelope with the 11 poster re-prints is a signed message from &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; author Harper Lee.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the DVD Bonus Features.............<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />....Gregory Peck's acceptance speech after he won the Oscar trophy as &#34;Best Actor 1962&#34; (the only Oscar statue he was ever to take home, amazingly enough). This vintage 1963 B&W video clip runs for 1:28.<br /><br />....Excerpt from the &#34;Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck&#34;, with Gregory's daughter Cecilia. This is a 10-minute bonus item.<br /><br />....&#34;American Film Institute Life Achievement Award&#34; presented to Gregory Peck. Run Time: 10 minutes.<br /><br />....&#34;Scout Remembers&#34;, which is a 1999 NBC-TV interview with &#34;Scout&#34; herself (Mary Badham). This bonus runs 12 minutes. .... Mary Badham, for those who may not know it, is the sister of John Badham, who directed such motion pictures as &#34;WarGames&#34; (in 1983) and the enormously-popular and successful John Travolta film &#34;Saturday Night Fever&#34; (in 1977).<br /><br />....The Original Theatrical Trailer for &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; (Length: 2:53). The trailer is in Full Frame (1.33:1) format. Excellent sound quality too. Video quality is lacking a bit, but it's not too bad.<br /><br />....Production Notes. (Text screens only.)<br /><br />The only thing missing here are the &#34;Cast And Filmmaker&#34; bio text pieces that were included on the '98 disc. Too bad, too, because those biography notes were quite good (and extensive), and covered several of the various TKAM players and execs.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />There are two first-rate documentaries on the second disc of this set. These two extra DVD programs amount to 3 hours and 7 minutes of added &#34;Mockingbird&#34; entertainment, pretty much the equivalent of two entire additional movies.<br /><br />The Disc-Two programs are:<br /><br />&#34;Fearful Symmetry: The Making Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'&#34; (90 minutes; B&W; Non-Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 24 Chapter Stops). .... This is the same feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary that was also included on the earlier DVD release of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;. Wonderful stuff here. Lots of interesting details about how this classic film got to the screen. Includes many on-camera comments by Gregory Peck. Produced in 1998.<br /><br />-- And: --<br /><br />&#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; (97 minutes; Color & B&W; Full Frame 1.33:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 18 Chapter Stops). .... This sensational movie-length documentary was produced by Gregory Peck's daughter (Cecilia) in 1999. It is a very nicely-constructed presentation, with a good music score too, which delves in great depth into the personal side of the great Gregory Peck, who proves here that he was still more than capable of holding an audience's undivided attention at age 83.<br /><br />This documentary could very easily have been called &#34;Gregory Peck's Life: In His Own Words&#34;. It's quite literally a biography on the personal life and movie career of Mr. Peck. It's certainly one of the best &#34;bio&#34; pieces I've ever seen on the life of any actor.<br /><br />This &#34;docu-bio&#34; contains video clips of many of Peck's films, plus old home movies, several talk-show clips featuring Gregory, and lots of other interesting stuff that help to give even more insight into the life of this amazing American actor (who was born in California on April 5, 1916).<br /><br />Gregory Peck takes center stage during portions of the program (literally), as he talks and jokes with large audiences around the United States, and conducts various Q&A sessions.<br /><br />There's lots of candid footage of Peck (and family) here too, including some impressive shots taken at Niagara Falls. And in Paris, too. And Ireland. And in Washington, D.C., as Gregory gets an award from then-President Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Near the end of this thoroughly-engaging bio/&#34;Conversation&#34;, we see proud granddaddy Gregory holding his just-born grandson (who was named &#34;Harper&#34;, after TKAM author Harper Lee). The scenes of Little Harper will make you want to reach into your TV and scoop up this adorable munchkin. He's one of the cutest little tykes I've ever laid eyes on. It's no wonder Gregory looks so proud here. These tender scenes with Gregory and his new grandson add the perfect sweet and sentimental finishing touches to the whole documentary.<br /><br />This &#34;Conversation&#34; bonus is a genuinely unique program. It was produced with an obvious large dose of love and affection by Mr. Peck's daughter (and all others who were involved in putting it together). After viewing it, you can't help but feel like you know (and admire) a man named Eldred Gregory Peck quite a bit better than you did just ninety-seven minutes earlier. And that might be the best compliment I can pay this very special and heart-warming documentary.<br /><br />Mr. Peck passed away in June of 2003, four years after he filmed this program. He was 87. He will be missed forever by multiple generations of movie fans who loved his work in the cinema for many decades. His talent is one that we'll likely not run across again, until we reach heaven. But thank goodness for fabulous documentaries like this one, plus all of his cherished films as well, which enable fans to retouch the magic and greatness that will forever be associated with Mr. Gregory Peck.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />The packaging for this &#34;Legacy Series&#34; edition has a very solid and collectible feel to it.

B000929AJQ|5.0|This was my first NIN cd.  After hearing \\"Bite the Hand That Feeds\\" on the radio I finally decided to take the plunge and try NIN for once.  When I first listened to the CD I will admit I wasn't too thrilled.  There were a couple good songs, but over all I wasn't impressed.  I had planned on writing a review then and it probably would have been a 3 or a 4 star review at the most.  I decided to purchase The Downward Spiral since I had heard from many people that this was his \\"best\\" album.  Finally, just recently I went back to With Teeth and discovered that it is one of my favorite albums released this year.   <br /> <br />I tell you this because I think this album, as much of Reznor's magnum opuses, are albums that grow on you.  It wasn't until I took the time, sitting down and actually listening to With Teeth that I realize the love and care that went into each and every scathing moment of it.  Even though the cd has a more poppy feel to it in comparison to earlier NIN, each song is still remarkably Trent in every way.  From the opening song, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" with its continual building and adding of music and voices to the title song to the end, each song is filled with a vehemence that people might miss on a casual listen.  What brought me back to this cd was the song \\"Only\\" when it was released as a single (not to mention the kick ass music video directed by David Fincher) and that song has continued to grow on me.  I also love the loudness and spunk of \\"You Know What You Are?\\" and the unique drumming by David Grohl on \\"The Collector.\\"  \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" is brutally beautiful, and the lyrics of \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" are great.   <br /> <br />Trent does rely on some of his old tricks, however.  In \\"With Teeth,\\" for instance, he does the loud then quiet middle before STARTLING you back to life with loudness.  He's done that before and yes it still works and is neat, but its old hat for him.  You can't call me a die hard NIN fan.  I'm not afanboy, but I love original and different music and right now finding NIN for the first time right now is like a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stagnant mainstream music scene (with the exception of System of a Down whose new cd rocks my world as well).   <br /> <br />People can say that With Teeth isn't as good as some of his earlier works.  I disagree with that statement, but I can see why fans would say that.  It is a more subtle album; you won't find the explosive and as on the nose songs like \\"Heresy\\" with its lyrics about \\"God is dead and no one cares.\\"  Instead you'll find lyrics that are more subtle and, at times (not always mind you), more interesting.  On the surface, it seems lighter, more pop-influenced than rock influenced, but underneath this cd does have teeth.
B000021Y77|4.0|It was more the style of the film which intrigued me, than the typical things one looks for in a film.<br /><br />The relentless pounding tempo, reinforced with the running and music score. Nothing really complicated, just plenty of time to let the mind drift and contemplate how seemingly insignificant moments in time can alter one's whole life.<br /><br />The film, \\"Sliding Doors\\", also broached this subject, and I liked that film even better than this, ranking it 5 stars, but \\"Run Lola Run\\" was darn good, too.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I thought the movie was wonderful. I have not seen it on stage, but I plan to in the future.  Gerald Butler did a fantastic job singing considering he was not a trained opera singer.  Emmy Rossum and Partick Wilson did a wonderful job with their parts.  I would recommend this movie to everyone especially if they like musicals.  I have watched this movie over and over again.
B0000797IO|4.0|I can find criticisms, but if just looking at the film as a vehicle for Jennifer Aniston, it did show a depth to her acting ability.<br /><br />The whole plot seemed dumb, but I'll go along with the thought that there really are some pretty dumb people, and this is how this collection would live out such slice of life situations.<br /><br />There are real people on the Jerry Springer show, and this film seems to actually capture the mentality of such people. Not the greatest subject material, but who hasn't watched some snippets of Jerry Springer and been entertained?
B00001QEE7|5.0|I remember having watched this movie many times when I was young.  I have since grown up, and this movie truly stands the test of time.  None of the movies Disney has been making now will ever come close to the hand-drawn classics they used to make before.  I'm not necessarily saying that the computer-animated movies they are making are bad, but that they will never be as memorable as The Little Mermaid, and others such as Beauty and the Beast.  I even caught myself sheding a tear at the end of the movie; it's that good. <br /> <br />Props to the various people who write the music.  Part of what made The Little Mermaid so wonderful was the colorful music that was sung throughout the movie.  It's sad that in this day and age, none of Disney's movies have any sort of music which truly capture the personality of each character.  One obvious example is \\"Part of Your World\\" which depicted Ariel's longing to venture out of her \\"watery\\" existence, and witness great things above the surface.  I have a newfound respect for Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (the brain-children of the music we all recognize and love); big props to them for making music that got stuck in my head. <br /> <br />The only thing disappointing with this DVD is the fact that there is no hint of special features on it (which was also implied when looking on the back of the DVD case, and there was nothing listed).  I've enjoyed the serarate 'Special Features' discs that have come with various other classic Disney releases, but I was disappointed that it wasn't the case for this movie.  Hopefully Disney will release a special edition for this movie also. <br /> <br />In any case, if you're looking for an animated movie with a great story, look no further because The Little Mermaid is the one you seek. <br /> <br />(And yes it's a guy who's writing this review.  I'm man enough to write a review of a great animated classic).
B0001QNFXW|5.0|This stunning concert DVD has EVERYTHING going for it: great set list, superb sound, great camera work and unobtrusive editing, and a beautiful setting in the Verona (Italy) ampitheater. And then there's the infectious charisma - and incredible dancing - of singer/frontman Jay Kay.  <br /> <br />If you're new to Jamiroquai, it's got a hip hint of 70s Stevie Wonder but with a thoroughly modern, unabashedly joyful, and gotta-dance club beats. Highly recommended.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is a great CD! All the songs from the movie are on it.
B00030590I|4.0|Hero is one of those movies most Americans will probably see and wonder what they just saw as the credits roll at the end.  The story involving an assissan's realization on purpose and the greater good over revenge is such a resounding theme absent in most action films, and all American action films.  The choice of color and movement to depict different takes on the same event make the artistry of the story unfold much easier then the typical dream or different angle of alternate takes shooting we see in films on this side of the Pacific.  Most of the martial arts are reserved for sword play unlike other films of this genre.  The movie is large on contrasts and gives deep insight to each character along with there motives.  A very engaging movie that isn't too over the top with wire work or dialog.  Great action and sword play and excellent direction and writing.  The ending is not typical which is one of the elements I love in a movie, being unexpected and shocking.
B0000026J1|3.0|Second choice of this excellent rock group, after \\"The Final Countdown\\"CD.
B00013RC8O|3.0|I first saw this movie in 1978 on TV, of all places.  I did not remember much of it, but the ending and car always stood out in my memory.  In the late 1980's I looked for it and found VHS copies, but they were $80.00 so I did not get one.  After getting this DVD I was amazed at what I did not remember, or more accurately did not understand when seeing it at such a young age.  The movie hits on many politcal and social issues of the era and challanges cultural norms through brief yet strong images and dialog.  The movie as a whole is choppy, edited bad and made on a small budget.  Character development is left for the imagination along with the reasons behind what is going on around the two main characters.  The themes and issues that the writer and director try to bring out are the movies saving grace.  It appears to be shot over the course of a week on a small budget, but the setup for each scene is done with care and purpose.  Again it is a very memorable movie and with an ending seldom seen in movies at its time or this time.  I believe if a good director and budget came around it would be a good movie to remake.  One of the best car movies of the 1970's.  Hard to follow but the issues the movie addresses are worth looking into.  I can now say I have a copy of the most memorable movie I have ever seen, next to Star Wars and Jaws from my youth.
B00005NNMK|4.0|For those people who love Europe music, this is the best CD from this terific group from the 80's decade. It include songs like \\"The Final Countdown\\"; \\"Carrie\\" and others that were hits all over the world on this epoque. It is Rock at its best.

0060989157|5.0|I was a Motley Crue fan before this book but after reading I'm an even BIGGER fan.  I could not put this book down!  I wouldn't even mind a \\"The Dirt 2\\" to pick up where this book left off.  Well worth the money!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got this CD a week ago and have been listening to it almost exclusively.  If you already like Green Day you'll really appreciate the maturity of their latest release.  If you haven't listened to Green Day before, this is a great place to start.  Throw caution to the wind and spend the cash.  You won't be disappointed.
0805047905|5.0|This book is now my 2 year old's favorite. We read it to her at least 3x a day. She is learning her colors and she loves the rhythm of the book. She claps the beat while I read. It is a wonderful book. All kids should have a copy!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Ok... I waited a while to write a review because quite frankly, I wasn't impressed on my first listen, or even the 2, 3, 4th... Here now, a few months later, and after seeing Coldplay on Tour, I am finely enjoying this album and its finer points...<br /><br />The thing that initially turned me off on this album is that the style was too much like A Rush of Blood to the Head. I love that album, but I hate it when groups don't change much... It makes all of the albums that sound the same a little more boring.<br /><br />However... things started to change when I gave the album a closer listen and more importantly, when I saw them in concert. While the sound is similar to previous Coldplay, the songs are a bit unique at times and jump out at me now... I think the key feature of this album are the lyrics. There are some great songs in there that really stand out to me. My favorite is Swallowed by the Sea, although all the other songs have their fine points. I mostly enjoy the subtleness of the songs.<br /><br />I think the biggest drawback may be the first single, Speed of Sound, which is just a bit too much like Clocks. Clocks is my favorite on A Rush of Blood, but I only need that song once... That is probably what turned me off of the album in the first place.<br /><br />Anyway, this album is great when you listen closely... other greats on this album include What If, Fix You, White Shadows, Twisted Logic, and perhaps one of the best, Kingdom Come. For its purpose, I think that song is so much more... It is only sad that we didn't get to hear Johnny Cash sing it... Oh well, Chris Martin does an excellent job on his own, finishing this album with quite a bang... I love it when albums finish stronger than they start. This is one of them!

0060528737|5.0|The last book in the Abhorsen Trilogy is by far the best. It is exciting, intense, fantasy. Read it, it's great.
B00005JODA|5.0|THE CONSTANT GARDNER is not a film for the inattentive viewer, or for the audience member that thinks of \\"thrillers\\" as involving car-crashes, lots of \\"action\\" and perhaps crazy psycho-killers.  (Not that there's anything wrong with those kinds of movies!)  It's an understated, super-tense, very British mystery.  It smolders and seethes.  It doesn't raise its voice.    The story, in a brief nutshell, involves the relationship / marriage between Justin (Ralph Fiennes), a mid-level British diplomat, who keeps his emotions well in check and enjoys gardening) and Tessa (Rachel Wiesz) a hot-headed rich-girl with aspirations to change the world...by any means necessary.  They end up in an African nation, where Tessa seems to be working closely with an African doctor to bring treatment to the poorest of the poor.  She rubs diplomats the wrong way with her \\"in-your-face\\" attitude, and she may be a very unfaithful wife as well.    It's not spoiling anything to say that the film more or less begins with her brutal murder.  After this, the film bounces back to show us how we got to this point, and then leaps forward to show us what happens after.      This is an angry movie.  It postulates as fact some pretty cynical and nasty conspiracies about the cozy relationship between drug-companies and the British government, all at the terribly high death-toll of the Africans.  It rants a bit too obviously about Britain's involvement in Iraq.  But on the other hand, we all know that SOMETHING is terribly wrong in Africa and that for some reason AIDS is out of control, poverty never gets any better, despite billions in international assistance and that many of the governments are brutal dictatorships.  So the movie also rightly makes us look at the plight of these poor people, even if the exact reason for it is speculative.    But at the heart of the film is the mystery of Tessa.  What was she doing?  Who was she in love with?  Who may have betrayed her?  Was she paranoid, or was she really on to something?  Justin, who deeply loved Tessa, pulls himself out of his protective shell, and goes on essentially a one-man crusade to find the truth...despite the obvious risk to his own life.    I won't say more than this, because so many twists and turns happen in the film.  It's packed with \\"plot developments,\\" but one of its great achievements is that they are easy to follow.  The plot, even with shifts in time, is pretty easy to follow...yet we never feel led by the nose.  We discover as Ralph Fiennes discovers.  The movie never talks down to the audience.  You must pay attention to keep up, but you also don't feel strained.  This isn't MEMENTO.  It's an adult thriller.    It feels like its been awhile since Ralph Fiennes has done anything.  I checked and was reminded that he DOES keep busy...but just lately, the projects have been quite out of the mainstream.  It's great to see him.  He does his smoldering, implosive \\"bit\\" again, but he always keeps it real and grounded, and we can always see the decent man underneath.  He's a sympathetic character, even when his passiveness is frustrating.  We always see quite easily how much he loves Tessa.  It's this love that is all he needs to feel happy and content.    A failing of the movie is that we're asked to believe that despite his clear love for Tessa, he doesn't really know what she's up to.  He \\"gives her the space she needs\\" (my invented quote...not a line from the film, thank God!) but it's kinda hard to buy that he would love her so much (and she loves him?) and yet be so out of touch with what's most important to her.  The film does offer some motivation for this, but upon reflection after seeing the film, it rang a little false.  It's far from a fatal flaw, but it did distract.    Everyone in the film is very good.  Rachel Wiesz finally gets a high-profile role in a film that isn't silly (THE MUMMY, CONSTANTINE).  I think she has great potential, and this film began to tap it.  Bill Nighy has a small but critical role...he is just absolutely one of the most terrific British actors around right now...he steals everything he's in (LOVE, ACTUALLY, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE... and the fantastic lead in STILL CRAZY.)  There are a lot of other great British character actors (and I'll admit I don't know their names), plus the always over the top but fun to watch Pete Postlewaite.    But it's Ralph Fiennes' film.  I predict another Oscar-nomination for him.  (Can't wait to see him as Lord Voldemort).  I recommend the movie highly.  Certainly one of the classiest movies of the year.    (In response to some other criticisms I have seen here...this movie does have a heart.  But as with all things in British diplomatic circles...it is kept discretely hidden.  Mustn't be improper.  I agree that the movie somewhat holds the viewer at a distance emotionally for much of the film.  But as Fiennes situation grows more desparate, he begins to loosen up and let us see what he's feeling.  The \\"arms-length\\" that we're held at slowly begins to bend and pull us closer.  By the final, lonely scene, I was very much held in an emotional grip.  The film had become quite personal...all the political undercurrents were set aside, and it was film about a man and a woman afterall.)
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I wasn't sure of the concept, but AP has always delivered so I gave it a try. <br /> <br />I'm impressed.  Guest musicians include David Gilmour with a dissonant, high end guitar, Crystal Method backing Alan Parsons as he handles vocals as well as he does live--I always wondered what he'd sound like in the studio (Good.  Like everything else he does).  There's even an odd bit with John Cleese. <br /> <br />The music is cerebral and surreal, electronic but not repetitive or trance.  It's definitely rock, with an edge.  Mostly somber, but not depressing.  Alan delivers the goods once again.
B00005JODA|4.0|In the Constant Gardener, we see a theme that is depicted in the most dramatic of ways, with violent death. The theme is the giving of oneself to a cause that is bigger than any of us, despite the cost.<br /><br />A recently married couple seems blissfully embedded in a life of love and promise. That all fades, and quite rapidly, when the wife if murdered en route to discovering a grand scheme bent on the murder of Africans in order to benefit pharmiseutical research. The husband, a British diplomat, who has had a hard time understanding his wife's compassion in his usually bottom-line world, sets it upon himself to find the basis for his wife's research, and, in turn, discover her depth of humanity as well.<br /><br />Early in the film, the diplomat's wife, upon seeing a family walking miles to their destination, says to her husband, \\"Stop, let's give them a ride.\\" He tells her, \\"There's thousands of people who need help out there. We can't help them all.\\" To which she responds, \\"Yes, but these are A FEW we can help.\\"<br /><br />As we continue to watch the progression of the protagonist, played superbly by Ralph Fiennes, from a luke-warm spectator of the human condition to an actual member within it, going so far as to adopt the same quote as his aforementioned wife in a critical point in the film, we begin to feel ourselves gathering an empathy for that same philosophy. This is never more true than the closing segments of the film, when we watch the great lengths that our once-unaffected gardener takes to ensure his belief, and doing so with the utmost tranquility.<br /><br />Action. Mystery. A change in outlook on each of our characters. And finally, a sense of peace that we might have never understood without the progression on the gardener's own journey, because with this peace comes the collection of the ultimate price.
B000000W5N|5.0|I purchased Sticky Fingers last year after I bought some of the Stones other albums. In my opinion, this is easiely their second best effort after Exile On The Main Street, which on its own, is an unbeatable record in many ways. On Fingers, you have 10 songs full of references of Drugs. Their past 2 albums were excellent classics but up to this point, this was easiely their best. \\"Brown Suger\\" is an all-time Rock N Roll anthem. \\"Wild Horses\\" is probebly my favorite Stones song. \\"Sister Morphine\\" is a classic Drug-Influenced song about what's it's like when you're Stoned. Definitly one of the most depressing songs about Heorin addiction ever recorded. The album closes with the gorgeous \\"Moonlight Mile\\". Sticky Fingers is en essential Stones classic. Recommended for any self-respecting Rock N Roll fan.
B0006957SA|5.0|Having only heard of the Pogues via Fairytale of New York and buying this CD on a whim, I was curious and wary as to what I was letting myself in for. I need not have worried, this CD is pure genius. Touching, rowdy, makes you want to raise your glass and cry on the shoulder of your best mate one minute then laugh your head off the next. Great buy, great CD, great band.
B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatles AKA The White album is the album that ultimatly put an end for The Beatles. After The White album, They recorded the Ok but not excellent album \\"Let it Be\\" and then eventually \\"Abby Road\\" which is a rediclously overrated effort that had barley any good songs. Following up their masterpiece, Sgt Peppers, The beatles decided to do a double record this time and the result is above than average but still they could've gotten rid of some songs. Most people know the music already so I won't explain that But songs like \\"Revolution #9\\" are worthless and waste of record tape. Songs on the first Disc like \\"Honey Pie\\" which is pretty much worthless as a whole. Overall, the album is great but dont expect The usual Beatles brilliance shown on albums like \\"Revolver\\" Or \\"Rubber Soul\\".
B00005N9CV|5.0|she is attractive, and her voice may not be at great, and some of her songs really suck.but having said that, i feel this is one classy album that looks and sounds great enough to be in ones music collection. <br /> <br />it reminds me of romantic escapes, on a rainy/cloudy day, dining out with my sweetheart over some red wine, and listening to her in the background. its all about the vibe, the moods that her songs arouse in me, and its all good!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie was quite unique. I'm dissapointed in the advertisement of this movie, based on how well it was put together. I would have like to have seen it on the big screen, but the comercials and ads were appealing enough to go see. There is enough crappy movies out there, that it's not worth your 8-10 dollars a person to see. <br />Everything Quintin touches, seems to be worth seeing. This movie is unlike anything you've seen so far. It's pretty wild how it really looks like a black and white comic book, but yet the characters are real. You have to see it for yourself, but you don't have to be a comic book fan to like this film, you have to be a movie fan. One who sees this film, can and will appreciate the cinematography and writing.  <br />Enough said, it's a must see.
B00007ELEL|5.0|i think i have laughed so hard only for a few movies,  <br />\\"Return of the Pink Panther\\" is one that comes to mind!  <br />literally, i got stomach cramps because i was lauching so hard!  <br />jeff bridges was in his element in this one, he was flawless in this movie, and i hope he does a part 2 for this movie, because it will be a blockbuster
B000006NUW|3.0|I wish there was a Motown box that omitted the Four Tops, Miracles, Temptations, and  Marvin Gaye. Why? Well, because any Motown fan should have retrospectives devoted to all of the above (although I personally despise the Miracles, heretic that I am). Yet there are amazing tracks from lesser-known artists that remain unanthologized or unavailable. I guess that's why they invented iTunes. But seriously, this music should be given to every child at birth.

0684803356|4.0|My body and most of my brain is in Calgary, but there is a part of me at the foot of a limestone cave in the mountains of Spain watching a man named Robert(o) negotiate aide in a war I'd never learned about.<br /><br />Vaguely, I was aware that in the last century Spain had a civil war.  I was not aware it was Republicans vs. Fascists.  I can't say I knew it was wedged right between the two world wars.  I had, from time to time, wondered why Spain was left out of the second but having never asked - I forgot about it.<br /><br />In Hemmingway and Steinbeck both, I'm beginning to understand the very weight of the Communist issue in 1930s America.  Accusing someone of being a communist was a very serious charge.  Even in Spain (Robert is an American on the Republic side of the war) a man is called a communist and reacts as though it was his life he is protecting in denying the slander.<br /><br />I think that period writers such as these are really instrumental in keeping history alive.  The books are much easier to read than Non-Fiction (for me at least) and there aren't enough people around from that time to talk about it anymore.<br /><br />The flip side to appreciating what a fictional author can bring is that, as in this, only a few players are introduced.  Hemmingway's Roberto was a fantastic character who held dread on equal weight as hope.  In the three days the book spanned I felt as if I was living along side Roberto.  I watched him plot his offensive; understood as he explained it to his comrades; rationalized the perils of the pending attack. Mostly though, I fell in love with him as Maria did and fell in love with her equally.<br /><br />As exciting as all that is, the repercussions of war were heavily felt as I edged on the last pages of the book.  It is heavy material and it wasn't as quick to get through as I have found other books that I have loved.<br /><br />The 470 could have easily been 900 pages and I would have read it still, devouring every word.  Give yourself the time to read it, as you may have to put it down a few times in the process.till, devouring every word.  Give yourself the time to read it, as you may have to put it down a few times in the process. <br />
B0002GTWYW|4.0|I was suprised that he made two songs that talked about suicide.  It was depressing.  All the others are well done.  He talks about his life and how hard it was for him to grow up and live.  He states that he does not like the west coast and tupac because he is from the east coast.  He is from Brooklyn, N.Y.
0792844882|4.0|Something draws me to this movie, the acting isnt particullarly great but something about it is striking and its like a train wreck- you cant stop watching it. Its raw, and very in your face. The sexually open parts graphic, but graphic in the way they are supposed to be- its gritty but then again strippers are gritty. I had a hard time understanding Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkley's intercharacter relationship.. still cant... The cinematography was wonderful, its very vibrant. Why do i think this movie is a camp classic? Well the lack of a budget ranking lead has a lot to do with it- Elizabeth Berkely probally wasnt thought of as anything more than Jessie from Saved by the Bell before this- not to say that now shes a serious actress but this totally pushed up her VaVaVoom rating a notch or 2 and i think the area of controversy that came out when it was released, i remember my father not letting my siblings or i watch it- and this is the man who let me watch children of the corn at 8. So the movie gets 4 stars, Its in my personal collection and id say its one of my favorite camp classics. :) Enjoy!

6304436408|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I actually didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I thought it would be drawn out and overacted, like many movies from that time period tend to be. It was beautiful and beautifully acted. The characters all brought a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\" to the role. I often felt as if I were looking at these people living their daily lives. The characters are very believable and as I mentioned je ne sais quoi, is the only phrase to describe the players--they added an indescribable something to the roles. Perhaps the only character that almost fell out of good graces with me was Colonel Brandon. I found his voice a little annoyingly coarse and stoic, but perhaps that's what the Austen book was going for anyway. Once again, Excellent movie, excellent writing, acting, directing, ergo, it makes for  excellent viewing.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|In Your Honor album is a great experience for me 'cause it brings me back good feelings. It's like listening to a soundtrack of my life.

This group is outstanding, and their gritty themed music is just the thing that needs to be added to any audiophile's collection. Chris Cornell's voice is powerful, and the music on the album does justice to the genre. Expect the best..and then sit back and appreciate listening to it!

B000002HEP|5.0|A friend of mine gave me this album back in the 90's and I could not believe it....this was THE BEST...I mean BEST heavy guitar album I have ever heard...it was music that I had been always looking for and LO!  hear it was... <br /> <br />The thundering opening of GARDENIA sucks you right in and takes you along a musical 'trip'... <br /> <br />What's unique about this album is that it has three 'sides' or blocks of songs that blend into each other seemlessly, each taking you across new musical landscape with that heavy edge along with some phat acoustic trips too.   <br /> <br />You've got the fierce guitar of Josh Homme combined with the sweet voice of John Garcia bringing these songs home to roost....\\"Fire...On the Mountain....and it rages out of control!\\"..from ODYSSEY. <br /> <br />These songs rage and rock and rule!!! <br /> <br />This started me out on the road for desert rock...see the Desert Sessions and Queens of the Stone Age as the progession of JOSH HOMME and the reminants of KYUSS after their break-up. <br /> <br />But this is a MUST own...this album pretty much crushes 99% of the music that's new today.  Believe it...you will not be dissappointed. <br /> <br />also get KYUSS \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\"
B000002GC2|5.0|This album just brings back a flood of pleasant memories. Right from the brilliant cover art with the photo of The Dude statue. The album that introduced us to James Ingram. A collection of brilliant songs, featuring lots of great artistes (Patti Austin, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder to name a few) and excellently produced by the master, Q!<br /><br />Nominated for a record 12 Grammys, the album got to #10 on the US album charts and had 3 hit singles on the pop charts. It featured a diverse array of styles; R&B, pop, jazz and rap.<br /><br />Opening track `Ai no corrida' is typical Quincy Jones, a super energetic dance number with a catchy anthemic chorus. Great sax from Ernie Watts. #28 pop, and winner of a Grammy.<br /><br />Title track `The Dude' is a funky song with rapped verses and a catchy sung chorus (MJ among backing vocals). Grammy for best R&B performance by a duo or group.<br /><br />The lovely synthesizer driven number `Betcha wouldn't hurt me' was penned by Stevie Wonder and performed by Patti Austin, and has a slight jazz feel. Patti Austin also features on the jazzy `Razzamatazz', `Something special' and `Turn on the action'.<br /><br />There's the wistful harmonica laden jazz instrumental piece `Velas' (candles in Spanish). Grammy winner for best instrumental arrangement.<br /><br />`Just once' is a tender piano ballad powerfully performed by James Ingram'. #17 pop. `One hundred ways' is a smooth midtempo jazz tinged song also performed by Ingram, #14 pop and Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance. It is a tender love song urging one to find one hundred ways to make your woman feel special. Compliment her, buy her roses, etc. Beautiful!<br /><br />A superb collection. After this, in 1982, Q would produce Michael Jackson's block buster `Thriller' and Donna Summer's eponymous album, both classics.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|You say you want a movie loaded with action, mild violence, clean dialogue, and a believable story? Well.....3 out of 4 ain't bad! In this case the weakest link is the story. It's just so unbelievable. All of the characters are good although Steve Zahn is definitely the star in this one. He shines the brightest. I still have trouble understanding the appeal of Penelope Cruz but not enough to make a negative comment about her. You just won't remember her performance once the end credits begin to roll. Likewise with Matthew McConaughey. He also is just.....what's the word for these two.....adequate. The film takes elements of Indiana Jones and James Bond and blends them together nicely into an appealing fun filled action movie. This is especially true in all the zippy lines wonderfully delivered by Zahn. I think this unassuming actor has found an endearing place in all our hearts with consistantly rewarding performances. So in the end I'll say it's a good movie and maybe even worth keeping altough I probably won't. Better rent it before you buy it.
6301969294|1.0|This movie has a basic philosophical point that apparently got a lot of people excited in the 50s, Ayn Rand's simplistic statement that the individual has integrity, but the popular view of 'the mob' is always mediocre.  There isn't much more to it than that, but the author thought it was profound, and so did the makers of this film, which is based on Rand's novel.  I cannot imagine how this single, obvious point could be the basis of a 800 page novel.  As a movie, it's hypnotically bad. Every scene and every character make the same point.  The villains make idiotic speeches about how \\"we have to consider public opinion, don't we?\\" and the heroes say things like \\"I got where I am by acting on my own honest judgement, no matter what anyone else thought.\\"  Although the cast is filled with great actors, in this film, the acting makes a daytime soap opera seem like the Royal Shakespeare Company.  The director apparently told everyone in the film to stand still and make a speech, preferably in a monotone.  The love affair between the architect Roark (who, in a fit of integrity, becomes a 'common laborer' after a bank board rejects his innovative design) and a fashionably-attired and presumably wealthy columnist who marries an egotistical newspaper publisher, is the most grim-faced romance ever filmed.  Yet his phallic architecture makes her weak kneed and vulnerable. The film pretends that architecture is an issue that a cynical publisher would put on the front page to stir the masses and boost circulation.  Right. Thousands of people will write the paper demanding that all buildings have Greek ornamentation. Uh huh.<br /><br />Rent or buy this movie if you want to feel like you're on heavy drugs. It is a bizarre relic that will make you laugh out loud.

0393307050|5.0|Don't despair. If you've been recommended this series, and have started reading it, and think \\"why?\\", keep reading. This series is worth dredging through the first 100 pages or so. I've never been so capivated by a series of books. I love Jane Austen and Martha Grimes. Only an author like Patrick O'Brian could captivate a 40+ female with naval war tales. My interest initially was solely in the characters, as it is with all the books I read. Mr. O'Brian delivers big-time with his Aubrey/Maturin and their other relationships in all his books. And yet, I found myself buying the other books which explain the ship terms, the geography, the naval history, etc. etc. I am now completely captivated with this period of history, and wish all with an adventurous spirit to enter his world.
B00003CXS4|1.0|I heard from my friends this movie was amazing, great, fantabulous. But when I rented this movie and brought it to my house, I was just disappointed. There was swearing every three seconds and tons of senseless violence. <BR>     The swearing kept on coming, and the act grew old. And you know what? I think they used the word &quot;F*CK&quot; more than they did in Blare Witch. It was an absolutely crapped up movie, and I wouldn't watch it again unless someone put a gun to my head. I hate this movie.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|I've finished reading almost all the reviews here and I must say that I'm very disgusted of people who say she's the queen of punk, or created this \\"Emo\\", or one of the best guitar players, etc. <br />This music isn't even heavy, the guitars are barely heard, and if we can hear them Avril is one of the WORST guitarists ever, she barely plays 2 chords and plays only in the choruses. And I can't stand her voice, it sound like a 4 years old girl who is crying because her mom didn't buy for her a lollipop as she asked. And she's not even hot, her face looks like a squashed mouse. in general there is nothing good about this waste of plastic but it is better than her terrible and overrated debut. <br />Oh, don't let MTV Rocks' review fool you, he/she is influenced by the worst channel on TV in the whole world, eMpTyV, and I'm not the first one who called it like this.  If you want real punk listen to Black Flag, Ramones, The Clash, Vibrators etc. <br />And that's what I have to say to Lavinge and eMpTyV organization <br /> <br />IJOS DE PUTAS!!!! <br /> <br />That's in spanish, I bet that none of you stupid Poser Lavigne fans know what its meaning.

6301969294|4.0|One of the hot topics in the field of asthetics is the extent to which a work of art is improved by 'truth' or cheapened by falsity. Does right and wrong, true or false, have any effect at all of the artistic value of a creative work of art. I believe this movie and the novel by Ayn Rand on which it is based is one of the finest case studies for the position that the truth of an artistic work's intellectual message has a profound effect on the artistic value of the work. Virtually the only other cinematic work about which I might say this is Leni Riefenstall's famous documentary, 'Triumph of the Will'.<br /><br />My point is based on the fact that author Rand takes a reasonable position of artistic integrity and twists it into a form which simply makes no sense when applied to the discipline of architecture. The abberation would disappear, in my mind, if Gary Cooper were a sculptor, poet, painter, or even playwright. If he were Michaelangelo doing the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the issue starts to get really fuzzy, as he is creating a decoration for a specific patron to fill a very specific function.<br /><br />What makes the wrongheadedness of the character Roarke's individualism so apparant is that it is played out in the world of architecture, where almost all buildings are done for a specific client, which, for commercial buildings, is almost always a corporation with lots of different opinions and needs to satisfy. The simplest case is that of a family with a husband, wife, 2.3 children and a dog looking for a house. You need to balance financial resources against the number of bedrooms, the number of closets, and the fenced in yard for Fido.<br /><br />If you think this is hard, multiply this by 1000 when it comes to building a mall or a highrise.<br /><br />The thing which makes this such a good case study of art and reason and right and wrong is the fact that the director, King Vidor and the principle actors, Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey do such a good job with the script, the blocking, and the cinematography. With Massey's character as a newspaper magnate, one is immediately inclined to make comparisons with 'Citizen Kane'.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the wrongheadedness of Rand's political and personal philosophy seriously compromises the whole film. Oddly, Cooper's character has a remarkable albeit superficial resemblence to Frank Lloyd Wright's career, which I am sure adds much verisimillatude to the story.<br /><br />But, from what little I know of Wright's career, he was largely successful from the outset and often compromised on major design points.<br /><br />I recommend this movie as much for its wrongheadedness as for its artistic value.ey do such a good job with the script, the blocking, and the cinematography.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a refreshing show that was never given a chance by the TV executives. A mix of Wild, Wild West and Star Wars. To different for some, it could not be put in any \\"BOX\\" or category easily. It is great to see the short run series put out in a format that future generations can enjoy.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|I don't think this is the best of all the Trek seasons--that honor goes to DS9 season 4--but ENT season 3 is in the top five.  There is a season-long story arc, but many of the shows can stand alone and are of excellent quality.  Enterprise is visually the best of all the Trek shows, and season three is the best-looking of all the Enterprise seasons.  The writers and producers do a great job of developing Archer's character, so the decisions he makes are sometimes noble, sometimes criminal, but always human.  This is terrific television and the high point of an unfortunately short-lived show.
B00000K0EA|4.0|Tomorrow Never Dies was the 18th official James Bond film, and the second one starring Pierce Brosnan. This time, Bond must race to stop a media mongul from igniting World War III between the Chinese and British for the sake of media ratings.<br /><br />For me at least, TND has gotten better with repeat viewings. The main criticism of this film has always been that it turns Bond into a 'run-and-gun' generic action hero and that it favours pyrotechnics and stunts over a developed plot. It's a problem all the newer Bond movies have had, but TND is where it's most obvious. Once you accept that though, there's a lot of fun to be had here. Lots of great sequences, including a parking garage chase and one on a motorcycle. Michelle Yeoh, being an action star herself, is the best of the \\"secret agent\\" Bond girls. Yeoh and her stunt team manage a fight sequence ripped from Hong Kong action movies that almost feels out of place in a western Bond film. And David Arnold's first Bond score is a sexy, classy, memorable affair that's worth buying the soundtrack for.<br /><br />The DVD packs a lot in. Two audio commentaries, an isolated score track, and a multi-angle storyboard featurette. It's missing a strong making-of documentary, but packs in a generalized featurette that aired on TV and is worth watching. Tomorrow Never Dies isn't the strongest Bond film, but it's pretty action-filled romp that's worth owning for Bond fans.
B0007TKH66|4.0|So it's not the best Trek series.  Enterprise Season One maybe the best first season of any of the Trek series.  There are a couple definite poor shows, but \\"Broken Bow\\" is easily the best kick-off episode in Trek.  \\"Breaking the Ice\\" is excellent.  The story-line about the temporal cold war is fantastic, and I am glad that there are no cute characters.  Phlox is eccentric at times but never annoying. <br />    Why this show did not make it is a mystery, but it certainly did not suffer due to quality.  At the end of the day, it stands with TNG, DS9, VOY and TOS.
B00005BJ9W|4.0|If you like your pop music decadent and bombastic, then RIO is your album. I am normally not partial to the really glitzy, eighties glam that ruled the airwaves back in the day(I like Townes Van Zandt). However, I do like pop that is well crafted and arranged. This CD fits the bill and the overly polished production so characteristic of the times is perfect. All of the boys can really play and the music is very danceable and catchy. Let go of the odd images of wierd haircuts and pastel suits and you'll find that you are dancing with yourself.
079073639X|2.0|...and this sci-fi-thriller is wrecked by a bad script, unsympathetic characters (or pathetic acting -you choose!), unforgivable performances by a talented cast such as Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone (who hasn't played in a good movie for a while) and Samuel L. Jackson. None of them can save \\"Sphere\\". It is one of those movies that promises a lot, and when the movie is over you feel cheated. First time I saw \\"The Abyss\\" I actuallt felt a bit more \\"hungry\\", but nowhere near this. Uninspiring and boring and chaotic and confusing and stupid! Easy money, no doubt! It's not even at the same level as \\"Event Horizon\\" -and this should really draw you the picture.
0688170528|2.0|My second Jodi Picoult might be my last. Even though the plot was interesting -- two teenage lovers, Chris and Emily, enter into a pact to commit suicide, but one dies and the other survives uninjured -- all of the characters were so slap-dash and poorly developed, the book could not sustain my interest. For the first 100 pages or so, I kept having to remind myself who was who: was the \\"sensitive veternarian\\" married to the woman with the exuberant personality, or was it the \\"cold doctor\\"?  Was the \\"meek librarian\\" the mother of Chris or of Emily?   I think I kept forgetting because I really didn't care -- her characterizations of them were far too shallow.  <br /> <br />The poor characterization also ruined any proper development of relationship between characters.  The book was supposed to be all about relationships: between teenage lovers, between best friends, between husband and wife, and between parent and child, yet none of these relationships were portrayed with depth, insight or feeling. All the reader gets is overwrought metaphors, and fervent declarations of commitment.  <br /> <br />Finally, I hated the ending.  Completely unrealistic.  Even Picoult admits in the interview at the end of my edition of the book that she believe that the story should have had a different outcome, but that she \\"envisioned the readers sending [her] hate mail.\\"  What a cop out!  I have no interest in following an author who has so little loyalty to her own story.
B00005JMEW|3.0|It wasn't that bad of a movie, it was pretty decent, in a okay kind of way. But I really expected better. Throughtout the whole film, it has VERY little plot, and lots of cliffhangers, such as why the bride was murdered in the first place. I guess(and hope) vol. 2 will explain. But what I most disappointed about this movie was that there's NOT one intelligence in this film, it's just all bloody slaughtering. The bride seems to have NO plan (at least, not a well-plotted one) for the revenge, she just go on massacre and massacre. I mean, I would assume that since they are DEADLY assasins, they would be very discrete and all black ops, you know, but Kill Bill is just basically composed of bloody scenes. I swear, that and a bunch of comic flicks, that's it. If you want to see a good revenge plot, go see Alias, I swear, that show has intelligence, plots that keep you guessing, AND fantastic action, not to mention it's more believable instead of mediocre comic-action plots.  <br />As for the whole bloody thing, it doesn't bother me that much, but seriously, IS IT REALLY NECESSARY????? A good action movie really doesn't have to have THAT much blood, not to mention the way the blood comes out is obviously NOT right. Even if you cut a human head off the blood won't pour out like a water fountain. An action movie is for us to see the action, not the blood, making the blood amount to the amount it's suppose to flow is more than enough. I mean, what's it trying to say? That it's a samurai movie? COME ON, massive blood doesn't make it a samurai movie, when are American movies gonna take off all these stereotypes??     <br />Overall, unless you REALLY REALLY enjoys blood (then you're a complete freak by the way) I would really recommand looking elsewhere for a good action movie.
B00004XPPB|5.0|I saw \\"Donnie Brasco\\" shortly after it came out.  I found it to be an excellent, well-acted, well-directed, and well-scripted examination of lower level organized crime.  The people we see are criminals and they do bad things.  Some of the things they do are quite upsetting.  However, some of the things they do seem so minor to what we expect that it helps underscore the occassional triviality of small-time crime.  There's a scene, for example, in which a number of crooks spend a lot of time trying to break open parking meters to get at the change inside.  I enjoyed the way the movie attempted to understate the level of criminality while reminding us periodically that these are still bad guys ready to step across whatever line we might have been willing to draw in the sand. <br /> <br />The focus of the movie is a crook called Lefty and played excellently by Al Pacino.  Lefty happens to meet an undercover cop and, after a cooperative effort, brings him into the fold.  We get the sense that we are witnessing a lot of real life events which is only natural since this is based on a true story by Joseph Pistone.  Lefty and Donnie Brasco, the undercover cop, spend their time doing what small time wise guys do.  It isn't glamorous but it is filmed in a way that makes it interesting.  In the end, we feel sorry for Lefty.  He had a chance to get out and realize his dream.  However, dead end or not, he stayed with the only life he understood and he understood it to the very end.     <br /> <br />I'm sure I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters shown in this movie.  However, I must say that I enjoyed meeting them through the movie \\"Donnie Brasco\\".
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence would have to be my most favorite rock band of all times, and this album is really the best rock album! Every song is likeable! I HIGHLY recommend you have this CD in your collection!! Trust me it's worth it!
B000002I4S|5.0|5 stars just for the title track. Coltrane was a genius. Get this, get this now! Why are you still reading!
B000002U82|4.0|Great album to relax to, has some very memorable parts, but some things are over done (the clocks for example), but otherwise good fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Ignore the \\"kid\\", he obviously needs a life. <br /> <br />So yeah, good album but not perfect, check out \\"The Wall\\" as in my opinion that is far better.
6304712936|5.0|I saw this movie back in 1984 when it first came out. The digital quality of the DVD lends itself to the excellent cinematography of this film, but also (and in my estimation even more importantly) to the audio portion that effectively captures the wonderful sound of Mozart's music . This latter aspect is terribly important when dealing with the lofty musical output of a genius that was the calibre and rank that Mozart was. The acting of Murray and Hulce, as Salieri and Mozart respectively, was quite exceptional in this film. I also saw the play acted out on stage in a local production soon after having seen the movie - and it was exceptional as well . . . so maybe I'm just a sucker for a well-done production about one of my favorite composers.     As to the story line - much of it seems to be faithful to historical accounts, and the rest is laced with a speculation by which the playwright attempts to depict how resentment can lay hold of a person's heart when comparing their abilities with others whom they feel to have a gift superior to their own. From Mozart's correspondence that I've read - he DID have many of the characteristics attributed to him in this movie (such as demeaning colleagues' work) but the \\"artistic license\\" that caricatured them was valid in that it was for purposes of showing how Mozart would have appeared through the eyes of a contempory who was consumed with envy over Mozart's musical abilities. The historical record for instance DOES say that Salieri somewhat lost his mind soon after Mozart's death. Now whether Salieri was of sound mind when he declared that he had \\"killed Mozart\\" will probably remain a matter of scholarly debate, and is what gives the story that little twist that sort of gnaws at us and makes us wonder . . .
B00001MXXH|5.0|Matthew Broderick's role in this movie makes you wish that high school really could have been that much fun to get away from,  (or that easy.)  Of course then you have his sister who thinks that he's out to make her life miserable, but he's only trying to show how much fun life can be if you only let it.  His exploits around the town keep you wondering if he'll actually get away with skipping school, and if he can ever get Camaron to relax and enjoy it.  Then to make the movie even more fun you have Principle Mooney who knows what kind of a person Ferris really is and will got to almost any lengths to prove it.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I really wasn't too big of a fan of this movie the first time I saw it, but now that I've seen in a few time I like it more and more each time I see it.  Ferrell is funny and his friends show up to make some great cameo appearances (Vaughn, Stiller, Wilson).  At the least, this movie is worth a rental if you haven't seen it.
B00007ELEL|5.0|A friend of mine told me not so long ago: \\"My son watches 'The Big Lebowski' once a week\\". Well, I don't watch it that often but rather often. It's one of the films that can be watched over and over again and you'll never get bored with it. When I started my DVD collection another friend of mine asked me: \\"Do you already have 'The Big L.'?\\" I said no and he continued: \\"Well, if I were you it'd be the first movie I'd get\\". And I thought he's right - this is absolutely a flick for all times. If you don't have anything to watch on a sunday evening and there's nothing new in video-renting shop you can always take 'The Big Lebowski' from the shelf and have a guaranteed pleasant evening. By the way I bought it the next day.<br /><br />It's amazing how Coen brothers can combine comedy and criminal film. Their black humor is the best among all that exist in cinema. Every line, every word is a subject of laughter. For a long time you'll be recalling a rug, Vietnam and what happens when you do particular things to a stranger :)<br /><br />'The Big Lebowski' is a true masterpiece of the 90's, and it'll be a jewel in every collection.
076780421X|5.0|I don't know what is was, possibly the relationship I was in at the time, or it could have been Salma Hayek, but I went through a phase where I watched this movie at least 3 times a week.  Pathetic I know, but this movie is that good.  Perry and Hayek offer great contrast as couple who has everything against them.  If you are a fan of Romantic Comedies or \\"Friends\\" then you'll like \\"Fools Rush In.\\"
B00005JKL8|4.0|I read many reviews where people were saying the movie is wrong, that it's not truthful and so on. To all those people I want to say: it's really beyond politics, it's just an action movie don't take it as a political tract. I'm from Russia and once one of our famous movie directors said on TV he didn't like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" because this film tells the whole world americans were the only ones who won the WW2. That it seems like other nations didn't take part in the war at all. Hearing this I wanted to reply: wake up, moron, 'Ryan' is not about nations it's about personalities.<br /><br />Noone actually shows himself at his best in a war. Everyone was killing each other - serbs, albanians, UN-forces... Like always there are no rights or wrongs here - everyone's to blame. Don't say it's easy for me to speak sitting far away from countries that once formed Yugoslavia - Russia is doing very wrong things now in Chechnia so we are to blame too.<br /><br />But I don't think we need to carry these discussions over to the cinema. I repeat: this is only a movie and it sets rules by itself. And as a movie (not life) it's nearly perfect - pilot shot down behind enemy lines tries to escape from the cutthroates that chase him. Brave pilot, noble commanding officer, proud civilian helpers, cunning villains - what else do you need for an excellent action film?! Plus awesome special effects (the scene when the fighter jet is shot down is just frantic), beautiful landscapes, good actors... If you like war-action movies this one is yours indeed.<br /><br />By the way bonus features have some extended scenes and they are gorier than they are in the film. Possibly it'd be better if they could make it to the final cut but the ratings you know... Anyway you can watch them no matter what.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie its because you've been living under a rock.  This is the story of Forrest Gump, a simple minded man who lives an extraordinary life.  Gump's life basically serves as a story line with which to relive the events of the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  I have yet to hear of anyone didn't love this movie.  A must have for any movie collection.
B000667FN8|1.0|You have got to be kidding... some people actually think these guys are punk rock.  Thats so crazy!.... anyways.. i cant stand this band.. the lyrics are so pointless and its soo poppy, and the guys voice is so whiny, and really quite irritating, Just stop making music all together.  My brother saw them live and he said they just stunk.  Pearl Jam, Audioslave and Incubus make these guys look like a bunch of weeds stuck in the ground with nowhere to go.. its like they are STUCK!...and they cant figure out any other lyrics to write about accept \\" my girlfriend brokeup with me\\".... ahhhhhh....
B0001WANCM|5.0|Baseball movies not only make great sports movies, they also make just Great Movies, period.  If you have any questions about this or think otherwise, then just watch this movie.  It will answer all your questions and doubts.  Costner, Liotta, and Jones are superb in this drama.  A great movie for anyone who likes great movies.
B000000Y2R|5.0|An early (50'S) set of cuts of an obscure concert by a group consisting of Dizzy Gillespie, Charley Parker and Charley Mingus. As an old jazz trumpet player during my miss spent youth, bought this CD to addd to my collection of horn players that keep me company in my dottage, but found Mingus bass work the greatest. Have pased it on to my teenage grandson who has taken up jazz bass - and is pretty good too - he aslo says its \\"awesome\\" and \\"real cool\\". A CD for all ages - at least from 16 to 86.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Think European Vacation, but update and centered around a bunch of college bound kids.  I find myself watching this movie over and over again.  While this movie is a little zaney, it is almost crazy enough to believe.  Filled with tons of laughs and hilarious situations this is a movie for anyone who liked \\"Road Trip,\\" \\"Old School,\\" or \\"Starsky and Hutch.\\"
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I thought this would be scary! It wasn't but that's ok! It was a great movie, though! Obviously it's about this psycho and he has this puppet thingy. This one part a girl is trapped in all this gear and she has to get out of the chair she's trapped in and then her time starts ticking. I think she has one minute. And she has to find the key and it's in this guys stomache so she has to cut him open so u see lots of blood. I did think the puppet was scary!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|How is it that I never heard of this guy until 2 months ago? I love Harry Connick Jr., and so do some girls in my office. One of them forwarded the URL for Michael Buble's website to me, so I visited, and listened to the two songs playing there. I was immediately hooked.<br /><br />Next time I went to Best Buy, I bought this CD. He's smooth, no doubt about it, and he sure can surround himself with a kickin' group of instrumentalists. (Did you see him and his band perform on the Today Show on Aug. 19? Man, those guys were smokin' back there. Great horns!)<br /><br />I didn't so much like \\"Quando,\\" because Nelly's got a great voice but she doesn't have the styling down for this genre so much. She had the pop rifs creeping in here and there, and I don't like the pop scene, so it kind of turned me off.<br /><br />But the rest of the tracks were all great. \\"Save the Last Dance\\" is just so much fun, and I never appreciated the song \\"How Sweet It Is\\" until I heard Michael's rendition of it.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is so soulful, so heartfelt, that you can practically see the guy sitting on a train, in a hotel room, staring out the window, thinking of home and the love that waits for him there. He tells such a powerful story that it visualizes itself for you in your mind as you listen. And isn't that what this art is about? Bringing the story and feelings to life for us? It's masterfully done here.<br /><br />\\"You and I\\" is another powerful song. I don't like sappy stuff, I just cringe at it, yet I was sitting at the computer listening to it through my media library, and when that song came on I just stopped everything. And I started getting teary, I will confess it, though I hate to say it out loud. That's how intense that song was.<br /><br />Michael is an artist in the true sense of the word. This album is so enjoyable, I'm going to get his first one when I go to Best Buy again. And I'm playing \\"It's Time\\" for everyone I can, so they'll buy it, too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is in a Sci-Fi class of it's own. In a 'verse that has no aliens but is just as trecherous as one with, the crew finds themselves in may precarious situations. Josh Whedon has really captured the true meaning of creative imagination. This serries rocks and will be pretty tough to beat.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Here we go with one of the definitive albums of the 70's and one of the top 5 albums of 1978. This is the definitive Blondie album. In the U.K. four of these tracks went on to become singles 'Hanging on the Telephone' a wonderful cover, 'Picture This', 'Sunday Girl' & 'Heart of Glass'. Debbie Harry becomes of course a cultural pop icon for good reason. Nobody was hotter in 1978 (I had the obligatory poster on my bedroom wall to attest to that). It seems a little pointless to leave any kind of in-depth review of this album as I'm sure that anyone who's ever heard of Blondie will be familiar with most of the tracks on this album. Suffice to say that it's one my top 5 fave's of 1978 & at the time of its release was a really exciting album to listen to with one of the best Album Cover's devised. Nothing less than 5 stars for this album will do.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|From the information I have found on various web sites, This version of The Fog will contain a Brand new Hi-Def Transfer taken directly from the original camera negative And baosts a newer Dolby 5.1 audio re-mix. All the special features are the same as on the previous release.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|They would have to hit you with a shovel to be anymore blatant.  This movie lampoons the ridiculousness on BOTH sides of the politcal spectrum...  Its definitely NOT pro-Right and decidedly not favorable to the far Left. <br /> <br />Its anti-Idiot...cause the world is full of 'em. <br /> <br />Also, setting any politcal agenda aside, this movie is worth price of admission for the songs alone.   <br /> <br />Pure Genius!
1931788340|5.0|I only can be happy about the service. The product came faster than expected and the price was low.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite prog album of all times. it rest just besides such classic as: Selling england by the pound or Foxtrot(Genesis), Relayer or Close to the edge(Yes),In the court of the crimson king (King Crimson), Free hand ,In a glass house or Octopus (Gentle giant). It is a masterpiece!
B000059XUI|4.0|It was a good movie for its own time. <br />Right now you can see some movie defects but anyway is a good movie. <br />I just wondering that why Clark can erase Louis memory with a kiss, he's Superman not Gandalf. <br />
B000B8IA2G|5.0|First of all, it was about time for this to come out! I was beginning to think it wasn't going to come out this year. <br /> <br />This is a great series very exciting, great special effects and the writing is by far better than most of SG1's first 2 seasons, sure this is because now the writers team are so familiar with the stargate universe It's easier to go on sci-fi mode for them ( I guess). Also the characters are great sure some need more developing, but hey! its just beginning and there are lots of people in atlantis, my personal favorites are Rodney and Sheppard. <br />I also love the fact that even though the team is in some very serious situations, the series is not horribly heavy to watch but actually has a enjoyable sence of humor and the chemistry between different characters is great. <br />Season 2 is doing awesome! sad is going on mid season break until january =(. <br />but if you buy this you can catch up on season 2 on the reruns if you haven't seen it that is. <br /> <br />Anyway I recommend this new series even though I refused to give it a chance when it was first aired (caught it on re-runs and loved it) Its even great for people who have never seen Sg1. I can't wait to get it and hear the commentaries specially Peter de Luis he cracks me up. <br /> <br />In a nutshell: \\" Great series, lots of action, fun to watch, very exciting beginning, bright future and excellent second season\\"
B000001H3E|5.0|What makes this album so appealing to many is its great  production. This record has the right balance between speed and heaviness. Music is of course great as well, but early Bathory albums have lots of good music too, but their production is not so good. For example, musically I really like UNDER THE SIGN OF THE BLACK MARK but I find it really difficult to listen due to its raw production (which is sounds as an ultimate compliment to the real black metal). But because production on BLOOD FIRE DEATH is so good, you're instantly know that this one is a must have.
B000002MP2|5.0|When I first heard this album I thought: Who the hell are these guys? But after a while, I was having a blast just listening to this album and every song is great on its way. I like Emenius Sleepus, Longview, Coming Clean, Welcome To Paradise and Having A Blast the best and after hours and hours I still don't know why. Anyways, listen this album and live Green Day!
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|Great film, any of the reviewers here will attest to that. But what makes this DVD release very special is a superb Dolby Digital and DTS soundtrack selection. I know of no better film to compare Dolby Digital 5.1, 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1, and DTS 6.1 ES soundtracks on your home theatre. The EX and ES tracks boast a sixth channel for Surround Back speakers (on 6.1 surround receivers), and the film utilizes all these channels to the greatest possible degree of realism, and musical immersion. The title sequence (music) and the Major's climactic battle with the tank sentry (sound effects placement) are scenes that will knock your socks off with a properly set up home installation. Also worth noting is that both Japanese and dubbed English tracks are presented in 5.1 and 6.1 formats.<br /><br />(Be aware that Dolby 5.1 EX features a \\"matrixed\\" sixth channel, that is, it is encoded into the SL and SR channels; Dolby Digital EX receivers will decode the channel and play it through the \\"SB\\" speaker. DTS ES features the sixth channel as a separate channel (\\"Discrete\\") and also matrixed into SL and SR (\\"Matrix\\") for backward compatibility. Suitably equipped receivers will display the soundtrack \\"flag\\" information for both formats, and decode the best option appropriately. For this alone, this DVD makes a nice \\"demo disc\\" to test your home theatre equipment.)
B000001EXR|3.0|KISS had a great sound in the past that was THEIR sound up until Dynasty. At the Dynasty point KISS tries to sound like what is hot at the time, usually a bit late too. For some reason they tried to write disco music when disco was already dying out. Then when they realized that disco sucked they tried to make a 180 and write a heavy Creatures Album. Creatures would have been perfect in 1980 but they were late on the draw again. By the way I love Creatures and Vinnie should be on the cover not Ace. <br />Then the makeup days ended and they tried to sound like Bon Jovi then Poison and whatever was hot. It was good but not great.  <br />Now Carnival Of Souls is them trying to be Metallica. Maybe even Soundgarden. Why? It's not KISS. With Gene it's about money of course. If you watch the KISS Xtream Close Up video you hear KISS dissing on Ace and Peter saying Ace never blossomed ect. (at least Ace didn't want to do The Elder and wanted to Rock!) <br />This is not Blossoming KISS. It's more like copying. Gene and Paul never tried to be original after Alive II and this album proves it. Not bad. But not KISS.
B00005JNSK|1.0|I hated this movie. All of the characters seemed blank and boring (the exception was the boy that played Charlie).And Depp's version of the character seemed like he was on Valium. The movie lacks the magic of the original, bigtime.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|First if all let me point out that this is the first DVD released from Dream Theater. The previous ones were not filmed to be released on dvd.  <br />Having said that I think we all agreethat these guys need no introduction. You may not like their music but you have to respect them as musicians. This budokan show contains great performances as well as excelent audio/video quality. The whole show sums up their whole career up to TRAIN OF THOUGHT. The second disc has little yet interesting information. Right now Im just waiting now for the gigantour dvd to be released which will feature OCATAVARIUM songs and hopefully the Pantera cover Cementery Gates played in honor to Dimebag featuring Dave Mustaine from Megadeth.
0140177396|5.0|Story reduction at its very best.  If it's tough to write a phenomenal novel, this novel `reduction,' all the components reduced to their most basic and delicious levels, is surely a reading piece de resistance.  The prose is effortlessly brilliant, the characters and their relationships works of art, particularly Lenny and George, the main characters.  The descriptions of settings and the way they're used to set mood are mental beacons of clarity and brightness.  The use of foreshadowing, SOMETHING bad is going to happen, causes a most compelling tension in the reader.  In particular, the relationship of George and Lenny, which follows the unstated male rules about explaining or defining relationships between men, needs not an iota more from Steinbeck to be manifestly candid.  Beauty, grace, pleasure, and awe in just over a hundred pages; I am grateful, indeed, to the young man who recommended it to me.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This band, and especially this song is a horrible representation of any kind of punk genre, they are completely sold out and can't play a decent song to save thier lives. This would be where I point out some good and bad things about the product but honestly, I can't find a single positive thing about this song or this band. Greenday is basically the band for any of you preppy children who like to pretend you're tough or emo or whatever, the fad for this band is disgusting and just the fact that people even consider this music demeans the entire concept of music in irredeemable ways. And for all of you who are thinking of defending this p.o.s please make your arguement better than \\"GREENDAY'S AWESOME DAWG, DON'T DISS IT!!\\" or something equally as stupid. Not that I actually believe that if you listen to this and call it music you have enough brainpower to actually make an arguement.<br /><br />I suggest you only listen to this band if you rather enjoy hemmoraging from the brain and dying in a pool of your own blood, or are a prep trying to feel tough (dawg). I suggest those of you who listen to this congealed filth go grow up or solve whatever problem is causing you to need to make up for by listening to a sold-out, prep rock, uncreative, and possibly tone-deaf band. Please gouge my ears out, I'll thank you later.
B000001F9E|4.0|In retrospect, Thin Lizzy can be seen as part of the \\"Irish Invasion,\\" which really wasn't an invasion of hundreds of bands, like the British Invasion, but rather, a continuous stream of first-rate bands, starting with Van Morrison and Them in the sixties, continuing with Thin Lizzy and Taste (featuring Rory Gallagher, who also had a fine solo career and very nearly was a Rolling Stone!), through to U2 and Gary Moore today. (Yes, I know the esteemed Mr. Moore was a member of Thin Lizzy, at least twice, but to answer your unasked question, no, he is not on this album.)  Jailbreak is a concept album that is best appreciated one of two ways: 1. As an oblique, but accurate and effective commentary on the state of Ireland, circa 1976, with plenty of Celtic mythology thrown in for good measure (\\"Warriors, \\"Emerald\\", \\"Fight or Fall\\"); or 2. As a kick-ass collection of hard rockin' anthems, such as \\"Cowboy Song\\", the title track, and, of course, \\"The Boys are Back in Town\\". In any case, Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson roar through tons of top-notch guitar riffs, Brian Downey keeps the beat with both precision and suppleness, and the late, lamented Phil Lynott plays fabulous bass and sings with both passion and lyric intensity. The remaining tracks are solid, and this album is sure to please. Get Jailbreak today, and watch the boys come back to town, and kick some serious butt while they're at it!!!
B0007P3582|3.0|Ok look, this is some good background music. The songs are the same. Every song includes the following.......<br /><br />1. Flute thing playing<br /><br />2  Some random drums<br /><br />3. Him talking/singing the lyrics<br /><br />4 Lyric are ALWAYS are about sex, just because its about sex, does not make it good.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Wow, after seeing the prices this set is being sold for now that it's out of print, I'm so happy I got this when it originally was released!  I've watched this set so many times, and it's always wonderful.  These DVD's of TV programs are great--particularly since most of TV is now crap and filled with reality programming.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Whats he doing out there?  'He's whittling on a piece of wood'.  I saw this film in the theatre in 69 when I was 11. I knew of fonda and bronson and went for that reason. I did know that Sergio Leone was the director and of his past 3 films.  But this one was different.  I now amuzingly call it Once upon a time we all waited and stared.  That is the beauty of it, Sergio was not afraid to take his time.  Way more than a spaghetti, it is a tale for all time. 'Time sure flys\\", 50-100 years from now this film will not be forgotten, it will stand the test of time. <br />The dvd is very fine, and long awaited.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album rocks! Linkin Park is one of the best bands of all time, and this CD has some of there best songs ever to be recorded. Here are those songs, with ratings ranging from pathetic to my favorite. <br /> <br />1. Foreward-N/A <br /> <br />2. Don't Stay-I like the song all right <br /> <br />3. Somewhere I Belong-I think it's an awesome song <br /> <br />4. Lying From You-It certainly is a pretty good song <br /> <br />5. Hit the Floor-It ranks up there as a good song <br /> <br />6. Easier to Run-Very close to being a great song <br /> <br />7. Faint-This song is OK, but not the very best <br /> <br />8. Figure .09-A wondrous song to the core <br /> <br />9. Breaking the Habit-The second best Linkin Park song ever made <br /> <br />10. From the Inside-This song rocks. End of rating <br /> <br />11. Nobody's Listening-Pretty good song. I like it <br /> <br />12. Session-This song is pathetic. The worst on the whole album <br /> <br />13. Numb-My # 1 favorite Linkin Park song of all time. It rules <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great CD, and the voice of the lead singer, the hard rock beat of the drums, guitars, and of course pianos, the cool tunes and the humongous noise will keep all fans of today's music on the edge of their seats. I recommend this album to anyone who likes hard rock band music. It's well worth $15.00.
0440237688|5.0|I have just reread this book with my daughter and I still can't believe how amazing it is.  The Giver always reminds me of the John  Lennon song \\"Imagine\\".  It is an entire book written about what it    is like to live in a utopian society.  On the outside it is perfect but this book is about the dark reality of perfection.  I could not put it down.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have always loved the music.  Saw it in L.A. and also a Broadway touring group locally.  I was not disappointed with the movie.  Music absolutely wonderful.  This is one I will watch over and over.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I listened to this on a kids cd player and was so amazed i got it myself....American Idiot is a bad song in many ways and has nothing to do with the othger songs.  Letterbomb and Extraordinary girl are not really good.  Whatsername and Boulevard are really good songs.  BY far the best song on this cd is Holiday which is hilarious but really nice.
B0007OCG56|1.0|I love Adam Sandler usually.  He doesn't have to star in a comedy for me to like him, in fact I was looking forward to seeing him in a drama.  But this was so long and so boring and so disappointing.  I think he did a fine job, but needs a better movie to be in (and cut his hair)
B000002H2H|5.0|As said before the theme of this Metallica album is Death....that is one of the reasons i got it in the first place.  All of the songs are really well made, and this album is what made me a Metallica fan.  My favorite song is Creeping Death.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|After the excitment of Train of Thought and the awesome DVD Live At Budokan, Dream Theater gave me the impression that they were going to take it in an even more metal direction with the next release. That's not how it went. <br />Anyway, more about that later. This is a good release, with some excellent work, but just doesn't live up to anything since Falling Into Infinity (and certainly doesn't live up to the two before that.) Some songs are great, Octavarium shows where they could head next, and some songs are mediocre, borderline 'bad' by Dream Theater standards of course. <br />The Root of All Evil is a great heavy track, which continues the story of The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul, both absolute classics of this band. A little less heavy, but not by much. An excellent rocking song with reprises from the previous parts and a very good piano ending. 2nd best.  <br />With The Answer Lies Within, it gets mediocre. This is an OK ballad. Along the lines of the mediocre ballads from Falling Into Infinity like Anna Lee or Take Away My Pain. Some good piano work, but the lyrics are lame and the song just isn't nearly as deep or emotional as DT's great ballads like Another Day, Space-Dye Vest, or anything from Scenes from a Memory. Probably the worst here. <br />These Walls is a pretty good one. I imagine it will grow on me. Not magnificent, but good nonetheless. <br />I Walk Beside You is not so good. Boring, uninspired, and commerial friendly. Whatever. Falling into Infinity had \\"You Not Me.\\" Comparisons have been made to U2. 2nd worst song here. <br />Panic Attack is where it gets better. Some think this is a great, incredible song, but to be honest it's not as good as the good stuff on Train of Thought, its just better than some of the other stuff here. Kind of in the Train of Thought style. Has some great instrumental parts. 3rd best. <br />Never Enough is a pretty good one, a little better than These Walls. Heavier than I Walk Beside You, but still a tad bland by DT's high standards. Good, but not remarkable. <br />Sacrifised Sons is the one I still need to give more listens to. The beginning is kind of lame, but once it picks up it gets quite good. However, the 9/11 lyrics are kind of a lame turnoff. Well, its definitely not even close to as bad as \\"When the Eagle Cries,\\" another lame 9/11 song by a great band. However, I am not sure what to make of some of the lyrics. I can't tell if its normal praising of US troops, sarcastic criticism of religious fundementalists, or a clever commentary on both. If its the last one of those, then this song is strong lyrically. Eventually I'll find out the motive of this in an interview or something. <br />Now for the big one, the 24 minute title track. The best one on the album. It's also something new for Dream Theater. This has a strong 70s prog influence, but the influences also range all over the place. It has a wierd, long, cool intro, and the various sections are all great. Then when it gets serious you hear the main theme recurr (you heard it sort of hidden in earlier songs like Answer Lies Within) and then it eventually gets really dramatic and the orchestra comes in. This song is impossible to describe, and has to be heard to be understood. This is quite an amazing song, and about the first 2 times you hear it it'll go WAY over your head. This definiteyl requires multiple listens. Best one on the record. <br />Anyway, what I think of the album as a whole: A strong release with some good stuff, some bad, some mediocre. But overall, a bit of a disappointment. All of DT's albums are different and their history is fascinating. But talk to me about that in a message board. I thought this album would be a hard-hitting, heavy variation of the Train of Thought style, and it was pretty much nothing like it. Some stuff was great. There would only be 2 I'd out on a DT best of though.  <br />I think this album may be sort of a period of transition. Some of the commerically appealing filler tracks may hint at a commercial attempt, which was evidently aborted. DT will never be mainstream in the US obviously, they are far too intellegent musically for mainstream american listeners. There is also some of the heavy, technical progressive metal left over of the Train of Thought persuation (although not as good.) There is also, most intriguingly, a potential new direction for the band's next album, the emotionally deep progressive rock style of Octavarium, more along the lines of 70s stuff even Pink Floyd, or some newer prog rock bands like Spock's Beard or Transatlantic (which mike portnoy is in.) <br />After seeing them twice on Gigantour, they may also try to expand their fanbase on the growing young american metal audience, which would lean their next record more of a Train of Thought style. You never know what to expect from these guys, which is what I respect and love about them so much. <br />My DT album order (reviews for the rest coming soon) <br />1)Metropolis Part 2:Scenes from a Memory (1999) <br />2)Images and Words (1992) <br />3)Awake (1994) <br />4)Train of Thought (2003) <br />5)Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) <br />6)Octavarium (2005) <br />7)Falling Into Infinity (1997) <br />8)When Dream and Day Unite (1989)
B00004RF8J|4.0|This is my eight-year-old's current all time favorite movie in the world. He (and I) particularly like Ellen Green (Audrey) and, of course, the giant person-eating talking plant is always a hit. Of note, this is a kinder, gentler version of the musical (and original movie), a change that I don't particularly care for. However, the \\"happy\\" ending may make some people more comfortable.

B00005JM02|5.0|As we have seen Disney and Pixar's deal together has led to a good batch of Blockbuster's and Finding Nemo ios no different. <br /> <br />13 Finding Nemo Walt Disney/Pixar $339,714,978 the 13 is this is the 13th highest grossing movie of all time.  One of Disney's highest ever grossing films.   <br /> <br />The movie is likeable for kids as well as adults.  The animation is great. Movie is better than SharkTale which was DreamWorks answer to Finding Nemo hoever they failed compared to Finding Nemo.  Finding Nemo has a great story and out of the Pixar movies to me is 2nd favorite of mine behind Toy Story which to me is still the best Pixar film.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|THE BROWN BUNNY is full of emotion.  The slow pace sometimes harms the movie.  But at times, the snail's pace lets the viewer absorb what is happening and digest it, letting the emotion of the movie bloom in full. <br /> <br />The movie works best as a road trip film.  I enjoyed going across the country with Vincent in his van. <br /> <br />When it came time for various characters to sit around talking to each other, I started to tune out.  None of the characters were nearly as interesting as the American landscape as seen from Vincent's van windows.  Yet the only dialog scene that brought the movie to a dead stop was the scene with the grandparents (and the title bunny).  It actually took awhile for me to get back into the movie after an eternity of sitting around the kitchen table with these elderly people who had nothing to say.  I wish this scene had been cut out entirely, or at least trimmed to a quarter of it's current length. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the interaction with Daisy at the end of the movie.  And the controversial oral sex scene did not disrupt the film for me... it just seemed like what those two characters would do at that point in the story.  It did not de-rail the film and it was refreshingly honest. <br /> <br />Though not really pulled off with a lot of filmmaking expertise, I did like what the final (flashback) scenes of THE BROWN BUNNY were trying to say. <br /> <br />Gallo's DIY filmmaking is wonderfully daring, but I wish he would let others in on the process from time to time.  I appreciate the freedom he has as an artist, but perhaps surrounding himself with more crew would add more quality to his film.  It is hard to get past the many out-of-focus and poorly framed shots in THE BROWN BUNNY. <br /> <br />Overall, THE BROWN BUNNY is not great cinema... but it is worth a look if you are open-minded. <br /> <br />
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I grew up on Batman and I am a huge Prince fan. So with that said, I will purchase this DVD along with Returns, Forever and Begins (Hated Batman & Robin). I have the first edition DVD of Batman and I was disappointed with the picture quality and the lack of any special features. Another bonus is the incredible Prince videos from the double-platinum soundtrack. Batman is one of my favorite movies so October 18th is marked on my calendar.
0385720920|5.0|Choke is my first encounter with Palahniuk. I read some of these reviews, and to my surprise, they are quite negative. I realize that most of these reviews are negative because they are aware of what else Palahniuk can do, and know that he can and has done better. However, on my side, I can't exactly take these criticisms to heart due to only having read, well, one. This one, nonetheless.     Sure, I've heard about the fandom of Fight Club and everything it entails, which is exactly why I chose against it as my first Chuck Palahniuk. I read the quick summaries of each of his works (knowing well that these summaries usually cover the tippest tip of the iceburg), and Choke stood out to me. The cover art also caught my eye.    Reading this has been one of the single most enjoyable moments of my life. It's also been the first time I have kept coming back to the book for more; excited and fascinated and worried and aroused and stressed and confused and burning!!!!!! It's the first book that has made me laugh. None of that chuckle/half smile crap, I mean a laugh that comes from the bottom of my gut. Boisterous.     The style in which he writes is much the style I speak. With a few exceptions here and there, I could relate myself to each and every character. And you know what? I cared at the end. To a mighty extent. This book answered strange questions I had and reiterated those I already had a whit about, in a fashion I have never seen before.     I finished Choke 3 nights ago. Last night I started LULLABY... but I will put it away for maybe a week more or two. Choke is still very much in my mind and is clouding my view of these new characters and new situations.
B000957O82|5.0|This was surprisingly good. I generally don't like romances. Unless they're funny and not too syruppy. This certainly fit the bill. Gut-breaking funny at points, sad, sincere, optimistic. Not to mention great acting. Not just a date flick, but a fun laid-back movie. Give it a try.
B00004XOWM|5.0|now this is more like it! whatever limp bizkit were eating/drinking/smoking/looking at when they wrote this album sould be made available for all artists, for whatever they did, it worked! this album is best described as the 'golden album of nu-metal' and should be in any rock fan's collection who has any respect for the short-lived nu metal craze of the millenium. Even if you dont fit this description and you are looking to expand your horizons, do it here! It contains the classics 'My Way', 'My Generation', 'Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) and 'Boiler'.  even the other less-known songs are so catchy, i'll be surprised if they dont stick in your head for years to come.
1401206905|5.0|I used to be a major Spider-Man fan, but I started to feel a need for a different hero. Spider-Man was awesome except I wanted something more gritty, something with a darker persona something that was about a hero but at the same time a hero that was broken inside. That hero is Batman. <br /> Everytime Miller writes a Batman comic it surpasses all known works ever done about the dark knight and the is especially true here. This comic is worth every penny and should be bought by anyone interseted in batman or super-heroes in general. This tells one of if not the greatest stories in comic history and I highly reccomend it.
B000001Y42|1.0|Limp Bizkit...some people will tell you you'll either love them or hate them. I'm one of the people stuck in the middle, and not everything Fred and co throw out is for everyone - this is a perfect example of such music. Very weak tracks (apart from the club classic 'Faith') and certinally not the best way for a wide-ranged rock or rap fan to view limp bizkit. Stick to Chocolate Starfish And The Hot-Dog Flavoured Water - a rap/rock classic!
B000002JA8|5.0|As if emerging from a swanky beach house, The Boys hit a smooth and consistently rich stride on their sixth album. \\"Discoteca\\" and \\"Single\\" accompany a sophisticated pleasure traveler with Spanish rhythm, \\"Metamorphosis\\" recapitulates an introverted man's growing up, while the beautiful \\"It Always Comes As A Surprise\\" seems to capture the northerner's amazement at his first night in tropical paradise.  The self-referential \\"Electricity\\" and proud stances of \\"Up Against It\\" and \\"To Step Aside\\" show an artistry and intellectual cleverness that never falls out of rhythm, while \\"Se A Vida E,\\" \\"Before,\\" and \\"Saturday Night\\" celebrate sweetness in life without running aground, as happy anthems so often do, on shallow bromides, cliches, or repetitiveness. The Pet Shop Boys have given us a library of fine albums, and often, even finer remixes, and this inventive and pleasurable album perhaps shows them at their best so far.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed Peter Gabriel's music, but I never really went so far as to buy many of his albums.  Truth be told, I fancied the tracks I heard from Peter on the radio, but I was always hesitant to buy his albums because I thought they'd be a little too odd for my liking.  The exception to all of this was Peter's 1986 album, So, which I bought and loved and played incessantly - as with my most cherished albums, I owned that one on cassette and vinyl back in the 80's.      So was my only LP exposure to Peter Gabriel until about three years ago, when I was reading about a forthcoming album, Up, that took Peter 10 years to make.  Intrigued by what I read about this disc, I bought it when it hit the market and was rewarded with an hour of OUTSTANDING music.  Up was unlike anything I was hearing anywhere at the time, and like the other PG album I had owned 17 years prior, I found myself playing Up over and over and over again, discovering melodies, lyrics, sounds, and harmonies that resonated with me on a multitude of levels.  (I wrote an Amazon review on Up, if you're interested...)    My love for Up spawned a desire to buy another copy of So, this time on CD.  When I went to buy my third version of that album,  I was delighted to find this two-disc compilation of Peter Gabriel's work spanning across his entire career and including all those older hits that I never owned because I was afraid I'd dislike everything else on those older albums.  Here are digitally remastered recordings of classic PG tunes, such as \\"Solsbury Hill,\\" \\"Shock the Monkey,\\" \\"Games Without Frontiers,\\" and \\"Biko;\\" a number of beloved tracks from that old 1986 album I know so well; some great tracks off of Up; and many other amazing songs I'd never heard before from albums I never owned.  Twenty-nine songs (count em, 29!) fill this two-disc set, and as I sit and listen, I just marvel at Peter Gabriel's gift.  The man is a true prodigy, an incredible musician, one who hasclearly emphasized his art over commercialism but has received worldwide acclaim in the process.  This album contains a new song, \\"Cloudless,\\" which is an appealing variation off of Up's \\"Sky Blue,\\" building off that tune's memorable choral chant.      Hit offers an abundant sampling of Peter Gabriel's music.  These tunes are intense, sophisiticated, challenging, and rewarding.  Having been more exposed to Peter Gabriel's work through this compilation, my prior hesitations are gone, and I'm eager to go back in time and buy some of Peter's earlier releases.  I highly recommend this album if you are like I was, someone who enjoyed Peter Gabriel's music in the past but wasn't 100% convinced as a devoted fan.  Hit will change all that; you'll love this album and acquire a great appreciation for the magnitude of the music this man has created over the course of his career.
0596007124|5.0|Absolutely fantastic and funny introduction into design patterns. It details only the more commonly used patterns from the GoF book, so don't expect to read about new patterns. It focuses more on deep understanding of the discussed patterns, how you can detect a possible pattern in your business requirements and how to choose the most appropriate one. The style of the book makes it very easy to read. It contains also quizzes and questions to check if you understood the subject.  <br />The sample code in the book is written in Java, but if are a C# or VB.Net programmer, you will be able to understand them quite easily. <br />I recommend to everybody from beginner to intermediate level into design patterns. I wish they had more of these types of books in the schools in any classes.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|First off, yes, I am a fan of Tim Burton. I even own every one of his movies on DVD (though one or two of them I could live without). But that's not the point. The fact is, I respect his vision as an artist; and his ability to create such surrealistic worlds that are both weird and wonderful are just enough why I idolize him.     Okay, now, some of you may wonder, if this is a direct remake of the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory that starred Gene Wilder. Actually, no, even though it's the same story concept. The only difference is that this film pays more homage to the book (MUCH more homage) and is (of course) AMAZING to look at. The storyline now, is simple enough (because I'm under the impression that a lot of people have seen the original film): Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a boy from an impoverished family living under the shadow of a giant chocolate factory, who eventually wins a candy bar contest and is given a tour, along with four other children, of the amazing factory run by the eccentric Willy Wonka and his staff of Oompa-Loompas.    Performance wise, this movie belongs to Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore, who are able to recreate their chemistry from Finding Neverland. However, quote: \\"Depp's Wonka is far less cuddly than that of Gene Wilder, playing it more like a demented Mr. Rogers with more than a bit of a sadistic streak. The way that he watches the kids meet their fates with giddy glee is quite disturbing, but it's hard not to enjoy this quirky hermit's complete lack of social skills.\\"-Edward Douglas, [...] (sorry, but the guy explianed it perfectly)Also, I'd like to clear this up out of my system before it does any more damage, but it seems A LOT of ....people are comparing Depp's Wonka w/ a certain pop star so much that it really just sickens me. This assessment can be contradicted however. First reason (and this came from no other than Depp himself): In an interview, Johnny said he had NO INTENTION whatsoever to base hischaracter off of Micheal Jackson. Second reason: Willy Wonka is a recluse, so he's supposed to be strange, weird, crazy, whatever. I mean, the guy shunned himself from society for 15 years so he's going to be pale, out of style/trend, and a bit behind. Also, throughout the movie, we're shown flashbacks of Wonka's past that are used to explain his weirdness. There, end of story. Freddie Highmore's Charlie is more sad than the original one, so much that you'll want to hug him b/c he's so optimistic depsite living such an impoverished lifestyle. Another performance nod goes to Deep Roy, who plays all the Oompa-Loompas w/ such panache. Everyone else is respectable in their performances.    Now, aesthetically, this film is amazing; in fact, this is Burton's most visually striking film to date. He yet again creates such surreal and imaginative landscapes that it's just real eye candy to look at; the factory rooms being the prime example. Some of the wacky machinery used to create candy is just as impressive and actually looks like it could work. Yet, as w/ the original film, this film creates an atmosphere that could unnerve sensitive folks. The boat ride down the chocolate tunnel is not the acid trip that was the original, but rather like an intense roller coaster ride. Also, for those who have seen the original, the four kids who fall to their weaknesses (loosely speaking: gluttony, pride, avarice(that's greed) and sloth) and punished for not heeding warnings are a bit more dangerous (thanks to the evolution of filmmaking) and look fatal, but are not.     Also, another treat in this film is to hear composer Danny Elfman (who has composed pretty much all of Tim Burton's films to date save for Ed Wood, which was scored by Howard Shore) sing again. He sings all the Oompa-Loompa songs provided by the lyrics written in the book with such style that you can't help but tap your feet. For the record, he also sung in Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.    Well, I believe I covered over everything. Overall, real faithful adaptation that surpasses the original in practically every way (sorry, but...my opinion). Also, the ending is different, both from the book and the original film; but still good. This is also Burton's best film next to Ed Wood and redeems him from his Planet of the Apes remake (what was he thinking w/ that?). Anyways, great film: just as wacky and twisted as you might expect but nonetheless wonderful to look at and as magical as the original.
B00003003R|4.0|The Live! That's right! THe lIVe album! Ain't it fun when you went down to Best Buy and bought the GnR live album and then laughed at all the losers who had to get the 'Clean' version? and Ain't it fun when you turned up the car radio full blast on the guitar solo on Paradise City. Ain't it fun when Axl told the audience to take a step back and then pulled off the ultimate jynx: the bass line to It's So Easy. Why then did I give this a 4? There's not nearly enough Use Your Illusion songs on this set, they're either mostly Appetite or Lies. It's cool that they included GNR epic classics November Rain and Estranged, but no Breakdown? Where's Get in the Ring Motherf#$$%er!? THose answers remain to be seen.<br />I've already described my ranking system a million times already, if you want to know just read another friggn review!<br />Best to Worst: Guns n' Roses<br />1.Use Your Illusion II<br />2.Use Your Illusion I<br />3.Appetite for Destruction<br />4.Live Era: 87-93<br />5.GnR Lies<br />6.The Spaghetti Incident?<br />Dont get the Greatest Hits collection, you are better off just buying all six of these.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Now I am a big fan of Slim Shady Lp, and Marshal Mathers Lp.I was very disapointed in encore cause it just wasnt Eminem in my opinion, its what he thinks people will enjoy, but thats not exacly true.I thought Slim Shady wasn't coming back but this shows he is. If your a fan of Devils Night (this cd is not as good as devils not but still great) you should definitely get this then cause this is very very good and very hardcore. Bizzarre is my favorite cause he is the most lyrical and controversal.Eminem has done a good production job on this. And if your like me and you want slim shady to come back, you will for sure like this record, RIP BUGZ.
B000000OQY|5.0|(...)<br />That's Axl's trademark yell for those of you wondering why there is a very long projecture of joy on my review. It is joyous because unlike what the official reviewers say this album is still Guns n' Roses. After all, the worst Guns n' Roses song is still better than the best Aerosmith or Kiss song (not that they're bad, its just GNR is so friggn' good!). Here is my track-by-track analysis:<br /><br />1.Reckless Life: Whoa! This almost sounds like Ac/Dc mixed in with a little bit of Motorhead! Pure awesomeness! GNR actually wrote this song! Who do you like em nuts, Wallise?! 10/10<br /><br />2.Nice Boys: Perty good. Although it took me awhile to figure out what they were saying, still pretty good. Aw, hell! I'll have to give it a 9.<br /><br />3.Move to the City: Great music setup, and I love Axl's rhyme and grind! If he comes up with any more witicisms, he'll turn into friggn' Bon Scott, with strawberry hair of course! 10/10<br /><br />4.Mama Kin: Hey! Speaking of Aerosmith, here is a cover! Righteous, I never knew that Axl could pull off a perfect Tyler voice, and by the gods he did it! 10 points for effort and 15 for pulling off the Tyler tone!<br /><br />5.Patience: A true GnR classic. I play it all the time when I pick up my girl for Friday night dates, she loves it. It is good to know that your signficant other has good musical taste and I thank you much GNR!! (Maybe I can propose to her with November Rain)! 20/10<br /><br />6.Used to Love Her: I don't see why this is so controversial. Of course he sings about killing his girl and burying her in the backyard, my big question is: why aren't these critics laughing to death?! THe joke is the song. Actually the REAL question is why didn't he cremate her? 11/10<br /><br />7.You're Crazy: The better acoustic version of Appetite's You're Crazy. THis one sounds crazier too, if ya know what I mean! 15/10<br /><br />8.One in a Million: I know that Axl is a racist, queer-hatin b$#%$rd, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Not that I'm any of those things but yeah you get the picture. This song is actually about the Greyhound buses that GnR members used alot of times to travel to new areas to form bands. A great classy melodorama. 15/10<br /><br />Rock n' Roll Roses!<br />Guns n' Roses best to worst:<br />1.Use Your Illusion II<br />2.Use Your Illusion I<br />3.Appetite for Destruction<br />4.Live Era: 87-93<br />5.GnR Lies<br />6.THe Spaghetti Incident?picture. This song is actually about the Greyhound buses that GnR members used alot of times to travel to new areas to form bands. A great classy melodorama. 15/10    Rock n' Roll Roses!

B00005JODA|4.0|Haunting and moving tale of passion and corruption is made even better by the inspirational performance of Rachel Weisz, who not only steals the movie away from the always great Ralph Fiennes but makes this the performance to watch for come Oscar time. She's just a raw acting powerhouse in this film and she propels this movie into the stratosphere with her performance. Ralph Fiennes gives a great performance as well and his emotional and solid performance that compliments Weisz in every way. She and Fiennes give this movie an emotional core that is solid and golden and makes this one of the best films of the year.  <br /> <br />4 stars all the way. <br />
B000002B7U|5.0|First off, before the review this album is only available through import because appartently Ozzy 'doesn't like it'. What about the fans you stoned over boozed down stupid old man?! This album is great and you are friggn dumb for pulling it off shelves! If I could see you face to face I would spit on it. But you are not here so I will write my own friggn review in protest. Now onto what really matters:<br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.The Ultimate Sin: Great drum intro by Randy Castillo, which by the way is the first Ozzy album he appears on. Also I like Jake's solo, it is like Van Halen with a blues influence. 10/10<br />2.Secret Loser: A really underated song, I was surprised when this didn't become the hit. I remember being really to'd when a week after I bought this they weren't playing it on the radio. Keep in mind this was in 1986, not today. Great use of speed rock  that will later be used throughout the album and in NRFTW. 11/10<br />3.Never Know Why: Now this is what fans were talking about when they complained about Ozzy going hair metal. \\"We rock, rock, rock!\\" The guitar is still good and so is the drum beat. overall, a pretty dern good song. 9/10<br />4.Thank God for the Bomb: In my mind one of the overated hits off the album. Seems to pop and hair influenced for the Ozz. 8/10<br />5.Never: THis song kind of sounds like old Ozzy, which is good since the last album BATM left a bad mark for the Ozz. Thank goodness Ozzy wasn't the only one who wrote the music and finally let Bob Daisley write some of it.<br />6.Lightning Strikes: One of the Ozz's hair metal tracks, it is actually really good. Lee's solo is a little Crazy Train influenced but probably one of the best on this record. 10/10<br />7.Killer of Giants: Great power ballad. Probably Ozzy's greatest since Diary of a Madman. Lee's greatest solo is in this song. 11/10<br />8.Fool Like You: A little Bon Jovi inspired, but still great. It is one of the three closers that make this song all the more worthwhile purchasing. Lee's solos are on the scale of awesomeness throughout.<br />9.Shot in the Dark: THe reason why Ozzy doesn't like this album, which is weird. It is definitely one of his best and the awesome bass and guitar riffs make it worthwhile to listen to. One thing he did get right was that the JSO version is better. 10/10<br /><br />Ozzys album best to worst:<br />1.Randy Rhoads Tribute<br />2.Diary of a Madman<br />3.Blizzard of Ozz<br />4.No Rest for the Wicked<br />5.No More Tears<br />6.The Ultimate Sin<br />7.Just say Ozzy<br />8.Live and Loud<br />9.Speak of the Devil<br />10.Bark at the Moon<br />11.Ozzmosis<br />Anything after Ozzmosis is not worth mentioningscale of awesomeness throughout.  9.Shot in the Dark: THe reason why Ozzy doesn't like this album, which is weird. It is definitely one of his best and the awesome bass and guitar riffs make it worthwhile to listen to. One thing he did get right was that the JSO version is better. 10/10    Ozzys album best to worst:  1.Randy Rhoads Tribute  2.Diary of a Madman  3.Blizzard of Ozz  4.No Rest for the Wicked  5.No More Tears  6.The Ultimate Sin  7.Just say Ozzy  8.Live and Loud  9.Speak of the Devil  10.Bark at the Moon  11.Ozzmosis  Anything after Ozzmosis is not worth mentioning
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the musical in San Francisco in August and was blown away. I wasn't that excited about seeing Wicked, as The Wizard of Oz was never one of my favorite stories/movies. But Eden Espinosa, who played Elpheba in the San Francisco production, was outstanding. She has an unbelievable voice. After she sang \\"The Wizard and I,\\" I wanted to stand up and cheer; she was that good. At the end of \\"Defying Gravity,\\" I DID stand up and cheer--nothing could have kept me in my seat! I've seen many musicals, and I've rarely been as moved and impressed by such a talent.<br /><br />The first half of the show was awesome. \\"The Wizard and I\\"--rousing and inspiring. \\"Popular\\"--an instant comic classic; hysterical perfection. \\"Defying Gravity,\\" knock your socks off, chills down your spine powerful. Unfortunately, the show fizzled a little in the second half. Too many slow songs. But we bought the CD and have been playing in practically nonstop ever since, and I've come to love nearly all the songs. Although the singing on the CD is top-notch, I honestly feel that the voices we heard at the show in S.F. were better! It was that good.<br /><br />As far as the story line of the musical, I was expecting a much \\"fluffier\\" plot and was impressed by how many sophisticated messages were woven into the musical. From the cruel reality of the \\"pecking order\\" of adolescent peers, the power (and danger) of spin doctoring, to the repression of minorities (animals), and more, this show packs a whollop.<br /><br />Definitely buy this CD, see the musical if you possibly can, and then go buy the book, as I did. I can't wait to read the whole \\"behind the scenes\\" story . . .
B00005LSYZ|5.0|You won't friggn believe this!: The other day I was shopping at Best Buy and guess what I found with the Ozzy cd's?  That's right! An import of the Ultimate friggn' Sin!!! Before I couldn't even find this album in a Vintage Stock store, but now there are copies in Best Buy?! TIFR!!!! Being an import, the album is kind of expensive ($18.93, WTF! No Rest for the Wicked only cost $11.99!) but better get it while it is accessible. This album is a testament of the awesomeness fo the 80's metal scene, buy it now before they run out!
