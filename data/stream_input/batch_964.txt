B002SJIO5E|4.0|Unlike many Sc-Fi/Fantasy movies of recent years, District 9 does not rely solely on CGI to carry the movie. I admit that going into it, I was expecting another Men in Black-type flick. But this one has a compelling story to go along with the special effects, and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth taking a look at!
B000B0WODA|2.0|2 1/2        Typical sophomore from the type of indie group unable to  deliver on any over-hyped promise to begin with, FF play it safe and in effect are still able to coast by on the small amount of talent they do have.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This work warrants two parts to its review. First, the documentary. It is extremely well-done and very informative. It will show you places that you did not realize existed on Earth, and it will show you animals equally exotic. From the strange to the beautiful, Planet Earth can teach you about our natural world very effectively.  Perhaps more important is the video. This is THE definitive Blu-Ray work in my collection. In fact, if I want to show off what HD can accomplish to non-believers, I bring out Planet Earth. It will wow you just as much as the exotic locations do. I do not know how they mastered it so well, but it is completely worth the extra money for BluRay. An amazing transfer to video.

B002XZ62HK|5.0|What more can you say about Celtic Woman?  They are all beautiful, talented women who sing like angels.  Their voices are beautiful separately and blend together perfectly.  They also have class to go with their beauty, they are a breath of fresh air when one compares them to the Britneys or Lady Gagas of today's show business.  As stated by others, this deluxe CD includes live versions of \\"The Call\\" and the finale, seen on the DVD of this concert.  It also includes Alex's \\"You'll Be In My Heart,\\" not seen on the DVD.  The calendar that it comes with features some very nice pictures from the show.  I had the pleasure of meeting all the members of Celtic Woman in person last Wednesday night at Borders Books in New York City.  They are as sweet and as beautiful in person as they are on the DVDs.  I was so excited at meeting them, especially Lisa (my favorite) that I have almost completely blacked out on what I said to them.  They seemed truly happy to meet their fans.  Now I am looking forward to seeing them Feb. 27th at Radio City Music Hall.  What more can I say?  They are truly fantasic and I highly recommend this CD and DVD (as well as their others, especially the Slane Castle concert.)

B000W4KSVA|3.0|On this 1962 record, his second for Impulse, John Coltrane assembled a collection of ballads that might counter the stereotype that he was an \\"angry young tenor\\" capable only of blowing his sax furiously. He is joined by the other members of his great early '60s quartet: bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones. The eight tracks here are all old tunes popular among jazzmen, such as Phil Silvers' \\"Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\\" and Altman and Lawrence's \\"All or Nothing at All\\".<br /><br />The performances here are impeccable. This is one of the great jazz groups of all time. But BALLADS is a fairly minor entry in the Coltrane discography. The format doesn't allow any of the players to solo to the same degree as elsewhere. Now, at this time in his career, Coltrane's music was expanding to visionary heights, and it's entirely appropriate that later album titles had to employ outer space metaphors. Sure, we get some nice touches like Jones' deft opening on \\"All or Nothing at All\\", but everyone seems hobbled, Coltrane most of all. Pick this one up after the other Impulse releases.

0316017922|4.0|In \\"Outliers\\", Malcolm Gladwell presents the case that success is due, in large part, to hard work and small, cumulative advantages. For example, it typically takes 10,000 hours of applied effort for anyone to become an expert in any field of endeavor. Gladwell presents some interesting statistics and many anecdotal examples of how talent and luck play a role in success. But without hard work, talent and luck are insufficient for success. He also describes examples of how common systems of recognizing, developing or rewarding talent have inherent biases that often fail to advance true talent.    The \\"rags to riches\\" storyline is popular in American culture; it reflects our belief that, through hard work, anyone can lift themselves from their current circumstances into better circumstances. Horatio Alger, Jr. popularized such stories in the 19th century. Modern popular culture sees exceptionally gifted or successful people and often attributes their success to inherent talent or simply luck as if they are outliers, i.e. not normal.    Gladwell asserts that hard work and persistence, which create small, cumulative advantages, are the primary factors leading to success. \\"Outliers\\" is an easy and engaging casual read that reinforces the American belief that anyone can achieve most anything if they're willing to work hard enough for it. Success is when preparation meets opportunity. Gladwell got this one right.
0552552127|5.0|I have slowly grown to love this series more and more. It is  an incredible world entirely created by the author and the only thing that has upset me is that i have no idea when the final book will be finished and publish. last time i checked, it didn't even have a title yet! Great read!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for myself because it was on sale. It's the complete set with a bonus disc at the end. The book it comes in is very cool--pink and fuzzy to the touch. When you open it up, there are pages of the actresses inside along with your discs.<br /><br />Very fun. Very good shows! I highly recommend this to anybody who likes Sex and the City already or to anyone who wants a laugh. I'd never seen the seasons before I bought this. I'm very happy with my purchase.

B0002I831S|5.0|I gave this DVD set to my brother for Christmas a few years ago and now that he has Blu-Ray, it was re-gifted.  It was wonderful to revisit this show and experience the excitement of Star Trek.  I was little when the show came out and I used to lay on my father's stomach while he sat in his reclining chair.  Later when I was older, I used to watch the reruns every day at 5 p.m. before dinner.  Star Trek looks great on DVD and the show was restored nicely.  The first season is definitely Star Trek's best season and contains the bulk of its classic shows such as The City on the Edge of Forever.  Yeoman Janice is on hand in the first episodes and she was one of my favorite characters.  The Menagerie is still my favorite episode in two parts.  A wonderful show.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|When I saw this in the theater, I wasn't expecting much, but by the time it was over, I was blown away. Great special effects, great characters (especially the little alien) and a great story (apartheid). The way it ended means the obvious sequel should be killer. The people behind this movie showed Hollywood how it can be done without spending $300 million, rehashing old ideas and lame concepts. If you have any interest in sci-fi at all, you'll love it. The finger nail sequence was disturbing!

B0030EWB96|5.0|I bought this album after listening to it on [...]   Personally, I love it.  I am not a huge fan of what I call 'unstructured' music, but I find this music brings just enough structure to make it work for me.  Meaning there is an underlying structured beat or rhythm to most of it that I really enjoy, while still retaining that chaotic jazz feel, if that makes any sense.  I am listening as I type through my surround sound system.  Her Pachelbel's Canon track is really unique.

B0012GN0JE|2.0|After a long run of classic rock guitar albums, Jeff Beck returned in 1985 with the Nile Rodgers produced Flash, an apparent attempt to create an MTV-friendly 80's hit record. In that regard, the album was a considerable success, charting in the American top 20 and going gold within months of its release; it even had the dubious distinction of winning a grammy award. But the album is completely awash in drum machines and synthesizers, making it sound dated (in the worst sense of the word) about five minutes after it came out. Some would argue that the brilliance of Beck's guitar playing slices through all the mechanized production, particularly on a song like \\"You know we know,\\" which does recall his past triumphs as an instrumentalist. But there is no excuse for putting drum machines on a Jeff Beck record; there's also no way to sugarcoat the fact that most of these songs are, of all things, dance tracks. No matter how much revenue this album generated for the CBS label (and the other parties involved) it was the low point of Beck's recording career. No wonder he did not tour to support it, only playing two gigs, one in Hawaii with Stevie Ray Vaughan and one in Japan with Carlos Santana. For hardcore Jeff Beck fans, Flash may retain some value as an historical curiosity, a sad artifact of an era when corporate greed was actually perceived to be a good thing. People new to Jeff Beck's music should check out any of the many albums he did prior to this instead. He would rebound in a big way with his next album, 1989's Guitar Shop, on which he returned to his strengths with a vengeance.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love this cd. It reminds me of the old crooners. It is relaxing and warm at the same time.
0446528056|2.0|...was because Amanda Seyfried of HBO's \\"Big Love\\" was in the movie (which I have yet to see) and the fact that I used to be a fan of Sparks, but stopped reading his work after the atrocious \\"The Wedding\\".    Let me say, his titles have no punch (\\"The Notebook\\", \\"The Wedding\\", \\"The Choice\\", etc.).  He should be thinking along the lines of \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", or \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", to name a few.  Those were memorable titles, and yes, they were the only successful novels by those authors, but I say it's better to write one Great American novel than it is to write ten mediocre novels (though the latter is more profitable), but hey, it's a living.    I did get into this book, though the hook, as so-called writing experts call it, was nonexistent.  Mr. Sparks uses his name, his brand, to sell his stories--he no longer needs a hook because his preexisting fanbase are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  The writing is poor and though the dialogue is believable, it's dreadfully dull.  All John and Savannah do are go on a series of dates (don't people ever do anything but go out to eat on a date?), argue and write letters to each other, few of which we read, but which I don't mind--I'm not a big fan of reading a bunch of italicized love letters, even in a love story, so I'm not complaining about that.    You know a love story is boring when the relationship between John and his father was much more interesting.  I had never heard of Asperger's syndrome (which is why I found it unbelievable that John's father, whose name I have already forgotten, was able to father a child).  I believe that John finally having a relationship with his father was worth his whole coin collection, for if Savannah did nothing else for him, she did do that, and I think it was a little nuts how John went off on her when she just mentioned that he might have the condition.  I did think John totally overreacted about that, like his father being less thanperfect was some kind of sin, when Savannah was just trying to be a friend.  I mean, what if she thought his father had cancer and didn't tell him?  As it turned out, she really helped John understand his father, which led to the mending of their relationship.    I did think John was pretty dense that he thought his father was normal with a few quirks.  No normal person, no matter how quirky, acts like that.      I thought John belonged more with Lucy than Savannah.  Savannah was okay at first, though her going into detail about her almost-rape after just knowing John for a couple of days was weird.  She wasn't a very smart girl if she accepted an open drink at a party, soda or not.  I've never even been to a party where there's been any drinking, and I am not nearly as naive as this girl.  That's why I don't go to those parties.      The author tells us that this girl is religious, but I got more of a spiritual vibe from her--religious people don't have sex before marriage, or at least they don't plan it.  CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  I thought it was crummy of her to dump him for re-enlisting after 9/11?  Such patriotism would make me fall even more in love with him, but no, obviously she couldn't wait just nine more months, or even marry him on his furlough.  It wasn't like she was thirty-nine and her biological clock was about to time out or anything.  The whole premise just didn't make sense.  She didn't even love Tim the same way.  Was it the sex?  Did she feel obligated because he had picked her up and taken her away from a bad situation, what?    I couldn't dislike Tim--I couldn't blame him for going after Savannah, but why did he wait until John was serving his country to steal his girl?  He seemed to take advantage of Savannah's loneliness.  Why didn't he pursue her before she met John?  It was like he was content to have her as a friend until she found someone else, and then all of a sudden, he had to claim her.  His (Tim's) illness really seemed contrived, and I think John was a truly selfless person for doing what he did, but he needs to get over Savannah and find another girl who would be loyal to him.  I actually thought him and Lucy would get together, but that isn't implied--it's rather implied that John will pine for Savannah forever, which would be fine if she was worth pining for, but she isn't.      I did agree with John about going out with her friends all the time when he was on furlough, just so she wouldn't get too close and be too sad when he left.  How selfish!  I really think the only reason she married Tim was because she didn't love him, not in that way anyway.  She had never had a serious relationship before in her life, and didn't know how to handle it, so she settled.  Well, I hope she's happy!    Dear John, it's time to move on.
1423119509|5.0|This product is great!  I was skeptical when my 19 year old asked for this series of books.  He's a college student and I thought, \\"What?\\"  So I bought them in the bound series (he prefers hardcopy).  I decided to read the series too (I'm 40), I enjoyed \\"Harry\\" I should enjoy this right?  Absolutely!!  This is a great series.  I was able to read a book every few days and I have thoroughly enjoyed them.  I am on Book 4 and my son is on Book 5 (which he took back to college with him).  Great series, nice compact packaging.

If you are an MJ fan, you MUST get this DVD!
B000OVLBF8|3.0|All I really expected going into Mark Steven Johnson's \\"Ghost Rider\\" was a superhero movie with really cool special effects, a fairly close resemblance to the original comic series, and a plot that wasn't atrocious.  For the most part it was a success.  Far from award-winning, it's simple, light entertainment with awesome special effects.<br /><br />After learning his father has cancer, circus motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze makes a Faustian bargain with Satan.  The deal: Johnny's soul for his father's health.  What Johnny doesn't realize is that Satan can't be trusted (How he didn't know that I have no idea), and he's now committed himself to be Satan's bounty hunter.  Whenever near evil he transforms into a ghost rider: a chain-clad flaming skeleton in a leather jacket who rides a tricked-out, demonic motorcycle.  His primary mission is to act as a spirit of vengeance and take down Satan's son, Blackheart, who wishes to take over earth.<br /><br />Aside from the commitment Cage made to get into shape for the movie, the other eye candy involved is Eva Mendes, who looks incredible.  In nearly every scene not saturated with special effects, she steals the scene.  The real star, however, is the CGI.  A flaming motorcycle ripping through cities, roaring up the side of skyscrapers and melting windows, capturing evil-doers in a flaming chain, sending hell-fire flying into the sky, destroying everything and causing small animals to spontaneously combust, it's all in a day's work for a ghost rider.  That's what I call a good time.<br /><br />The major problems with this film are the poor plot and complete lack of character development.  Sure, there is the ghost rider legend, but beyond that we don't really get to hear an explanation for his antagonists, their quest, or much less anyone else.  Additionally, there is nearly no explanation for their characters or Sam Elliot's graveyard sage, and more than one evil entity is just thrown in without explanation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the visuals, and for fans of the comic, but not much else., and for fans of the comic, but not much else.

0800141601|4.0|Skipping much of Arthurian background story - and completely disregarding other aspects - \\"First Arthur\\" begins where the most famous of Lancelot's legendary adventures begin.  With her lands attacked by ex-knight Malagant (Ben Cross), Lady Guinevere (Julia Ormond), as a stereotypical ing&eacute;nue, is soon to wed King Arthur (Sean Connery) for protection.  A country divided, Malagant's forces seek to overtake Arthur's, and upon Guinevere's arrival to Camelot they make their first strike.  In rides Lancelot (Richard Gere) to save the day.<br /><br />Considering past Arthurian lore, I'd say a lot of this film is accurate.  The scenery is impressive, and the battles are worthy if unspectacular.  Except for the final sword battle between Lancelot and Malagant, which is ridiculous.  Not only does the number of swords in battle magically change, but Gere ends up holding a handle without the sword at the end.  Two of the more obvious movie slip-ups I've ever seen.<br /><br />The emotional aspect of this film is true to form.  The Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur love triangle is very well done, as Ormond manages to express an admirable love for King Arthur and a lustful desire for Lancelot.  The struggle between the opposing forces of good and evil is captivating, despite its predictability.<br /><br />The problem with this film, however, is the casting and the costumes.  While Ormond and Connery are nearly perfect, and Cross is a completely malignant evil, Richard Gere just doesn't seem to be right as Lancelot.  He possesses neither the polished veneer of a highly skilled knight, nor the ruffian edge of a battle-hardened warrior.  He's simply not believable.  The costumes, on the other hand, are just as bad.  The peasants' attire is appropriate, but the battle armor of the various knights, both good and evil, is anachronistic at best.  Rather than the classic silver armor of good versus the dark grays of enemy armor, First Knight gives us a costume designer's interpretation, where the knights would look just as comfortable seated at a round table as they would a Michael Jackson themed disco club from the early 80s.<br /><br />The movie is a decent medieval romantic thriller, but it's not exemplary.  Told without The Holy Grail, Merlin, or Excalibur, it's a small piece of the pie that is just a bit off.  Except for the medieval obstacle course, I thought that part was a great addition.just as comfortable seated at a round table as they would a Michael Jackson themed disco club from the early 80s.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I may not be as well versed in the technical end of Disney movies but this film is my favorite Disney film.  I originally saw it during its initial theatrical release when I was a child.  I maintain that the detail in the scenes is amazing.  The clocks in Gepetto's shop are a wonderful experience itself.  The detail that was put into these early hand drawn animated features is flawless.  I just can't immagine any one today doing all that work on any film.  Now all that work is done with computers and although the films look wonderful, there is something magical about an old hand drawn Disney flick.  The updating of the film onto Blu-ray is amazing.  It is clear and sparkles. I had purchased Pinocchio on VHS when it was released a few years ago but this is a vast  improvement.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|In the sixties the Traveling Wilbury's would have been called a super group. Their music is unidentifiable by the many flavors each musician brings to the group. Great listening, bound to be a collectors item.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This is a little known movie that is highly underrated.  I recently purchased it on Blu-ray from Amazon because it was on sale and had some great reviews by others.  I had never seen it in theatres and never even knew about it until I read some of the reviews.  It is a really powerful movie which gets to the heart of things quickly.  Right from the start you realize that Eastwood is playing a tortured man who needs help but somehow can't take it from anyone.  Eventually he comes around and makes his point. Definatley not a film for the younger crowd.  Lots of foul language and cursing as well as racial slurs.

B000001FW9|4.0|4.2 stars<br /><br />I got lucky last month and found four classic Gentle Giant records, the original vinyl pressings from the early seventies, for a dollar apiece. I already had Three Friends but bought it again, just to have an extra of that great fold-out cover. That was all I knew of these guys. I'm glad to hear they put out a number of decent albums.<br /><br />I think this is a fine record, very Crimsonish but with a bluesier edge thanks to Green's guitar. The Shulmans were mighty ambitious and it pays off here; I especially enjoy some of the bass/guitar harmony lines, very tasty moments that mesh nicely with the vaguely mystical lyrics and keyboard washes. Pantagruel is a highlight, but pretty much every track is worth closing your eyes and really listening to.<br /><br />Visconti did a solid production job here; when seeing his name I always think of Python's Flying Circus references to his ubiquitous nature at the time, but clearly he knew his way around the mixing board, and arrangement charts as well. This album sounds very good for '71, full bass and clear, clean highs; haven't heard the cd, so I can't comment on it.<br /><br />But I really doubt it's remotely close to the value of finding this in almost perfect shape, not one scratch, for a buck, foldout cover and all. Garage sales can't be beat.<br /><br />I've always loved Yes, Crimson, and especially the early Genesis with PG, and while Giant's musicians are not quite of that calibre, they're certainly fine, and wrote plenty of unique tunes. If you like prog, this is a good one. And once the taste is acquired, there's other GG to enjoy, with Octopus and Free Hand among the best.

B000055Y0Y|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />Well written and directed, with good performances all around and a typically excellent Morricone score, Fire is stolen by Malcovich, easily one of the best actors of his generation. His bad guy here is perfection, with all the menace he needs yet enough humanity to make him believable. Clint is Clint, as ever, and Russo holds up her end. But it's Malcovich who makes this work.<br /><br />The script is exemplary, the dialogue realistic, and in general this is an intelligent thriller that fires on all cylinders. Clint's selling of himself as a piano player falls a little flat; he's clearly not playing in the bar, but gets points from me for putting on Kind Of Blue when he comes home, and for his love of jazz in general. That whole angle felt a little forced, though. Aside from that, everything works well here; all political thrillers should be this tightly constructed, and have a script this smart, where the good guys can become bad guys in the blink of an eye. But hey, who really wants to admit that our secret service runs around the world killing people our corporations find bad for business?<br /><br />Clint gets points for tackling yet another American myth, as in Unforgiven and so many other classics, while seeming to be the rah-rah patriot. Bright fellow, that Mr. Eastwood.

0446698342|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is known for his love stories. Let's face it, the man has found a pattern that works for him. But this story was different. To me, this has to be one of his best books yet! I was expecting sappy love (which I will deal with in order to enjoy his characters) but that was BARELY there! Truly a story about faith (believing in something, anything) and understanding.    Logan Thibault was just like any other U.S. Marine, serving his time in the sandbox. Danger surrounded him constantly and he came close to death on more than one occasion. That is until he found the picture. A beautiful young woman at some kind of fair. Everybody jokes about it until it seems to be the only reason Logan hasn't died during his 3rd tour in Iraq.    Finally, after losing his best friend, Logan decides it's time to leave. He gets processed out and sets out, on foot, to find the woman in the picture. That trek takes him from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina where he decides to settle in for a while. He meets the kinetic Nana, who runs a dog training facility with her daughter Elizabeth and grandson Ben, and chooses it as a place of employment.    Overtime, as Logan becomes comfortable with this close-knit family, he begins to question his real reason for staying. Is it the search for the elusive girl or something more? The discovery he makes not only changes his path, but also the path of those around him.    As always, Sparks weaves a simple storyline into a more complex analogy. What this book is really trying to get across to its readers is faith and fate are quite important. If you really believe in something, then you should go all out for it. Shallow attempts at going for something really means nothing. And fate is not clear and defined. It is a modifiable path that we can chose to take. I found this book's characters very likable and I found myself actually caring what happened to them. Logan's background in the Marines is a different starting point than Sparks normally takes and I thought it was very appropriate for this time period and specific character. All in all, this was a great story that didn't take me too long to read. Give it a try if you haven't read anything by him.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has a delightful voice and the selection of songs is  outstanding.  If this is an example of her potential she should go a long way.  I am looking forward to her next cd.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|I bought this as one of my first Blu-Ray discs, and as far as old movies set to Blu-Ray go, this one looks fantastic. If you love Superman, you'll love this disc.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I really like the movies and wasn't expecting the TV series to be as good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Because the series is animated, it really can't be compared. If you liked the movies, you should like the show, but realize that the show is animated. All were produced by George Lucas.
0385336950|1.0|I thought the little-known fact of the Japanese Balloon bombing was very interesting, and I believe it alone could have supported the entire story line without all of the added mysticism, introspection etc. (Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction) Also the book contained way too many flashbacks (back stories). I was at times confused then bored by the 'First Person' presentation, however some scenes in the book captured my complete attention.

B001NERPHS|5.0|What can I say but \\"Bob you have never let me down\\". Anyone who enjoys Dylan for his talent for his lyrics and his style should own this recording.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If you miss Nathan Fillion's Firefly character, you will love this show.  I see his character in this show as very similar in attitude, without the underlying angst and anger.  His character, Richard Castle, is a charming but arrogant jerk, but Fillion pulls it off in a delightfully likable manner.  Stana Katic, the lead detective that plays opposite Fillion, more than holds her own as a keep-it-business professional who keeps him on his toes.  The balance of the ensemble cast provides a talented backdrop for the daily lives of the characters, and gives the show more depth than many of the detective-type shows on TV today.

B0002SROT0|5.0|Everyone seems to have a proprietary take on Elliott.  People who came to him with this album will probably always feel this is the quintessential Elliott, whereas those who knew his earlier stuff tend to be put off by the more elaborate and rockist arrangements here.    This was my first contact with Elliott, and I quite fell in love with the album. I had been listening to Grandaddy's \\"Under the Western Freeway\\" and \\"Sumday\\" right before I started listening to \\"From a Basement. . \\", and as a result I at first deducted points from Elliott for less originality.      But the allegiance to Beatles forms really matters less and less the more you get in touch with Elliott's emotional state as he's putting the songs across.  Repeated listenings reveal a craftsman at the top of his game, and an insistence on not engaging in self-pity.  Even when he at first sounds self-pitying, you realize that hidden in that agony is a critque of himself, as well as a statement of alienation.    As with Jason Lytle of Grandaddy, your connection and amazement increases once you know all the lyrics.  Your enjoyment bumps up dramatically when your understanding goes up from 80% to 98% (See [...] for lyrics).  You understand how much Elliott was enjoying creating and singing these songs, and it makes it very difficult to believe that he would have wanted to kill himself after having created them.  The album sounds like he's made it through his storms, and is at peace on the other side of them.    I think he actually sounded more depressed on \\"Figure 8\\" (\\"I have become a silent movie. . . \\"; \\"Better Be Quiet Now\\"; the song \\"Happiness\\"; \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\"; the morbid piano coda at the end of the album).    Here, he sounds more distanced from his pain, as if he's spent a lot of time thinking things through, either with or without a therapist.  So the songs are felt, but also sometimes have an admirable level of detachment:  \\"Coast to Coast\\", \\"Memory Lane\\", \\"Shooting Star\\", \\"Pretty (Ugly Before).  Sometimes they're NOT detached:  \\"The Last Hour\\" especially, and \\"Twilight\\", are a bit more direct and vulnerable.  But the insistence on emotional truth remains the same throughout.    Elliott really is the spiritual heir of John Lennon, the guts on the floor Lennon of \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\".  Like John, he knows how to work with \\"filters and masks\\", as Robert Christgau has observed about Lennon, and changes in mood, but it's all in the service of connecting with other people, and being vulnerable, not distancing himself from others.    XO and Figure 8 are fine albums.  But \\"From a Basement\\" is equally fine, in its own way, and still just as shiningly honest.  Elliott didn't want to repeat himself here.  Don't disrespect him because he chose not to, and because he stretched his production and style techniques.    He was and is the real deal, here, as elsewhere.

0385341008|5.0|This book had everything--An exceptional storyline, fascinating and 3 dimentional characters & the unique perspectives of multiple voices; each of whom experienced this time in their lives from a different vantage point. As an armchair student of history, I was only vaguely aware of this event during the Second World War.  I was born in April of 1946, but have heard many stories about the war years.  I have  a  friend who didn't emmigrate to the US until after the war.  She spent WWII in her native Scotland and did'nt move  across the pond until the fifties.  I gave her a copy for Xmas this year & am anxiously waiting for her to read it and give me her thoughts on its content--both historically and personally!  I would recommend this book to anyone interested  in the endurance of the human spirit and perseverence in the face of even the most cruel and unfair of ordeals.

1906694176|5.0|I really liked the first book in the series \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Although it took a little bit of effort to  get into the book with it's different locations and characters. Once I got started it was well worth the effort. \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" was even better and a non stop read. Totally captivated by the series and unable to wait for the US release in May, I ordered \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" from a seller in England! As hard as it may be to believe, I found this one to be the best of the trilogy. Start with the first book and work thru in order as it will help everything make more sense. I do not go into any details regarding characters or the plot as I prefer not to spoil the book for you. My review is more of an opinion of the fact that I really liked it and would highly recommend it to you.

B0014BQQYS|3.0|\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is more an exercise in style than substance. One can understand why audiences enjoyed it, but the mixed reaction from critics is a more-accurate assessment of the film's quality. Other than being fitfully entertaining, the film has no particular point, other than pointlessly projecting 20th-century attitudes on 19th-century characters.<br /><br />The problem starts with William Goldman's consciously lightweight treatment of the material, followed by George Roy Hill's \\"Don't take this too seriously\\" direction. According to the supplemental material, Hill was surprised when preview audiences laughed throughout almost all of the film, so he went back to tone down the film's humor. This is a strange reaction, considering that the film is populated with supporting actors that were or would become known for comic performances: Henry Jones; Kenneth Mars; Ted Cassidy (Lurch in \\"The Addams Family\\"); Cloris Leachman. Timothy Scott (who would play Pea-Eye in \\"Lonesome Dove\\") is one of the \\"Hole in the Wall\\" gang, and Jeff Corey (not known for Westerns) is a sheriff who warns Butch and Sundance about the disaster that will surely befall them.<br /><br />Of the principals, only Newman stands out. He has the acting energy, the personal drive and fire, that Redford and Ross lack. Redford has always struck me as vapid, and he seems neither to truly find his character, or simply have fun playing the part. And he's too good-looking -- a fashion model in Western drag. Gabby Hayes was a better actor (and a heck of a lot cuter).<br /><br />The transfer is so-so. We are (well, I am) so accustomed to razor-sharp, ultra-detailed HD images that the general softness of the film (which seems intentional) is disappointing. Not surprisingly, the best cinematography is in indoor and night scenes specifically lit for the camera. The sound isn't very good, either, often muddy and thumpy, and there are patches of distortion (most notably in \\"Raindrops\\"). Only half the score is in stereo.<br /><br />There are a few good moments -- particularly the train explosion from \\"too much dynamite\\" -- but for this viewer, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is not the breezy romp it was (probably) intended to be. It is ultimately pointless and too self-referential to be entertaining.lf the score is in stereo.<br /><br />There are a few good moments -- particularly the train explosion from \\"too much dynamite\\" -- but for this viewer, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is not the breezy romp it was (probably) intended to be.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I won't go into some long spiel about the technical specs etc.  Suffice it to say that the stereo mixes of the Beatles were always quirky.  The mono mixes bring the songs to life and the subtleties of the music come out in George Martin's painstakingly precise mono mixes.  He spent all his time mixing the mono versions... The stereo mixes were whipped out quick.  (All this is excluding Abbey Road which was the only album where stereo was the only mix... Any Beatles fan must hear the mono mixes...  AND its NOT the same if you buy stereo and just convert to mono...

B002ZG997C|3.0|Super-bad dude (Denzel Washington) is walking west through an entirely typical post-apocalyptic desert landscape.  It's all shot on digital video, and for once the format looks just right for the gray, washed-out landscapes.  After wasting a bunch of thugs with a wicked long knife/short sword, Denzel wanders into a one-horse town run by a nasty boss-type guy played by who else?  Ben Gazzara.  No, just kidding, but Gary Oldman is channeling him I think.  Heck, I dunno, maybe there's just a generic amoral town boss type and everybody tends towards it if they play these roles enough.<br /><br />Also in the town are Tom Waits as a shopkeeper (entertaining for his few minutes of time but wasted) and Mila Kunis as the daughter of Oldman's blind kept woman, Jennifer Beals.  After Denzel goes all Toshiro Mifune on a bunch of Oldman's men who've just returned from raiding, Oldman takes an interest; and after finding out that Denzel has a precious book, he's even more interested.  You want to guess what the book is?  I don't think you'll find it too hard...<br /><br />This is a rather silly and derivative movie that vacillates between various tough guy genres - post-apocalyptic science fiction, spaghetti western, samurai film.  The after-the-end-of-the-world stuff doesn't come off as much different than what we've seen in dozens of films from A BOY AND HIS DOG through MAD MAX and this past year's THE ROAD - gray deserts, shattered towns and cities, little animal or vegetable life, dust, hopelessness.  The close-in fighting sequences feel like updated Kurosawa, and sharp-eared viewers will note that one of Oldman's henchmen whistles the theme from Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA at a couple of points during the film.  Denzel  is doing the taciturn, emotionless staring type of anti-hero best exemplified by Clint Eastwood in the \\"Dollars\\" trilogy, though he brings his own particular kind of charisma and even a certain warmth the role; he and Mila Kunis (somewhat miscast I think but trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.<br /><br />Besides all the tough-guy stuff and macho posturing though, the film wants to be - and say - something more.  Problem is that in the resolution (which I'm not going to spoil for ya) that something more has to be taken so literally and absolutely for the film to work that if you don't want to believe it (and it IS a matter of belief) you'll probably just find it all laughable.  And the film doesn't play out for the most part as a comedy - it's a lot more serious than most spaghetti westerns, even solemn at times.  Then again, you could just have fun with Denzel doing Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and any number of other macho action figures and maybe that's enough.<br /><br />On a certain level, though, this film clearly wants to be taken seriously, wants to be something more than just a mindless action romp; the Hughes brothers who directed it haven't exactly shied away from Christian themes in their previous films, and here they are front and center and obvious.  You don't talk so much about religion - the Bible, specifically - if you don't have some kind of agenda.  But it's so damn muddled, and so careful to try to straddle various lines in order to have as wide an appeal as possible that I'm not sure it was worth it.  And in the final analysis, if this guy is carrying around a Bible and the message he's getting is \\"kill anyone who stands in my way\\", what does that say about the book, humanity, or this film?trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.

B0000640S3|1.0|Fresh after fighting the VC's in Nam, John Rambo (half-nude and with a serious speech impediment as usual) decides to really fight the liberal world conspiracy by joining Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, blowing up evil Russians as he goes along.<br /><br />Poor Jihad Johnny and his mentors Reagan and Bush obviously didn't know what the hell they were getting themselves into. Does \\"Wahhabi\\" mean anything to you, colonel? If the Jews have objections, we just send more aid to their settlements around Jerusalem. That usually stops them from complaining about our Stinger missiles being handed over to the Einsatzgruppen Westpakistan. Besides, the Taliban really are a lost tribe of Israel, aren't they?<br /><br />So Johnnyboy charges ahead, fighting the evil Commies on camel back, scoring yet another big victory for the holy war against the infidel.<br /><br />Thank you, Rambo.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first CD is certainly no disappointment to this listener who enjoys good music.  Just as was seen on the British version of \\"You Have Talent,\\" Susan Boyle's voice is clear, with distinct enunciation, and an incredible range.  This gifted vocalist is a new-found diamond.  The selection of songs for this, her first CD, is a very nice mix of light classics, pops, and sacred.  It is well worth the money.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|A very interesting documentary of the making of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and the fandemonium that came with it. I was glad I was able to purchase it as a stand alone DVD.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|1.) Dialectic Chaos - Powerful riffs erupt onto your speakers, signaling the start of 45 minutes of blistering music; and heralding the triumphant return of Megadeth to the forefront of the metal scene.  The solos are intense, more precise than those of Killing is My Business or even Rust in Peace, and are some of the best technical work the band has ever done.  New guitarist Chris Broderick puts his best foot forward to start off the record, showing himself to be as competent a musician as 'Deth has ever had (yes, Friedman was excellent, but his style was completely different, so a comparison would be largely irrelevant.) A great instrumental track at least on par with Into the Lungs of Hell, and a perfect intro for the next cut.    2.) This Day We Fight! - \\"For this I was chosen!\\" growls Mustaine over several furious layers of thrashing guitars reminiscent of Take No Prisoners.  This one is thrash from start to finish, a relentless assault on the senses.  Lyrics are great for fans of classic 'Deth, recalling battle scenes from fantasy literature such as Lord of the Rings.  Mustaine's singing style sets the tone for the rest of the album: lower-pitched growls than we are used to hearing from him.  You won't be hearing too many high soaring vocals ripped from Secret Place or A Tout Le Monde.  This continues a trend set by 2007's United Abominations.  I personally don't mind it; it's just a different tone.    3.)44 Minutes - A haunting slow guitar piece underneath a blaring police radio: \\"We are all pinned down by automatic gun fire!\\"  Then, a staggered riff and crawling baseline kick in.  So begins the most contemplative track on the record, a personal favorite of mine.  Lyrics can get a tad awkward with the phrasing at parts, Mustaine trying to stretch sentences over a couple of lines (\\"so inSTEAD they WENT for the BANK\\").  However, there are also moments of songwriting brilliance (\\"the bowls of wrath poured out on the ground\\"/\\"until they shot Achilles' heel and brought down the beast\\").    4.) 1320 -  The sound of a drag car taking off, then a gritty, gainy riff that could have been ripped right off KIMB launch an interesting track with numerous tempo changes.  Breakneck guitars punctuate mid-paced verses and choruses, until about the 2:30 mark. Everybody cuts out for a simple fast drum fill that conjures up images of an idling funny car.  But it's not idle for long: so begins a solid minute of classic heavy solo-laden thrash that will leave your neck sore for days.    5.) Bite the Hand - Contrasting itself with the previous track, Bite the Hand showcases mid-paced riffs broken up by intense vocal sections that kick in to double time.  However, the time changes only provide the framework for some very heavy guitar pieces.  The time change shortly after the 3-minute mark has some great dueling solos also.  Lyrics are nothing to write home about, however.  Solid track.    6.) Bodies - Many have drawn comparisons between this cut and the legendary \\"Symphony of Destruction.\\"  The similarities aren't overbearing, but this definitely would have found a home on Countdown to Extinction.  The slower pace and space left by the staggered guitars provide some needed relief after the blazing sections of DC, TDWF, 1320, and BTH.  A Tout Le Monde-like contemplative solos hit around 2:30 in, but these are just a set up for the real show, a 30-second thrash fest to close it out.  Broderick really shines here, as does good ol' Dave.  A climbing-then-diving riff slows the track down to round it off.  Good melodic piece.    7.) Endgame - Slow, doomy riffs that would do Tony Iommi proud supply the foundation for this apocalyptic-themed title track.  \\"This is the end of the road/... of the line/...of your life/... the Endgame.\\"  Lyrics are haunting and drip with the suspicious attitude of Dave's work on Countdown as well as United Abominations.  Once the gallop begins, this track does not disappoint.  Guitar work continues to be top-notch (sensea theme here?).  The dynamics are excellent, and reflect on Dave's improved musicianship over the years.  The song fades out slowly, abandoning you to contemplate the haunting words \\"Believe me when I say: this is the endgame!\\"    8.) The Hardest Part of Letting Go... Sealed With a Kiss - Another favorite of mine, THPOLG starts with a pair of eerie picking pieces riding an ambient synth track.  Metalheads, fear not!  This is not a deleted song from Risk!  Once the heavy prog gallop is unleashed a couple minutes in, the track gets really interesting.  Great screaming guitars in the back support the Edgar Allen Poe-type tale of love and revenge, reminiscent of Last Rites/Loved to Deth.  Pay attention to the lyrics; they are some of the best on the record.  No truly epic leads on this one, but a very well-written song.    9.) Head Crusher -  The first track so far to match This Day We Fight in intensity, Head Crusher is classic thrash at its finest.  Unforgiving chord-changing and \\"riffs\\" that would be considered solos for most other bands.  Even though I know it's coming, I always jump when it comes on, chasing away what remains of the soothing guitars that close out the previous track.  Loses some steam a couple minutes in for one of Dave's pet spoken word sections.  But that soon gives way to some excellent soloing to finish the track.    10.) How the Story Ends - The war-themed lyrics really shine on this mid-paced, grooving cut.  Nothing too spectacular musically, but Dave paints a great word picture of ancient warriors battling to the death.  Solo section 3/4 through is very solid; Broderick is spectacular.  I suppose the only real complaint one can have is that it's a little too \\"samey,\\" not standing out from its brethren on this record.  That's almost a compliment I suppose: the record is so good that it's tough for this song to distinguish itself.  Not a bad problem for Dave to have!    11.) The Right to Go Insane - Finally!  A great bass section, very doomy and crawling.  For those who have heard the latest Heaven & Hell record, it's like a sped up version of Butler's piece on \\"Double the Pain.\\"  Really fits in very nicely with the theme of the song.  The guitars ring out and leave a lot of space for the drums and bass to drive the tune forward.  The chorus is one of the most catchy and melodic on the record. It also has the most personal lyrics on the album.  And best of all, there's a minute-long thrasher at the end that closes out this classic thrash CD.    ---    Overall, this has now become my second-favorite Megadeth effort, just behind Rust in Peace.  Dave combines the musical prowess of his first four records with the songwriting dynamics of CTE, Youthansia, and Cryptic Writings to concoct something truly special.  Give it a spin, you will not be disappointed!

B002VPE1AW|3.0|Beware: This movie has fallen under fanboy syndrome.  This syndrome is typically characterized when grown men act like teenage girls over sci-fi/anime movies.  Unless you are male, probably 13-40 and spent a good deal of your life thinking of yourself as a nerd, you're probably going to be impressed by this movie, but will find it hard to relate to the fandom for it.    Here are some strengths:  1) It looks great.  I mean, it looks really, really great.  No doubt about that.  Waiting for the technology to come around paid off, it's fantastic to see.    2) The setting is well put together.  You can tell that Cameron did put a lot of work into the details of this planet, and it shows.    3) The characters are archetypes, but that's not unusual for Cameron.  He serves up predictable, yet reliable characters that function well within the story itself.    Here are the weaknesses:  1) The score.  You expect a movie like this one to have a memorable score that you just can't get out of your head.  The Dark Knight, couldn't get it out of my head.  LOTR, couldn't get it out of my head.  This score is a total phone in that sounds like a mix between Titanic and The Lion King.  It's not original at all.  During the movie, I kept waiting for Celine Dion to chime in, \\"My heart will go on!\\"  I'm a huge music buff in movies, oftentimes it makes or breaks a movie and this broke the movie.  Cameron should have sent Horner back and said, \\"Do it better.\\"    2) By coincidence, the other night, I watched Aliens and was surprised at how well it held up.  Sure, the effects aren't perfect, but to make up for it, Cameron just created other worldly suspense.  I was often amazed by Avatar, but never surprised.  I knew the big battle was coming.  I knew the blue people were gonna win.  I knew he was gonna get the girl.  I knew it all.  Part of the downside from this exceptional CGI is that there is literally nothing that cannot be created, nothing we cannot see, and thus there is very little tobe imagined.  The movie lacked a certain mystery that some of Cameron's previous works exploited so well.    3) It's too long.  I don't care what anyone says, cutting 30 minutes from this movie bumps it from 3 to 4 stars.      4) The blue people sex was awkward and unnerving.  Call me close minded, but I thought it was stupid, and it looked terrible.  That whole section of the movie was unbearable.  It was terrible.  TERRIBLE.  A D- stretch during an otherwise decent flick.
0553583182|5.0|Even the book written before decades but it is a treasure.<br /><br />This book connect \\"The Secret\\" - the book - with the power of God. How can we ask and pray to get what we want. How can we visualize our big dreams?<br /><br />I love the book and recommend.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss has done it again! A truly original, witty, well-crafted modern musical. Neil, Nathan and Felicia rock!
B001FB4W16|5.0|Awesome video quality, nice extras. If you like the HBO series True Blood, then this is the definitive way to own it. Everything from the packaging of the set, to the commentary and cast interviews is nicely done.
B00005QDW5|4.0|It is a good cd, well recorded but I still like \\"Dark side of the Moon\\" better.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is great.  It does take a different story line from the books so far.  I enjoyed it very much, usually the difference is hard for me, but it was well done in this series.
0977476073|1.0|The author has made numerous errors in the translation of the original book to English.  I would highly recommend this book if you want to see how mistakes are made during translation.    If you goal is to understand the original meaning of the book pass on this translation it's just not accurate and you won't get the true meaning of the original book.
B000RIWAVW|4.0|On Halloween 1963, Haddenfield, 10-year-old Michael Myers, estranged and mentally unstable, is imprisoned in Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis for the murders of his mother's boyfriend, his older sister, and her boyfriend. Now, 16 years later, he escapes and now in search of his baby sister Laurie and Dr. Loomis must warn the residents of Haddenfield and get to Laurie before Michael does. This movie does make for a very admirable companion piece to a horror classic, blending the old and the new into an entertaining and thought-provoking fright movie.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book! It was a great little story about a small island off the coast of England<br />and its wacky,sometimes very eccentric inhabitants during the German occupation of their town<br />during WW2...Great!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Science was never my strong suit in my schooling, but Planet Earth has definitely sparked a significant interest in the academic side of science that I never knew existed in me before.  A true labor of love!  Thanks to the BBC, the diverse beauty of our planet is more accessible than ever before.  And the beauty of life, as depicted in this series, truly takes one's breath away.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Sam Bush (Sam Rockwell) is in the last two weeks of a three year contract, mining fuel that can only be found on the dark side of the Moon. He talks to his plants and has his cubicle bed surrounded by pictures of his wife and daughter. The three years of isolation is taking its toll. He's seeing things, and losing his concentration. When he gets into a lunar rover to investigate a problem with one of the land strip-mining machines, he accidentally crashes, only to wake up in the infirmary with GERTY 3000 (voiced with HAL 9300 coolness by Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />But something is wrong. Sam thinks there's someone else with him. And there is...another Sam. Has Sam lost his mind in the isolation and aftermath of the crash? Did he die and just hallucinate what is happening? Is there a conspiracy of clones? Is he really being rescued, as the messages from Earth suggest? Thus is the premise of Duncan Jones' (aka Zowie Bowie) \\"Moon.\\" Rockwell plays himself and himself, trying to reconcile all that is happening to the twin hims in hopes of achieving wellness before he can go home. It's Science Fiction with very little science, only a lonely miner and his robot friend trying to figure out what is going on in their isolated outpost.<br /><br />To that end, there are obvious parallels with modern classics like [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]] (isolated man battles himself after greedy corporation screws everything up) and [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey.]] Rockwell plays the everyman of Sam Bush very effectively as he unravels the mystery of his predicament. It's also nice to watch a science movie where plot-lines are not connected by an endless series of explosions or CGI aliens (in fact, the special effects are largely retro in nature, something I found refreshing). Jones provides us with an ambitious debut as a director, as well...and given that the only two pop songs he inserted into the movie were ever popular \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" and one hit wonder Chesney Hawkes' \\"The One and Only,\\" says a lot about him not taking easy choices.<br /><br />After all, how simple would it have been to call up Dad and ask for \\"Space Oddity?\\"and Only,\\" says a lot about him not taking easy choices.    After all, how simple would it have been to call up Dad and ask for \\"Space Oddity?\\"
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan mesmerizes with his exciting examination of the possible sources of our food in America. I love food and for me this book constituted a celebration of it's complexity and possibility. Although Pollan is obviously biased he takes a calculated look at the propositions of both sides, even though through the novel we follow him to his inevitable arrival at his own perceptions. I highly recommend this book to all readers, especially those who are politically conscious or who just get inordinately excited about food the way I do.
031606792X|5.0|Having been a high school English teacher, I admit the punctuation made me have to re-read some parts, but I've never been a purist (having struggled through Russian novels). Content has always been more important in creating and telling the story. I must admit to being a late comer to the Twilight series having seen the movie on cable. I was extremely happy to buy the four book set. From the time I started Twilight to the last in the saga Breaking Dawn I was drawn into the world of romance, conflict, love lost and love found.  Must confess to reading all four books in six days.  How is that for spell binding.  I didn't have to wade through a sea of four letter word dialogue or drug addled behaviors. The love is sweet, the conflicts are full of pain and anguish, and the struggle between good and evil is heroic. Breaking Dawn does not disappoint and carries through with love conquers all.  Readers who demand a level of sophistication in their novel will criticize, but those of us who enjoy storytelling applaud this book.    This book as well as the others have a simplistic charm and grace to them. I'm re-reading them to have the image in my mind when the books go to DVDs.  This book brought me into the action by letting my mind see the wedding, pregnancy, birth and conflict with the Volturi. I would recommend this book and the rest of the saga to anyone who wants to be a part of a richness of the story. I am so appreciative to the author for sticking to her dream and bring to life a romance with a happy ending. You have cast your spell over me with your charming characters.  It is truly a most satisfying experience.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|My favorite part of the movie's score is the magnificent music during the ending credits.  Like the movie, it never lets up until the final words roll by.  But this music is not on the CD.  The movie version's drumming is not part of \\"I See You\\" on the CD either, which leaves it a bit flat.       The music is very moving during the film, but sometimes gets buried under other sounds. That's why I like ending credits music in general, because it sums up all the best music in the movie, and can be heard clearly. I guess I'll have to wait for the DVD.     My favorite musical pieces are in track 7 and at the end of track 12, but the ending credit version is slightly different.  Better, in my opinion, because it was designed to stand alone.    Side note: Avatar has no opening credits at all.  Even the movie title is absent, and only appears at the end.      P.S. I have edited this review.
0307593525|5.0|This set is everything I expected and more. The measurements conversion is most appreciated and the information asides are quite enjoyable. This is real French cooking so be prepared for butter, butter and butter and numerous recipe steps. It is however, worth every step in the end!
1573300403|5.0|I'm going to be honest. I got this video for one reason and one reason only. Although I can view it online, I HAD to have the EPIC Scream video so I could view it on my television. The video has amazing quality, too. There are other favorites of mine on this video as well which is the best video or short film as Michael preferred to call them and that's Thriller. You will also get the video that skyrocketed Michael's career to another galaxy and that's the Billie Jean performance at the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today and Forever anniversary. The performance that the late legendary Fred Astaire enjoyed and who also happened to be one of Michael's idols next to James Brown. It was also the performance that was enjoyed immensely by the late Marvin Gaye. This is a must have for every Michael Jackson fan.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Just watched this movie and loved it. I love Miljo! The movie had me captivated the whole time.
031606792X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it!! It is a perfect ending to this original saga. I fully recommend it.
B00000IREA|4.0|Unless your into the kitchy, sexist period, this may not appeal 2 all.  I enjoyed it because it was so over the top.  Jane Fonda, obviously still learning her craft, didn't have a lot of range.  She mostly just showed off her body in a new outfit, almost, every new scene.  The storyline was laughable, but for all you Music fans, this is were Duran Duran got their name from.  As long as you don't take it seriously, it is very campy.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|A wonderful blend of science fiction and crime scene investigation, keeping you on your toes and guessing! Worth every penny.
B00275EGX8|5.0|OK, first let me say that I am not going to judge how accurate this film may or may not be as I've never been to Iraq or been around a real E.O.D. team. This is a movie, people, not a documentary. So going off that I will say that I really enjoyed this, it is very entertaining. I liked its gritty, sweaty, realistic style. Top notch cinematography, especially in the way the slow-mo's show dirt leaping off the ground or top of a car as the I.E.D.'s detonate and also when shell casings bounce off the ground. Good directing, good acting, just an all around good movie in my opinion. I saw it on DVD but I'm sure it looks even better on BD. 5 stars, Highly Recommended.
B000M341QE|4.0|All I can say is... wow.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese's The Departed is an action movie that builds in intensity right through to the end.  Two men, both products of the underbelly of Boston, end up going to police academy.  One, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), flourishes, but remains beholden to crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  The other, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes deep undercover to get the goods on Costello.<br /><br />Their lives weave around each other, until eventually they find themselves actively searching for one another, with fatal consequences.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson makes for a mean gangster, and transitions between a friendly \\"uncle-type\\" and an emotionless killer without missing a beat.<br /><br />This is a movie that will have you wishing you owned stock in one of those fake blood companies prior to production.  Be warned.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I purchased the dvd locally and like it even more than the theater version.  The whole team is wonderful.  It's a bitter sweet experience to watch because of my deep sorrow over the passing of precious Michael but I'm thankful to have this rehearsal footage.  The concerts would have been spectacular.  A big shout out to the entire team.  You were all great.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Very good condition. Moreover if you consider this Cd was edited in limited quantities.
0385341008|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this imaginative story of the German occupation of  Guernsey Island.  The tale is told in a way I have never read before.  I had a keen sense of each of the characters, and I cared about them all.  Their stories still linger even after finishing the book.
B001W63DY6|1.0|I never got to see the DCD because it is Blu-ray...... and Amazon charged me a great deal of money to return it.  Just like they charged me a great deal more for other DVDs....Last time that I will order from Amazon....ecb

0066620996|4.0|Enjoyed the book but considering all that's happened in the last two years, it's a bit outdated.
B000LW7OWE|4.0|I found this entertaining and Kilmer plays a pretty good Morrison. That said, the film twists and fabricates the truth in a lot of ways which is what happens whenever Hollyweird makes a film that a lot of us were there to wittiness. I saw the Doors at Whiskey and it was nothing like it was portrayed. I was at the Golden Gate Park gig as well, also a complete fabrication. The genius of Morrison boosted by the rest of the band is hard to capture but we have the music to remind us. I am going to see Ray in a club venue in a few weeks and it will be interesting to hear him play again. I was a lucky boy to grow up only 70 miles from the City and our rescue from the sticks was to go and see music. It was a great time to be alive but Morrison's star went through the sky too fast. I always wondered what the album after L.A. Woman would have been like. It is entertainment and bad history. Nuff said.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|John Mayer is a solid musician and song writer. \\"Half of My Heart\\" has a great guitar lick and lyric.     The artist reveals a good deal about himself in the various songs. Like \\"part of the man who's never truly loved anything.\\"Not to mention \\"Who Says I Can't...........\\"    I just hope this creative young artist keeps it together to write lots more music and keeps pushing the envelope of both his musical and personal growth while sharing his insights with his audience.    Overall another fine CD from a strong popular artist.....KG
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Great series however if you have collected the box sets like myself you will be very disapointed in the way this product is packed. Why they couldn't keep the original packaging i don't know, cost cutting most likely. It is very disapointing.

0440244870|3.0|This is a cute book with a lot of humorous insight into the mind of a young woman living in London. I felt the ending was a little too predictable, however, and perhaps more suited to a younger reader.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|Outstanding! I have been a long time Derek Trucks Band fan and it just doesn't get any better than this. I have seen DTB play live several times (this is a treat you need to experience) and have also seen the Soul Stew Revival play. With my very first CD I bought of DTB over 12 years ago.....I knew then that this would become one of my more favorite bands. I like all of the music that the Derek Trucks Band play, but this has to be one of my favorites. It really has something for just about everybody!! I am not a music critic as an occupation, but I have a fairly extensive collection/variety of music (think Frank Sinatra to Linkin Park) and Derek Trucks and Band are great musicians!! If you get a chance to hear Derk talk about his music, you will find out that many artists and styles of music have influenced what he plays. The more that I listen to this CD the better it gets. He has such a great group of musicians to work with and it makes what he does all the better.
0060890096|5.0|I rarely write a review, but the performance of Jay O. Sanders in Catch-22 Audio CD version is so impressive that I  just have to.  The book can not be an easy read.  I don't think I would have gotten trough it.  Some of Heller's chapters/paragraphs are intentionally repetitive although funny.  Difficult to follow at times.   But with the help of Sanders who manages to give the various characters distinct voices/intonations, it is so much more enjoyable.  Amazing what a good actor can do.     If you have trouble with the book - get the audio CD narrated by Sanders!
B000FVGN00|5.0|Even if you just play the first five or so seconds of T-Rex's Slider, you know you are really, really onto something speical.<br /><br />\\"AWWWWWW Ohhhhhh Ohhhhh Yeahhhhhhhhh,\\" belt out ex-Turtles Flo and Eddie the second you cue the first track, \\"Metel Guru.\\" Before you can blink, you know you are in for one SERIOUS rock and roll party. Marc Boland does not have a voice like Kaylan or Volman, but he is smart enough not to compete. He simply lets his androgonoius chirp sail over the massvie sound of the backing track.<br /><br />This may just sound like basic, good rock production--I can't help but stick the knife in, back when people really understood how to record rock albums-but there is a secret weapon on Slider, and his name his Tony Visconti<br /><br />Visconti had produced a lot of early Bowie, Gentle Giant, and a lot of lesser known English bands. He has this way of taking a basic format rock band--maybe adding a few strings-and making the music siound really, really thick and yummy. This works particualarly well with a breathy voice like Boland's.<br /><br />The song writting here is great--little rock and roll poems-but it is the production, towering like that big top hat on Marc's little head, that makes this album a classic<br /><br />GET IT!

0786889284|5.0|This series of books, nine of them in fact, by Ridley Pearson containing the cop character Lou Boldt are the best.  Hard to put down once you pick it up and start reading.  I would love to see Ridley Pearson add to this series. The love of my life sent me \\"Undercurrents\\" as a Christmas gift and I was hooked after reading it and have ordered the next six in the series and looking forward to getting the last two.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I received the movie about 5 days after I purchased the movie. I think this is good considering I bought the movie two weeks before Christmas. The movie was not scratched and it never skipped. I never had to contact the seller for any miscommunication and I would buy from him again.
0143036556|5.0|\\"Collapse\\" is one of the most important books you could possibly read in our society today.  Through his analysis of earlier cultures that have collapsed you learn that nothing is guaranteed to last forever.  If a people and their culture don't make the right decisions, they can fail.  Failure means death on an apocalyptic scale.  His is not a shrill 'the sky is falling' voice but rather a calm, reasoned story teller.    He starts out the book with a long description of Montana.  At first you kind of wonder why is he spending so much time talking about a modern state when you're expecting ancient failed civilizations.  Gradually his point builds, and when you get it, it is profound and effective.     We are responsible for our choices and their consequences.
B002N1AERI|5.0|OK, I'm lying.  I don't really want more cowbell.  Ridiculous Saturday Night Live skit notwithstanding, I was just saying that to get your attention.  What I DO want, though, is to see more of this scorching lead guitar work on future Epica releases.  Band leader Mark Jansen had gone on record in the past as saying he only wanted to play rhythm guitar because that is what he is best at doing.  Former second guitarist Ad Sluijter had never wanted to play lead either.  So Epica's first three releases didn't have any lead guitar to speak of.    Enter Isaac Delahaye.  The new second guitarist was more than happy to shred some leads on this album, and it has taken this band to a new level.  While their previous opus, The Divine Conspiracy, was of course another wonderful platter of Epica brilliance, it did seem, at least to this listener, to get bogged down a bit in the muddied waters of sameness.  Familiar guitar rhythms, accentuated by the expected use of classical instruments.  Loved it, but not really anything different from the first two albums.    The lead solos now produced by Delahaye's axe light a new fire under the operatic mayhem and neo-classical wizardry already present with this band, opening wide vistas of potential melodic landscapes.  It allows the orchestral elements to be bigger, bolder, bulkier.  The classical background works so well with the lead guitar, each of them complementing the other seamlessly.    The beautiful Simone Simons is in top form, providing us with her usual power and professionalism behind the mic on every song.  Her dynamic vocal range infuses each song with emotional passion and variety, from in-your-face to serene, from fast to slow.  Spy the 1:54 mark on \\"Tides of Time\\" (a ballad), where she effortlessly glides from her higher pop registers in which she started the song, right into her higher operatic registers, without missing a beat.  Quite impressive.    Speaking of vocals, Jansen now has a partner in grunting crime, that of new drummer Arien van Weesenbeek, who lends his own growls to that of the band's fearless leader.    There are thirteen tracks on this album, two of which are short instrumental interludes and two of which are ballads (one being a duet with Sonata Arctica's Tony Kakko).  That means there are nine really solid - and delightfully long - heavy rockers.  \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", part V of Jansen's \\"A New Age Dawns\\" story, is the ever-present big epic found on every one of their albums, this one clocking in at thirteen and a half minutes and delivering so many impressive time changes and other surprising elements, that it will make your head spin.  The title track, which brings the album to a close and is the final piece of \\"A New Age Dawns\\", extends beyond nine minutes and has unique nuances of its own.    Subject-wise, the lyrics encompass a wide range of topics, but center on the idea of freedom and the illusion of freedom.  Note their use of audio clips that highlight the smarmy, vacuous rhetoric of political leaders, found in the interlude track \\"The Price of Freedom\\", and in the song \\"Semblance of Liberty\\".  They pull no punches here, laying open the hypocrisy of Western \\"freedom\\".  They even include Goethe's famous quote, in the song \\"Resign to Surrender\\", spoken, I assume, by Weesenbeek: \\"None are more hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe that they are free.\\"    So yeah, avoid the cowbell, guys.  Keep the lead guitars.  Once again you have proven your worthy status at the top of the Orchestral Metal hill.  I knew right away when I heard the first couple songs for the first time, that this was going to be one hell of an album.  I applaud loudly!
0393061310|5.0|I envy Jared Diamond.  His two books \\"Guns,Germs and Steel\\" and \\"Collapse\\" are products of a life well lived. He has combined his life experiences, education and his own reason to create works that move our society's intellectual wealth a giant leap forward.    Detractors may claim that his version of history dehumanizes events.  Rather, this work emphasizes that there are undeniable physical constraints and advantages each culture encounters.  It is these factors which provide the framework for individual choices and development.
0061849901|5.0|When I first read The Bell Jar, I think I was in 8th grade.  I got very into Plath and her poetry shortly thereafter.  The love and respect that I have for Plath is not easy to put into words.  I ended up studying her extensively in Grad School and writing my thesis on The Bell Jar.  After reading feminist criticism by Julia Kristevia who studied Jacques Lacan, I knew I had to base my thesis on this.  My argument was that Plath used feminine language in her novel that was in direct opposition with the 50s stereotypes that she was being forced into.  The only way for Ester Greenwood to back to what she felt was true was to descend into \\"madness\\" which was not madness at all but a way to cope with the life she was being FORCED to lead by those around her.  Ester was able to overcome her demons by basically rejecting the \\"masculine or symbolic\\" language and embracing the semiotic or feminine language that Kristevia described.  Plath rocks!

B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|I swim recreationally as I truly enjoy the full body workout. But, the extra neck action and cadence timing to breath is a factor in the speed in which I am able swim and the amount of swimming I am able to accomplish in the time allotted for my workout. This snorkel allows me to concentrate on my body (correct arm action and kicking out of the hips etc) during my swimming sessions and makes breathing effortless. I can really dig and get much more workout per minute then without. I go at a much quicker pace until my body begs me to stop instead of taking a rest period because Im unable to catch my breath. The only draw back was the first session or two learning to not breath at all through the nose (the recommendation to wear a nose clip might be important to some who try this for the first time) which was no worse than a slight discomfort until I exhaled stongly through my nose to clear which I am very used to now. And it looks a little silly but is always a topic of conversation with fellow swimmers who I have noticed are beginning to show up at the pool with them!

B002U6CJCE|4.0|A fun action film with plenty of good stunts and the three main actors getting their varied screen time to satisfy their fans. I had more fun with the supplements but the film handles itself enough to where you get your money's worth on the BD.<br /><br />The story takes place at a ransomed Chernobyl (Bulgaria subbed) by bad guys supported with a renegade scientist who happens to have his own Universal Soldier cache. They threaten to blow up one of the reactors unless some lame demands get met. Enter the American general played by Corey Johnson (worst performance I have seen for him) to facilitate using the cold storage Universal Soldiers. The story lumbers through the usual predictable fights and shootouts, but they got a UFC guy - Arlovski - to play the main bad soldier and he actually did a good job here. The writers found a way to get both Van Damme's and Lundgren's characters reused to meet again and the fun continues.<br /><br />The Blu clarity was outstanding with only a few falters scattered throughout. The DTS was amped way up, but it gets used prolifically. The guns were given some serious volume, but the dialogue (the cheese was kept to a minimum) never gets drowned out. The supplements are fun and include:<br /><br />* Behind the Lines, 20 minutes. A good documentary on the stunts and fights.<br />* Commentary with Lundgren and Hyams. I enjoyed listening to everything Dolph had to say about the project, working with Van Damme again, the hurdles of filming in Bulgaria, etc.<br />* MovieIQ. Turned this on while listening to the commentary so I am overloaded with trivia about these guys and the UniSol franchise right now - but it was worth the time.<br /><br />Region coded A/B/C with English subs only.

1592402690|3.0|Initially I was very taken by Geoff Emerick's story of his role as recording engineer for some of The Beatles' later albums. There is a lot to like about this book with its bird's eye view of the recording process, sitting elbow to elbow with George Martin, and explaining some of the innovations forced by the creativity of The Beatles and their restless demands for new sounds, especially in view of the stodgy conservatism of EMI. So hats off to Emerick for facilitating some of this great music by breaking rules left and right and experimenting intuitively to get the sounds they were groping for. Clearly he was a very creative sound engineer, just the ticket for this very creative group of musicians. I also enjoyed the story of his coming of age as a recording engineer. However his tone sours as the book goes on, to the extent that I found myself having to push through about the last third. I suppose this is fair enough given the souring of relations among The Beatles, but it doesn't make for very good reading. Apparently Emerick was a sensitive plant who couldn't bear the fall from grace of his heroes into pettiness and quarrelling.     But I was very surprised by how harsh Emerick is on George Harrison. Of course he was there, I wasn't. But if George Harrison's musicianship was really as limited and plodding as Emerick describes, it's hard to see how he would have come this far with this quick thinking, quick witted, musically restless and somewhat impatient bunch of musicians. Emerick describes Harrison as taking hours trying to work out a \\"Taxman\\" solo, only to have Paul say let me give it a go, and then rip off that smashing solo in two takes or so. Well, like I said, Emerick was there, but this view of Harrison permeates the book, it's not just about Paul grabbing the spirit of one song more quickly. I find this view of Harrison ungenerous and have to wonder about its accuracy. Sure, I sometimes ask the question \\"when did George stop being Carl Perkins and become himself?\\" And I find the tone of superiority that characterizes more than a few of his songs a bit tedious at times. But is it really true that he was so far behind his band mates as a musician that they had to cover for him? He certainly holds his own in the middle spot of that wonderful, single take, 3 guitar stand off in \\"The End\\" on Abbey Road.     It seems like every book I read on The Beatles as a group or as individuals, has this same kind of myopia. Is this a requirement of the genre - to establish for posterity which one was the lesser musician, or the odd man out, or the one to blame for whatever you want to blame them for. Geesh - like Lennon said later, \\"we were just a rock band that made it very, very big.\\" One of the great understatements of all time, but right to the point in insisting that they were just four people making music together. The important words here are people and together. All this talk about which one's the genius (was it Lennon, was it McCartney, was it Martin), is useless and beside the point. What is the point? The point is the alchemy of four people making music together. And in that there will always be an element of mystery.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Do you remember the thrill of going to see the Beatles in Help?  If you want to revisit your youth, or share the Beatlemania with the younger generation, this movie is for you.  It is obvious the \\"fab four\\" had a fun time making this movie.  Instead of complaining about the lack of Oscar winning drama they perform around some of the best music history or today has to offer.  My granddaughter is a Beatles fan and has now watched this movie several times.  It is a quality reproduction that is a nice break from the day to day stress.  Light and breezy, full of some favorite tunes.  Highly recommend.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I like that I can watch this series while my kids are around.  I try not to watch TV when they are up, but at least it is clean enough that if I want to finish an episode as they wake up from their nap I can.  I think the earlier seasons are better than the later seasons so 1-3 are probably worth owning.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I appreciate the illuminating eye opening information in this documentary. I have watched it multiple times and am sure I will watch it plenty more times. I have even shared this video with friends and family, and teens! I'm glad to say that even the teenagers were engaged in thought provoking dialogue after viewing this video. Many (friends, family and teenagers) found the information to be illuminating. It will definitely make you think about the way you shop for foods.

B00002EPJH|5.0|When I first heard this music on the radio I was mystified, because it sounded like Keith Jarrett musically, but had none of the hallmark vocalising or oral contributions one has come to live with on a Jarrett album. This is one of a small selection of albums I find to be perfect 'afterglow' music, just the right amount of tenderness and expansiveness to carry you into the cosmic dimension of relationship, where every note is a whisper of the Infinite, just as every moment with your lover seems to be the whole point of existence...
B0029P3II0|5.0|I had never heard of this group before this year. It's a good R&B, contemporary rock, adult rock, easy listening type of CD. Good voices. Worth the buy.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I've been a fan of this mini series for years and have owned it on both VHS and DVD.  The Blue Ray edition is by far superior with a super crisp picture and excellent sound quality.  I am very pleased.
B002OUTIOI|5.0|If you are a Mika fan you will like this CD. He is a very good musician, songwriter, and singer. I admire artists who do it all themselves and don't just cover other people's work.
B000W91RUG|5.0|We fell in love with Big Bang the end of last season.  Thought we'd catch up with previous seasons.  We watch these when we want a relaxing laugh in the evenings.  Makes us love it even more.  Being somewhat of a nerd myself, I'm happy to see that Nerds Rules!
B00005QCFI|1.0|I was hoping that this one comes with a better presentation, I was specting for a digipak or something like that, this one is a vinyl replica but the vinyl replicas from Iron Maiden are kick ass, this one from scorpions could be better... This is expensive for the presentation... Awful.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I do not even know how to describe the greatness that is this movie. I watched it three times in theaters and honestly it probably is BEST in theaters. All the sounds and actions and everything wow. But it looks great anywhere. I like this new concept of remaking Star Trek and do hope the next one is an original story kind of like this one was. All the characters picked are PERFECT. Really...the director knew what he was doing. I know I hear a lot of beef coming from old school Trekkies who are saying how this is not like the original and it's blasphemous blah blah. This movie is meant to appeal to the NEW generations. I hardly think of the new people as the old people. These are all new characters who happen to have been inspired by the original Star Trek. And it works.     The only problem I had with the whole entire movie was Uhura being Spock's love interest. Doesn't really make sense. I also do not see why she was put on this cover since the main theme of this movie is the tension and forming friendship between Kirk and Spock. I personally believe she was put there as an object to deter people from imagining a sexual tension between the Captain and his First Officer heh. That's what happened with the original Star Trek and honestly, you can not stop it with this one. BUT this is my opinion and isn't even a review. Just a hint.
B0002Y62II|5.0|I do not speak German, but you don't have to too enjoy the hard driving metal sounds and emotion. When I am feeling low I will listen to this to pick my spirits up.
B001NXBRJG|2.0|The blu-ray transfer for this loked fairly appalling to my eye. Each layer of depth looked overly independent and made the film look very false. I don't know of a better way to describe it, but even at the very low black friday price I would rather buy a regular dvd copy and watch that. Not recommended.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Great series, well acted, shot period piece, with interesting perspective on the meaning of life. Blu ray extra features give interesting insight and of course the picture and audio are superb.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|this is a great movie. if you have seen firefly this movie just continues the amazing series. if you havent seen firefly this will still be an awesome action movie. For the price this is a definite buy!
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|This DVD came damaged .It was not secured in the case and therefore has scatches.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is a great series if you havent already seen it. this price is a steal. it comes in a nice metal case with all 6 DVDs. but if you havent seen this series you have to watch it and pay close attention to what is going on. I had trouble my first time seeing this because you get introduced to the characters early and you are expected to remember who is who. Eventually once you get to the last few discs you are \\"googling\\" the characters. so this is not one of those series you can just throw on the TV and do some homework too because 1) you wont know what is going on and 2) you wont get any homework done.. all that aside this is most definitely worth it! there is so much action and every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!
B002RSDWF8|5.0|I must admit that I did enjoy \\"Wait For Me\\" - the original version.  It is low key and beautiful.  Moby is well known for his upbeat dance club songs, but it is the melancholic Moby that really is wonderful.    This album is a far departure from \\"Last Night\\".  While the original \\"Wait For Me\\" is already an ambient masterpiece, Moby takes it one step further with this bonus ambient cd.  A beautiful addition.  Then, you also get the dvd with interviews, videos, and live performances.    I highly recommend this purchase for any fan of ambient music or Moby.  Even if you already have the original cd, this is worthy.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|In 16th century Japan, protracted feudal wars have created a prevailing sense of lawlessness. Bandits have organized into formidable armies that scavenge the countryside in search of villages to loot. One morning, a band of thieves arrive at the outskirts of a farming community, but is persuaded to delay their attack until the barley has been harvested. A peasant farmer overhears their plan, and summons the villagers for a town meeting. The farmers seek counsel from the village elder (Kuninori Todo) who advises them to hire \\"hungry samurai\\" who would protect their village in exchange for meals. But the task of finding formidable samurais who will accept such a meager compensation proves to be a difficult task. One day, the farmers witness a middle-aged ronin (masterless samurai) named Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) single-handedly rescue an abducted child by relying solely on his cunning intelligence and precise technical skill. Kambei has grown weary of fighting, but the plight of the farmers wins his sympathy, and he agrees to take up their seemingly hopeless cause. Kambei's victory also attracts the attention of a young man named Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao Kimura), who asks to become his disciple, and a brash, overconfident drifter (Toshiro Mifune), who is eager to match his skills with the seasoned samurai. Despite the time constraint and lack of reward, Kambei assembles a team of capable, altruistic samurais: a dedicated colleague, Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), willing to face death for his dear friend; an agile, confident samurai, Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba), touched by Kambei's sincerity and generosity; a cheerful, but average swordsman, Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), whose experience often involves fleeing from battle; an expert swordsman, Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), seeking to hone his craft. With the crop harvest imminent, the samurais must fortify the farming village, devise a combat strategy to counter the invasion, and train the peasants for battle.    Seven Samurai isan engaging, precisely crafted story of selfless bravery, perseverance, and fraternity. Using medium shots and seamless, slow motion in order to temper the violence of death, Akira Kurosawa succeeds in creating a delicate juxtaposition between the samurais' graceful art of combat and the barbaric reality of war: Kambei's rescue of the abducted child; the fencing challenge in an open field; the arrival of the bandits on horseback for the decisive battle. But the mastery of the film lies beyond the fluid choreography of the battle sequences. Seven Samurai is an equally compelling tale of poverty and despair, redemption and purpose, community and heroism - a sweeping, epic portrait of individual courage and the tenacity of the human soul.
B00158K0S8|5.0|This is my third installment of of the movie Patton - VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray, and this is certainly the best of the bunch.  Excellent reproduction of the original, great sound and additional features that, for a change, are worth watching: historical bio of Patton, reminiscence by Francis Ford Coppola on the research, writing, and the behind the making of the movie, and some trailers.  My father loved this movie (he was a Lt. in Patton's 3rd Army during WWII).  He took me to see it when it first came out in 1970, during the height/depth of the Vietnam war so I guess it will always bring back memories. I figure he would have liked to have seen this version, too.  Although it certainly glorifies the man and the times, the movie continues to be worth a watch every now and then. One of the few.  Worth the price of another gadget - blu-ray player.  Now what to do with the other 2 versions...
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The show is great! What more is there to say? If you like vampire shows and want something that is adult rated and quality, then this is the show for you.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|While not reading actual feedback on the movie, just the star ratings, I expected a B movie with not much going for it but special effects.  I was surprised in that I liked this movie very much. I thought the premise was good, and honestly, can't understand some of the harsh reviews.  It's not a perfect plot -- I figured one element out right away -- but still enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I won't go over the storyline.  In fact, try to go in knowing nothing about the movie, and I think you may enjoy it more.  I went in totally blind so didn't know what to expect.  I felt the acting was really good, with Bruce Willis coming off as a very believable main character.  I enjoyed seeing other actors from some of my favorite movies and felt everyone gave a good performance.  I wish James Cromwell could have had more scenes.  Many complaints about the movie is too little character development, but I liked the way the story unfolded with minimal info.  I think it played better in this movie.<br /><br />The regular DVD has no major bonus features other than a commentary by the director and a music video.<br /><br />This was a rental for me, but I liked it enough that I will buy the movie.  Please give it a chance.  Like me, I believe you will be surprised.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I played a copy of this for extended family over the holidays, and everyone enjoyed it so much that I bought copies for everyone.  An amazing interpretation of the Rolling Stones Wild Horses.  Not just a beautiful voice.  A thoughtful and creative artist.
B000WLIEKK|5.0|Opinions aside, Alter Bridge is a technically great band.  Guitar, vocals, bass, drums are solid and the melodies are full of hooks.  Creed?  Creed who?  The Creed discusion is over.  Alter Bridge is working on their third album as I type and that is all that matters.  Forget the past and embrace the future.  Great band with brilliant music.
B002ZG4Q5W|3.0|UPDATE (02/07/10): Watched the film last night with a friend who had received a copy for review.  And while the video presentation wasn't up to the standards that we've come to expect from a Criterion style release it is clear to me that this is also not the same video encoding that we're seen with other releases.  That said I was still disappointed with how inconsistent the video quality looked.  It does not show the high level of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) that has been excessively used in other releases but the film grain that does remain is inconsistent throughout.  On a whole the color palette does show improvement and the imagine is sharp in comparison.  We did find instances of edge enhancement but they took some searching to locate and were not noticeable from a proper seating distance.  In the end we attributed some of these faults to what are likely problems with the master.     All-in-all we agreed that this is the best Ran has looked on any home format to-date.  While it doesn't live up to our own expectations it is still be worth the upgrade for those who are looking for the best home representation of the film.  Recommended - 3 stars    Note this release is region locked.    ORIGINAL COMMENTS: Initially back in Feb 2009 Criterion, the definitive masters of bringing classic films to home theaters, announced the release of Ran however only a few short weeks later Jon Mulvaney sent out a statement that they were canceling the release due to \\"rights issues\\".  Since this time the SD and HD distribution rights have gone back to Lionsgate's StudioCanal which is releasing the version you see here.    Lionsgate's PR described the Blu-ray release as follows:  \\"Akira Kurosawa's brilliantly conceived re-telling of Shakespeare's King Lear magically mixes Japanese history, Shakespeare's plot and Kurosawa's own feelings about loyalty in this epic masterpiece that was named one of Empire Magazine's \\"500 Greatest Movies of All Time.\\"  Set in 16th century Japan, an aging ruler, Lord Hidetora announces his intention to divide his land equally among his three sons.  Hidetora's decision to step down unleashes a power struggle between the three heirs when he falls prey to the false flattery bestowed upon him by the two older sons and banishes the youngest for speaking the truth.  That ruthless betrayal ultimately drives Hidetora insane, destroying his entire family and kingdom. Deep human emotion and outstanding acting combine to create one of the most acclaimed foreign films of all time that was hailed as \\"a great, glorious achievement\\" by the Chicago Sun-Times and \\"as close to perfect as filmmaking gets\\" by the San Francisco Chronicle.  The Blu-ray Disc is presented in 1080P High Definition Widescreen format with Japanese, English, Spanish, French, German and Italian DTS Master Audio.  Special features on the disc include \\"A.K.\\" - the acclaimed feature-length documentary on the making of the film, \\"Akira Kurosawa: The Epic and the Intimate\\" - documentary on the director, a Portrait of Akira Kurosawa by Japanese cinema expert and interpreter Catherine Cadou, \\"The Samurai\\" - documentary on Samurai art, \\"Art of the Samurai\\" - an interview with a Japanese art of war expert plus BD-Live and a 20-page collectible booklet.\\"    Only time will tell if Lionsgate's StudioCanal can live up to the standards set by Criterion.  The current international Jesnet release, as reviewed by [...], shows to be mastered from a poor quality source or worse upconverted from a SD master.  That release has a very hazy look with serious levels of compression artifacts and speckles in the image.     Once the final product is released I'll update this review with commentary on the A/V quality.  Here's hoping for the best!

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We bought Castle for our son for Christmas at his request, and have ended up watching the whole first season with him on DVD.  The program is entertaining, has some sparkling dialog, and each episode twists the plot as appropriate and needed to be interesting.  The writers deserve credit for not building the romance between the two main characters too quickly, which has ruined many other series before their time.  It seems that the writers have a tendency to give Beckett the upper hand in the verbal sparring with Castle, and that's worked pretty well.  We're watching the show on broadcast TV now as a result of seeing the first season DVDs.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|a fantastic Marvel movie
B001FB55HQ|4.0|This really is a good movie. Good action. Good acting. and above all it's a good-dang Terminator movie I am not looking for Academy Award stuff here. I just want a movie that has explosions and robots. Does the movie have to have a good script? No, the thing that makes the old movies so good is the ridiculous script. I want people to stop whining that this movie sucked because if you compare it to the old films, without letting your biased for the \\"classics\\" get in your way, then this movie is actually better then the first two. The third one was really just a mistake and I will acknowledge that at least.<br /><br />So if you want a good action movie with a decent story, and quite convoluted at times if you think about it,then watch this one.<br /><br />PS think about the title of this review also while you watch.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Shot in just 33 days for a paltry $5 million by first time director Duncan Jones, MOON is as much of a breakthrough for this unknown director as [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]] was for (relatively new) Neill Blomkamp. Yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />Clocking in at only 97 minutes, the film also gives a sense of urgency to a situation that easily could have been snooze inducing. Instead, Moon will have you on the edge of your proverbial couch, cheering on its main protagonist(s) and asking tough questions about big business, genetic research, and what it means to be human.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell ([[ASIN:B001TH93GU Frost/Nixon]]) is in almost every frame and pulls in an Oscar caliber performance (although I doubt he'll get nominated since this isn't a big budget flick and hit only a limited number of theaters before going to DVD). Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a lonely man. In fact, he is the only man at a moon-base that collects Helium-3, a valuable energy commodity that gets shot back to Earth. Sam's only companion is a Hal-9000-ish machine called Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey, [[ASIN:B001AMHNKW Recount]]) who's sole job is to protect Sam. But not for long, because Sam's three year contract at the lunar base is coming to a close and he's ready to return to his beautiful wife and daughter back home. But an accident injures Sam and he awakens in the infirmary with Gerty caring for him.<br /><br />Memory gaps and surprisingly good physical condition (after such a bad accident) allows Sam to get back to work quickly. But he soon discovers a stranger trapped in a vehicle, and this stranger looks a lot like Sam.<br /><br />As the two Sam's fight, argue and eventually gain an understanding of what they are, a terrible realization hits them both. It is a poignant, graphic and horrible moment that will have many a hair standing up on peoples' necks when they see what has happened and what lengths a corporation is willing to go to in order to minimize expenses.<br /><br />The time spans are fascinating and leave much open for discussion. How long can one truly last living alone on the moon? How much radiation exposure would you get? And how long, genetically, was Sam designed to last? None of the answers are readily available, but most viewers will be asking themselves these things long after the movie has finished running its final credits.<br /><br />Congratulations must be given to director Duncan Jones for chasing after Sam Rockwell to do this role; he was, no doubt, the absolute perfect person to do it. Also, the miniature moon-scape scenes were phenomenal and never looked cheap or forced, as did the lunar station.<br /><br />The music was the perfect mix of creepiness and forlorn so that you really don't know how to feel about Sam and his predicament at the end. Empathy is there for sure, but what good it does is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Looking for a great independent film that you won't soon forget? Shoot for the Moon.h open for discussion.

B001DXS4E2|5.0|I've searched locally for this movie for years.  The movie is quite older than I am, and I remember seeing it as a young teenager many years ago.  I saw it twice, maybe three times and thought it was just great.  I've been so disappointed that I couldn't find it. I checked on Amazon in November 2009, and not only was it there, but in a wonderful package including the black and white and a colorized version, not to mention a CD of all the songs sung in the movie.  Wonderful!  I love it!  If you are in the market for a wonderfully entertaining musical movie with comedy and romance thrown in, this is definately worth the price!  THANKS, Amazon.com!!

It needs to be told, I hope more people listen and want to make a change. It makes me think that maybe a global disaster would not be so bad, then maybe these big corporations and laws would be null. Just back to the good old days where people had to work for their food. Where food was grown the healthy way. I am sick to my stomach over this. I am not sure where to start but I will do what I can and go from there.

B002VECLVO|5.0|I read Christopher Isherwood's novel A Single Man at least a dozen years ago, and remember thinking it a real downer.  So, when I heard that Tom Ford was making a film my reaction was - of all the gay literature, why A Single Man?  Well, Tom obviously knows best, for A Single Man is one of the best films of the year - if not the best.<br /><br />  I've read a number of derogatory comments about former fashion designer Ford's artsy-fartsy direction, and its all garbage.  Each of the production elements is top drawer: the music, costumes and cinematography are elegant and sophisticated.  The look of the film is fresh and it moves with a sexy, sinewy fluidity.  The screenplay by Ford and  David Scearce is as faithful an adaptation from a literary source as I have ever seen.<br /><br />  The cast is headed by a brilliant Colin Firth as George, a literature professor who has on<br />ly recently lost his companion of 16 years (Matthew Goode).  Firth has been one of those generic British actors who fill out the casts of costume dramas like Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient, or plays the second lead in comedic films like Bridget Jones' Diary or Mama Mia!  His performance here is simply a revelation, communicating volumes with a simple glance or gesture, his face registering each emotion with a subtlety and surety that warrants idolatrous praise and prizes.<br /><br />  Unlike Firth, Julianne Moore has been delivering great performances for the better part of two decades.  As George's lonely, boozy, British friend Charley, Moore creates an indelible character, perfectly articulated without a trace of overreaching or camp.  Goode, from last year's Brideshead Revisited, plays George's deceased lover Jim; Jon Kortajarena plays a fetching young hustler; and Nicholas Hoult (from About a Boy) plays Kenny, a student who pursues George, reviving his faith in the possible and the future.<br /><br />  In lesser hands this could have turned into a vapid or maudlin `day in the life' or `a grief observed' movie of the week.  However, the opposite is true.  A Single Man is a sad, though oddly life-affirming film.rved' movie of the week.  However, the opposite is true.

Easy fast reading. Made me start thinking and playing differently immediately. It's surely worth your time.

Even though we don't live in the US everything they do effects us so we wanted to know how he ticks.    I wish alot of people would read this book and they might be a little more supportive of helping him get the country on the right track instead of making things worse.  I believe he truly has the good of the nation in his heart and will try and do his best with such a bad situation.  He also has done alot more hands on then alot of people give him credit for.    He has our support.............

B000L3CHC0|5.0|The watch arrived as advertised and I have to say it's a beautiful piece of work and the pictures don't do it justice. The Tissot packaging is phenominal with even a nice little book detailing the company history which is amazing. Apart from that, the watch is more than I was expecting and the band is stunning. Since I'm not a large guy I was worried the watch might look too large for me. It doesn't. While it's a thick watch, its not a wide watch. The perfect watch for dressy occasions or everyday use. Altogether, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it highly.
B002WDD8TS|5.0|the cd is great however the title of the product, \\"\\"\\"\\"\\"New Moon Soundtrack: Deluxe Edition (CD & DVD)\\"\\"\\"...makes one believe it is the cd AND the movie...

B001F9Y2CM|5.0|Finally, All of ABBA's albums and an extra bonus CD in one 9 disc set.The sound quality is excellent. You gotta have this if you're a fan.Several tracs I'd never heard befor. Each disc is in its own original album cover sleeve. The bonus tracks boocklet is full of timely facts about the release of each album. A great price for such a collection.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This season doesn't let you down. Plots are still unexpected and well thought out. Actors are great and characters continue to develop in ways we care about.    It is a shame that there are no subtitles available on this set.     The first disk of this set was faulty although it was replaced quickly and painlessly.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have been watching the Star Trek series since it first aired. This is the most visually impressive installment of the movie series. The story line might upset a few of the Trekkers who watch, but it does open up a whole new experience with the franchise. I highly recommend this movie whether you are a Trekker, or not. I will keep you on the edge of your seat. Five stars.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Excellent picture and sound.  If you have an excellent stereo system to play this through or a good surround sound system, you will be thrilled.  The picture is also excellent and it is a good story.  This is one you will want to own on Blu-ray.
0307593525|5.0|This set is a classic and anyone who wants to improve their cooking skills would do well to have this in their kitchen. A word of warning though, there are a lot of steps to these recipes and if you like quick and easy cooking this is not the book set for you. If you are willing to put in the time and effort the end result is definitely worth it.As for the price, I did a lot of research before purchasing this set and Amazon had the best price.(new)
B001PPLJJ0|4.0|The story is intriguing and the picture and sound are also very good.  It is a serious piece.  However, this is not a Blu-ray to own because of the sights and sounds (though they are done well).  This one is about the story, which is how it should be.  It is a good and provocative story a bout young love and growing up.  You may not agree with the young man's choices (I did not), but they are certainly real and probable.  I recommend this movie, certainly at a discounted price.  I own it and am happy I do own it.  Thank you.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|As a Harry Potter fan I had to get this latest enstallment of the series.  I went straight to Amazon for my purchase and as I expected, I was not dissapointed.  The movie was priced very reasonably and the purchasing procedure was fast and easy.  The movie was in my mailbox within 5 days and I was watching it that night.  Thanks, Amazon, for a great buy, as always.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|It's hard to put into words exactly how obsessed I am with this series.<br /><br />This is the definitive visual history of humanity's greatest war. In the three or so years I've had it, I've watched the whole series--all 26 episodes--about 6 or 7 times. And some favorite episodes, like the one on Stalingrad, I'll watch twice each time around. (It's always excellent, but I particularly like watching that one during breakups or other romantic woes, as it really keeps things in perspective.)<br /><br />I don't know of any better single-volume documentary treatment of the Second World War; what's more, I don't think there ever will be one. It came out in 1974, long enough after the war that passions had cooled, but soon enough that many of the principals could be interviewed with their memories intact. To see, say, the completely unrepentant recollections of the pilot of the Enola Gay, Paul Tibbets, intercut with first-person testimony from a survivor of the bombing of Hiroshima, or Albert Speer's musings on the bureaucratic squabbling that hampered weapons production in the Third Reich--these are testimonies that could never be replicated.<br /><br />And the strength of the series is that it views itself that way, as a testimony, a witness to all the dead of the world's most destructive war. It is not just the powerful we see interviewed here, but the meek, the lowly--the housewife who survived the siege of Leningrad, the Britons who endured the Blitz, the German journalist who watched his countrymen leaping into burning water during the firebombing of Hamburg. And we get the firsthand imagery to make this testimony real; we see footage of unresisting Jews being gunned down while they stand on the edge of open graves, and frozen German corpses on the banks of the Volga River after the disastrous battle of Stalingrad, and incendiary bombs setting fire to the heart of Japan's wooden cities. Still, it isn't just gut-wrenching eye-candy; there's real analysis of the big picture to complement the close-ups of the gritty details. Aside from the maps and diagrams, there are sharp, concise observations to make it all make sense; of the German 6th Army's surrender at Stalingrad, for instance, Laurence Olivier's narration intones: \\"This was no ordinary defeat. It was a catastrophe.\\"<br /><br />The only serious complaint about this series is in how the episodes are broken down. It's a little Anglo-centric in the time allotted to its various subjects--we probably didn't need a separate episode for the Blitz AND the English home front, for instance, if we're not going to get much of substance on the Yugoslav partisans and nothing at all about the Czechoslovakians who assassinated Heydrich; also, dedicating a whole episode to Burma seems disproportionate, given the relative lack of time spent on other fronts of the war on Japan. But we do at least see a more complicated portrait of the British than we might have gotten; we see both the stoic victims of the Blitz, and the vengeful streak that sought to wreak an Old Testament-style retaliation in turn. \\"They have sown the wind,\\" British Air Marshall Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris says in one episode, providing his justification for the RAF's nighttime bombing raids that killed hundreds of thousands of innocent German civilians: \\"And they shall reap the whirlwind.\\"<br /><br />This quote gets at what makes this series truly timeless, and worthwhile, despite the quibbles: it resists the temptation to take sides, and instead shows the British as it shows all sides. Rather than making simple judgments, it show that humanity's greatest war also took some humanity from all who fought in it, and--to a greater or lesser extent--everyone ended up as both victim and persecutor in turn.close-ups of the gritty details.

B00102F5WK|1.0|So, first of all, the story is told in a warped time sense that doesn't work until the very end.  Second, so now the suicide bombers are the sympathetic characters?  I don't think so.  I totally hated this movie.  I'm so sick of hollywood scratching the bottom of the barrel for things they can blame on America.
B001V7R09A|4.0|Yes, truly a master artist, but the sound quality is poor and the recitals are studded with coughs and other noises that distract. Pity, as the recitals are some of his best music. There are several CDs in the box set. some are good. Overall, not sure I will listen to them all that often due to the poor quality. Interesting to own but probably would not have bought this box set-rather choose individual recordings that have better recording techniques and unfortunately not the live performances....

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Several times, Star Trek has exhausted it potential, only to be renewed.  While I enjoyed the first series the most when it came out and watched it for years as reruns, I really got into the Next Generation (after initial resistance).  TNG was not just a re-tread, but a culmination and maturation of themes evident in the first series.<br /><br />Kirk would blast his way out of a complicated situation, with some cheesy philosophical observations that rang just true enough.  I loved all of it totally, non-critically, to the point that I did not question it until I was middle aged.  It is the best show that I ever knew.  Period.  You got all the great hard sci-fi themes:  time travel, a new kind of empire, wonderful characters in complicated cultures, and technological power pushing the edge of science.  Indeed, not to exaggerate, it informed my intellectual pursuits through college.<br /><br />Then, I discovered how fabulous TNG was:  rather than military and impetuous, it was studied, disciplined, and diplomatic.  Once again, it synched with my interests:  international relations and institutions, cultures, historical influences, simple alien mystery.  TNG was even better than the original, though emotionally I will always prefer Kirk and Spock,<br /><br />To me, Deep Space 9 and Voyager seemed like pale attempts to breath life into the series.  As a friend of mine said, \\"none of the aliens are interesting.\\"  I could watch them, but I always felt a \\"so what\\" in the back of my mind.<br /><br />So here we are.  I think that this film may be a successful reinvention.  Because of a time warp, an alternate reality is created, complete with two Spocks existing in the same space.  This alters the universe, opening possibilities for an entirely new series, one up to date in ways I can't imagine or articulate.  OK, I though the resoltion of this film was a bit under par, like the origianl TV series a bit impetuous, but the themes work and are pretty deep with fun variation.  Will Spock and Uhura have a love child?  How will Spock's relation with his father change?  What is Kirk like without having grown up with his father?  Fun stuff for the greatest (and most profitable) franchise hollywood ever created.  THe best thing about it is that you can re-watch it multiple times - there are uncountable in-jokes, subtle allusions, and so many new avenues opened up.  Finally, it has a pace of action that brings it to Star Wars levels, with absolutely fabulous special effects.<br /><br />Recommended?  Yeah.Will Spock and Uhura have a love child?

0679805273|4.0|I bought this book - after coincidently reading about it on the web. (Actually I was doing a google-search on 'rejection'). Needless to say, Dr Seuss' book has some meaningful insights to life, and the challenges we all face from time to time. (I'm 38)<br />Pick up a used copy and read it. No need to buy a new one, I kinda liked the one I got with the inscription from some kid. I bought 3 more copies for friends that I guess will like reading this book at different stages in their lives. And if you have kids? Then you should be reading the book aloud already.

I'm not real crazy about those kinds of movies for children (my grandson is 11)but his parents okayed it and it made him happy more so than some I probably would have chosen.  Price of the item and delivery time were exceptional.  Thank you very much for your prompt attention to my order.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Absolutely brilliant and surpassing a lot of the young \\"stars\\" from overnight succees. Sir Mccartney sure is alive and kicking.  Nice versions of the old beatle and wings songs and well presented. I have always been reluctant when it comes to re-do old material but this is nothing but great due to the band and their input. This live DVD turns off the light of Scorsesee and the Stones.
0810983915|5.0|Greg Heffley wants to spend his summer indoors, relaxing, playing video games with his friend, Rowley, and watching late-night horror films. His mom has other ideas, however. She wants him to spend time with the family, improving his education, and playing outdoors.<br /><br />Greg tries to implement his ideas of summer, but without much success. He tries to spend time with Rowley kicking back at his friend's father's country club, but gets permanently uninvited when he accidentally tells the clubhouse manager his complaints about the place's service. Things only get worse when his mom tells him he has to find a way to pay off half of the smoothie bill he and Rowley racked up.<br /><br />When Greg's father comes home with a dog that won't leave him alone, he's soon at his wits end. With failed attempts to earn money, a falling out with his best friend, and a crazy dog, will Greg ever survive summer? Will he find some way to make this into a great summer, despite the rocky start?<br /><br />This fourth installment is an excellent addition to the other three stories. Greg's true character really comes out in this novel as he discovers who he is, learns to balance everything that's going on, and takes an easy-going approach to life. The illustrations are well-done and only add to the book's humor.<br /><br />Avid and reluctant readers alike who have loved the other DIARY OF A WIMPY KID books, who like humorous stories, or who prefer reading realistic fiction will all enjoy this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Kira M
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Very dissapointed with this purchase, as other reviewers said it before. About half of the discs are defective. Episodes would freeze in the middle of playing them, or the disc won't play at all. Sadly, this is going back for a refund.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I have not been familiar with the doings of Julia Child or her existence, but I love food and wine, the culinary experience of life. I did not need a lot of convincing to buy this DVD, the actual truth is I could not wait for it to arrive so that I also can get familiar with \\"The Julia\\". You see my daughter is very much into cooking, I just love to eat the food. No back where I started.. I received the DVD, so yes we are living in the middle east as expats, any arrival of a parcel is a BIG event, but the arrival of Julie and Julia was a special event! It is just me and daughter at home, poor hubby is earning the bucks off shore...:), but what make this event so special is that we will not be interrupted when we watch our so called girlie movies. Rushed home, no problem that their is no food prepared, making ourselves comfortable on the couch, we are having dinner with Julie and Julia tonight!  Meryl Streep is an outstanding actress and I loved her in the role of Julia. So much to say about Amy Adams' performance... she is like a cool summer breeze smelling like lavendar, what a delight to watch her.   Definately one of my top movies, a masterpiece.

0060723513|1.0|I read this book ten years ago and am ashamed to admit it. It was so very obviously a new age fantasy novel masquerading as truth or near-truth, that to finish the entire book was an exercise in self-deceit. Enough reviewers have produced salient points to this effect that I submit this review only to add one more point that has been overlooked by those unfamiliar with its source.    Margo Morgan quotes an aboriginal with a sort of poem or statement about clouds and coming and going that is a verbatim plagarism of a mostly obscure poem by Seung Sahn Sunim, a Korean Zen master. It has been ten years, so I won't attempt the quote myself, but the memory of her blatant dishonesty saddens me to this day.
1596680296|3.0|I bought this book thinking it came with magic...it didn't. I expected step-by-step easy directions for basic socks, what I got was how to do a gauge swatch followed by a couple of patterns that one might very well find for free online. It just wasn't happening for me. Im sure I'll pick this book up years from now and love the patterns, but right now, I find the book to be personally useless. I should mention that I'm a visual learner (via youtube and such) and I dont always swear an oath to swatches. Someone who relies entirely on swatches and reading material to learn how to knit would probably get a lot out of this book. Just so you know, this book does not include courage, patience, or magic powder that keeps your DPNs from sliding. It does, however, have lovely pictures.
B001BRDXCS|5.0|Brotherhood is not just another compilation by the Brothers, Keep my composure makes you feel the flow, and Midnight Madness, well, is madness! a very, very good track. Despite it has some of the tracks that made them what they are, it still can make you dance, it sounds still fresh and its an easy listening record. A must have for every Chemical Fan, and why not, for everyone that likes to try something new.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Finally, a movie that realistically depicts a relationship!  The opening line, \\"You should be warned, this is not a love story\\" perfectly describes the story. Although it's a boy-meets-girl movie, it doesn't take views on the typical saga of fighting, cheating, and getting back together. It is hilarious and depressing at the same time. Also its a non-linear narrative that goes back and forth between the past and present which makes it very interesting. This is a must see 'love story'!
B0033807C2|5.0|okay first off great book   secondly i loved it when annabeth and percy are finally together but i think he should have tooken the immortality and asked if annabeth could be immortal with him   sadly he didnt    also id like to ask is this the last book in the series it better not be theres still another prophecy and heaps of greek mythology to explore
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing so much about this woman from friends and seeing her in the press almost constantly.  Not a country fan, but what the heck?  Was impressed at how great the songs are.  Taylor really seems to have tapped into something here.  She is the woman we were, the woman we want to be, and the woman we all can be.  Really heartfelt stuff.  Performance is ok.  She is a young artist.  With songs like these though, you don't need to be the best performer to make them really shine.    Can't wait to hear what she does next, as she gets develops more.  I really think this is one new artist who is hear to stay!
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Regardless of where you stand with Lady Gaga, there's no denying how catchy her music can be at times. Everywhere from the radio, to youtube, Lady Gaga inhabits. So while there is no escape, there is some interesting music to be heard by today's pop standards. \\"The Fame Monster\\" alone is an eight track EP that represents a whole other side to Gaga's 2008 similarly named album \\"The Fame\\". The songs featured on monster are much quirkier and simply put darker.<br /><br />Everyone should be familiar with her past singles, if you are a fan of those chances are you'll meet her new one \\"Bad Romance\\" with the same respect (if not a little bit of the creeps). This EP is to be considered the yin to the Fames yang. I personally feel these new tracks are stronger, but take a little bit of time to adjust. Those buying this album will be happy to know (if they haven't caught on already) this EP comes along with the entire LP. So you get a lot of bang for your buck, and its shortcomings can be dealt (some filler for example) with the blistering high notes of her better material.<br /><br />What's interesting about this album is the sheer number of songs that will instantly capture your attention (again I say this with both albums being brought into the picture). Most pop, and electronic artist have one track that remains a staple off a release and the rest usually is one way or another filler. The electronic beats are sick, the vocals are outstanding, and the number of songs you get can't be beat.<br /><br />I was originally going to give the album a three out of five, but after much reconsideration I felt it really deserves the four (especially being accompanied with the album that made all this happen).

0060005696|1.0|I do not debate the point that too many products and choices lead to confusion and confusion leads to unhappiness.  I would like to suppose that what the book sites as too many choices, in fact amounts to very few ones.  That most choices we are facing are not choices at all, but the same stuff in different packaging to create an illusion of choice. The examples are many and range from tires manufactured by the same company from the same materials on the same production lines under different brand names  and sold for different prices, to political parties that pursue the same policies but differentiate by ideological rhetoric.<br /><br />The premise of this book is stupid or dishonest.
6305090564|4.0|Well casted, subtly funny, and of course action packed, this should've been a much bigger hit than the so-called critics gave it. Then again, I've said it before, and here it comes again, broken record or not, with most movies, who really cares what they think? Not me! To me, the critics don't know squat about good movies-of any genre.  I'm no expert on movies, but usually, I judge movies on my own criteria-story, direction, cast, special f/x, music, basically, I analyze every part before trashing it, it appears most people here do the same, as they should.  My opinion on this movie is it's well acted, good story, although somewhat cheezy, but that was probably the idea, the f/x were convincing enough for me, plus the charecters are hardly wooden-the bad guys are easy to hate, Treat Williams and Famke Jennsen are easy to like, even though she started off bad, Anthony Heald, whom you may remember as Dr.Chilton from Silence of the Lambs once again plays his role to the helm. Director Stephen Sommers, famous now for combining action, horror, adventure, and humor-was very successful with the elements here, as he normally is, plus I also liked the Mummy films-by him, I also don't really see those as remakes of the classics, admittedly though I haven't seen those, so I can't judge them either way. Long story short, if you haven't seen this, give it a shot, you may be surprised.
159562015X|1.0|This was recommended and I took it, but the test is timed and you only have one chance to answer the questions that are critical to the rest of the book making sense.  I was a bit busy when I tried to take it and was quite displeased to find out the only way to update or revise your responses is to buy the book again.

B001PU8N0I|2.0|I loved Little Dorrit as a novel.  But I could not make heads or tails of the dvds.  It was a kaleidoscope of complexity that did not progress, but also did not end in a satisfying manner.  I require that all film end in a way that makes me more deeply understanding of the basic story.  There were some themes that came through: the pride of little Dorrit's father in his elevated role inside the debtor's prison, but the little Dorrit I imagined from the novel was not an insignificant figure, a simple tattered waif.  She had something compelling about her in the novel that transcended her pecuniary status.    I am not angry at the people at BBC who tried to bring this novel to film.  But they need to try again, and I will buy it if they do.   I must read the novel again in order to even understand the dvd.  It is a hodge-podge of miscellany from the novel that does not explain the novel.  I can imagine how hard it is to do Little Dorrit.  I know only two people personally who have read it, my sister whom I practically bludgeoned into it, and my old, favorite college professor in English who really cared for it, as I did and do.  It is one of my favorite English novels.    Maybe I need to say I love the BBC and Masterpiece theater.  I adore what they did with Jane Eyre.  I had read the novel, been to the pastor's cottage, seen all the many graves, walked Top Withens.  And I feel they did marvelous things with the Jane Eyre dvd which I watch often, but Little Dorrit is not whole, does not exemplify the little child grown into a woman who was little Dorrit  in a debtor's prison.    I cannot help the people who made this film.  I could not read my novels by Dickens aloud to my husband because they did not translate from reading to speaking.  I only know I read almost every Dickens' novel that existed, save Pickwick Papers.  I loved Dickens' novels.  It took me almost a year to work through them.  And in that year I discovered Little Dorrit, which I had great liking for.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|We absolutely loved every minute of it.  Even better than the original.  The special effects are great and true to the original values of Star Trek.  You won't regret this purchase.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|This movie was basically played during commercial advertisements.  The movie is VERY predictable.  You literally know what will happen next.  I spent most of the movie wondering why a real actress like Sanaa Lathan was not used instead of Beyonce.  Beyonce is a beautiful young lady with many talents, but acting is not one of them.  People please stop casting her in movies!  You will have more fun painting than watching this film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have followed Susan Boyle since seeing her on Britian's Got Talent.  She has a beautiful voice. Lots of peple have great voices ut hers is extra special. Love the album. Play it frequently. Hope there will be more to come.
B000OVLBIU|1.0|If you like movies where you can guess the punchline right before the actor says it, this movie is for you! Back in the day I liked the Rock, Con Air, and Face Off, (note back in the day, have you tried watching them today.....I rest my case) but veer far away from this one unless you are a die hard Ghost Rider fan. Even then, prep your mind for watching a movie that is short on depth, lacking in script, flawed character development, etc, etc, etc. I saw this a long time ago when it came to the theater (not willingly, but there wasn't a lot showing that week) and literally shook my head the whole way through it, realizing I spent 10 bucks to see it. Some of the computer animation was mildly okay, as you can tell the majority of the budget was spent on special effects trying to make Ghost Rider cool (certainly not on a decent story/script or talented supporting actors), but in the end, it left more than a lot to be desired. Anyone who gave this move a good review is completely biased and was just happy to see Ghost Rider come to the screen. Name the movie you hate the most. Watch it before this one.<br /><br />I give this one inflamed chain link out of five.
0061854549|5.0|It is a fantastic read, some people have a problem with the authors' assumptions and methods but I think they are trying to dig too deep and they appear to have forgotten this is a new way of thinking.  The only thing I would like to see different in the book is more detail on the experiments,  some of them we read the results and their interpretation of the data, but it would be nice to see how the info was gleaned.
0671015206|5.0|A great eye opening experience. The Millionaire Next Door helps debunk many misconceptions about the wealthy people in America. Don't believe everything you see on TV. Most millionaires are the ones that live right next door, indistinguishable from most ordinary folk. This book is also great at helping ordinary people realize that if you live on less than you make, you may be the next millionaire! :)

B002CXGAHA|5.0|The Season 1 of The Tudors on Blu-ray is worth tracking down. I wish Showtime would make The Tudors available in Blu-ray in the U.S., but I was happy to order it from a private seller to get it. If you're a Tudors fan, you definitely have to upgrade to the Blu-ray version!

B0002VL0KQ|4.0|This is so bizarre.  I first discovered it in the waiting room of my hospital's maternity floor. I have to say it made me chuckle, even while in labor. I don't know who buys this for real, but it makes a great gag gift.  There are the typical Anne Geddes flower babies, but this time a \\"reflective\\" and CREEPY Celine Dion is mixed in.  The most alarming visuals are where the babies are crammed in to pantyhose and suspended above the singer.  Other costuming includes dressing the babies and Celine up in matching vegetable attire. I have no idea why Celine is posing like this with other people's babies, but it is entertaining.  We got a great laugh out of the babies coming out flowers that look very much like female genitalia, and an even bigger laugh out of Celine's facial expressions and poses.  I've questioned her taste before, and this reaffirmed my suspicions about her having none.  I'd definitely recommend it for a \\"white elephant\\" shower gift, I can't imagine wanting it under any other circumstances.
0439023483|5.0|I have been looking for something that equals Twilight in readability, style, voice, and addictability (is that a word?)and The Hunger Games was all that and more.

B002X9W50E|5.0|Ever since the video for the Reality Tour was first released, I have marveled at the sheer generosity the package represents. It was clearly a gift to dedicated fans, musical connoisseurs, critics and anyone else in the world who might not yet have had the opportunity to encounter and negotiate some of the marvelous recent musical challenges Bowie has issued himself and his collaborators. Now, the best music from the tour has been repackaged as a two-CD set and we have the opportunity to recontextualize it solely in musical terms, minus the cinematography and Bowie's fine performance values. And, of course, it works! If there is any doubt that Bowie is not on par with great musical artists and entertainers such as (dare I say it?) Frank Sinatra or Judy Garland, one has only to listen to his mesmerizing delivery of \\"Bring Me the Disco King\\" to hear how completely he recast one of his own compositions for the ages--a surreal show tune to be performed in only the darkest clubs of the outer planets. This is an essential record of an important artist at yet another peak.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|What can I say?  Its a classic, one-of-a-kind move that I have watched many times and have never gotten tired of....the reviews that have come before me really say it all, so this is short--one of my five favorite movies of all time.

0061922315|5.0|This beautifully written book, [[ASIN:0061922315 Secret Daughter: A Novel]], is one that will linger in my thoughts for a long time. It's a poignant story about family -- just who is \\"family\\" and what it means to be a part of one. It's also a brilliantly written testimony to mothers everywhere, for \\"if the mother falls, the whole family falls.\\"<br /><br />Asha (Hope) was secretly named Usha (Dawn) by her birth mother, Kavita, and is adopted from an Indian orphanage by a married American couple when she is just a year old. Kavita, already grieving the infanticide of a previous daughter in a society that prefers male infants, had made the long journey to Shanti to deliver her 3-day-old child there for safety so that her husband and his family would not also destroy this second unwanted female child. She left her daughter with only a thin silver bracelet and a wish that Asha be allowed to live, grow up, and perhaps have a better life.<br /><br />Somer and Krishnan Thakkar, both doctors -- she's a pediatrician and he's a neurosurgeon -- have been unable to have a child. He is Indian and came to America to attend medical school and stayed for a better life. She married him without fully appreciating the Indian heritage and his connection to the land of his birth and to the family and traditions he left behind there. When they adopt Asha and bring her back to America to raise, little do they realize that their new beloved daughter will one day defy her parents and seek to restore their connection to their Indian relatives despite the fact that she may hurt them when she begins to trace her birth parents to find out who she is and why they gave her up for adoption.<br /><br />The story moves forward in time from 1984 to 2009, and is told from the viewpoints of the three main females of the story - Somer, Kavita, and Asha. All are women who have a very strong feeling about motherhood -- and about their own mothers. In addition, each woman sees a different India and comes to appreciate the country in different ways even as they realize that \\"Mother India does not love all her children equally.\\"<br /><br />The story of each woman's journey to epiphany and self-realization is very moving and satisfying. I highly recommend this book.ry in different ways even as they realize that \\"Mother India does not love all her children equally.\\"     The story of each woman's journey to epiphany and self-realization is very moving and satisfying.

B000O599ZS|5.0|Short and to the point. John Wayne was one the greatest stars of western movies, without a doubt. The Searchers is one of the greatest westerns ever made. In my opinion it exceeds High Noon and Shane, two of the other outstanding and memorable westerns of all time.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I am a big fan of Celtic Woman, and have been wanting this CD for quite some time. I had especially wanted \\"At the Ceili\\" and \\"Spanish Lady\\", two of the bonus songs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the front insert had all of the words to all the songs. That may not be important to everyone, but it definitely matters to me. The charm is nice, and it comes with an explanation of the claddagh, but it's nothing impressive. If you want the extra songs, it's a great buy. If you don't care either way, get the regular CD - it much cheaper. For me, despite its being way more expensive than the basic A New Journey CD, I think it's worth it.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I saw Blade Runner in the Theatre when it originally came out. I loved the original version. I am glad it includes the happy ending, and also a voice over in the film. When Blade Runner came out on Laser disc, I bought the Director's Cut. Now, with 5 versions of the film on this Blu ray collection and 9 hours of entertainment viewing, wow! Personally I prefer the original Version, but enjoy it now that it has been restored!! Doesn't get any better than that, unless they make a 3-D version someday. lol
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I am a Norah Jones fan and was completely thrilled and blown away by this latest album. I was surprised to see that there were any negative reviews. But after reading the negative reviews it is from people who can not accept that she has evolved as an artist.  You can not expect a talented musician to keep producing the same vocal/piano songs over and over again. She spiced it up this time as any great artist would and added some excellent bass... mixed sounds..etc.. thus accentuating her beautiful voice even more. There are still a couple of songs that reflect upon her older work but overall it is more upbeat and fresh. NOT at all a cheap Pop album (by any means), it is more of a New take on the Old blues-jazz genre.. I LOVE it from start to finish. Well Done Norah!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've had the album since the downloadable MP3s, but have been listening to it quite a bit more lately, and for me, it has surprisingly become my favorite and most accessible Radiohead album yet.     Songs like \\"Reckoner,\\" \\"House of Cards,\\" and \\"All I Need,\\" are low-key tunes with Thom Yorke the best at using his vocal chords as a unique and powerful instrument. The latter two being ballads-- an interesting detour from their usual song subjects. \\"House of Cards\\" and \\"Reckoner\\" have also assumed their top spot on my favourite Radiohead tracks along with \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" \\"Karma Police,\\" and \\"How to Disappear Completely.\\"    The only semblance to Radiohead's older material is \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" with a layer of walled guitar sound beginning the track. Otherwise, this album is as low-key and beautiful as anything I've ever heard. Lush layers of instruments over instruments. Strong song-writing that evokes powerful visual imagery. For me, this Radiohead album has surpassed OK Computer to really define what Radiohead is as a band.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell of Blink fame has written an epidemiologic analysis of why certain people are more successful than others. It has less to do with IQ levels and more to do with one's heritage, culture, and time of birth. It is a fascinating book that explains why all top New York lawyers have the same resume, what the Beatles and Bill Gates have in common, and the hidden advantages of star athletes (from the book jacket).  Some examples follow: Gladwell posits the \\"10,000 hour\\" rule--e.g. it takes 10,000 hours to be really good at anything whether it's playing the guitar, programming on a computer, playing video games, working math problems, or playing soccer. Above an IQ of 120, the 10k rule is more important than IQ; thus an a guitarist with an IQ of 160 plays no better than a guitarist with an IQ of 120; it really depends on how much work and effort one applies himself. This is true with Bill Gates and his hanging out at the computer lab at 13, the Beatles playing in Hamburg, Germany, at 14 years of age, before their meteoric rise in Liverpool, England and America, or Warren Buffett studying the stock market at an early age, all easily putting in at least 10k hours of work (about five years of working full-time on one project only).
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Having seen the film before reading Amazon.com's summary, I respectfully suggest that Kathleen C. Fennessy go back and watch this movie again.    It's certainly true that Sister Aloysius doesn't like this priest and his progressive ways, but she isn't setting out to destroy him because of that.  She is setting out to stop an abusive priest taking advantage of an isolated, lonely boy.  How do we know that?  The film tells us so in an earlier scene involving another student.  We see that student walking away from the school and wiping his nose with a handkerchief.  He stops across the street, looks back at the school building, laughs and lights a cigarette.  Just after, we see an exchange between Sister Aloysius and Sister James, wherein the young and innocent Sister James (who by the way did not go to Sister Aloysius with this matter because Father Flynn was being attentive to Donald, but because Donald had returned from a visit with Father Flynn upset, disoriented and with alcohol on his breath) just cannot believe Sister Aloysius' outrageous allegation that the student she had just sent home with the bloodly nose probably induced the nosebleed purposely just to get out of school early.  Yet we watched that student as he left school and we know that what Sister Aloysius said about him isn't outrageous.  It's true.  So later, when Sister James does not want to believe Sister Aloysius' conclusions about the priest, we know they are true.  And the doubts expressed by Sister Aloysius at the end of the film are not about the priest.  They are about a church she had invested her life in, that has looked the other way when children were in peril, and put a predator in yet another place where he could go after more children.  Just had to add my two cents here, as I think Ms. Fennessy's summary is completely off-target.  As for the film itself, this is an actor's showcase that contains three riveting sequences, two between the school principal and the priest, and one betweenthe principal and the mother of the young victim.  Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman are arresting, as is Viola Davis, the boy's mother.  The story itself is rich with an uncliched take on a difficult, much analyzed and discussed problem.  The film is an intense character study and should not be missed.
0786868724|5.0|I've always been a Mitch Albom fan beginning with Tuesdays With Morrie and The Five People I Meet in Heaven. Albom's latest offering parallels his earlier format of Tuesdays With Morrie in which the author is asked to write his Rabbi's (The Reb) eulogy when he dies. In the eight ensuing years Albom begins to understand the man Albert Lewis behind the robe and trappings of his religion. Albom visits his dying Rabbi over the years to get to know the The Reb and is not surprised to find out that Albert Lewis loves life and people of all religions. An equally compelling story is that of Henry who is transformed from drug addict and dealer to minister for the street people of NYC. From his first meeting with Henry after spending a night in his old church building with a hole in the roof covered only by a blue tarp to a sizable donation to cover the heating bill, Albom is transformed to look to care for others less fortunate than the sports teams he meets in his daily job traveling around the country as a sports reporter. The eulogy is anything but anticlimatic as Albom preaches his own sermon at The Reb's eulogy about where do we look for Reb now but up where he has always been looking. He asked the Reb one last question before his death: If you had only five minutes with God what would you say? The Reb replied \\"guide my family on earth to what's important, the next three minutes give to those suffering and need of your love and counsel and finally what is my reward?\\" The Reb's answer for God might surprise you.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|A cute little flick, this movie begins with Sandra Bullock (aka Miss Tate/Margaret/Maggie) hustling to get to work, as is her Executive Assistant/Secretary (Andrew).  Miss Tate is Editor-in-Chief of Ruick and Hunt Publishing, a New York book publisher.  Maggie is so loved by those who work for her that as she arrives, they are all emailing each other announcing \\"It's here!\\"  \\"The witch is on her broom\\" is the intraoffice email signal that means Maggie is on the move through the office.  Maggie is a Canadian citizen, working for a U.S. firm, awaiting her U.S. visa.<br /><br />As Maggie enters her office, she finds Andrew standing at attention, holding her Starbuck's Venti something-or-other flavor. Very quickly into the movie, Maggie is summoned to her boss' office and advised that her visa was denied and she is about to be deported.  She had left the U.S. while the visa was being applied for and had violated the rules, so the application was denied.  Well, now that's a fine kettle of fish!  She cannot reapply for a year and cannot work for a U.S. company while she is deported.  Out of desperation, she announces that her and Andrew are getting married!<br /><br />Maggie tells Andy they will work it out and get a quickie divorce later.

We get to see a few nice pictures of Alaska, too.<br /><br />Andy's family includes Betty White as his adoring and lively Grandom, Mary Steenburgen as his loving Mom, and the guy who played \\"The Coach\\" as the father he doesn't get along with so well.

B000W91RUG|3.0|This is obviously a minority opinion here, but I was not especially high on Season One of THE BIG BANG THEORY.  I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and -- the worst invention in the history of television -- the laugh track.  Moreover, Season One of TBBT did not get the formula quite right.  Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times -- especially in this season -- be excruciatingly irritating.<br /><br />Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).<br /><br />On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore -- before it became a Barnes & Noble -- Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.  It still isn't among my favorite shows (no sitcom ever could be), but it is one that I will continue to DVR after having caught up on DVD.ing a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).

B00127RAJY|5.0|i have been doing the 30 day shred for 16 days now, and the results are amazing.  i am not significantly overweight, 10-15 lbs max, but i've gotten out of shape, lost muscle mass, and gone up a couple of sizes in my jeans.  i was bummed.  with summer looming and the prospect of a bikini lighting a fire under my ever growing butt, i did some research.  this dvd had great ratings, and though i had never used a workout video before, i went for it.  i am so glad i did.  in just over 2 weeks i have gone from zero pushup ability to 15 pushups in 30 seconds.  i've got all sorts of little muscles appearing in my arms, legs, and abs.  oh!  my abs!  you wouldn't believe - i got a 2 pack in two weeks!!  i've lost inches around my waist and hips - this workout is amazing.<br />  i do it religiously each morning before work.  i never half-ass it.  it is hard, but i can feel myself improving every single day.  people have complained of knee and ankle trouble with the workout, but i think that with the right pair of cross-trainers (not running shoes!) and careful attention to form, you can definitely avoid injury.  she tells you what to do and mistakes to avoid, listen to her.  also, i think it is better to do fewer reps with proper form than to do high reps improperly.  watch each level before you try to do it yourself - get acquainted with the moves, the pace, and her instructions on form.<br />  people have also said that the workout is not for beginners, and i strongly disagree.  though i am not very overweight, i was not working out before starting this program.  i think it is more a strength of will than of body.  i make myself get up at 5:30 and do this.  i make myself push it until the exercise is done.  your body will improve over time, but the work starts with your head.  if you need support getting started or following through, you should check out the shredheads blog.  google it and start at the beginning (march of 2008, i think) to see the amazing transformation from post baby body to bikini ready hot momma.t baby body to bikini ready hot momma.

0802798225|5.0|This book just blew me away! It was amazing! I have read some great books, but this is now my favorite. After I finished it, I was so ready to start reading it again.<br /><br />The characters were both well-developed and complex. Brittany felt so real, like some teens could actually relate to her. I know on some levels, I can. On the outside, her classmates see a person with a perfect life. But there is so much going on in her life - from her parents, her sister, and even her feelings. Alex is perceived as the bad boy who's a gang member, but just like Brittany there is more too him. There are some obvious differences between the two characters, yet they are more alike then I thought possible.<br /><br />The writing was superb! It was so smooth that I flew right through the book. Hardly noticing how the pages were thinning and the book coming to the end. There was something about her writing that made me feel as though I was right there. The chapters alternate between Brittany and Alex's point of veiw. I loved this because I got to know the characters better. Being able to have glimps into each of their personal lives. This really helped Alex win me over, because I got to see through him and into the life he struggled with everyday - a life he doesn't want to live.<br /><br />This was the first book I have read by Simone Elkeles and I must say I will be looking for more books by her. I highly recommend this book.

In fact, they could and should be albums in their own right.<br /><br />Lots of gems, all of which are revelatory both by providing just more Springsteen songs to the repetoire, but also some rare live performances from the early years, before fame made them larger than life.<br /><br />A must have collection for fans.
1416972242|5.0|The next book in The Mortal Instruments trilogy is City of Ashes, and it holds more action, more suspense, and even more unexpected surprises! While continuing her fight to find her place in the Shadowhunting world and a cure for her mother, Clary is more confused than ever. She still has feelings for Jace, but the fact that he's her brother makes things that much more harder. Then there's Simon and their relationship, which just moved to a new level. To make matters worse, Valentine is back and has stolen another mortal instrument, the soul sword. Can they stop him in time?<br /><br />Amazing! I can't seem to get enough of these books. Cassandra Clare's writing is great. I feel like everything there isn't what it seems to be. For example, Clary and Jace's \\"brother-sister\\" relationship. Are they really? I can't wait to find out in the next, and final installment.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I first saw this on an Air Canada flight and even on the tiny non-HD screen mounted on the back of the seat in front of me, it blew me away.  In fact, the tiny screen probably enhanced the faux documentary style.<br /><br />The story is truly fresh.  After so many alien invasion stories that made them invulnerable, to use an apartheid metaphor to describe how humans might truly interact with creatures from another world was both remarkable and sobering.  It felt totally plausible, which is unique in science fiction.  What an indictment of human nature and our species shameless history in treating each other.  Of course, we'd put aliens into the same category as Jews in Nazi Germany or black townships in apartheid South Africa.<br /><br />The film is filled with astonishing performances, in particular Sharlto Copley as Wikus, the company toady who becomes infected with alien DNA.  He provides the realistic center of a standout cast, none of whom felt like they were acting.<br /><br />The special effects are seamless.  You really believe you are seeing humans and aliens interact in real time.<br /><br />Worth adding to your blu-ray collection.
1416955070|5.0|Wow! What a great way to start out a trilogy. City of Bones is very original; I haven't read anything like it before. Taking place in New York City, the plot is so twisted and full of surprises with each flip of the page. I was immediately hooked from page one all the way to the end. I felt as though the characters were very well-developed - even the side characters. You got Jace, Alec, and Isabelle, who are Shadowhunters and are invisible to humans. Except, Clary Fray can see them. From the moment she meets them, she gets sucked into the Shadowhunting world and from then on strange things begin to occur. Clary's mother suddenly goes missing, and Clary finds herself being attacked by demons.<br /><br />I most definitely recommend it for those of you, like me, who have a special love to explore the otherworldly. This book has it all! It's fast-paced, funny, and dark, filled with twists and turns around every corner, and includes Shadowhunters, werewolves, vampires, angels, fairies, and warlocks. I enjoyed every minute of reading City of Bones and I can't wait to read the sequel.
B002SQ3664|5.0|I just got through watching the TAKING WOODSTOCK BLU-RAY and I must say that it looks outstanding on my Bravia TV. Maybe its because I don't have any movies on Blu-Ray that have been filmed in the past few years, they're either older or on DVD, but the picture and color is just breathtaking.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and the definition is super sharp...even better than real life. I didn't see TAKING WOODSTOCK in the theater, so I don't know if the picture quality was the same, but it's really amazing on Blu-Ray. And the crowd shots are really cool, too.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is based on a book [[ASIN:0757002935 Taking Woodstock]] by Elliot Tiber (then Teichberg-he changed his name) about his involvement with helping the 1969 Woodstock concert happen. Elliot's parents owned a small, rundown motel in White Lake in Bethel, NY and he also happened to have a permit to put on a music and art festival. He was also neighbors with Max Yasgur who owned the land where the concert took place. So the movie captures the chaos that happens behind the historic concert and how Elliot's life changes as a result of the \\"Aquarian Festival.\\"<br /><br />It follows the book, which is a fun read, pretty closely but it doesn't depict the Stonewall riots, which Tiber was also involved in, only hints at it in a phone call.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and I think Ang Lee captured the spirit of those three days, perfectly. The costume designer and prop/set designer/art director should win Academy Awards because you will swear that you are watching footage taken right from 1969. There were times when I wondered if they spliced film from the original documentary [[ASIN:B001NXDSJI Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)]] into some of the scenes, Lee uses a split screens at certain moments (like in the Woodstock Doc), because they look so authentic.<br /><br />The actors were all great but the stand outs were Imelda Staunton (Sonia Teichberg), who plays Elliot's overbearing Jewish mother. She's hilarious and would have made \\"Sophia Petrillo\\" on TV's [[ASIN:B0002W4SX6 The Golden Girls - The Complete First Season]] proud.

1416914307|5.0|The final battle draws nearer, but who will come out on top? The Shadowhunters, the Downworlders...or maybe both will? This series has everything any paranormal, supernatural, or urban fantasy lover would want! Action, danger, suspence, humor, romance, and fantastic characters. Full of twists and turns that will knock you socks off. City of Glass was a perfect ending to a fantastic series.<br /><br />I finally got the one question answered, which I have been trying to figure out since the first book, and I'm sure many others have too. Are Clary and Jace really brother and sister? Well, I know...but I'm not going to tell you, you will have to read it to find out. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Along with our old characters, we get introduced to a new and mysterious guy named Sebastian.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Cassandra Clare continued to amaze me with all the twists and surprises hiding around every corner. I absolutely love these books, and I am sad to see them end. But like I said before, this book was a great way to end everything. I am looking forward to reading more of Cassandra Clare's work.
B001HIJYR4|3.0|By the end of the movie I was wondering if this was based on one of Mark Millar's graphic novel ideas, and sure enough, it was in the credits. The movie has garnered a fair number of negative reviews, but this film about an ancient guild of super assassins does have its moments, although for its material it basically rips off just about every recent action thriller you can think of, from The Matrix to Star Wars. Still, how many truly original movies are there? A movie's success basically depends on how well it does with its already usually shopworn themes and ideas, anyway. But I digress; more specifically, the action sequences here reminded me of the spectacular gun-play in the movie, Desperado, starring Antonio Banderas and Joachim Almeida from the early 90s, if I remember right. The idea of a guild of ancient weaver-assassin's is also cool. The interior scenes of the mill with its great looms were also well done.<br /><br />There's certainly a lot of action, and the train wreck scene on the bridge is one of the best action sequences I think I've ever seen in a movie. The cast is excellent between Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, although I was less familiar with the male lead, which is why I don't recall his name here, but anyway, he did a good job too.<br /><br />Some of the ideas are wildly fantastic, but fun anyway, such as the special loom and the finely woven cloth with its knots that can be deciphered to name their next victim like a binary code. There's a diverse cast of characters, and the training scenes where they convert the protagonist from a meek accountant to a trained killer are entertaining, although again, pretty fanciful stuff, the most incredible thing being the idea that these super assassins have some psychokinetic powers that allow them to bend bullet trajectories around obstacles and corners. He gets trained in both gun and knife tactics. The knife fighting scenes reminded me of the scenes in the movie Dune between Gurney Halleck and Paul Atreides.<br /><br />Anyway, not a great flick but not as bad as the negative reviews here say; maybe those are from the fans of the graphic novel who didn't like how it turned out, but I haven't read them yet to find out, but I will.nyway, not a great flick but not as bad as the negative reviews here say; maybe those are from the fans of the graphic novel who didn't like how it turned out, but I haven't read them yet to find out, but I will.
1595141979|5.0|This book has got me tounge-tied. I don't know exactly what to say, without giving away any spoilers. WOW! is basically what comes to mind. I think this is the best book in the series, so far. (they get better with each additional book, it seems) There is so much more going on: drama, suspense, action, and surprises. I love reading it because well, it was amazing. Great writing, a gripping plot, and fantastic characters. But then again I'm not sure what think about the ending. I was SO not expecting that (if you have already read it then you know what I mean) Overall, it was incredible. And now I can not wait until the next book, Blood Promise, comes out so I can find out what happens next.

This is worse than All That I Desperately Needed To Throw In The Trash.

0061537969|5.0|I think this book had a profound impact on me. What I loved about this book was how humans take the little things in life for granted.  I even started to think about my opposable thumbs and what life would be like without them. I loved the reference of the taunting zebra throughout the book because in his mind, the zebra was real. But when was the last time you saw a stuffed animal \\"unstuff\\" itself. Yet he convinced the reader of the Zebra playing this evil role in everyone's lives. The writer did a great job of invoking emotions and feelings throughout the book. I was sad when the book ended.<br /><br />Overall this book was a great story that made you laugh, made you cry and made you think all at the same time. You fall in love with Enzo. The car goes where your eyes go. I am looking forward to the movie!

0805086846|5.0|I agree with the many reviewers who have already argued that Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee should be required reading for all Amercians.  The battles and massacres it chronicles will always be part of our history, a history that doesn't fall off our record after so many years like a traffic ticket.  I would also argue, however, that reading this monumental work would benefit people all over the globe, because brutality, hubris and deceit are not American traits but human ones.  As Americans, it's imperative that we fill in the missing blanks in our history, especially in those periods of history so often glamorized and simplified for entertainment purposes.  Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee does this more effectively for the so-called \\"Indian Wars\\" than any other single work.  Six years before Alex Haley changed the way we looked at African-American history with Roots, Dee Brown offered us the words of those who fought, killed, died and survived in the Westward Expansion.  His work has been criticized by some for telling this story from a particular point of view, as if the history books our parents read in high school were produced ex nihilo. All history is written with a point of view.  That's one reason why it's important that we read a lot of it!  [[ASIN:B0032JTVGU Only Shot At A Good Tombstone]]

B00005MP58|5.0|Ok, we all know that Collin Firth is one of the hottest men on the planet.  Now, put him in the best movie and character role that you can put him in and you have the best Mr. Darcy you could ever have.  In the beginning, he is so mean and disdainful to Lizzy.  She bears it well, but holds her own with him.  I love the fact that every Austen woman is equally matched to her man and Lizzy and Darcy are definitely matched well.  Every time he says something to her, she comes right back at him with something even more clever than what he has already said.  I love the part where he takes her hand for the first time and helps her in the carriage.  It is a spark worthy moment and just makes me sigh with longing every time I see it.  Of course, I wish there was more kissing between these characters when they finally get together, but just watching Darcy stare at Elizabeth while she is at the piano with his sister just makes me melt into a puddle every time.  If you are a romantic and want to show your man the romantic, beautiful Austen woman you are inside, then show him Darcy and explain to him in simple terms how it makes you feel.  I'm sure your hot man will show you some love and affection worthy of the man that we all look for, our own Mr. Darcy (sigh)!!  If you have found your Darcy, hold on to him and if you haven't (like me), keeping looking.  Until you find him, keep this movie close by and you will feel like he is near!!  Enjoy the Firth as he works his magic as Darcy and watch Lizzy capture his heart over and over again!!
B00003CXCW|5.0|SUNSET BOULEVARD is one of those classics that transcends hollywood's usual fare. We are taken on a guided tour through the damaged mind of has-been silent film star, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Every aspect of her decrepit mansion, from it's interior artifacts to it's moldering structure and long-deserted swimming pool are pieces of her shattered, rotting soul. A struggling screenwriter (William Holden from NETWORK), on the run from the repo-man, stumbles upon Ms. Desmond's hidden, overgrown lair. We are introduced to the forgotten legend, as well as her faithful servant, Max (Erich Von Stroheim). The rest is about the battle between Desmond and her newfound writer / lover / obsession. SUNSET is a black comedy w/ nods to noir, suspense, and even horror. Desmond, while certainly macabre and (at times) hilarious, is also a tragic figure, rerpresenting the faded, dying superstar, w/ only ancient memories to warm her bones. As we watch her sanity unravel, we are reminded that hollywood and aging do not co-exist. That getting older is a terminal condition, and that hollywood sees it's legends in two ways. At a distance they are museum pieces. Up close, they are unsavory lepers. Unfortunately, very little has changed since 1950...
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have loved this story for a long time.  I love how Jane survives her childhood, between her aunt's disdain and the school she is sent to, with a grace and beauty that we today have trouble finding.  I have seen many adaptations to this story, but this is my absolute favorite of them all.  Mr. Rodchester is wonderfully updated with his dry wit and charm masked behind a bad temper. Jane is charming and matches his witty stabs with just as much gusto as he does.  On the box, it has a review that says it is \\"Bronte with heaving bodices\\".  This reviewer was very much correct.  You experience Jane and Rodchester in a whole new way.  At one point in the movie, he has Jane on the bed and is rubbing his hand on her arm, and up and down the edge of the collar of her dress.  It is SOOOOO sexy and so not typical of Bronte, that it just revs up the sex appeal of this story.  If you watch this with your own hot man, you might have to finish the rest of the movie later!!  Of course, the end of the movie just makes you fall in love with Rodchester's vulnerability and Jane's independence.  The roles are changed, but the love is still the same. Rodchester has much more personal contact with Jane in this adaptation and I like it!!  At one point, he is holding her in his arms in the libaray and kissing her.  For Bronte's time, it was unheard of in public, but it certainly is AWESOME to see on film.  If you want sexy period romance with a foul tempered man who is really a big softy and a quiet, reserved woman who can keep a foul tempered man in check and can make him stop and think, then you will love this film.  Enjoy and cuddle up with your own Rodchester (or Edward or Darcy if you prefer) for this very sexy example of Bronte's finest.

B002NFCHBA|5.0|At this vastly reduced price and with such stellar artists, DG's Complete Edition of Chopin is self-recommending, but for those of us who own separate CDs from Argerich, Zimerman, and Pollini, there must be hesitation. Chopin has his juvenilia, and his songs are a special taste. Only completists will be enticed. For me, the caveats among the major works are as followws:<br /><br />Polonaises: I am not convinced by Pollini's at times brutal, brusque approach to the first seven Polonaises, recorded in harsh sound on a clangy piano. The remaining numbers are done by Anatol Ugorski, a pianist unknown to me, but he veers towards the tinkly.<br /><br />Waltzes: Oddly, I can't think of an outstanding waltz collection in the Decca/DG catalog. Here we get two discs of them in ordinary, straightforward readings by Ashkenazy.<br /><br />Mazurkas: These, too, are given to Ashkenazy, presumably because neither Pollini nor Argerich has recorded more than a handful. Since Ashkenazy is so plain and uninspired, maybe DG shouldn't have opted for all the Mazurkas form one artist.  Variety would have given us some spice.<br /><br />Impromptus: These are done well by Yundi Li, but some listeners may have preferred an older, more experienced hand.<br /><br />Depending on your own biases, this list may amount to quite a lot of caveats or very few, but I thought they were worth pointing out.  As with all such massive box sets, the biggest beneficiary will be the listener who owns none of the CDs on their own and wants them all at once. Does such a listener really exist?
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|After the \\"Third Golden Age\\" of Disney Animation ended a decade ago with \\"Tarzan\\" and then with the \\"end of hand drawn animation\\" with \\"Home on the Range,\\" many thought Disney had abandoned the medium that it basically created and built up.  Then came a number of things that lead to this film: Michael Eisner was fired, Disney acquired Pixar and Pixar lead man John Lasiter was put in charge of Pixar AND Disney animation.  The best move that could have been made.<br /><br />The result ultimately was this film, Disney's return to hand drawn animation, the way Walt did it.  But, it wasn't just a return to classic animation, but also to good old fashioned Disney-style story telling, complete with Princess, Prince, evil villain, cute side kicks and show stopping songs you'll never get out of your head!<br /><br />Best part about this film was that Disney updated their message and it works.  From now on, wishing on a start alone will not be enough, you have to work hard to achieve your dreams.  But, you do still need to wish, you can't just leave it to work alone.  It's a hand in hand kind of thing, you need both.  A VERY positive message to children today.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray or DVD, both seem rather skimpy on extras.  Clearly the DVD is skimpy because Disney wants people to buy Blu-Ray (which is ridicules in my estimation), however the Blu-Ray could have had more to it itself.  I predict a double dip later on down the line with this title, which sadly is also a classic Disney tradition.<br /><br />But extras aside, if you enjoy classic Disney animation, this film is for you!  If you enjoy good movies you can watch with or without your family, this film is for you!  I highly recommend it!

0439023491|5.0|WOW, OMG, whatever you want to call it, this book was great and what a great way to continue the book series, which is outstanding to say the least.  Like the first book, this has you feeling almost every emotion possible.  It packs actions, adventure, mystery, and romance all in one great story.<br />I couldn't put the book down.  I set a new personal record in finishing this book in such a short time, now dreading the wait to read the third book due out in Aug.<br />The same characters manage to capture just like they did in the first book.  Both the first book and this book are great books for all ages, well maybe at least wait to read it till your a teen.<br />Can't wait till Aug to get the third book.
0307454541|5.0|I could not put the book down until I read all 600 pages!  It kept having one plot after another develop.  It was full of suspense and intrigue.  So sorry this author is not still alive.  Will be reading his other two books.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|If suspense filled action thrillers are what you are looking for then you can definitely find it here.  And if you like Kate Beckinsale you also love this movie, she plays a U.S Federal Marshal stationed in Antarctica by her own choosing.   The only other big name well known actor in this movie is Tom Skerritt as 'Doc'.    There are at least 3 \\"killers\\" in this movie: time, mother nature and human.  The last 2 seems to do the most damage and cause the most action & suspense.    There are Russians carrying a mystery cargo, a race to find the missing cargo, a killer with an ice ax and mother nature at her worse.  Enjoy the movie, enjoy the action and enjoy Ms Beckinsale.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|'Taken' is a fast paced action film that doesn't waste anytime getting to the point. The set up is simple and Liam Neeson shows he can play a bad A$$ as good as the next guy. What I enjoyed about this film is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's under an hour and a half and Neeson is terrific as a father on a mission to save his teenage daughter. If your an action fan this is a no brainer, but I think this will satisfy any movie lover who likes guilty pleasure films.

044654146X|4.0|The book is good read , it remind me Soviet propaganda from the 1950, when similiar authors made accounts in this global INN without innkeeper. The authors if they served in military have rather different experience from US marines or those whom Churchill seen as \\"Rum and Buggers \\" in his army times.I too. On p.96 is described unbelievable selfbelief  in action - and missing beingness. Also comments in strict selection of super supers , and one has to ask ,where ,into what Holywood  or yeshiva are deposited those who do not qualify  among heroes? Where is that human refuse , what every society produce ? P. 97 -600 soldiers killed 400 Hezbolah - q.what for ? they after 120 years did not find common tongue?Why to be so pride for? p 129 - Israel will become one of top 15 wealthiest nations 2020. One has to see Kongo people slaving for Israely firms and see that it will be great achievement.Miserry of those unknown.P. 130 The true fact all others have to share responsibility as for many today. \\"For many Jews , there literally was no place to go. \\" It is ours as well theirs common heritage. For them  because they did not want to stay.They do to Palestinians something very similar. And it is not easy to acknowledge.P.210 what would destroy Israel is peace, not just time without arms , but peace of minds and motives to be, It would be over night, und it would probably destroy lot of us with them. As good will perstroika did  USSR.P.213 why not grant conmmon wealth  citizenship to arabs? Everybody can do it or try it. Conclusion with Shimon Peres is moderate , amputated some parts of story.But book is about the enterpreunership what substitute statehood for identity, while having staff on payroll. The mishmash of who are you and what are they -the rest of mankind -consumers - waits to be said. At the end as well as @ the begining , Israeli or Jews are on this planetary spaceship as well with us , as we with them .And even when someone from either side would like to be aloneor have it all for themselves, it is better for all that it is not showa alternative. Book is nice read as I said similar books was in 50ties public libraries full.What is amputated in that success story  is enslaved Palestinians who plaster Israeli componds while exIDFs supervise them with M 16. And it is not Gulag or Birkenau ,it is Israel beyond the technologic inovation NASDAQ success today. It makes me woried about copyright for truth , who has it ?
0451228731|5.0|I won't repeat plot elements here, as many have already done so.  However, this is a top notch book, outstanding in action, pace, imagination, and thought provoking.  There is nothing boring about this book.  Yes, the ending points to an obvious follow-on, and in fact that has happened with \\"Freedom,\\" which I look forward to reading immediately.  Much of what the author describes is technically possible and should serve as a wake-up alert.  Fascinating read.
193413712X|5.0|As George Washington Carver dies in the home he built, he remembers events from his life.  Three generations of Crosbys, the insane pastor, his epileptic son, Howard, and George exist in worlds that no longer exist.  In these worlds a man relied on physical labor, his ability to fix, mend, repair, or build everything around his house.  The women were equally tough, often doing without, always driving husbands and families in a desperate ploy to escape to better lives.  Interspersed within this tale are entries from an old journal, excerpts from \\"The Reasonable Horologist\\"-a text written about clock repair, and a subtle shift of perspective and point of view.  Paul Harding has proved himself a master, the language is poetic.  His sentences actually breathe.    Howard and his son, George, are the most complex characters presented.  Howard abandons his family after he fears his wife is about to have him committed to an insane asylum for his epilepsy.  He is an itinerant merchant, a tinker, who makes his rounds by mule drawn wagon, selling soap, pins, household sundries, as well as repairing pots and pans.  A backwoods gypsy.  Perhaps the most intriguing section of the book is Howard's annual visit to Gilbert, a woodland hermit who claims to have gone to school with Nathaniel Hawthorne, which if true makes the hermit 120 years old.    George is the son who can't run away.  He slowly advances through high school academia and retires to repair clocks.  He has a penchant for hiding cash in safety deposit boxes, along with a signed first edition copy of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" that is left at his father's doorstep.  As he dies, in a hospital bed in the home he built by hand, he alternately observes the home disintegrating around him and struggles to recognize the family that surrounds him during the vigil.    Simply, a masterpiece.

B00288KNL8|1.0|I ordered \\"Coraline (Single Disc Edition w/3D)\\".  I received \\"Coraline (Single Edition w/2D). My Grand Daughter was very disappointed!!!!  I could have paid less for this item. I chose this venue because ad stated that Amazon packed, and shipped, this item. I believed this would add a high degree of reliability to assure correct, and accurate order.  Amazon has replied that they have no control over what is in vendor's wharehouses, or what is shipped.  So why does Amazon advertise that they personally pack, and ship, order??  If it ain't correct, don't ship it!  It is not what I orderd, do not pack it!  Look at order.  Look at product. If they do not match, do not prepare it for shipment. Do not advertise what you cannot do.  Will this review be deleted?  Amazon excersizes great control here. No?
0812973992|4.0|Let the Great World Spin is a brilliant novel that reads as a collection of overlapping short stories.  Some characters are more detailed than others, but each one is extremely complex and interesting.  The majority of the novel takes place in the Summer of 1974 as the author returns throughout to the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center of Philippe Petit.  It is through this act that we are able to tie most of the events to a particular day.      In each chapter, you are able to to get into the minds of characters who by the end of the novel, are all connected.  The characters include John Corrigan (a monk/priest who is a friend and protector of a group of prostitutes who live outside his project), Corrigan's brother, Tilly and Jazzlyn (mother and daughter prostitutes), Gloria (the woman who adopts Jazzlyn's children), Claire (the wife of the judge who presides over the hearings of the tightrope walker, Tilly and Jazzlyn) and many others.  The detail of the crime in New York City at this time is amazing, as are the descriptions of current events relevant to that time.  The characters' reflections on their past makes each one come alive and, despite their flaws, you can't help but be moved by them.    It is interesting that Corrigan, who I believe is really at the center of this book, is never written in the first person.  We learn of his short life strictly through how other characters viewed him.  Even at the end of the novel, when we are taken to the year 2006, Jazzlyn's daughter is still reflecting on the life of Corrigan and wants to learn more about him.      If you are looking for a light read, this is not the book for you.  It is, however, a book that will stay with you for days after you complete it.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|This is a difficult film to rate.  On so many levels I was disgusted and disturbed by the extremity of some of the scenes.  Many times I wondered, did they need to go that far?  Personally, I do not want to see this again and would not recommend it to friends.  However, I can't deny the brilliance of the plot.  It's a movie about revenge and revenge it shows in the most gruesome way and definitely in an unforgettable way (although, I would like to forget some of the scenes).  The filmmaker has chosen the most personal, psychotic motive possible and the most disturbing and haunting revenge ever seen on film.  The mystery thriller element is also quite brilliantly done.  The movie definitely will provoke you to the extreme.  I can't bring myself to recommend it but I will say that on the theme of revenge there is no other film like it.  And I doubt there ever will be one after it.
0451457994|5.0|Recently, I decided to catch up on some older, classic films.  One of the first I tried was 2001: A Space Odyssey.  While I admit that it gave a great sense of the chilling isolation of space, the ending was too much of a non-sequitur.  The special effects (ape-men of the veldt, the final trip) did not age well.  However, a friend I watched it with was intrigued enough to read the book.  They were very much impressed and recommended it to me.  I skeptically decided to check it out.    I'm so glad I did.  This is possibly the most important book I have ever read.  There is too much that goes on beneath the surface for a film, but it works as a novel perfectly.  Many sci-fi books try to be spiritual, but this is the first that I have read, sci-fi or not, to actually pull it off in a profound way.  One thing that really sets this book apart is how incredibly plausible it all seems.  Yes there are aliens.  Yes there are evil computers.  But this book is the product of a clearly scientific mind.  For as fantastic as the elements are, nothing seemed impossible.    Even knowing (sort of) how it ends, this book has changed my life.  It is uplifting and spiritual, and there is simply nothing else like it.      As Clarke says in the forward, \\"Here is one possible answer to that very reasonable question... The truth, as always, will be stranger.\\"
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I just loved this book and I could hardly put it down.  It was one of those books that make you feel bereft when you are finished with it, I didn't want it to end.
B002ELM5HY|2.0|Well as a MK and Dire Straits fan, I guess I'll just accept the fact that just because I liked the old stuff, doesn't mean I should continue to fork over money for the new boring stuff from MK. I've got just about everything Mark has done. So I guess I'll go dig it out and enjoy the great history of a legend. He obviously is producing the stuff he likes, and there is nothing wrong with that, but it is not for me. He is my favorite guitarist, well he really doesn't play guitar anymore. What a shame.<br />Don
B00076RT24|2.0|This is by far the worst of the Star Wars movies (all of I-VI). Jar-Jar is torturous to watch as are young Anakin Skywalker, Watto, Sebulba, and the other cartoon creatures of this film. Only worth having in order to complete the set. This is the movie that makes it impossible to watch all six in a row, in a day. Plain and simple.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Absolutely great TV program.  I'm not a biker, etc. just a 75 year old great-grandmother that happen to  start watching the second season of SONS OF ANARCHY and got hooked on the plot and characters so, I had to order  SEASON ONE being as I missed it. All I can say is that SONS OF ANARCH had a GREAT FIRST SEASON and I am waiting   to order the SECOND SEASON even though I have already seen it.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|For the price, this is a great DVD & CD combo.  The DVD concert was really nice.  The Killers played an awesome set.  Plus some songs at a different venue.  Watched it everyday for a week when I first got it.  Invited a couple of friends over and they raved about it too.  They are buying their own copies.  The CD takes from the DVD concert.  I ripped it to MP3 format and it is on my iTunes now.  Jamming to it in the car.  Great purchase.  If you kinda like the Killers, you gotta get this combo.  If you love the Killers, you already know.

B0011UBDTK|4.0|The best part of buying the complete series is the case it comes in. We borrowed the complete series from a friend who had it in parts and aside from the fact that those packages sucked and fell apart, it was a hassle keeping it all together.<br />In this set, its like a little binder with pockets for individual discs.<br />It really is worth it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is an excellent product. Susan's voice when singing comes out so naturally and with great sensibility. It gives me goose pimples.  Good selection of songs. I would have never imagined her singing a Madonna or Monkee song, and sing it in her own style and yet sound great.  Her music helps me relax.  Expecting to buy her next CD.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|This was the best Star Trek movie ever made.  I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the old and the new.  I think it's great the way they made it possible for this set of actors to become the Enterprise for my grandkids someday.  Move over William Shatner!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|The movie is just great!!, Tarantino made a good work based on the old western films, and amazing situations that makes you inside the movie as a wonderful book.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  They made unnecessary changes to the story, changes that made the movie worse, not better.  They cut out very important parts and added unnecessary and ridiculous scenes.  Too much teenage love and not enough Half Blood Prince in the Half Blood Prince.  It became Harry Potter 90210.  To sum it all up, I'm afraid it committed the unforgiveable sin for a movie, it was boring.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|They may miss on occasion, but Mike Oldfield (like Bob Dylan, at 65+) can still achieve the sublime. The two items with which I've begun to compare MUSIC OF THE SPHERES are Carl Orff's CARMINA BURANA and, much more recently, Ian Anderson's DIVINITIES. Oldfield's album arguably surpasses theirs. Certainly he had less help than Anderson, who had Andrew Giddings as cohort. Some reviewers are saying SPHERES should be given a play on PBS. I say he deserves better somehow, especially after years of genuinely outstanding output (yes, including his pop-rock records like the fun and galvanizing EARTH MOVING). But if DIVINITIES made the classical charts, this latest by Mike Oldfield should be there right now! Two more things: (1) Never has its creator shaped and interweaved the basic Tubular Bells opening theme to such subtle effect as in this most recent gift to us; and (2) \\"On my Heart\\" has to be one of the top 5 melancholic-bliss melodies ever. I think that's what Mike wants, what he sacrifices for, and if I could I'd do more than shake his hand, I'd probably kiss it.
006621131X|4.0|Interesting look at boho New York from a major contributor to the scene, and an intriguing and fascinating story of two intertwined lives.  I  enjoyed reading about Smith's self-discovery and her growth--and Maplethorpe's-- into becoming artists. As others have commented, its hard to think of either as being \\"unformed\\".  I also thought it was a great retrospective view of New York: the art scene seems more mainstream these days. I find it hard to imagine the world Smith describes happening these days in NY, but that may just be age speaking    However, like many artist's autobiographies, even the darker scenes seems imbued with a romanticist tone that softens  edges and crops the picture.  I find coupling any autobiography with a complementary biography gives a fuller and more complex picture.  Inside insights can be put into context, and personal revelation is  highlighted by contrast with an \\"outsider's\\" perspective.  I highly recommend Morrisroe's book [[ASIN:0306807661 Mapplethorpe: A Biography]]:taken together the two books offer a complex portrait of two remarkable outlaws.

0316044695|4.0|In addition to that ill-fated expedition in Afghanistan, Luttrell gives you a convincing inside look as to what it's like to pass through Navy SEAL training.  All of that was the best part of the book.<br /><br />It's a page turner, sure enough, but my complaint was that the characterization of the slain SEALs we were supposed to care about was so flat.<br /><br />As it is, everybody was \\"a great guy\\" and \\"the best SEAL out there\\" and \\"extremely professional.\\"  It's like they're flat characters, not even human, not even fleshed out.  Nobody has any negative sides, for example.<br /><br />Luttrell, of course, knew that the families of those men would be reading this, so I guess he had no choice.  Plus, who wants to give one's slain fellow soldiers feet of clay.  My only point is that Luttrell should have waited a few more years before writing this.<br /><br />Still, I find this book so inspiring that I would like to read it every Fourth of July, as I currently do with the Declaration of Independence.  It's too long for this, though.
B002UXRH10|2.0|I purchased this cd as a Christmas gift for my brother.  He asked me if I bought it at Walmart because it is the edited version. When he loaded into his computer it listed the title then \\"edited\\", so this cd is censored. Not what he wanted.  There was no information tagging this as a censored or edited cd.  Very disappointed.
B0029NY9YO|2.0|You know how all those people who had never read Tolkien complained that, plopped in the middle of the theater for Jackson's trilogy, it was too baffling?  I felt the same way about this:  the plot was far too convoluted to have been a movie.  In fact, I sat through this with a fan who knew all about it.  I had to pepper him with questions right up until the very end.  Not a good sign.<br /><br />Some other observations:<br /><br />1.  The soundtrack for this blows.  No, let me try to be more articulate.  It frequently was a jarring mish-mash between the music and what was happening onscreen.  It was almost as if somebody had put their iPod on random and pushed \\"play\\".<br /><br />2.  What's with all the slow motion these days?  Good grief.  It's getting out of hand.  At one point, the characters are crossing the street in slow motion!<br /><br />3.  They should have delimited Dr. Manhattan's powers more believably.  By the time he's smooching that chick on Mars I had pretty much checked out of the movie.<br /><br />4.  What?  No minorities among the Watchmen?  Unacceptable!  When is Hollywood going to learn: the only justification for casting white people is if you need a villain, an airhead, or a gender-bending misfit.
0547260695|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories from my childhood.  When my son was 5 or 6 I introduced the VHS version to him and he would watch it over and over again.  I was thrilled to see a pop-up version, and this one is beautiful.  I would recommend it as a keepsake or to give as a wonderful gift.  The story is timeless and appeals to both adult and child alike.  The analogies within the story give insights into human nature and the universe around us.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I saw the snippet of Sting's Winter's Night video on ET, and I knew that I'd like to have it for the unseasonable cold Florida winter. We've been playing it ever since, even today at the art gallery where we work. The jacket liner gives a lot insight into Sting's music and spirit. He writes about almost every song on the CD which helps me to understand the history and feeling of the piece.    I hope that you'll like the CD.

B002R2L008|5.0|Norah Jones and her smokey gorgous voice are at it again. Norah Jones is simply one of the most talented singers we have at the moment , and their are actualy many talented singers out their if you choose to find them. Her music this time is still quintessentially hers but slightly more \\"poppy\\" than some of her earlier efforts. Norah's first album was very spare but she has added layers of sound to all of her later efforts. The new album features smart lyrics with a touch of humor. For example  Man of the Hour deals with disappointment in love but deflects it with a clever gag. I can recommend Norah to any one who ants a more adult interpretation of contemporary pop music or any one who likes Jazz music and is interested in a change of pace.
B001L0ZMJM|5.0|This book was written and appeared in 1943 and I remember that I read it then and was hugely impressed.-   After so many years I had forgotten much of its plot,  so that, when I heard that a friend of mine was reading it, I ordered a copy for me at Amazon.- This time I was so tremendously fascinated that I finished its 694 pages(Centennial Edition) in four days.-   It is truly inspiring and the characters and the plot are extremely well drawn,  as well is Ms. Rand´s general premise that all collectivism and work in committes are \\"second-hand\\" and cannot really be as creative as the lonely effort of a gifted individual.-  The book is a hymn to the creative mind of man, and to absolute freedom.-  She rejects all altruism as egotism,  and she makes a very convincing case for it.- If one has to \\"criticize\\" something, maybe it would be that the dialogues often become long monologues, which is probably unavoidable because with this book the author wants to explain and to defend a theory of hers,  whch she calls \\"objectivism\\".- The book, even after so many years, is a MUST READ for young and old.-
B000VE439Y|5.0|I'm not the type who watches movies more than once, but I've probably seen Monty Python's Life of Brian about 20 times.  Brian is born in Bethlehem on the same day as Jesus and, throughout his life, is continually mistaken for Jesus.  In the end, he too is crucified.  On one level, the movie is a comedy, bordering on slap-stick. It is a smashing success on that surface level.  Just below the surface, however, it contains far more serious social commentary, and it was actually banned in Britain for a time.
0756656230|5.0|the minifigure book is a great celebration of an iconic lego item! one criticism, there is a bias towards more recent minifigures, for example, there are no pictures of the original yellow castle minifigures!    the main book has some great features, specifically, great shots of early lego sets, and the wooden toys the company produced before it began making the bricks, there are features of great historic interest such as a double page spread on the evolution of the lego logo. a similar criticism could be made however, there is a definite bias towards recent sets, specifically the movie theme sets, and whilst there are 'sets to remember' pages, vast swathes of great sets from earlier years just don't appear. having said that, i still give it five stars, its worth every cent, very enjoyable, and you'll keep picking it up to look t it!!
1582701709|5.0|A friend lent me her copy of The Secret, so that's how I was introduced to it. I read it in December of 2009 within a couple of weeks.  It is a great book and I really believe that everyone should read it because the Law of Attraction is a real law that people have been taught doesn't exist anymore, when it does. As a Christian it has really helped me to get my mind back on the positive things in life, creating my own positive experiences and let go more quickly the negative things that happen.  And it also I think is just a great read for anyone who's lost their dreams for whatever reason, to be able to start to dream again and enjoy life more. So I definitely recommend this book to everyone, whether they know how to have a positive outlook on life or if that's a struggle.  :)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Pros:  - Keeps game sounds private.  Great for apartments, or when you don't want to disturb other housemates.  - Surround sound that actually works.  Great for FPS games like Call of Duty.  I routinely get kills I would never have gotten because I can hear people sneaking up on me and tell where they are coming from before I see them.  - Integrated xbox live chat with independent chat volume.  - Boom mic swivels and is even removable.  - Comfortable.  I've worn them for 5+ hour straight gaming sessions and they're great.  - Good battery life.    Cons:  - Occasional popping sound from wireless interference.  It is a bit annoying, but occurs very infrequently and is acceptable considering they are wireless.  - Batteries.  When the batteries die, the sound just turns off.  There's no signal to let you know they are getting low.  Have some spares handy.  I use rechargeable AAAs and they work great.  - Massive interference from wireless G connected Roku player.  When the Roku player is on in the other room there is massive interference on the headphones.  There is lots of popping and the sound cuts out frequently.  This is my biggest complaint.    In my mind, the Pros far outweigh the Cons.  I highly recommend these.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|In these apocalyptic times of the credit crisis, a movie like this invokes the very darkest side of humanity and asks us to watch what evil we posses. This sounds like a good story, but is flawed by the lack of balance - there's no uplifting elements to counteract the gloom.    This is a movie that views the world as a faceless machine - the waiter, the guard, the taxi driver are all human beings living out a robotic life where a few \\"conscious\\" people, the super heroes, lament about how terrible everything is. There are attempts at humour, but nothing that's genuinely funny. As a result this film comes off as depressing. The film gets close to saying life is not worth living.    One thing that hurts the story, is how much abuse people's bodies take before they die: you see people being bashed around for minutes, when one blow would have killed them. This makes the deaths seem farcical and meaningless.    I know someone who likes the film because she had an abusive ex boyfriend who she is still in love with, years later - this film helps her justify these feelings. The relationships in the film are neither moments of love, nor Ayn Rand style powerplay. They are irrational, pointless - as if sex was unimportant, and I would say, viewed cynically. There's no joy of sex here.    This is a movie that touches upon interesting topics, but most of this intelligence is in the similes and metaphors used by the characters, and as a consequence this film drops you moments of thought provoking ideas but they don't have any context in the story as a whole.    Some of the cinematography is interesting with some nicely framed shots, but the editing is mediocre which really detracts from this effort. The acting is disjoint, there's little chemistry, and it feels they did not rehearse, so the characters are not clear in the actor's minds. The writing is average.    I have no problem with the nudity, but the blue character, Dr. Manhattan, (and this is a criticism of the graphic novelas well) the blueness is abstract. The fact that he's blue is not really relevant at all.    This is a paranoid, violent movie, that you will enjoy if you are into these things. If you like to think the world is going to end, you will enjoy this movie.

B000092Q8C|5.0|Yes, I would have loved 5.1 releases of all the Peter Gabriel recordings.  Just listen to the \\"Up\\" SACD or the 5.1 DTS tracks on the \\"Play\\" DVD for a jaw dropping showcase of Gabriel's music in surround.  For whatever reason, however, most of his catalog was re-mastered in stereo and that is what we're stuck with.  \\"Melt\\" is my fave Gabriel release -- although his next three albums are very close to my heart.    I have the first U.S. vinyl pressing, and both the original and remastered CD discs.  I've listened to this album many, many times and know its sounds intimately.  The clarity of this high resolution release is stunning.  None of the earlier releases can compare to the SACD remaster, which simply sparkles.  The highs are crystalline, the mid-range more detailed and \\"in-the-room\\" than I have ever heard, and the bass is solid but not overpowering.  And very importantly, there is no hint of the compressed, over-loud audio that is present on the CD remasters.  If you can find the Gabriel SACD titles at a halfway reasonable price (hard to do right now, unfortunately), do yourself a favor and grab 'em.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Product was just how it was discribed. They were prompt. I would purchase from this seller again.
B000VECAEO|3.0|the DVD's are ok except for a very annoying commercial in spanish at the beginning that cannot be skipped.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The attention to detail, drama,action and comedy, along with the ties to the original t.v. series make this movie great!
0375826726|5.0|Would have liked to be notified when the book was delivered (sent as a gift); otherwise, great service.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love all the seasons of Supernatural and thanks to Amazon now own all the seasons out on DVD.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is the classic western.  It has everything a dedicated western lover wants. It has, humor, a bit of romance, realistic action,and it actually has a credible story line!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|i have pre-ordered this extraordinary indie and can't wait to see the film again! i saw it in a hotel room this month and then i played it again and again. there are so many nuanced scenes, such incredible acting by tom hardy and the supporting cast, the movie is like nothing else in the genre. critics comparisons to clockwork orange are missing the mark, imo. i think everyone will be floored by hardy's performance, especially in the last scenes. you will never be able to look at magritte's iconic painting the same way again! despite claims in the uk that the film romanticizes charlie bronson--or villifies him--most critics say it does what the director intended, to show the man in his many personas without judging him. the style of the film is hard for me to put in words--you cannot take your eyes off the screen! two thumbs waaaaaay up for this gem
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I have read this book several times and had my 20 year old wanna-be rock star read it also.  Keidis is brutally honest and that takes chutzpah.  Love this book!
B000NIVJHM|4.0|i wish id known there was such a difference between the versions, so beware. i got the ultimate--but it is not. saw the newer one in a store and it has many extras that ultimate does not. i am ordering the 20th ann. one--NOT on blu ray--and donating the ultimate to the library.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|I must have seen that movie 10 times already and love it more every single time!  The best western out there!!!
B0006B2A42|5.0|Rock Hudson was always a better actor than many gave him credit for, he was so believable in any role, at this time he finished \\"Seconds\\" some felt that seconds was he best film, I content movies like \\"Zebra\\" are more difficult you can say that Hudson is in his element it's tough to play yourself, when we all know Rock wasn't captain but he connivence he was the captain of the boat. That's true acting, See \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" you will not be disappointed.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I will admit I am a fan of Enya. However, when this collection came out I kept wondering if it was worth the money; after all, I had already all the CDs. For me, the decisive point were the video clips (it includes a couple of shorts about the making of the videoclips), and also the two songs from the Lord Of The Rings.  So, to conclude, if you are a fan, it is worth it. If you are not, I would also recommend it as a way of having most of Enya's best music.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|Movie In Perfect Shape.  Very Quick Delivery. Will Do Business With This Seller Again.  Very Happy.
B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|An okay rental, but don't buy this movie, unless you can buy and ship it for the same price you'd rent it somewhere. SPOILER at the end.    Essentially, in a world where everyone spends their days lounging in reclining easy chairs with tanning booth cups over their eyes, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames compete to see who has the most obvious fake hair.    There are two brief but mildly interesting action sequences, hurt by the obvious and cartoonishly CG enhanced athletics of the participants.    In the future, we will all have cheap robot replicas of ourselves who go to work for us, but what happens if you fall asleep in your easy chair while you're mentally controlling your robot who's driving on the parkway? Too much is never explained.    And who'd have thunk that a future world full of cheap, replaceable robots would still have cars powered by fossil fuels? Funny.    SPOILER: James Cromwell is willing to kill millions of people to stop his surrogate creations. However, there's apparently a simple \\"off\\" switch. Dumb.
1591843162|5.0|If you grown up metaphorically with Seth as I have and read his books and blog, this book explains something. It explains why today, like me, you've probably become a Linchpin and are indispensable at work. I didn't plan on it, it's just happened - like Seth says \\"There's no map.\\" But over the years Seth's consistent gifts of thought have washed over me and in my effort to be remarkable I have changed and continue to change for the better.    I have a special needs kid and could find lots of reasons to just take it easy. Yet, after I read or watch Seth even for a brief moment, I'm inspired to be more than I am. I'd recommend this book BUT I think it would be a better read after you've read (or listened on occasion as I have) to ALL - YES ALL - his other books first! I mean it!      Don't believe me? Borrow \\"Purple Cow\\" from the library as I initially did. You'll see your life split in two. BS and AS... (Before Seth & After Seth)    Thanks Seth!!!
B00005JPLW|4.0|This is a great movie, for the most part. Some of the computer imagery did not move off the big-screen to the dvd very well. There are some very dark spots in the show, & alot of the blood-splashing takes away from an incredible story. Historically, this movie for the most part stays the line. There are a few misnomers, but I guess you can chalk that up to 'Director's discretion'. None the less, it was a fantastic show. Certainly not for younger audiences, and not a movie that you'd want to watch very often.
0385504225|3.0|but not great.  One improvement over \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was that the puzzles were actually pretty arcane and not easily solved at first glance by anyone except the brilliant Dr. Langdon.  On the downside, there is an unecessary amount of location descriptions and the evil nutcase Mal'ack is just ridiculous.  It's clever, but a bit of a slog, and there are some plot twists that are just annoying and needlessly complex.
0375847227|5.0|I read the books when I was about 12 and I still love them at 19. As far as religion goes I didn't think anything of it when I was younger. I strongly recommend this trilogy to any child going into middle school because I doubt that they put as much thought into any secret meanings that may be in the book.
B0000062FN|4.0|A must have for Santana fans.<br />Batuka - getting funky here.  The 70's are starting to creep in.<br />  As a latin-rock instrumental it does the job.<br />No One To Depend on - filler, with some fine jamming.<br />Taboo -  love this song.<br />T L - Too much organ for my taste.  Not as good as above.<br />Everybody's Everything - not a fave, but still rocking.<br />Guajira - one of my faves.  I have another version on which the singer's voice is more upfront.<br />Jungle Strut - another one of my faves.<br />Everythings... - filler.  didnt care for it.<br />Para... - sung in Spanish.  A rocking latin-rock song.<br /><br />After 3 latin-rock albums I can see why Carlos Santana wanted to move<br />into another phase, and (supposedly) expand his musical horizons(with mixed results).
B0036HZEM8|5.0|hi i never new that L.j smith made a movie series on his book vampire diaries.. its an awesome story- i have all his books on the series- the awakening- the struggle- the fury - and the dark reunion... my favorite was the fury- when  stefan damon and elena had to join forces to fight katherine... i must have that book hundreds of times-                     L.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Susan's wonderful voice.  There were a couple of tracks that I felt weren't best suited to her but, overall, very enjoyable.  I hope she records more songs that really show off her voice.  I am looking forward to her future CDs.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I ordered the CD but it did not arrive.  A got a new one for free.  Very good after sales service!
B0026P3G12|4.0|This Cd is very nice. Her voice is sweet and selections are relaxing. It would have been nice if there was something \\"new\\" or original, but it still is lovely. Would make a nice gift for an older person who is hard to buy for!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|Highly recommended, not a big Tim Allen fan but he plays it well.  Also love Sam Rockwell and Tony Schloub(sp?) highly recommended...
1878424114|5.0|the most helpful book of all time..if you're feeling confused, buy this - it will help - a new book that has me smiling is: Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I previewed the tunes on this CD when I found out they were opening for Theory of a Deadman at First Avenue in Minneapolis.  I liked what I heard so I bought the CD. My boyfriend and I both listened to this CD MANY times prior to hearing them in concert and have LOVED it.  They also did not disappoint in concert--do not miss them if you have the chance!
1401307787|4.0|that this book is on the sale rack at my local B&N - it's far too good for that - highly suggest you get it - a new book that floors me in a different way: Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon
B002BX2LEM|5.0|This was a great movie and Mickey Rourke was perfect in his role. Bought this for someone going through a hard time so they could see that those times don't last forever...it worked! Appreciated getting it as fast as I did.
B001GCUO16|5.0|i enjoyed this film. It's full-packed and breath-taking action film. One thing i like with this purchased is that it comes with the digital copy so i can watch it over and over again through my itouch.
0446530573|5.0|Book was a gift to a Sopronos Fan.  Was able to get a collector's 1st edition -  that arrived a few days after placing order in brand new condition.  The book was more than I expcted it to be - the recepies are fantastic!  I'm ordering one for myself!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|\\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is a sort of fairy tale for adults, and yet also appeals to children (on different levels of course). Mr. Fox, who is ably voiced by the talented George Clooney (all suave and composed, yet wild at heart - in the movie I mean:)) reminds us of the pitfalls of adulthood, of having to \\"settle\\" when one's soul yearns for something more, and Mr. Fox, who has made a promise to Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) many moons ago not to risk himself hunting chickens ever again, has \\"settled\\" into a stable yet boring life as a newspaper columnist. But Mr. Fox misses the adrenaline rush and excitement that comes with hunting - so he transplants his family (which includes a rather average son, Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) who is constantly trying to prove himself to his accomplished father) to a tree which overlooks three farms, owned by the nasty farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. Before long, Fox is planning an assault on the farms, and gets an o'possum, Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) to act as his reluctant sidekick, who also has a tendency to space out.<br /><br />Well, things don't go quite as planned (surprise, surprise), and Fox and family find themselves at the receiving end of the farmers' rage, led by Farmer Bean (Michael Gambon who credibly portrays the riled up English erm, 'gentleman'). So, it's up to wily Mr. Fox to get himself, his family, and the rest of the woodland creatures out of the mess he created. As fantastic as Mr. Fox is, the supporting cast makes this a great ensemble piece - there's the sneaky rat (Willem Dafoe), the badger lawyer (Bill Murray) who tries to dissuade Fox from purchasing the tree in the first place, Meryl Streep as Fox's wife, etc. In the capable hands of director Wes Anderson, \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" with its stop-motion adventure is a refreshing break from the series of insipid features passing of as \\"family\\" entertainment these days.<br /><br />Is this a movie for children? I think it's more of a film for adults and older children - there are no profanities in this film (all the expletives are replaced by the word \\"cuss\\", e.g. what the cuss? etc, so this needs to be explained to younger children), there is a fair amount of violence as the farmers use all sorts of methods to destroy the animals though it's not bloody or gory; some kissing between Fox and Mrs. Fox, scenes of the adult animals drinking, the farmer smoking etc. Final verdict - a fun movie that will delight the inner child and jaded adult in all of us.e are no profanities in this film (all the expletives are replaced by the word \\"cuss\\", e.g. what the cuss? etc, so this needs to be explained to younger children), there is a fair amount of violence as the farmers use all sorts of methods to destroy the animals though it's not bloody or gory; some kissing between Fox and Mrs. Fox, scenes of the adult animals drinking, the farmer smoking etc. Final verdict - a fun movie that will delight the inner child and jaded adult in all of us.
B00123MBGA|5.0|This is the Dead's first album; if you were conscious during the '60's it will take you back. Excellent, raw cuts which serve as examples of why the Dead gained recognition and soared in popularity. The Amazon version is $2 cheaper than the iTunes one, and has no DRM...gee, I wonder which one to buy?
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband is the one that ordered the series & gave it a 5 star rating.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|This is an interesting, well-plotted, fascinating film that won't be to everyone's tastes. It centers around all sorts of goings-on during WWII with a plot that's incredibly intricate and nastily violent.    The movie features several stories that eventually lock together. You've got the Nazi \\"Jew Hunter\\",played by Christoph Waltz (in one of the best performances of the year. Before seeing this I was prepared to say the Best Supporting Actor win would go to Christian McKay for his performance in \\"Me and Orson Welles\\". Now I'm not so sure), a Jewish woman (Mélanie Laurent)who survived a massacre of her family led by the \\"Jew Hunter\\" (what is that in German? \\"Juden Jaeger\\", I assume), and then, almost as an afterthought, you've got an American guerrilla group led by one Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who offers one of the most hilarious moments in the film when he speaks Italian with a very thick Tennessee accent.    It's hard to describe the plot without giving away huge parts of the movie. Suffice to say the Basterds are sent across enemy lines to wreak havoc against the Nazis (which they do rather graphically). Meantime the Jew Hunter is oozing his way across the landscape and the Jewish woman he failed to kill is running a movie theatre. When the Nazis decide to premiere a movie there, she makes plans to blow it up.    As usual with Tarantino, there's lots of blood and gore, plus plenty of references to other movies. The soundtrack is like a Spaghetti Western, there's an appearance by Emil Jannings, references to the works of Leni Riefenstahl and mention of the great German film studio UFA. Left out are comments on the works of Murnau and Lang, but given the Nazi view of Lang especially, that's no great surprise.    As mentioned the movie tells several stories all at once. It is a testament to Tarantino as a filmmaker that I never once felt lost and that the stories come together in a way that seems quite natural.    I'm no great Tarantino fanboy. \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\" (both parts), remain to me some of the most overrated films in history. I didn't like either one. On the other hand, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Jackie Brown\\" are two of my all-time favorite films, so there you go.    The DVD extras include some deleted scenes (though fewer than you'd expect), as well as trailers and a six-minute short film done in the style of Riefenstahl. It's less interesting than one might want.    Ultimately I recommend this movie. It's a tad on the violent side (to put it mildly), but well worth seeing.
B000FDECGA|5.0|First off, I love this film, its packed with non-stop action. And I don't mean the cheesy overdone Hollywood \\"explosion every two seconds\\" type action; rather the quirky, yet somehow epic 1970's-1980's era style of film.<br /><br />What I love about it most is how it really feels like you are put in this guy's position. You worry about him and his son throughout the film. Lots of suspense prior to the fight scenes (which are about every 30 seconds to five minutes). You will be on the edge of your seat. And you actually see him spare a person (a woman). So you may begin to identify with the main character and his cute, innocent-looking little son.<br /><br />Warning: If you don't think fake heads getting chopped off is funny and are way too concerned with a storyline other than \\"revenge,\\" then you probably won't like this film.
0688014291|3.0|It has very basic concepts and to me, it is written in a condescending style.  Having said that, I did get some value from what the book had to say, so I wouldn't tell somebody not to get it, I would just have your expectations not set too high.
0312330537|2.0|My sister raved that Shantaram was the BEST book that she had ever read. So, I excitedly bought the book and started reading. Was there something I just didn't get? It took me about 2 years of picking up and putting down the book, and thank goodness, I finally finished it tonight! I persevered because I hoped the book would get better, and then more recently it became a good practice book for my speed reading.  Lots of pointless stories that barely tie together by an author who is in desperate need of a good editor to stop the rambling on for 935 pages.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is a great movie that tells about the bombing of Pearl Harbor from both sides.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love this season, it was so good with all its twists and turns! I could watch it over and over again!
B0002S947K|5.0|I first heard this song on the Travelers troubled dog commercial.  What a beautiful song & great commercial.  It is the best commercial that I have ever seen.  The song & commercial are perfect together.  I bought the CD just for the song Trouble.  Love R. LaMontagne's unique voice.  He has a new fan.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|LOVE the new blu-ray version of the Godfather trilogy.  I watched the first two (I probably won't watch the third one because I try to forget it exists) and everything about it was great.  It is much brighter, the colors are sharper, and visually it is just far superior to the regular DVD.  If you are a fan of the Godfather movies, this is a must buy.  My brother told me about it and I ordered it as soon as I got my blu-ray player.  The set is pricey, but well worth it in my opinion.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My fiance and I loved playing this game in college with our friends, so I purchased it for him for Christmas. Great game for small social gatherings, because its a game that you still get to interact a lot with your opponents. Also great, because the board layout changes every time, so you will never have a repeat of the same game. Involves a good amount of strategy, but not overly complicated. Overall, we love this game!
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Everything was fine after this CD has been transported around the world ;-) as it is not on sale in Germany. Announced to arrive mid of January 2010 it has been delivered two weeks before Xmas - very welcome to be a present for my son.    Thanks a lot !!!! Kind regards, Ralf Kucharski
1594488843|5.0|Revealing \\"The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,\\" contrarian Dan Pink delves into decades of long-neglected psychological research to demonstrate what generations of corporate and nonprofit managers have been doing wrong. Pink shows how the research proves traditional carrot-and-stick incentives may work well in a world of rote learning and assembly-line production but can easily be counterproductive in a new world that demands creativity and self-reliance -- the right-brain thinking about which Pink wrote so cogently in his earlier book, \\"A Whole New Mind.\\" If you lead or manage an organization of any sort, this is must reading.
B001992NUQ|3.0|A few things i would like to note,  the High Def. for Fight Club was slightly a let down. I have a DLP samsung, and since many scenes were in the dark, the HD did not seem to shine. A few scenes looked great when compared to the DVD version which i have. Might look batter with LCD, i'm not sure.  I do like the cover and the \\"title menu sequence\\" (you'll know what i mean when you buy it). Great addition to any avid movie collector, just don't expect to have great HD content unless you own the high end LED or DimLight technology TVs.  If you don't have the movie yet pick it up, definitely a great addition to blu-ray.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|After watching the first episode, what was portrayed was so awful compared to our society today, I couldn't understand why folks wanted to watch this and almost tossed it. After agreeing to watch another episode, and the complexity and depth became more apparent, I got hooked. I'm going to buy season two.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Forrest Gump is probably one of my many favorite all time movies. It looks phenomenal in HD and probably one of the best conversion to blu-ray movie i've seen in a while. If the other Sapphire series look this great, i'll definitely pick up Braveheart and Gladiator.    You will not be disappointed with the quality of the movie at all. I have this on VHS, DVD collector's edition, and now Blu-Ray, and i'm very happy about my purchase. A must have for any avid movie collector and just anyone who enjoys watching cinema.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is one of the best vampire series they could have come out with.  The Sookie Stackhouse books are just as great.
B0012GMXA6|4.0|This is a wonderful cd for someone who is interested in Latin American music that is not limited to the Caribbean. Estefan is in glorious voice and she chose songs from places beyond her native Cuba. It's fun to listen to and the variety is astounding. She includes a short description of the songs in the liner notes so for me, a Spanish teacher, it is great for use in the classroom and to broaden my own understanding of Latin American Music.
B00280LYHS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!    Great book. Rick did good on the last book of the series. He also did great on the other 4 books. GREATEST SERIES EVER!                     THANK YOU, RICK RIORDAN!
B0027HOBM2|5.0|What can I add to the many already excellent reviews of this series? Not much other than if you loved the quality of shows like Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Big Love, and others of that caliber, you will not be disappointed.     Set in early 1960's NYC at a mid-sized advertising agency, the show explores a very seminal time in our recent history when so many things were called into question and so much of our culture was shifting away from 1950's conformity-- toward civil rights, woman's rights, a deep distrust of government, loss of innocence, and a growing social and political instability. The way it treats the realities of business (then and now) is also about as honest and accurate as anything I've ever seen in a TV series. All of this history is woven into highly charged dramatic stories that develop and explore these shifts through incredibly well-drawn characters that reflect these ideas-- and without ever losing site of their basic humanity. Never boring or irrelevant, and amazingly well-produced, there are few shows that have ever come to television that can match this. It is worth every minute of your time. This show was filmed in HD and the Blu-ray release is pure joy to watch-- unlike HDTV broadcasts and standard def versions blu-ray reveals details in lighting (some of the best I've ever seen) and texture (the clothes in particular) that are just not visible under any other format.
0307454541|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful novel.  \\"Couldn't put it down\\", as it were, but as much for the internet approach to crime solving as for the plot itself.  The Lisbeth Salander character is utterly mesmerizing. Pacing, character development, plot that hangs together, this novel has it all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim, mostly because I liked the title, but this novel is so much more. You simply cannot help but fall in love with these characters and Enzo's truly believable outlook on life. This book is hilarious at times, but also deeply heart-wrenching. I recommend this to anyone!
0307269981|5.0|The first novel by this author is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.  This one may fall short of that, but really only because the first preceded it.  This novel continues in the vein of the first, as regards the internet crime solving theme and the mesmerizing Lisbeth Salander heroine.  I couldn't put it down any more than I could put down the first. I simply can't wait for the final chapter and yet, I have the same melancholy feeling that many had with Harry Potter before the final novel was published.  Can't wait, but gosh, will this really be the last? In this case, it has to be, which makes for some wistfulness.  That wistfulness is itself high praise for the late author.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|When I received my movie, I got a BluRay disc instead of a DVD, like I ordered.  I emailed the seller and they resolved the issue instantly!  I got the DVD and they sent me a pre-paid label to send back the BluRay movie.  Great seller!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I like romantic movies, but so often, they are so fomulaic.  Most already tell you in the first 5 minutes what is going to occur.  (500) Days of Summer takes the romantic movie to a new level.  Original in the way it unfolds (it moves forward and backward over time) and played with charm by Zoe Deschanel and  Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a different role for him.  and Great music!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and the entire family is addicted to it.  Our two year old will say, 'Watch animals?\\"
0670020745|5.0|I could not tell the book had been used.  It took about a week to arrive, and was worth the wait.
1582701709|5.0|This book has changed my life forever, the actuality that what I think about comes about was at first mind blinding, but whoa, this book has opened my eyes,mind, spirit and soul to the tempo and serenity of the universe. You are your thoughts this books writes and boy are they for real. Down to the bone honesty and fabulously written by multiple authors, this book is so good I got it on CD and will relisten often. WHATEVER YOU WANT IN THIS WORLD YOU CAN AND WILL HAVE when you put into your mind positive flow. If you are ever going to read something life altering in a positive way this book is it. Positive thinking, life changing, prosperity bringing, abundance delivering and forever mind altering. I'm re-reading it again and again. GREAT!!! Can't say enough. Andy Monty P.S. Get This Book.
0060765380|5.0|James Rollins continues to write well crafted stories.  If you have liked his previous works, you will enjoy this one as well.
074322454X|5.0|Great read.  Looking forward to watching series again and reading other books by this author.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Its not a bad WWII movie, but what amazed me was Quentin's shot at Brian Hutton's 'Where Eagles Dare'  during the interview with Elvis Mitchell - Quentin says he 'just didnt buy it' and 'they pissed away all  the suspense' yada yada...I mean so what if the characters dont speak German or whatever, its the story  that counts and what Quentin doesnt realise is that 'Where Eagles Dare' which starred  Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton back in 1968 is a classic, and a far superior film to this. The cable  car fight is still a white knuckle ride, despite the obvious special effects - that is an example of   great film making when the audience knows its fake but still invests emotion. Inglorious Basterds wasnt   a bad movie but Hutton's film still owns 40+ years down the road and is fondly rememebered  as a classic of this genre. Also worth noting \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" has more action, suspense and intrigue  in the first hour of the film than 'Basterds' has in its entire running time. With that said, I doubt   Inglorious Basterds will stand the test of time as much. Check out Where Eagles Dare instead cos its   a better film all round.
B00168OIOE|5.0|My only complaint of this Blu-Ray would be that since it's older, not all the special features on the \\"bonus disc\\" are in HD. Though the Blu-Ray Bonus features are re-made especially for this release and are in glorious HD Other than that the actual movie looks amazing, and sounds fantastic. Brings the experience of Monsters Inc. to a whole new level. I love this movie even more now.

B00005N6KG|5.0|These are perfect for the gym.  I usually buy 2 or 3 at a time and have them stashed at various places (gym bag, home, office).  They last about 6 or 7 months with heavy use (and heavy sweating).    They are comfortable and don't fall off when working out!  Highly recommend!
1592402690|5.0|Emerick's perspective from the studio control booth is amazing.  His competence as a musical engineer allows him to describe both the creative thinking and the technical challenges behind the Beatle's songs that wonderfully expands the reader's/listener's appreciation of their music.  This book invites the reader to undertake a close listening and a thrilling, almost academic, study of various Beatle tracks and albums to clarify subtleties in their music that were not at all obvious before.  This book is a tour de force for that reason alone but amazingly standing side-by-side to the musical discourse is Emerick's perspicuous insight into the Beatles individual personalities and the collective personality of the band.  The impact of the four members on each other and those around them and vice-versa  is brilliantly fleshed out, which made the complex normal and not-so-normal tensions that finally did the band in all the more sadly inevitable.  Knowing full well the outcome, I still found myself rooting for a strong-willed individual somewhere in the Post-Sgt. Pepper madness to grab the band collectively by the collar and demand that they behave.  Unfortunately no one asserted this authority and so we'll never know how much great music was lost because of the band's disintegration.  Emerick captures the tragedy of the Beatles demise with stunning and gripping psychological depth, which makes this an absolutely brilliant book told in an pleasantly informal, unpretentious manner.
B000V86OKG|5.0|We started watching Dexter Season 1 because we had no other shows to watch and wanted to try something new. This show is incredible, Season 1 was great with the plot and twists but Season 2 was better. This show is awesome. If you like crime, mystery, and a bit of comedy, this is a great show to watch.
0440245931|1.0|I purchased this book thinking it was new from your discription. You did not indicate that this was a re-run of a book that came out in 1992. The story is good and well written but I had already read it when it was really new. This type of deceptive advertising is not worthy of you.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|The Lost Boys a great Classic Horror movie with a bit of comedy thrown in. One of my favorite  2nd vampire movies of all times only SubSpecies is Number  1 on my own personnal list of top Vampire movies.     Great movie, classic songs, classic comedy, Great Acting and a Great Evil vampire (David) Kiefer Sutherland. the 2 Corey's are good in this movie and have some of the best one-liners in the movie.     if you like Vampire movies I recommend seeing this movie and add it to your collection.
0446567337|3.0|[[ASIN:0446567337 Dear John]] Absolutely beautifully WRITTEN, Sparks doesn't let you down to push your emotions to the extreme. If you are a hopeless romantic and have been dying to read this or can't wait for the movie, you have to be someone who can handle leaving a love story with unhappiness. This is why I'm not sure how many stars to give it.    I bought it and ended up finishing it in less than a day! It follows two very different relationships, John with his father and, of course, the love story of John with Savannah. After finishing the book I felt so uneasy the next few days as it is extremely bittersweet. I read that this would happen in so many other reviews but decided to ignore them and read the book any way. However, if John and Savannah really loved each other as much as they said, things would never have unfolded like they did. I learned to love John's character more than almost any other book but the let down was heartbreaking.    I'd give it five stars for the writing quality and different plot style for Sparks, but only two stars for the believability of the romance between the characters during \\"Part 2\\" and the few days worth of depression it gave me. Like I read in \\"Bookd\\"s review, it was manipulating. I'm not sure if I'll be able to sit through the entire movie.    Hope this helps :)
B002SJIO4A|5.0|The imagery is great (sets in a natural setting unlike most science fiction movies).  This movie deserved to be advertised better in the U.S.; perhaps, being a realistic vision of the ongoing/recent world's events (the wars, refugee camps, mass paranoia, and prejudice) did not get the attention that it deserved.

B0019LY5IM|4.0|LOST is my favorite show of all time, thus I have no complaints whatsoever about the show itself, as it is fantastic. I do however have a complaint about the Box Set design.  For 4 straight seasons they have designed the season box sets in a consistent fashion, until now, with a sleek loving plastic casing that slid out the bottom.  This box set is in a cardboard casing that slides out from the side, and has thrown of the entire look of my lost collection.  In addition to this, there is usually an abundance of bonus features, whereas this season the bonus features are far more limited! Overall, I was disappointed with the look of the Season 5 Box Set, and I can only hope that for the final season they rectify it!
B00009ZYC1|5.0|Ordered this movie to replace the crappy VHS copy I have.  The kids loved it! (So did mama!)
B000A59PMO|4.0|So I came to Veronica Mars late in the game, and am only half-way through season one, but I have rapidly become obsessed.  I won't repeat what the other reviews have said (except that the comparisons to Nancy Drew, Buffy, and Twin Peaks are pretty spot on).  I do want to emphasize that the show isn't perfect.  Some episodes are stronger than others, and of course the premise requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but the overall quality of the series is so far above most other TV that those seem like picky observations.  I will commit heresy though, and suggest that being dropped as a series isn't the worst thing that can happen to a good TV show.  The premise in 'Heroes' had about one good season in it, and that's what we got before it started declining.  Having said that, one or a few good seasons is more than you get in most shows.  Many of the other reviewers have name dropped their favorite shows that others may not be familiar with, so I'll do the same.  Check out 'Slings and Arrows' (18 episodes total, by design), followed by 'Book of Daniel' (only 9 episodes, that was a true loss), 'Clatterford' (12 episodes), and the live action version of 'The Tick' (but not the animated version).  If you all will try out the ones on my list you haven't seen, I promise to try out the ones on yours.
B000T05R90|4.0|Is it me, or is the critical literature about Syd Barrett a bit misleading? I mean, coming to this album based on what I'd read about it, I expected some kind of quaint, pastoral, twee epic. What it is, however, is heavily improvised, jazzy space rock that is, to these ears, far more experimental than the arena-friendly rock Pink Floyd would later do, post-Barrett, when it rose to US chart success with Dark Side of the Moon. Pink Floyd without Barrett was like Genesis without Peter Gabriel, i.e., less out-there, less ground-breaking. And the sound and approach of Piper at the Gates of Dawn would live on in everything from the music of Oasis, a band wrongly characterised as Beatlesque, but featuring instead the noisy guitars and snarly, British schoolbrat vocals of Piper; Sonic Youth, who took the idea of improvised rock to an extreme; and, most surprisingly, Pere Ubu, whose heavily improvised albums New Picnic Time and Art of Walking really sounded not so much like Captain Beefheart, to whom they were often compared, but like early Pink Floyd if they had hired Willie Dixon as a lead singer. David Thomas, like Syd Barrett before him, clearly improvised not only melodies, but lyrics, after which he refined his stream-of-consciousness into something poetic. This is clearly what was going on in Barrett's work on Piper, and the band were a cohesive unit behind him, with special mention needing to be made of the jazz-level chops of drummer Nick Mason and pianist/organist Richard Wright.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell writes about big ideas, in this case about previously unexamined determinants of success. He gets his ideas across, despite their conceptual nature, because he is a very good storyteller. The stories in Outliers are vivid, unique and thought-provoking. What leaves me unsatisfied is that some of the stories don't really support the thesis.  For instance, he tells of an airplane crash caused because the culture of the pilot and crew forbade assertive communication.  While the story demonstrates how we are affected by our culture, it certainly has nothing to do with success.  He brings the discussion back on the rails by revealing that airlines now do extensive training to overcome this. There's the rub. Much of what he is trying to say is that success is somewhat fatalistic.  Yet, there are everyday stories about compensatory efforts, such as the airlines' programs he mentions.  He does not talk of stories - typical of news features - about individuals overcoming the odds he claims unavoidably create destiny. His stories are interesting and he does tie them together to make you think. But, the whole is not strong enough to make you want to respond to his ultimate call to action -- \\"to build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success.\\"  What do you do about that, other than try to make education fair and accessible? And that challenge is nothing really new.
0545123267|4.0|Didn't realize this was a \\"teen\\" novel(from my perspective) when I decided to read it.  Written in a diary style - with each chapter written from another character's perspective.  It took me a LONG time to get \\"into\\" it, but once I got past the first 50 pages or so...it kept my attention fairly well, but not to the point where \\"I just couldn't put it down\\" and kept reading until 3am.  Another author's take on life as a werewolf, with a few twists I hadn't heard about before.  I would recommend this one for the over-13 crowd (those who liked \\"Twilight\\" Series would probably like this one).  Will see if my teen daughter wants to read...An \\"OK\\" book in my opinion, but I would wait until it goes \\"on sale\\".
0812973992|4.0|I began reading this book while traveling which was a bad idea. There were way too many distractions for me to get into this book. So I started it Monday but didn't finish it until last night. I'm really glad I stuck with it though because I really enjoyed reading it.    The central event of this book is a man walking across a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. I had no idea but this part of the book is true! The other sections of the book - I'm not sure what to call them because they just didn't seem like chapters- each were about a different character. It reminded me of Olive Kitteridge: A Novel in Stories by Elizabeth Strout. While I enjoy this style of writing I think it did make it harder for me to get into the story. Once the character's stories started to overlap or I got the story of a character mentioned earlier on then it got interesting.    The characters were very unique and ranged from prostitutes to a rich lady living on Park Avenue. The relationships they shared were amazing and most unexpected. I think my favorite story was A Fear of Love. This was the first part of the book where the stories began to overlap.    Ok that is all I have to say. I'm going to end with a quote from the front matter of the novel because it is prefect.    \\"All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.\\"      -Aleksandar Hemon, THE LAZARUS PROJECT
B0019FOC5E|5.0|We have seen the movie about 5 times and everytime we enjoy it.  It is an upbeat movie with great music.  We had to get the CD so we could play the music when we wanted to.  Actually, the CD Soundtrack sounds enhanced and makes you feel like dancing around the house.  Some of the tunes are stuck in our head and we sometimes catch ourselves humming them during the day.  I would highly recommend this one to be added to your collection of enjoyable music.  Buy through Amazon.  Great product, great price, great delivery!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|The moment I saw this in theaters to the moment it came on DVD and I hit the purchase button, it was a life-changer.

0061730327|5.0|William's story is one of hope during hardship and sorrow. Interesting to see how this young man started a path that lead to such world media attention and changed his life. It also shows that low tech and simple technology solutions and practical education opportunities are more valuable than than many foreign aid efforts now in place.
B000000W5L|1.0|Appreciation of music is mostly subjective but why so many people this album so highly is beyond comprehension. The Stones are generally over rated and this album is a case in point. It has no emotional element to it all. The vocals are largely incomprehensible and the lyrics that can be discerned are rubbish. Rip this Joint is a maybe four stars but none of the other songs stay in the memory or create any interest at all. The rhythm mix is stale and there is little musical virtuosity on offer here. If you have a spare hour to entertain yourself, don't bother with Exile on Main street.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|When the film District 9 came out to theatres in August of 2009, I heard mixed reviews.  Many poeple liked while many others absolutely hated this film.  So I became curious.  I had to see this film to find out for myself how good this film was.  Once i bought the film, not only did I love this film, I personally have hailed this film as the best film of 2009 as well one of the most important films ever.  Director Neill Blomkamp has has really crafted a work of complete originality as well as from the heart.  Apart from the underlying theme of aparthied that takes place in the film, there is yet another theme more important that.  It is quite evident that the aliens are symbolic as the various tribes in this country who look ironically enough look at each other as aliens.  It is a country that has been divided into warring nations and interestingly enough< Blomkamp doesn't treat this work with the mainstreamed-Hollywoos approach...  However, Blomkamp takes his material and makes a living documentary out of this.....Not just shot with a documentary feel, but more so that its happening right now.  District 9 takes us on a fictitious but nevertheless all to real feeling journey seen through the eyes of one man....  the main character Wikus Van de Merwe is unwillingly throw on a journey where he realizes the horrific nature that exists in human biengs.  He becomes the ultimate outsider and soon forms an uncommon bond with an extra-terrestrial named Christopher Johnson.        The film's perspective is ingenious as it focuses on humans who fear something that is unknown to them.  Because we fear the unknown, we act with hostility and therefore, cloud ourselves in denial as we believe that our actions are out of good judgement.  Actor Sharlto Copely gives a defining performance as an ordinary man thrown in extraordinary measures against his will.  First time feature film director Blomkamp Shines and executes his vision well with imagination as well as real life accounts definately making District 9 a film for the ages.
B0000026NC|5.0|I have this on cassette, I liked it then, and I just had to have it on cd too. I still like it now.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An excellent film that kept us interested all the way through, except I feel too much time was spent on the woman who lost a child and we fast forwarded through some of that.  I am sorry for her loss but it just dragged on too long.  My skeptical husband since bought the DVD and has been passing it around to friends, who now want me to raise all their chicken and pork for them :-D<br /><br />Unlike PETA films this one does not try to gross you out and make you a vegetarian.  There are a few short graphic scenes but rather than try to sicken you, the message they are trying to get across is how a handful of Big Ag companies control over 80% of America's food supply, and how politically powerful and nearly untouchable these companies are.  It all seems very bleak, but at the end you are told how you can get better control of your own food supply... for example raise whatever you can, buy direct from the farmer at the farm or at farmers' markets, at the very least eat simpler and make as much as possible from scratch and fresh foods rather than buying prepackaged, highly processed foods.<br /><br />One point I would like to make about the chickens is that they are not \\"forced\\" to grow unnaturally fast as some reviewers say... they have been BRED to grow that way.  I grow the same chickens, Cornish Cross broilers, in my \\"back yard\\" (we have 10 acres).  Mine spend the first three weeks in the brooder til they are feathered out, and in addition to meat bird starter get hand pulled clover and grass with dirt and roots, as well as all the fine hay bits leftover from feeding other animals.  After moving to pasture pens I cut their high-powered Meat Grower feed with 25% plain scratch because in my first batch, before I cut the feed, I did have a few keel over from congestive heart failure from too-rapid growth.  They also get moved to fresh grass 2-3x daily.  No problems with the next two batches -- I ordered 75 chicks and was shipped 79 (a good hatchery always includes a few extras) in those batches and had only 3 die, and those within the first few days, weak ones/shipping stress.  I butchered from 6 to 8 weeks of age and while I did not weigh them, visually they were almost all larger than the storebought birds which are usually 3-1/2 to 4 lbs.  In fact some were Godzilla chickens, about 8-10 lbs!<br /><br />I love meat and will never be vegetarian unless I am forced to it.  Some people will take this movie as a call to vegetarianism.  I see it as a reason to buy your food direct from the farmer who grows it, one who allows you to visit the farm personally and see how it is raised.  \\"Organic\\" simply means the animal was fed organically-grown feed.  The animals can still be raised in terrible conditions and their meat labelled \\"Organic\\".  \\"Cage Free\\" and \\"Free Range\\" does not mean the birds are happily running around a pasture... it can mean there are still hundreds or thousands crowded at a square foot per bird into buildings, with all their food,water and shade inside so even if there is one small door to the \\"free range\\" outside they are likely not going to use it.<br /><br />I want to know how my meat was raised and how it died and was processed.  I am lucky in that I can raise and home butcher my own pork and chicken and buy my beef from a friend who raises her animals the same way I do.  Many cities are allowing folks within the city limits to keep chickens, so anyone can now keep their own for eggs or meat.  My own town has no regs against livestock at all and I know a man in the middle of town who raised a pig in his back yard last year.  He does have a large lot and kept the pen scrupulously clean so the neighbors would not have any complaints about smell.  Laying hens and meat birds make a lot less noise than your average dog.  Just don't keep any roosters to avoid annoying the neighbors (with meat birds sex doesn't matter, they are butchered long before they begin crowing).ose batches and had only 3 die, and those within the first few days, weak ones/shipping stress.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|I must say, after watching the first season, I asked myself, how could they possibly top this? It was so great of a show that I thought it was gonna be one of those shows that had a great start and then drops to mediocre............Not with this show!!  And now that I've seen all of season two, i can say just one thing, WOW!!!!!  Season two delivers in more ways than season one did!!!  I'll admit, it was much darker than season one but all the more better.  New characters, bigger character development and one hell of a twist (or twists).  If you haven't seen this show, i highly recommend you jump on the bandwagon!!  This normally isnt my kind of show (or so I thought), but when I bought the first for real cheap and out of curiosity, I had to own all three seasons......Speaking of which, it's a shame that television cancels all of the good shows and leaves the craaaaaaaap still on air.  If you have nothing but good things about this show, trust me, it lives up to its reputation and so much more.  even though it doesn't portray our world accurately, it brillaint defines youngsters having important and pivitol roles like older people and thats what i respect about about the show.  It definately made its place as my favorite show!!!!  And it gets better, SEASON THREE IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST TWO!!!!
B00000E2QI|5.0|Wow! What an amazing recording by Chailly!<br /><br />I`m not much into choral works. I prefer my symphonies and concertos. I`ve always found this piece, however, quite enjoyable, having heard fine renditions from the local libraries by Jochum on DG, Dutoit`s lovely Montreal on Decca, and Levine`s impressive DG Chicago recording from the `80`s. Yet none of these performances urged me to actually buy one.<br /><br />However, when I first heard this 1983 version, I was completely entranced. In Trutina by Silvia Greenberg brought tears to my eyes. O Fortuna was more intense than any of the previously mentioned performances, especially with the 2-beat drum resonating fiercely.<br /><br />The tempi are perfect: very consistently paced. The sound is fresh and sharp, as many early stereo recordings from Decca in the 1980`s were.<br /><br />For Orff (and as well for Mahler 3), Chailly is the best choice for me.

I enjoy science-fiction and particularly plausible representations of what society/ civilization (so-called) might look like in the future. To my mind the author's view of the world in the very near future seems all too plausible and would even seem inevitable if not for a doubt that the good guys will have that much high tech at their disposal and be that well-organized. What am I saying? Read between the lines of the daily news reports and extrapolate. Thankfully, I have an Ark, faith in the GOD of Abraham and the Father of Jesus.

B0019X3YXM|1.0|I would not have written a review for this movie, had I not been embroiled in real-life relationships with hardcore narcissists, and reading books about how to get over them and, importantly, identify them before falling head over heels for them.<br />From the very beginning of the movie, my jaw hit the floor. I think in the past I may have found Elisha Cuthbert's character compelling, \\"free-spirited\\" and attractive, but now... She is a by-the-book, larger than life, larger than psychology textbook hardcore narcissist; she disrupts poor guy's life in every possible way, has him arrested, harassed, concussed, humiliated, estranged from what matters to him. She constantly disrupts his life, his schedule, whatever he wants, or builds, or wishes for, she has to come first, she is grossly irresponsible, immature, \\"cute\\", \\"dangerous\\". She introduces him without warning to a new love interest, she plays hot when he can't take it anymore, she pouts, she faints, she sues him, takes him to Daddy so Daddy can make him feel 2 inches tall and show NO RESPECT whatsoever for any part of him.<br />Of course, some \\"reason\\" is found by the the end of the movie. Whatever.<br />Funnily enough, I watched Chasing Amy a day after watching My Sassy Girl, and CA's characters's reality, sensitivity, honesty and sometimes great maturity were an eerie clash to MSG's. Same setting (New York), same age group, 2 blonde heroines... but one of them just makes you want to throw her from a very high bridge... and no further resemblances can be found!<br />I am in the process of learning that real life isn't what's portrayed in the movies. And MSG could do a lot of damage, if believed...

I decided to remedy that this Christmas, and spent considerable time reading reviews of this and other Carpenters Chrismtas CDs. I was a bit leery of some other reviewers' comments about too many instrumental selections on this collection. Well, take my advice: buy it. Those instrumental pieces are absolutely beautiful medleys of Christmas carols and songs that open each of the CDs. They provide a very nice lead-in to Karen's beautiful vocal work.    This has already become one of my favorite Christmas CDs.
B002VKE0XA|1.0|This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The hype promoting it was better entertainment then the movie.
0316010669|4.0|I haven't read the rest of Gladwell's library yet, however, if the rest of his books meet the quality of this one, I'll pick them up. I was fascinated by the case studies used to prove his point of snap judgments- it really went a long way to explain how we can 'know' something without any empirical evidence.
0312370849|4.0|It's been a couple weeks since I read Sarah's Key and the book, straight-forward despite its back-and-forth structure between 1942 and the present, has stayed with me. It's a simple but memorable story of a romance, a pregnancy, and marriage in the present, and the horrors of the holocaust in 1942. Tatriana de Rosnay did a craftsman's job of putting this together - the structure and writing are solid. It's a quick read - I'd recommend it for a vacation but not necessarily a readers' group where you might want more depth.    For those interested in France and World War II, Irène Némirovsky's Suite Française is also wonderful.
1591843162|3.0|I got an early copy of Seth Godin's new book \\"Linchpin: Are you indispensable\\" because I made a $40 donation to the charity Acumen. In return, I agreed to review the book in a blog post at my site. Here goes, I hope you find this helpful.    Every once in a while I run across a book that is so important, so compelling, so unique with respect to not only content but also writing style that I can't put it down until I finish it. This is not one of those books (for me); nevertheless, I am going to recommend it because I concur with his core message and if you have not heard it before from other sources, I think you need to hear it now.    Parts of this book are brilliant - they will change how I talk about my core message. Much of what Seth had to say in this book was not new to me, and frankly I prefer the way others have said it. But Seth has a style of writing that will appeal to many, and I predict many will come away reading this book thinking it is the most important book they have read in a long time.  Don't get me wrong, I am a BIG fan of Seth Godin, but for this book such claims would be pretentious.    Here is Seth's bottom line:        I didn't set out to get you to quit your job or to persuade you to become an entrepreneur or merely to change the entire world. All I wanted to do in this book was sell you on being the artist you already are. To make a difference. To stand for something. To get the respect and security you deserve. If I've succeeded, then you know that you have a gift to give, something you can do to change the world (or your part of it) for the better. I hope you'll do that, because we need you. (p. 230).    I think he succeeded, and if you have never heard this message, then I encourage you to get this book and read it. Seth is right, we need you to make a difference, to stand for something. YOU need you to make a difference.    A linchpin is someone that is remarkable. They bring the emotional labor to their work. They pour themselves intowhat they do because they know it is the right thing to do, and they become better people for living and working this way. This also makes them very scarce, and that scarcity makes them valuable - indispensable.    Seth defines art as \\"the intentional act of using your humanity to create a change in another person\\" (p. 99). I love that. Seth acknowledges that when we give to others, the law of reciprocity kicks in and they will feel indebted to return our favor. But Seth reminded me that when we give to others with no expectation of anything in return, that posture of unconditional generosity changes us. It creates abundance in our lives and in the lives of those we connect with at work and in our communities. I've known that for a long time, but is always good to be reminded of it. Thanks, Seth.    I wish this book had been 50 pages and free on the internet instead of 236 pages and $15 on Amazon. Then more people that need to hear this message of remarkable, abundant living might get it. Alas, this book to some extent represents the cog in the system that is the object of Seth's lament.    Read more: [...]
B002XUL85G|5.0|This movie is GREAT. The only thing I would have liked to see is the names at the end going slower so you could pick out your name (if you answered that email and put your name in for the credits).
B00009R6J3|4.0|This 1/4\\" to 3/8\\" adapter works.  It is well made.   I'm using this on my old (late 1970's) but excellent tripod that only has 1/4-20 hardware. And I needed something to fit my Kirk BH-3 ballhead to tripod. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the flange could be larger diameter to give more support. Highly recommended.
B001EN71DG|3.0|I feel old, I remember when I saw Star Wars, & at the theatre they were handing out \\"Bad News Bears\\" batting helmets, of course times change the theatre that I saw \\"Star Wars\\" in was eventually converted to an 'adult' movie theatre.Sigh.    You have to look at it this way, this is George Lucas' baby, and the only way to not accept his vision is to not buy the product. I like having the original releases, however I just wish they included the \\"making of\\" dvd, with this set, I really don't want to drop $30plus on that DVD alone. Don't get me started with the Prequels, I have no problem with Episode 1, if I was 5 I would be kind of psyched, I wasn't 5 when I saw Episode 1, the writing was really poor, I did enjoy having the Tuscan Raiders, portrayed as drunken hillbillies, also just all of Lucas stereotyping with all of the creatures, yes I wish Jar Jar have never been thought of would like to see a death cage match between Jar Jar and the Ewoks.     When I heard Lucas hired writers for Episode 2 I was happy until I saw the film, episode 2 is just plain awful, except for the last 45 minutes, overall just a cluster of good intentions gone horribly wrong. The there is Episode 3, great action scenes holy crap writing (As Harrison Ford once said \\"George can write this s***, but whose going to say these lines\\") and if I'm wrong all apologies. The Star Wars prequel just demonstrates to leave well enough alone, however the 2nd & 3rd Matrix films all time worst in my book only 1 Matrix film made.    Back to Star Wars, this DVD set first night I got it I ended up watching the 'extended editions' with the commentaries, and they weren't half bad, however Greedo never shot first.    So it is nice to have the original and altered versions of the first saga, \\"Fanboys\\" has its heart in the right place and if George had that passion with the Prequels as the makers of that movie (Fanboys) Lucas wouldn't be so heavily criticized.

0553381687|5.0|I normally read nonfiction but will read some fiction based upon recommendations.  I have read the first three books in the Song of Ice and Fire series and highly recommend this book and the other two that I have read:  A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords.  This series has excellent character development and engrossing storylines.  I rate this series on par with Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.
B002WY65UQ|4.0|I loved St Trinians as a kid. This doesn't come up to the original standard,  but does have a standard of its own. It's a fun escape and I totally enjoyed  it. There is not an actor in this that didn't do a good job. And the music is  great. I immediately  went to itunes and downloaded the theme. The lyrics  are brilliant. They fill me with girl-power:)
0547258305|2.0|I LIKED THE IDEA OF THIS BOOK, BUT SOME OF THE PARTS WERE VERY SLOW FOR ME. IT IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER 400 PAGES BUT I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THROUGH IT. THE WRITING FOR THE FIGHTING THAT OCCURED IN THE BOOK WAS LACKING TOO. (UNLIKE MISTBORN OVER 650, WITH A STRONG FEMALE HERO AND I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN) I ALSO HAD A HARD TIME WITH THE NEGATIVE VIEW ON MARRIAGE, (NOT BECAUSE I FEEL THAT TEENAGERS SHOULD GET LEG SHACKLED TO JUST ANYONE THEY SHAG) BUT BECAUSE KASTA HAD IT SET IN HER MIND WHAT SHE WANTED AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE CARED HOW HER \\"LOVER\\" FELT. KASTA CAME OFF AS VERY SELFISH AND I FEEL THAT SOME PEOPLE CONFUSE THAT WITH BEING STRONG. NOT SO.  THIS IS NOT A BOOK I WOULD INCOURAGE MY TEENAGERS TO READ.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I bought 2 of the DVD's for $30.00 each and they seem not to be the authentic product from Disney. The packaging looks grainy and contains spelling errors and typos galore. The video itself has what appears to be recording marks that appear in the upper left hand corner and the video quality is not as clear as it should be. VERY DISAPPOINTING- I'll think twice about buying another video off of Amazon.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This performance does not disappoint.  Everyone heard I Dreamed a Dream before and I love hearing it again.  The other selections have been as delightful.  Happy to have purchased this...it arrived quickly and continues to please...
1933308087|3.0|This book is very heavy, perhaps it should have been in two volumes. Also the print is extremely small, and the gold lettering is almost impossible to read even under an Ott light. It deffinitely has substantial research but the print makes it too difficult to appreciate.
B000J103OI|3.0|The Devil Wears Prada is not the greatest comedy in the world and it doesn't really evoke belly laughs, but i didn't feel like i wasted the money on the DVD. Anne Hathaway was a little young to play the character she did, but her earnestness in the role was sorta winning. Meryl Streep is an incredible actress (duh!) and i can't imagine why she took such a mediocre script, but she is funny and believable in this otherwise drecky movie. If the premise sounds like something you'd enjoy, i suggest renting it first rather than buying. It's dumb, but kinda funny...mostly.

1416594787|5.0|In \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" Dawkins explains several bodies of research, each of which alone proves Darwin's theorum*.  (*I like Dawkins' proposal for the use of an unambiguous term for \\"a model that fits the existing facts related to a specific subject.\\")  Given the evidence presented, the reasonable conclusion is that the diversity of life on Earth formed primarily through natural selection over a period of billions of years.    For those who choose to ignore or deny the evidence, or those who enjoy arguing with anonymous strangers on the Internet, I invite you to flame me for my honest, intelligent and reasonable opinion.  Don't be surprised if I don't reply to your comments here.  I prefer to spend my precious time on more fruitful pursuits.
1416583408|2.0|Reads like a text book for vet school.  Found it mostly boring with a few kernels of knowledge I needed to know.
0385737947|5.0|My son Edward (13) had this to say about the book: When I first saw this book, I knew it was going to be good. In this book, A boy named Tom is sent to a place called the Glade. He has no recollection of his family, his friends or why he is there. When he arrives, the Gladers are waiting for him. They are all male, and all the same age. none of them have any memories, just like him. The next day, a girl arrives, the first one ever. Things change after that. Great book! It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|I received my purchase very promptly after ordering. However, when the box set was opened on Christmas morning, the first disc was scratched so severely that it wouldn't play! Although this was probably something due to shipping, I feel that more than $2 of the $10 shipping fee should have been refunded. Getting a replacement sent was a breeze though.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Good story line, but, without original crew. Scotty will be missed 4ever! He can never be replaced in my opinion. Was glad to see Lenord Nimoy playing his father. Live long and prosper!
0439023483|4.0|This book came highly recommended. I enjoyed it. Really hopeing the next one Catching Fire comes out on Kindle soon.
0439023483|5.0|My son (13) had this to say: This book was outstanding! I could never put it down! I stayed up practically all night reading it! In this book, Katniss Everdeen is a girl living in the land of Panem, built on top of the ruins of what used to be North America. Her sister, Primrose Everdeen, is selected to compete in the deadliest event called the Hunger Games. The hunger games are similar to gladiator fights, except the arena in which they are held can hold anything from a desert to a desert similar to Antarctica. Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. This adventure story keeps you on the edge of your seat as the author puts a new twist at every turn.
0321344758|4.0|Don't Make Me Think, 2nd edition, is about building usability into websites from the start, not adding it on at the end. Thus, the author spends time on usability considerations during the design and development process.    Having been working with websites for several years, I was already familiar with much of the material, but not all. I was happy for the coverage of user testing - that is something I will need to do more of when working on consulting projects.    Admittedly, there was not much material here that I was not already aware of, and much of it is common-sense type stuff, but there were useful tidbits throughout. Plus it is nice to have all this information in a slim and concise volume. As a result, I will be able to quickly review it whenever getting into a new project, just so I know I am planning it right from the start.    This slim book distills much wisdom surrounding website usability, and is worth a read for anyone involved in the process of building a website.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and now it is out on blu-ray! Awesome! If you loved the original, you will be so happy with this copy. I highly recommend it for anyone's collection.

0439023491|5.0|My son (13) purchased this book after starting the series with one I bought him for Christmas.  Here's what he had to say about it!  This book was absolutely outstanding! I could never put it down! Suzanne Collins is an outstanding author. If you haven't read this book, you simply must read it! I would recommend that you read the first book, The Hunger Games. In this book, Katniss and Peeta go on a victory tour after they win the Hunger Games. After the tour, things change. There's a new head Peacekeeper named Thread. Gale is strapped to the whipping post for hunting on the Capitol's land. There are rumors of rebellion, and even a thriving district 13. Will Katniss and Peeta survive? Find out in Catching Fire, the second book of the Hunger Games. Great Book!
B000RJO578|4.0|My wife and I watched this the other night.  It was funny, entertaining and not formulaic.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I will be returning this mobile, unfortunately - it will not fit on the Ragazzi Etruria shaker stage crib, and I feel there might be similar issues with other convertible cribs - a definite design flaw, considering the current popularity of convertible crbs.  The top railing is too high to allow the crib to be mounted, since the lip determines the placement, and the bottom of the mobile does not come down far enough to expose the hole where the clamp attaches.   Wish I knew about this before I ordered - every other Fisher-Price model shows the mounting in pictures, and all the other mobiles use straps to hold it in place, not a lip plus clamp, and this mounting style was NOT apparent in any of the stock photos.  Not recommended for convertible cribs.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I wanted to like the book but I didn't finish it because it was vulgar. I couldn't even donate it to my local libary, it was too embarrasing. I was not surprised that Julia Child was not a fan of the blog. Also, Julia Child was proud of her work as a secretary and all the author could do was compare secretarial work as being a total failure. But the movie--glossed over those bits and it was fun and tastful. Don't miss it, the movie that is.

B002SJIO54|4.0|\\"District 9\\"  (2009)<br />-----------------------------------<br />(Mildly spoilerish review below)<br />-----------------------------------<br />A grotty but gripping sci-fi tragedy that begins with a city-sized spaceship that becomes marooned over Johannesburg, South Africa and is found to contain over a million refugee aliens.  The South Africans, having plenty of experience with apartheid, quickly move the buglike aliens into a large shanty town called District Nine, where squalor and crime run rampant.  Twenty years later, tensions between the \\"prawns\\" (as the aliens are derogatorily called) and humans come to a head, and a decision is made to move them onto a reservation, far off in the African bush. The evictions are under the supervision of a bland, seemingly nervous bureaucrat with a thick (and charming) Afrikaans accent, the kind of fumpfering, nebbishy functionary that proliferate in the UN and various European NGOs... But behind this seemingly innocent facade, the man's true character is soon revealed, as he heartlessly carries out thousands of illegal evictions, all held at the point of a machine gun... with full air support. The development of this central character is what makes this film fascinating -- the layers of cruelty, pettiness and glimmers of humanity, which make for one of the more interesting performances in recent years. In no small part this success is due to the script, which, while flooded with gory, disturbing images, is also quite multi-layered and skillfully crafted.  Good, solid sci-fi, with an entirely plausible scenario for how the human race might meet with a less-than-overwhelming alien invasion.  Recommended!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B0015AARJI|5.0|there is no controller for the ps3 better than the original. the only things that can be improved are through a fps freek joystick add-on, which i love and use for everything, and i also suggest dual triggers for the controller, you have to try them and see for yourself, i use both of them on every game that i play. I would suggest staying away from the speedfreek, i don't ever use that add-on.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This review is for \\"It's A Wonderful Life (Two-Disc Collector's Set)(B/W & Color)\\" SD DVD set. The holiday classic receives a wonderful treatment here. Video is crisp, audio is clear. I was skeptical of the color version at first, this movie is one of those that I've always felt would be better left b&w, but they did an excellent job. The colors are realistic not over done and also very precise as if done pixel by pixel on the original print. I truly enjoy both versions. Best of all I can now watch this iconic film on MY schedule.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I had been looking for Susan Boyle's CD ever since seeing her on television.  When I found it on Amazon.com I ordered it right away and it's been playing ever since.  I love, love, love it.  The songs are so beautiful and relaxing.  I'm waiting for her next release.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|If you enjoy movies that have a happy ending, a cheesy sing-along moment, and thought-provoking characters, you will love \\"Love Actually.\\" The movie portrays several different types of love through the relationships between characters. This is one of several recent movies (Babel, Crash, 21 Grams) that shows how its several characters are astoundingly and, against all odds, interconnected. Although the premise of the film seems extremely cheesy, even the most cynical viewer will find a heartwarming and personal moment to respond positively to.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Fantastic...with blu-ray it's like watching the movie for the first time, the exteriors are raised to a new level making this movie more enjoyable, and you can't beat the terrific action, and acting. Highly recommend.
B000026OW3|5.0|This is an incredible collection. I have been listening through the box and am up to disc ten this morning. I don't know how anyone can claim not to like classical music when you listen to the beauty of Chopin's Berceuse. The color and beauty of Rubinstein's playing is beyond description. Buy this music for your children, your grandchildren, your friends. The price is unbeatable. Yes there are other great Chopin pianists. However, this is a great starting point. I would start with the nocturnes Disc 2, waltzes Disc 9,  disc 10, and polonaises disc 6. Beware this music is addictive. It is an addiction that you will never regret. If you enjoy these recordings your next purchase should be the nocturnes with Moravec. Other recommendations will follow. One of my great regrets in life is never seeing Rubinstein play in person. Check out the two videos on DG. Whenever my spirits are down this music cures it.
B002T9H2MO|2.0|Moon is Director Duncan Jones' homage to slowly-paced, reflective science fiction films of the sixties and seventies; its debt to 2001 and Silent Running is obvious.  The film mainly serves as a vehicle for Sam Rockwell's performance as a lonely astronaut. That's not necessarily a bad thing; Rockwell is a colorful actor, who always brings a goofy charm to his roles.<br /><br />The problem is the plot.  It is based on an existential crisis that arises when the protagonist realizes that he is not who he thought he was.  Science fiction novelist Phillip K. Dick used to make a living writing these kinds of stories, but what works in a short story often fails to sustain a feature-length film.  The main question in Moon is answered by the middle of the film. Though Rockwell gives nicely-nuanced performances as different versions of himself, it's not enough to maintain dramatic tension.  A few devices are employed to do that - such as a clock ticking down to the protagonist's return trip - but since the viewer knows the protagonist's identity by then, the resolution is obvious.<br /><br />It's nice that this film does so much with its miniscule budget.  Personally, I love to see its reliance on physical models rather than CG.  The \\"Earthrise\\" shots are quite beautiful.  The interiors copy the sterile white look of the aforementioned films.  Kevin Spacey's computer character, \\"GERTY\\" is an annoyance though; it can only be termed an unimaginative rip-off of 2001's HAl-9000 computer.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's not the budget that hinders Moon, it's the paucity of new ideas that render it sterile.
B0026P3G12|2.0|There was a time not that long ago when everyone involved in a recording session assembled in a studio, the sound engineer sat in the control booth, and away they went. But not any more, apparently. The credits for Susan Boyle's first CD state \\"Mixed by Ren Swan. Recorded and mixed at Rokstone Studios, London\\". So far, so good, but they continue \\"Strings recorded at Air Studios, London\\", and a little further on \\"Choir recorded at Sphere Studios and Rokstone Studios\\". The danger of separate sessions is that the vocalist is oblivious to the sounds that will be added in at a later stage. The result, sadly, is plain to hear on this CD; a disconnect between the dynamics of Susan Boyle's voice and the so-called accompaniment, which has all too obviously been grafted on, and sounds unnatural. It's a master class in how not to do it. The fact that the CD has sold in bucketloads does not alter that fact. The acid test is whether it will still be played in say twenty years time. Somehow I doubt it.    That is not to denigrate Susan Boyle, for whom I have nothing but admiration, but I fear her career will be meteoric unless she can find a producer better able to showcase her talent.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|The blu-ray version of this movie is incredible, blu-ray has the ability to capture the colours and yes even the sweat. I highly recommend purchasing this classic Paul Newman movie...well worth the price.

0385493622|3.0|This is a book of flashbacks. The main story is Wiles' eventual proof of a conjecture which implies the truth of Fermat's \\"Last Theorem\\". The flashbacks provide background for understanding in a very elementary way what ideas were used in the proof, and who else contributed to essential ideas beneath and within the proof. But the flashbacks often go beyond this purpose, and this gives the book the feel of being expanded to fill enough pages for a book. The filler in this case, however, has real value in itself as popular mathematics, but as a whole the book reads like a series of mathematical tangents, at least until later chapters when the drama of Wiles' final work on the proof shows, I think, the significance that rigorous proof has to mathematics. A narrative structure that didn't try to dramatize and flash back, which was linear and introduced Wiles at the end of the book instead of using him as a hook for the entire narrative, would have made a better book.     Incidentally, the story of Galois as told in this book would make an excellent film. There is a book [[ASIN:0425172910 The French Mathematician: A Novel]], by Tom Petsinis, based on Galois' life. I have not read it.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle's voice is so beautiful and mellow. This CD is great for easy listening. I play it on the way to work to put me in a good mood. I expected a little more variety on her choice of songs, but I realize she is shy and new to the game.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|These three movies are an excellent pre-cursor to the Mark Hamil/Harrison Ford Star Wars movies.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|I bought these headphones to replace an old set of low-end SONY's I'd had for years. I'm not bashing SONY, just those headphones. They had no bass to them and in order to hear bass in my iTunes music and youtube videos, I had to crank the volume which didn't do my ears a lot of good. These are the polar opposite. They sound excellent and fit very comfortably over your ears. They will eventually make your ears sore, but that will take 2.5 to 3 hours. These have a lot in common with the K77s. A relative of mine who works in a recording studio recommended these to me over some Sennheisers I had been considering. I'm glad I chose these. The only downsides to these are that they look a bit funny since the plastic \\"frame\\" sits high over your head, and they are a bit chunky so I'd avoid traveling with them. Excellent phones, though. I'm very pleased with them.
B002HREKCI|4.0|I read this book in one day because it was a page turner... it's hard for me to find really really good books and this was definitely one of them, but i just wouldve liked a little more in the ending. it was over too soon and i wanted more explanation i guess.  i also thought that maybe Hannah could've had a little bit of better reasons for killing herself.  i thought (spoiler alert!!) in the beginning when the book kind of alluded to the english teacher as being involved that he maybe either sexually abused her or tried to or something.  he just didnt say what she wanted to hear and it was kind of not enough for me to see killing yourself over.  This was a great book though and i will probably read it again someday!
B0000X61VE|5.0|Have used it for years in VHS version. Glad to see it in DVD form.  Definitely recommend it!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is among of the best superhero movies ever. In fact, if it wasn't for Batman's suit and Batmobile, you could easily argue this is among the best detective movies. It has an engaging storyline, spectacular action sequences, great characters portrayed wonderfully by a talented cast, and great direction (as usual) from Christopher Nolan. It's a crime this movie wasn't at least nominated for Best Picture in 2008. Here you have a rarity - a movie which the public and critics alike almost universally praised.    Christian Bale again does a great job as Batman, supported by Michael Caine as Alfred and Gary Oldman as Gordon. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox with a host of new gadgets for Batman, including a modified cellphone which can act as a kind of sonar. The standout performance though goes to Heath Ledger as the Joker. He brings a dark and maniacal quality to the character which matches how he was represented in many of the Batman comic books, as a dangerous lunatic. In many of the scenes the Joker is both amusing and terrifying at the same time. When holed up in the same room alone with the Batman, it is clear the Batman has met his match, which forces Batman to consider actions he previously would've shied away from.    Batman starts out by cracking down on organized crime. Seeing him as a major threat, the crime bosses bring in the Joker to deal with him but are unable to control him. Even the crime bosses quickly become afraid of the unpredictable Joker. The Joker targets several officials, including Harvey Dent, the up-and-coming District Attorney who has been using official channels to stamp out crime even as Batman uses his unofficial methods. Dent has one other thing in common with Batman - he's dating Rachel Dawes, the woman Batman still loves but won't become involved with fearing it'll make her a target. Ironically, she soon becomes a target because of her association with Dent. Those familiar with the Batman storylines from past comics, TV shows,and movies will also know Dent as the one who changes to become Two-Face. When targeting officials isn't enough, the Joker manages to pit regular people and hardened criminals against each other in an attempt to show man's nature.    The chase scenes in the movie are some of the best action sequences I've seen. \\"The Dark Knight\\" provides a great mix of action and psychological drama. It adds a touch of romance with the ill-fated love of Batman for Rachel. And the Joker provides many funny moments, even while he's being menacing. In short, this movie has something for everyone. It transcends the superhero movie genre.
1899618740|3.0|Okay, is it just me? Am I missing something? I saw this book being demonstrated on YouTube and thought it would be a great gift for my niece, so I looked it up on Amazon. As far as I can tell from this and other sites, the book is out of print and not available new, and quite a few people have it listed on various sites for anywhere between nine hundred dollars and two thousand dollars! What's up with that? Can someone please explain? I get that it's out of print, ok, but is ANYONE possibly selling these used books at those prices? If so, apparently we've pulled right out of the recession without me knowing about it! I mean, come on, it seems like a cute, fun book that would be amusing and entertaining for a short while, but it's not the holy grail!<br />If anyone could please shed some light on where I could get a copy of this book at a reasonable price, I'd greatly appreciate knowing about it. Thanks very much in advance.<br />Jimi
B000002WUD|5.0|What a great collection,I believe that this is Elvis at his best. I love the range and scope of his 70's recordings. A Must have box set. I still have a un opened box giving to me as a present.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I liked this one but not as well as her first one, as it was a little bouncier and twists you around a bit more.  Still some good new moves to work in with my First version.  I would recommend this.
B00006IUL7|4.0|While this isn't the sort of thriller which will keep you on the edge or your seat, it will keep your interest throughout. Nolan does a great job directing, as usual, and it has a very talented cast, lead by Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams. Williams does a very good job in a rare dramatic and creepy part. There's no element of his more well-known comedic side here at all. With a few well-placed twists, the movie will keep you guessing.    LA detective Dormer (Pacino) is sent with his partner Eckhart to a small town in Alaska, in part to get away from an evolving investigation into their department and, more officially, to help with a homicide investigation. The little town of Nightmute isn't used to homicides, so when Dormer arrives to help, young officer Burr (Swank), who looks up to Dormer, is thankful for his help. None of the local officers are aware of the LA internal affairs investigation, but it's the main thing on the minds of Eckhart, who has decided he will testify, and Dormer, who is afraid of being ruined because of his action in a previous homicide case. Dormer is unable to sleep - partly because of the constant Alaskan sunlight and partly due to feelings of guilt - and this visibly wears on him. Before long Dormer identifies and lcoates the girl's killer, Finch, a police mystery writer, but things are far from over. Finch recognizes Dormer's weakened condition and has something on him. When Finch hatches a plan that would help them both get off free, Dormer has to choose either to play along or to try to outsmart him. Can he get justice for the murdered girl without implicating himself in other matters?    The Alaskan scenery throughout the movie is both picturesque and somehow oppressive. Its stark nature adds to the sense of disorientation from Dormer's insomnia. The combination of beauty and eeriness reminded me of \\"Twin Peaks\\", though it has none of that TV show's quirkiness. Alaska looks like it would be a nice place to visit... but Ican easily imagine how the perpetual daylight some months and perpetual darkness other months would take its toll.    With good acting, evocative scenery, and a simple but well-devised plot, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a quality thriller. So far Christopher Nolan hasn't disappointed.
0316044695|5.0|As a former Army soldier, I have a great interest and respect for the stories of dedication and sacrefice. It was an honor to read this great NAVY Seal's tale, a man who along with his team sacraficed so much for themselves and their country.<br /><br />Please read this book, you will be let inside the lives of men who fight. He allows you to see the comical side of fighting men even in the middle of a heated fire fight. The scenes get so intense that you just don't want to put the book down. The auther has a way of painting a vivid picture of his friends/team-mates that when the worst happens you feel like they were your close friends. You feel as if you are part of the very story itself, feeling every emotion along with him.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This CD is excellent. Every song is terrific and sung with Michael Buble's own style.  I'm constantly playing it in the car and singing along as well!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a beautiful movie that harkens back to all of the wonderful things we expect to see in a classical Disney movie.  It is artistic, creative, the music is beautiful, and everything is well done.<br /><br />Good things to focus on:<br />  The overarching theme in this movie is the importance of having a balanced life.  The heroine believes hard work is important and can make dreams happen.  But she also learns that we can't be consumed by work.  We have to have margins in our life for family and fun.<br />  The prince learns that an excess of fun with no hard work results in limited options in life, a lack of purpose, and even loneliness.<br />  There are a few implied lessons as well.  We see the importance of treating all people kindly and respectfully as a minor villain works against the prince in retaliation for being mistreated.  Also, other characters are sometimes careless in how they treat their neighbors and friends.  We also see an example in the importance of helping others as the bayou animals work together to help the heroine and the prince.  The prince also learns that he should be wiser in choosing who he trusts, as he is pathetically duped by the villain, even though he was warned by his companion.<br /><br />Things parents might want to know about:<br />  There is definitely a dark element in this movie with the `voodoo'.  I do not personally know much about it, but the villain uses tarot cards and talks to and makes deals with spirits.  It might be kind of scary for very young kids.<br />  The villain does kill one of the lovable supporting characters.<br />  The outfits many of the girls in the movie wear leave little to the imagination.  Even compared to The Little Mermaid, I think this movie has more cleavage and tight fitting outfits than any other Disney cartoon I've seen.  Some things are drawn very realistically.  At one point a bouncy female character (and I mean `bouncy') takes up most of the screen to quite vigorously adjust her bosom.
1594152497|5.0|This book does not \\"preach\\" or hand out a series of self-help remedies for daily woes. It functions to instill a language for the reader that enables clear articulation of what we all know inside to be the truth--the reality of Being and its applicable value. This language is accompanied with a profound sense of inner peace, which has also helped me dissolve conflicts among my friends and loved ones. In fact, the depth of understanding to be gained is invaluable, especially when compared to the minute price tag. This manifesto of the present moment is so moving that I have actually bought multiple copies because I keep lending out/ giving away my own.
0446569895|5.0|I have read many books, but have never written a review, until now. I Am Ozzy is hilarious and very informative. This is one of those books that you can not put down. A MUST READ
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The tale of how a villian becomes a supervillian is funny, smart and  poignant.  It made me love Neal Patrick Harris.  I already loved Joss Whedon & Captain Tightpants.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A wonderful picture!Kept my interest for the entire movie. Anamation was great, and Ed Asner made the character real.
B00000DOZH|5.0|One of the best rock and roll albums to ever be put out. Bon Scott saved teh best for last, even though he did not know it was his last. Angus young shows his true talent with his raging guitar. There are so many recognizable song on this album that as soon as you hear the start it is easy to know it is AC/DC. I love this album and even if some of the lyrics trail off in directions that most people do not want to hear they stand by themselves as great music.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|This movie got 90% positive on rotten tomatoes.  This must be because the critics are mostly left-wing progressives (aka ultra liberals).  Okay, the aliens (metaphor for undocumented immigrants, I guess.) are here because their spaceship broke down or they ran out of gas (pretty dumb for advanced super smart space beings).  They act and live like sort of uneducated/criminal/primitive subhumans. BUT, they are smarter than humans, obviously, due to their advanced technology, and they are much faster and stronger (but they're easily intimidated and bullied by humans).  Then, also, they have weapons that are far more advanced than ours, BUT Chris the alien refuses to use them to protect himself or his alien brothers.  The contradictions are many and inexplicable.  What's the rest of the metaphor here?  That aliens in our own society should be treated fairly and humanely because even though they have strange eating habits and are criminals, they are really pacific geniuses with super human strength that just want to hold hands and sing about peace?  And, finally, the evil people in this movie are weapons manufacturers.  Ironically, their obsession is with the far more deadly weapons that the aliens brought with them.  The blacks in the movie (the Nigerian gangsters) are portrayed as Voodoo, barbaric exploiters of the poor defenseless, but super strong and super smart, aliens.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love this show.  Amazon was super quick in delivering my dvds, and I'm excited to finally get to watch all the episodes I've missed.
1591843162|5.0|I don't know where to begin with a review of one of the most powerful, relevant books I've ever read regarding business.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis (some of you may of heard of him) writes books about faith, God, and Christianity. Maybe you know him from the movie Chronicles of Narnia. I was talking to a friend  of mine today about him and about how much thought and passion and depth he puts into each sentence. Most books you can glean a few good ideas from but C.S. has a great or powerful idea in, literally, every sentence.<br /><br />I say all this to say that I think Seth is the C.S. of business. It feels like there were hours of work put into each sentence and paragraph he writes. Maybe there weren't, maybe he's just a genius, or maybe he's a genius AND poured in thousands of hours of work put in.<br /><br />The most powerful takeaway, for me, is that we are all mapmakers. Artists (everyone honing a beautiful craft, not just painters and musicians) make their own maps. They don't use old maps or steal from other people's maps, they make their own beautiful, creative, organic maps. And they follow them no matter the monetary value they receive.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I really did my homework in choosing a fitness watch with heart rate monitor. I ordered competing models from Garmin, Timex, Polar, and Suunto, to look them over closely and compare.  Then I sent them all back but this one.<br /><br />Someone pointed out that this Garmin watch is a little on the clunky side - that's true.  I have a small wrist,and the watch part of it is long and flat and doesn't really fit nicely.  They had to pack the GPS receiver inside the band. But no matter - with the band strapped tight, it stays put, and it's not so huge that people would say \\"What's that thing on her wrist?\\"  It still looks like a watch. A funky sort of a watch maybe, but not a television set or anything.<br /><br />I think you need to decide if you want GPS or not.  I decided that yes, I really wanted GPS to measure my distance, because I run and jog and hike and travel quite a bit, so my routes are always changing. In my ideal world, I'd be able to pop up a map on my PC and see my route, and have a table showing all my workouts and how many miles they total, in running, biking, etc.  I could finally answer the folks at the running store when they ask how many miles are on my running shoes.<br /><br />I ended up with this Garmin, far and away the best choice for just what I wanted. All the other GPS solutions were separate strap-on-the-arm ones that contain AAA batteries that need to be replaced every 12 hours of operation - ouch, costly. Even with rechargables, it would be a hassle to be always taking them out, plugging them into the charger, putting them back in the arm-band-GPS unit.  The watch on those other devices was just a receiver for the arm-unit.  Granted, it meant that their watches could be a little smaller ... I really liked the design of the Timex the best, and the Polar was small too.  But who wants to carry a clunky thing around their arm?  That's one more thing to pack or lose, more batteries to buy and fuss with, more parts to break... forget it.<br /><br />I also was swayed heavily by the Garmin software and tight integration with the PC and mapping software.  None of the other brands, as of this writing (January 2010) had anything near as easy.  Polar excels at fitness tracking, but not the mapping part.  Timex and others require third-party mapping solutions that you have to manually upload and integrate with.  Only Garmin had a simple plug-and-play solution.  Plug in their little included USB \\"ANT Stick\\" (like a little thumb drive), and bring the watch near, and it automatically receives the data the watch stored from your workouts, loads it into your Garmin fitness/mapping program, and you can see all your stats and your routes etc.<br /><br />I also liked that this unit is one of the few that tracks altitude, so you know not only how many miles, but how much total up and down you went (cumulative).  It can display the data on a chart with any paramets you set, for example you can see the actual altitudes of your run along your route.  That is so cool!<br /><br />Other people trashed this unit because the bezel-touch operation is a hassle.  One guy made the point that he just locks the screen into a view before his run starts, so he doesn't hassle with the touch thing going haywire.  That is the perfect solution, and it's what I did too.<br /><br />So with this Garmin watch, you only have to remember two pieces:  the watch, and the charger.  The charger clips right onto the watch to rejuice the battery inside.  It ships with conversion plugs for international outlets.<br /><br />Here's a tip that isn't clear from Garmin's specs:  the GPS can be turned on or off.  With the GPS on all the time, the watch will run out of juice after about 8 hours and will need to be recharged.  With the GPS off, it lasts almost 2 weeks.  It works like a normal watch, tells date and time, etc. Heart rate monitor.  Etc.<br /><br />I was worried that this watch wouldn't work if you, say, went out in the morning for a hike, stopped for lunch, continued hiking... 8 hours wouldn't be enough.  The simple solution is to turn off GPS when you don't need it, and your battery will last as long as you need it.<br /><br />So, if you can afford it, this one is the only way to go, if you want GPS.  I've had it a month, after handling all the others, reading their manuals, etc., and settling on this one. I'm super happy with it and love Garmin.  Next generation will be even better, when they fix the bezel issue and get the watch to be even more watch-looking, but this is miles ahead of the competition as is.<br /><br />** Update - I've now had this model for almost two years, and still think it is fantastic.  A few things I learned - The link to mapping software works great, I have two years' worth of running/biking stats and I can click on any single run to see the route.  Since I travel a fair amount, it's a great memory of places. It's also great when I go to the running store for shoes and they ask \\"how many miles are on the pair you're wearing now?\\"<br /><br />It also has a handy feature where you can set a starting point, such as the parking lot of a hiking area, and then once you're completely lost, have it point the way back - you get an actual arrow pointing and a distance indicator of how far away you are from that point. It's kinda buried in all the menus, so not something you'd be able to find quickly unless you did it regularly or had the user guide right there, but I used it twice and found it a comfort knowing that, even if I got lost, I wouldn't be lost.<br /><br />It is also easy to switch between running and \\"multisport\\" modes, which means you can bike and jog and keep those stats separate. (That way, you're not apt to get impressed with yourself for running 20 miles, when in fact that day you were on a bike.) There is also an optional setting (that was delivered through a firmware update a year after I bought it, and probably is pre-installed on newer ones) that will detect if you've stopped moving for a given period, say a minute, and it will put the tracking to sleep till you start moving again.  That helps you track your pace better if you have to stop for some reason and don't want that averaged into your overall time.<br /><br />I have to mention that the wrist band closure is a bit of a hassle, if anyone from Garmin is reading.  It has a little lock to keep the end from flapping, but in fact, it's really hard to push the locking end through the little hold-down.  Just a wee bit of hassle, hardly worth mentioning.  Everything else I said above is still the case. It's a great tool.simple solution is to turn off GPS when you don't need it, and your battery will last as long as you need it.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|AS a movie, it achieved total failure. I am not saying you cannot create a work of entertainment with a regular camcorder. See Borat to understand what i mean.    But this movie failed with the terrible story. I found it difficult to keep watching.    What about the ending???? Ridiculous!!!    On the other side, this movie was money magic. The marketer behind it deserves an oscar, for sure!!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|One of the songs in particular is a homage to Queen (which I love) and they're all rather theatrical, but that is what I love about Muse, the passion that you can feel behind the music.  The piano pieces are beautifully lifting and sweetly flow through my thoughts.
B000YAX3P0|2.0|I first heard Amy's voice on Back to Black which is probably causing me some difficulties in accepting her debut album Frank. If you compare the two, in Frank she is much higher pitched almost bubble gum poppish. I like my Amy with more darkness and a huskier voice. Unfortunately this may have been related to her voyage into heavy smoking, boozing and other drug use. made her voice sound awesome at least.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|See title of review.  Purchased for son for Christmas.  He is a hugh Star Wars fan and loved the DVD.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I bought this CD solely for one song that I heard on an episode of CSI: Miami.  I never really thought that the rest of the songs would be that great but they were all wonderful.  I listened to the CD while driving from Boston to Richmond for the entire trip.  I totally recommend this CD.
0385504225|5.0|This is an excellent novel.  I like Dan Brown and his style of writing.  I never realized our own country, the United States of America, had such an interesting and mysterious history.
0618918248|5.0|Thought provoking. Stirs your mind. Makes you question many things that you might have taken for granted. I have now begun to ask the question \\"why\\" for any religious claim. Honestly, it has made me a much better and happier person.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. It's well done and uplifting. Definitely worth buying. Support Susan Boyle and have great music to listen to. It's inspirational...
B002VPE1AW|4.0|The graphics are brilliant, often I felt I was in the scene.       However, the story was bad and predictable. I could have left the picture half way through once the tree was destroyed and do not think I would have missed anything.     The characters were extremely stereotyped. Despite that Giovanni Ribisi, I thought did a very good performance. No-one else was any good, not that I blame the actors as the script was so bad.    This film is worth seeing only for the 3D graphics.
B0030GJ50C|2.0|Glad I rented it. I would not buy it.<br />Pros: None that I could see.<br />Cons: Bad special effects, Bad script, Bad Story Line, Bad movie.<br />I would wait for it to be on HBO, Show time, ECT. Before you think of paying High price to buy it.
140011425X|4.0|I am an avid audio book purchaser and listener.   I am a huge fan of the TV show based on this book, and I was eager to listen/read the book.  I really enjoyed it. I would definitly buy more if others came out in the series. It was light but kept my interest the whole time and I really liked the characters (Heat & Rook's) interactiion.  I really love Nikki Heat's character. She is defintly a woman I would love to be friends with!
B002B4OVWG|5.0|I love it for my daughter. She gets to cuddle the monkey while sucking on her binkie. It also helps when ever it drops it doesn't always land on the nipple side and gets dirty.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|A well made movie with sex appeal and good laughs. This is a strong R rating with some full nudity and sex. Not for the kids! However, this is a sexual movie that does not pull punches and delivers entertainment.
B00192IV0O|2.0|i got that boom boom pow    i got a feeling that todays a good night      no effort , yet soooooo much money    it kind of bothers me, i think lady gaga has more talent she sings well and she writes her own songs, even though i hate her genre and think she dresses wierd    but these guys dont sing well and are so rich    its lame    i guess i may just be jealous, and i dont mean to hate,  but i dont really think these guys deserve to be in the music bisness.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I love this classic Rogers and Hammerstein musical.  I loved it as a kid and now my kids are now loving it as well.
0756655307|4.0|This book is awesome. It has tons of information on almost every hero/villain in the marvel universe. It is quite large, but managable to hold while on a couch. The cover is also very cool, much better than the 2006 cover. There's tons of new information, like stuff about the Civil War, WWH and Secret Invasion. And have updated chracter bios. like Avengers, Captain America, Hulk, Iron-Man, Spider-Man, Thor, Wolverine and X-Men. It was nice to see all the Avengers teams over the year, even the newer Mighty Avengers and Dark Avengers. Captain America's page had a full page on the new Captain America (Bucky Barnes), which I thought wasn't right, since he's hardly been around, unlike other heroes who only get half a page for the 40 years they've been around. Key Moment pages are added, but will be outdated in the next couple years. And that brings up my main problem, most things are already outdated. A key moment is Captain America's death, but he just got revived!! And what about stuff past Dark Reign?? Siege and Fall of the Hulks is non present. The new Avengers team and Heroic Age is not yet created!! The last thing about Thor was that he was banished from Asgard, but he's already returned and is with the Avengers. Lots of updates and changes and was in date when it first came out, but it's only a matter of time, before all of this is old news. They should've made this in the next 8 months from its original release date, with all the new stuff then. Still a great book, and recommended for every Marvel fan. That's just a little pet peeve I have. Just be aware most of the \\"New Stuff,\\" is already old stuff. The marvel hand-books are much better, but if you're short on money this the way to go. 4.5/5
B002C6K7NU|5.0|This CD was delivered on time and sounds terrific.  This seller did a good job.
B0007O38XU|5.0|Spaceballs the movie! Spaceballs the shirt!  Spaceballs the breakfast cereal!  Spaceballs the flamethrower!  The kids love that one.<br /><br />During the comedic era of John Candy and Rick Moranis, Mel Brooks got fed up with all the hype around Star Wars, so he devised this little number to put things back in proper perspective.  Filled with timeless punchlines and sight-gags, this film is still just as funny today as it was 30 years ago.<br /><br />In terms of plot, imagine merging Luke Skywalker and Han Solo into a freedom-fighting space pirate named Lonestar (Bill Pullman) who flies a space-ready Winnebego with his trusty man-dog Barf (John Candy) as they save a wandering space princess from the evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and the Spaceball empire.<br /><br />Of course, in a film like this, plot is secondary to laughs, so don't expect too much in terms of dramatic value.
0847830942|5.0|bought for my mom....she loves the photos.......great review of the classics.....Bicycles as works of art!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|One of my favorite movies, period. Recently, re-watched it with our 10 year-old son and 7 year-old. My son has a very quirky sense of humor and he was just completely blown away by Alex, the way Alex was translating Russian into English was very similar to how my son, who was born in the States, would translate from English to Russian. My daughter, who is more on a sensitive side, was asking thoughtful questions about the war, Nazis, what it was like to be a Jew in the Ukraine during the war, etc, and she was so touched at the illuminations at the end of the movie. Now, when they don't want to do something, their standard answer is \\"Grandfather tells me it's impossible\\".
B00000JPH6|5.0|A great movie.  I love the Muppets.  Jim Henson and Frank Oz know how to weave in many lessons about Love and Light.  I loved the behind the scenes feature showing how the characters were created.
0316017922|4.0|I just finished reading Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, which is a look at the contributing factors to the success of certain people.    When I originally wrote this, I put \\"a look at what makes people successful,\\" although after some thought I considered that to be a bit misleading. A lot of times we look for how-to's when it comes to success -- read this book, do these exercises, think like this...all of which, according to Gladwell at some level, is folly.    Rather, the author looks at environmental factors as things that help to create a fertile environment for success. The examples are fairly wide ranging - such as your birthday, the support of extracurricular activities at school, as well as socioeconomic factors.    It's a fairly easy read, taking me about three days to get from cover to cover. While the subject matter is pretty deep and engaging, it's not a hard read at all. If anything - it's a real page turner.    Two things left an impression on me after reading this book.    First - intelligence is a matter of being at a certain threshold, and once you cross that threshold, the incremental gains aren't as important as you might think. In other words, the difference between two people with IQs of 150 and 180 really isn't that significant, whereas the difference between people in the low 100s is more significant. Once you cross a certain threshold, you've got a pretty wide open future ahead of you.    Second - a lot of people's success is the result of luck as opposed to hard work. This of course, not to say that it's all one or the other, but that sometimes, as the saying goes, you're just in the right place at the right time.    This of course, is interesting to learn, but somewhat disheartening if you think that you may have been unfortunate to be born outside of the lucky window or into a situation that doesn't have some fortunate circumstances. Of course, one's definition of success can vary widely, so let that be a reminder as you read the book. But nevertheless, it does provide an interesting mirror in which to reflect on one's own life and the opportunities you may or may not have had. If nothing less, it's an encouragement to work towards the betterment of future generations of both your own descendants and those not of your blood line.    Regardless, Gladwell scores again with another fascinating look at life from a different angle, much as he did with both [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]. Definitely read Outliers, and maybe even buy it.

B002L6I9Z4|5.0|We had two grandsons that wanted a camera this Christmas -- when I saw the Lego camera I didn't need to look further.  Both boys (one age 8, one age 6) were very happy and took pictures all Christmas day.  It is durable, arrived safely and timely.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I am a fan of the Terminator saga. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was the best movie of the series. This film is certainly better then part 3. The DVD displays everything you saw in the movie theater. Unfortunately, there are no extra features on this disk. I was disappointed when I couldn't watch any deleted scenes. This product is good for one who just wants to watch the basic movie, but the dvd will not satisfy serious fans.
0743579275|4.0|This is the audio version of Richard Dawkin's book presenting the evidence for evolution entitled The Greatest Show on Earth. I purchased the DVD as a gift for a friend so I've not actually listened to it, but I can recomend the book in whatever form without reservation. When one considerers the clear and accessible evidence Dawkins presents, not just from biology, but from all of the natural sciences, and compares it with with the cockeyed explanations for the creation of life on earth apparently believed by 40% of Americans, one fears for the future of our nation.

I was surprised that with the purchase of this great Study Bible, I was granted online access to an EXACT copy of all 2000+ pages.  In addition  there was an audio link to hear the passages read to me.  A great tool in absorbing and comprehending the meaning of the words.
0312370849|5.0|There is apparently a lot of literature available about the effects of WWII on children. Sarah's Key is intriguingly written from two individual viewpoints which inevitably merge closer and closer together. It is an absorbing, touchingly tragic read, which experience I have cherished. From an historical standpoint, it sheds light on the French participation in the Holocaust, of which many of us have been ignorant.  Katie
B001QOOCTE|5.0|A friend introduced me to this DVD/CD a few months ago.  I bought ten on Amazon, kept one and gave nine as Christmas gifts.  Everyone loves it, and it's a great project.  I love to support projects like this.  There is so much discord in the world, and this project brings people together all over the world through music.  I recently purchased five more to give away.  The price is very reasonable.  I'll probably buy more in the future to give away.
0684857219|4.0|Obviously there are many reviewers of this book. This is one of those things that appeal to people but don't really take the time to study or practice the techniques outlined in the book. Take it from someone who has studied Arnold. I'll be brief and share with you some insights that may help you leverage and learn what you need to know a little faster. (1) Don't get the book right now if you don't have much discipline (2) Get the book if you want to learn about discipline and are serious about improving your health. These are not techniques for a slouch. Do you think you have what it takes to be a champion? Do you want to be like Arnold? Those are serious questions to ask yourself and this is particularly a good place to answer those questions. These are items you'll want to get as a supplement if you don't have them already: [[ASIN:B0000C3I6U Pumping Iron (25th Anniversary Special Edition)]] and a copy of [[ASIN:0894711350 Gray's Anatomy: The Unabridged Running Press Edition of the American Classic]]. This book is the 2nd edition encyclopedia. Arnold cut a lot of information out of the 2nd edition because it was no longer relevant. Other sections were cut but overall content is not affected. There are errors in the book and sometimes a somewhat better explanation of how to perform certain exercises would have been more helpful. Some errors carried over from the first edition on exercise techniques.<br /><br />Almost forgot - get [[ASIN:0671797484 Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder]] to round out your references. Using those sources alone you won't need anything else until you start to make some serious progress and than you can explore other well known bodybuilders of that era for a different approach to the sport. And probably the most important advice. Yes, Arnold used steroids but he will not recommend you use them. Arnold's steroid use has no bearing on the quality of the content in this book. Steroids have side effects. There is no such thing as small, manageable doses. If you're a Catholic steroids are forbidden by the church for this purpose - I checked.e doses.

B002YMNI9W|5.0|The Korean version of The Fame Monster Deluxe is really awesome. It is censored(Disc 1 only), however it has the cool sticker (at least the one I bought from a seller from Korea did) and it has a physical copy of Disco Heaven and Retro Dance Freak, great quality!

B002WDL534|5.0|It's so cool to watch it spin and see Lady GaGa spin with it (per its a picture disc) Its great sound quality. The only issue is is that it IS censored \\"bit\\" and no \\"F\\" word, however, they started selling the censored version only as MP3 or MP4 downloads and no physical media recently on January 26 2010 which you can find here on Amazon or iTunes.
B000AM6MM8|4.0|If your at all interested in History of the Holy Land read \\"Jerusalem Besieged\\" by Eric H. Cline. As this book progresses Jerusalem and the Christian Crusades it is amazing in that the details are so strikingly similar between the book and movie. The book JERUSALEM BESIEGED and the Video (Movie) KINGDOM OF HEAVEN go together like great wine and wonderful cheese. It is truly like having the book you are reading come to life ON THE VIDEO SCREEN...   They are delightful!
B0026P3G12|2.0|I love Susan Boyle's voice and was looking forward to hearing more of her music.  I found this album had much more religious and holiday songs on it than I was expecting since I wasn't able to listen to it prior to purchasing.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Abby Road was one of the few Beatles albums I did not replace with CD the first time it was available. A friend advised me that it was a bad transfer. I heard a few tracks from his copy and agreed to stick with my vinyl copy and transfer it myself on a good computer when I had the time. The Martin family treated this re-mastering project just like George treated all the original Beatles recordings, like it was one of his children. I can tell the mix is virtually the same as the vinyl but it is much more vibrant and easy to pick out distinct instruments and vocal parts. It's a redundant statement but it sounds just like the original but a lot better. It's not like the first CD release of the rolling Stones or ZZ Top where they cleaned it up so much it lost something, this one is done the way George Martin would have done it forty years ago if he had a computer to mix it on. I am glad I waited for the re-mastered Abby Road.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|i purchased this as an xmas present and it literally came 3 days later. way before the anticipated time so i was super thrilled to get that in the mail.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|The book was an easy read and gave an insightful look at some of the negative aspects of Indian culture.  The writing style is simple and uncluttered without unnecessary florid descriptions that I have read before in books about India.  However, the letter format didn't really work for me, the longer the book went on the less and less it felt like letters. However, in earlier chapters the protagonist, Balram, poses questions to the recipient (the Premier of China who is planning to visit India imminently) and this gives an interesting perspective on the character of Balram.<br /><br />The story follows the transformation of Balram Halwai (a poor low-caste Indian) from his position as a loyal servant into the much less loyal character of a wealthy entrepreneur.  The central themes of the book are corruption and class/caste.  The modern day setting shows that these are still strong elements of life in India despite continuing change.<br /><br />There are many metaphors in the book but the key metaphors are the rooster coop and the white tiger: Balram feels he is stuck in the rooster coop where all the roosters are resigned to their fate.  He dreams of breaking free and becoming the rare white tiger that he feels he is.  It was interesting to see the change in character of Balram from a humble servant to a much more worldly-wise man.<br /><br />After reading the book it is a story that I've pondered rather than moving directly on.  There are many questions that the book raises and it would be a good book to discuss with others in a book club.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Is this truely the end? I have really enjoyed all the series, but 5 highlites them all. The ending was unexpected, but really enjoyed. Kind of sad to come to an end, but my bones tells me there will be another movie etc.  hope so.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I am admittedly biased - I love Sting.  This is another awesome CD by him.  It is not a Christmas CD per se.  It is more of a seasonal CD, but it is great for Christmas; however, you can still enjoy it after Christmas because, as said, it is more about the season.  I loved this CD so much, I bought the DVD which is beautiful, and the concert is set in a gorgeous old church in Scotland
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Before I start with this, should Amazon not let you hear more than a 20 second clip of songs when you sample them? I'm just saying! Anyway, I am a HUGE John Mayer fan because he is one of those artist that you can truly just let the CD play and never touch it while you go about your day. His music is great for a romantic night in or cruising on a road trip to parts unknown...that is until THIS CD! I sampled it, as I always do because, if you dig a song, you just know it, you feel it. However, I only felt that way with about 3 cuts off of this CD. I found myself VERY surprised and let down. I started to think that maybe all of his personal problems with what beautiful woman to shag next had found its way into his creative process! I am not slamming him at all and I don't hate him. I just compare this CD to the latest works of Train...don't even get me STARTED on that CD!
B001GQACGE|5.0|Every song is touching and full of emotions. Also, the way the producer arranged the songs into two discs was really smart. Disc 1 has all the soft and light music while disc 2 is a whole new experience with hot and fast-tempo music. I'm completely sastisfied with this cd.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|If only the war ended like this...Tarantino's war fantasy is a very good, but not great film. The great Tarantino dialogue is there, the shock and gore too! It just doesn't feel original. The actors were great (especially Waltz) and the ending is gratifying. I guess you shouldn't be shocked to find this isn't a Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A great picture and robust sound! Loaded with special features. FINAL VERDICT: WORTH A LOOK (TARANTINO FANATICS: MUST OWN).
B002DYKP8S|5.0|The picture and sound are beautifully shooted in this movie. SPECtACULar view and music. A really worth watching movie it is.
B001U887NS|5.0|love these lined crocs<br />brought pair for hubby, and had to have a pair for self.<br /><br />make ideal slippers; have support that slippers don't have
B000YRY8BG|3.0|This review is intended as a supplement to the other reviews here--look to those other reviews for summaries of this series.<br /><br />I watched the whole series over the course of a few days and consequently details from the early episodes were still fresh in my mind at the end. Some early events that should have been red herrings--intended to be misinterpreted--turned out to have no logical justification.  While I catch more of such problems than the typical viewer, you probably will benefit from having larger gaps (similar to the original broadcasts).<br /><br />Even ignoring those failings, the \\"resolution\\" was a major letdown with too many of the explanations being unlikely and forced, or the actions being grossly out of proportion to the presented motivations.  A good story has you say \\"Of course! Now I understand\\" but this one is \\"OK...If you insist.\\" This may be the result of an American perspective, but then this review is for an American audience.  For example, a shorthand reference to events that is evocative to the British audience may trigger only skepticism among audiences unfamiliar with those events.<br /><br />If I had rated this series before the final episode or two (of 6), I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This was the first time I had tried ordering something used on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier!  The box is in great condition, considering that it can be hard to keep cardboard boxes in good condition... and the DVD plays perfectly!
0446560065|5.0|This man really knows cats! A few of these cartoons went over my head but most of them are hilarious.
B002ZHKZCO|4.0|I was a little disappointed that this is a flipper disc. I would have been happier if it was just a Blu-ray with the cover art. I have the standard dvds and wanted blu-ray. The audio is outstanding on my HT. Great price so I can live with it.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|If you've only heard \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" and took this artist for just another Alt Rock one-shot, then this album will be a shocker. \\"Kiss\\" is probably the least interesting track, and sounds very little like the rest of the songs (although \\"Girl With One Eye\\" has similar violent imagery). A rich sophisticated blend of rock-folk-world, fitting in with many other bands of today. Florence's voice is a brilliant instrument. The lyrics are dark, strange, worldly and poetic. \\"My Boy Makes Coffins,\\" \\"You've Got the Love\\" and \\"Dog Days are Over\\" are my favorites so far.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|I couldn't believe that I received this movie for such a great price. It was in perfect condition.
B002GJT4Y6|4.0|This is a review for the ultimate edition.  My biggest complaint is \\"Why didn't this come out sooner!\\"  I love it.  I was waiting for a few years to buy the movies hoping an extended version would come out. Last year I caved and finally bought hp year 1 and 2 but I was hoping that eventually there would be an extended version.  I love the books a lot more and I was hoping any extended scenes would make it closer to the book.  My hope was right.  The scenes that were added did make the movie closer to the book.  Why in the world did they take them out in the first place?!!!  It's only 13 minutes more but so worth it.  And I could be wrong but I am pretty sure I detected some touch ups.  The first touch up was in Diagon Alley when Hermonie magically fixed his glasses.  Also my favorite touch up was when Malfoy called Hermonie a Mudblood for the first time.  At last I hear some gasps from the Griffindor Quiditch team.  I would get so annoyed at my copy during that part saying \\"in the book the team is outraged why didn't they show that in the movie.\\"  Now they seem to have added some gasps that are not in my other version.....These touch ups are in the extended version...I have not viewed my theatrical version and nor do I intend to.    My sister bought year 1 and 2 when they first came out in the special edition formats.  I realized right away that this special features disk (3) is the same as her special edition disk which came out in what 2003.  I reviewed everything on that disk I could and tried to access the dvd rom play version of the disk.  I don't understand dvd roms...I never have.  I tried to access it and it would not work.  As near as I can tell, it accesses a site on the internet which may not be around anymore.  That is what my hubby said and he's the computer wiz.  But he never looked at it he only went by what I told him.  I was very sad that I could not get it to work though.  I have not reviewed the very last disk which I'm assuming is newer information.  It looks like there is a show about creating the world of Harry potter and it's going to be split up for each year/version.  Like I said I haven't reviewed it but I look forward to it.  Warner Brothers Why didn't you come out with this earlier?!
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|I really loved this movie, and was excited to see it for sale at such a great price. Didn't need to return, but I think that I would have had no problem doing so if I did.
006176759X|4.0|I wanted to read L.A. Candy so bad after author Lauren Conrad's departure from \\"The Hills.\\" I figured it would give me my fix into the glamorous, Hollywood-style living that the show did... and, for the most part, I was right.    I can understand how some readers could be disappointed. The only character (of the girls, anyway) that I grew attached to was Jane, and I grew irritated at a few of the others. There were many parts that were slow and seemed to drag on, but I did get really excited when things started to pick up.    For the fans of Lauren Conrad who miss watching her on \\"The Hills,\\" I think you'll find this an overall pleasant read. The L.A. setting and glamorous locations described in just enough detail is enough to make you want to get all dolled up after reading it. I found the ending's cliffhanger a little too choppy, but it only makes me want to snag up its sequel when it comes out.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I saw it when it first came out and enjoyed it.  Liked it even more on second and third viewing.  Tarantino can be heavy handed at times,  but even with that the characters are memorable and very interesting.
B002CPD5LM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this blu-ray. The film quality and sound was excellent. I believe you'll like it too! I can't say much more.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|In its inaugural season, the FOX offering of the Sci-Fi/Mystery saga FRINGE did not disappoint.  While entering a market that has been dominated by such fan-friendly juggernauts as X-Files, LOST, and to an extent Unsolved Mysteries, the show delivered a knockout.  A captivating cast, compelling story lines, and enough well produced special effects to keep it current, FRINGE first season set the stage for what could be a long run indeed.  The DVD offers insightful, light-hearted, and relevent featurettes as part of its Extras along with stunning extra footage.  Get in on this show asap, you won't regret it.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater but this is a review of the bluray disc. There are features that the regular dvd doesn't have, like an extended version of the dance audition (amazing!), a run-down of all the costumes he would have worn (my FAVORITE part!) and a very emotional tribute of him by the people in the show. The movie itself, of course, was fantastic. But if you are a real MJ fan and have the means to do it, definitely get the bluray. You won't be disappointed!
B002GHHJU4|4.0|To Keep it simple, I loved this Movie, it was definitly not the worst film in history but it won't get an acadamey award either. I'm a sucker for hot Chicks being all evil and looking hot doing it, (And I'm Gay, but i guess that makes sense!). Anyway i would recommend this to anyone that likes Horror Teen flicks....Like my title says, Just Plain Fun.<br />And!!!! The Soundtrack is okay, I wished that the producers or whoever had worked a bit more on that part, i think a great soundtrack can help the most mediocare of films, thats why i gave this 4 stars! Still i walked away loving \\"Jennifers Body\\".

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has an Angel voice!  I can't stop listening!  For sure I will be waiting her next album.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|Very lame and unrealistic story line. And if you know anything at all about Antarctica and Amundson-Scott station at the South Pole you would instantly know that nothing in this movie come anywhere close to reality. Mountains in the horizon at the South Pole? The station is abandoned in winter? A bunch of flimsy stuff outside that blow around? A really bad movie.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I am amazed at how this music is liked by generations.  The remastering of the nusic and the better quality audio equipment used today has allowed me appreciate this music once again, and hear quality I never heard before.
1401323820|4.0|Instead of Christmas cards I give books, because they take more than a minute to read and have a greater chance of not being thrown away, and \\"Heat Wave\\" was what I gave my wife last Christmas as her card because we watch \\"[[ASIN:B001XRLWPQ Castle]]\\" and while she had seen Richard Castle's faux novel on the television show I was pretty sure she had not seen it was available in the real world, which meant I had the element of surprise.  Clearly, \\"Heat Wave\\" is intended for fans of the series, which means by definition it will probably have limited appeal to fans of mystery novels who do not watch the show.  Certainly I would never have picked it up otherwise.  But as an example of a tie-in to a television show, this faux novel is somewhat unique, reminding me a bit of \\"[[ASIN:067173590X The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:067173573X Diane - The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper]]\\" from distant days of yore.<br /><br />The basic scenario of \\"Heat Wave\\" will sound quite familiar.  Detective Nikki Heat became a cop because of the murder of her mother and now her professional life has been complicated because the mayor is allowing Jameson Rook, an award-winning reporter who never runs out of famous names to drop, to tag along with Heat and her squad as they work on their current case.  That would be the death of Matthew Starr, the New York real estate developer who either jumped or was pushed from his luxury apartment filed with an expensive collection of private artwork just off Central Park West.  So Heat has to investigate the crime while dealing with the unwanted intrusions and not always helpful help of Rook.<br /><br />\\"Heat Wave\\" is most decidedly NOT an episode of \\"Castle,\\" although you will \\"recognize\\" many of the characters and the verbal parrying between Detective Nikki Heat and reporter Jameson Rook has a decidedly familiar ring.  There are a couple of significant differences, both of which I appreciate as being necessary to having this be a \\"true\\" Nikki Heat novel.  The first is that the central character is the female detective and not the male writer.  I do not think that there is a scene in the novel involving Rook in which Heat (or another member of her team) is not around.  That means when the main characters head home it is her we follow instead of him and because this is a novel rather than a television episode with a narrative voice over we are privy to Nikki Heat's private thoughts instead of having to decipher quick looks and vocal inflections.  The second is that the writer is now an investigative journalist rather than a write of crime novels.  This proves to be the more significant difference because what the character of Richard Castle brings to Kate Beckett's investigations is his ability to make evidence fit into a narrative framework.  His \\"If I were writing this as a novel\\" line-of-logic is his analytical paradigm in any criminal investigation.  Rook is as big a budinski, but his help in this particular investigation comes more in terms of having contacts that can help Heat rather than it does it being able to offer rational explanations for when the puzzle pieces refuse to create a complete picture.<br /><br />There is a final difference that should be addresses, and that would be the celebrated sex scene in the novel that has been alluded to from time to time on the television show.  This sex scene is not all that steamy (you could probably film it as written and air it on television), but it strikes me as a rather interesting way of having your cake and eat it too.  A recent issue of \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" that listed putting on Jay Leno in prime time as the biggest bomb in the history of television listed \\"[[ASIN:B000TFI2OW Moonlighting]]\\"'s David and Maddy hooking up as the fourth detonation on that list, and the one that has taught many a television series that has come in its wake that a consummation devoutely wished by fans can be a death blow to such characters.  A show like \\"[[ASIN:B000UZDO5I The X-Files]],\\" that managed to put off sex between the two leads until it was basically an anticlimax, is the exception that proves the rule.  \\"Castle\\" manages to provide its audience with sex between the two fake characters' fictional surrogates, without actually sending Castle and Beckett between the sheets.  Meanwhile, other shows from \\"[[ASIN:B001L1S1OY Bones]]\\" to \\"[[ASIN:B001CTDH76 The Mentalist]]\\" try to walk the same tightrope with varying levels of success (\\"Bones\\" fans were pretty ticked off by last year's rather pathetic attempt to have their cake and eat it too, and do not get me started on what happened with Lorelai and Luke after they finally got together on \\"[[ASIN:B000U0F7RG Gilmore Girls]]\\").<br /><br />The bottom line is that fans of \\"Castle\\" can have fun reading this book, without having to worry about whether what is in the novel is canon or not, with Heat and Rook looking exactly like Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion (why would you read it any other way?).  It will be interesting to see if ABC Studios signs off on another one of these faux-Richard Castle novels, which I would expect will take the same approach in terms of the three specifics detailed above, with approximately the same results.  Of course, the Heat-Rook relationship cannot start lapping the Beckett-Castle characters, because \\"what might happen\\" between the two has to be around the next corner, not on the other side of the ocean or on a distant planet.  \\"Heat Wave\\" is not a classic mystery novel, but it is a pretty fun Christmas card.es]],\\" that managed to put off sex between the two leads until it was basically an anticlimax, is the exception that proves the rule.  \\"Castle\\" manages to provide its audience with sex between the two fake characters' fictional surrogates, without actually sending Castle and Beckett between the sheets.

B000056HE9|5.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is right up there with \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol (1938, 1954)\\" and \\"Christmas in Connecticut\\" as a must-see movie when the weather outside is frightful and the love af your family is so delightful.<br /><br />Cary Grant is at his best in his role as the angel. David Niven must have taken a bite from a lemon before those scenes where had to be so sour.  Loretta Young is so kind and beautiful in the title role.<br /><br />The character actors, however, steal the show. Monty Wooley is wonderful as the Professor.  The scene where the angel keeps filling his glass of wine ranks high in cinema history.  Elsa Lanchester is superb as the maid, and how about James Gleason as Sylvester the cab driver.<br /><br />I saw the movie on some new channel (THIS Network?) and they cut out the cab ride scene complete with the beautiful scene at the skating rink.  I was mortified.  Now, it is part of my collection, just waiting to be viewed on that cold night around Christmastime every year -- with James Gleason and his cab waiting to pick me up.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I loved this movie so much I had to own it on bluray. I have the DVD version, but I wish that PIXAR would have updated it's tour of the Pixar Studios. When this movie was first released, the studio may have been new at that time, but not anymore. This bonus feature is no longer needed on the bluray version.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I give this album 13 stars.  I thought for awhile that this was Dylan's best album since Blonde on Blonde. Then for awhile I thought NO, it's his best album since Highway 61.   Then, like Wittgenstein, I changed my mind again, undergoing a paradigm shift, and realized that it is actually his best album since Freewheelin'...  As far as the Theft charges; Malcolm Lowry once said - \\"If you steal from one person, it's plagiarism; if you steal from everybody, you're a genius.\\" Case closed, the Judge done hammered down his hammer, and we can all leave the courthouse and amble on down into the sunny square outside, where Bob is playing, his guitar case lying open on the bench. The sound of bees fills the air in the background.  Bob has mined the hills of folklore again, and shown us once again what varied and colorful Mother Lodes there are to be found in the Folk. If you haven't joined his jingle jangle travelling band by now, this album will initiate you.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|Picture quality: Visually stunning    Another, short subject documentary, winner by MacGillivray Freeman    White water rafting in the Colorado River accompanied by the music of the Dave Matthews Band (DTS HD Master Audio 5.1).    Lots of breathtaking aerials of the Grand Canyon. Beautiful shots inside the canyon. A definite home theater reference Blu-ray disc.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I'm thinking this is the movie \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" wanted to be. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds couldn't be more perfect, aided by the reliable support of Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson. I haven't read any reviews, but I think this is one of the best scripts in a long time, clever direction and really good acting. Sitting at home alone, I found myself laughing out loud. Glad I watched it. Gorgeous cinematography. The ending might've been a bit of a cop-out, but I was generally entertained, and that's all I can expect. Ryan Reynolds is simply one of the best. Terrific performance!
B00013RC8O|4.0|We've been looking for this film for years and finally found it.  Not the greatest plot wise, typical 70's movie.  We knew the plot before we bought the movie because we saw it when it first came out.  It was the hot car, and the locations that we wanted.  Filmed on location in several western states, one of which is Glenwood Canyon in Colorado before Interstate 70 was built.  This is a movie for nostalgia for us.
B0029O08WA|4.0|Being a Twilight fan, I had to have the soundtrack, though I thought it would be lame.  Suuprise, it is not.  I enjoyed the music very much.  Glad I bought it.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Arrived quickly.  THANKS.  Never bought the DVD, so was really excited about watching Wall-E on Blu-ray again.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is one of the best new series I have seen in a long time. Can't wait for season two to come out.
B001HN69AY|3.0|Stunning visuals, wonderful performances, and an intriguing premise--nothing new really for a Terry Gilliam film. However, all those combined still don't add up to a story that really goes anywhere or has a real point, which is sadly ironic for a film that attempts to extol the virtue of a good story. Too bad the film didn't take its own advice.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|This 2009 release of \\"Casablanca\\" is identical to the 2003 Special Edition release, except it's packaged in a regular DVD case as opposed to the cardboard case of the original. The first disc contains two commentary tracks (one with Roger Ebert, one with historian Rudy Behlmer), a two-minute introduction by Lauren Bacall, and a gallery of trailers. The film transfer is also identical to the original release, but this film looks about as great as it possibly can on DVD.<br /><br />The second disc contains the one hour and twenty minute 1988 \\"Bacall on Bogart\\" documentary and a thirty-five minute making-of documentary \\"You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca\\". Next is a seven minute feature with Bogart's son and Bergman's daughter titled \\"As Time Goes By: The Children Remember\\", along with the eight minute 1995 cartoon spoof \\"Carrotblanca\\". A selection of deleted scenes and outtakes, totalling about seven minutes, are of particular interest here (though there is no sound for any of them), and a \\"Production Research\\" gallery. Of lesser interest is the premiere episode from the 1955 \\"Casablanca\\" TV series titled \\"Who Holds Tomorrow?\\", it's a noble failure and clocks in at about nineteen minutes.<br /><br />As far as special features go, the only thing the [[ASIN:B001EL6EHC \\"Casablanca\\" Ultimate Collector's Edition]] has over this release is the hour-long 1993 documentary \\"Jack Warner: The Last Mogul\\" on a third disc. It's quite entertaining and informative, particularly for film buffs, but it's really the only reason to purchase the 'Ultimate' edition. That is, unless one cares about a small book of production photos, office memos, lobby & poster cards, and a passport holder and luggage tag emblazoned with \\"Casablanca\\".
0810983915|5.0|My child has difficulty keeping interested in reading.  But he loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.  He has everyone.  He can not put the book down.  The stories are funny, probably because they could happen.  Great buy for young boys.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I have been waiting to buy this movie ever since its release this past summer, the price was what got me to impulse buy it the second I saw it but the service I receieved is what keeps me shopping with amazon! I ordered it on a Sunday normal, standard shipping. It shipped Monday and I got it Tuesday! I was soo happy/suprised when I got it so quickly! Made my day :)
B0019LY5IM|5.0|If you haven't seen LOST you're in for a treat!  6 seasons of some of the best television ever.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|great series one that makes you laugh and cry while also being thought provoking about social and cultural issues that are true even today
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought this product cause I play modern warfare 2 so much that I felt it was time to upscale to a better headset, before I had the basic logitech one. It's great, and I don't bother my parents with the game sound, if you play first person shooters its well worth buying, but if you don't then buy something cheaper. There is a hissing sound when your at the main menu, but when the game starts don't even hear a thing. It's great how you can adjust the volume of the game and the chat, It's a must buy.
B001FB55I0|3.0|For Terminator Fans, of which I am one, this was an entertaining movie.  It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening. It was the best of the recent man vs. machine genre movies.  There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Just purchased  from Amazon to watch at home. I thought it would be too scary to watch in theater or at night. WELL.....<br />Unbelievably boring!  Not believable at all! Hardly scary. Now I know why 1/2 the people that saw this got up and left the theater. Not because they were scared but because they were bored and angry they wasted their money! So so BORING I cant stress this enough! I'm going to go do laundry way more interesting than this LOL!!
0316044695|5.0|First rate account of a mission gone bad and the sad consequences.  I read the book twice and recommended it to many people.  It contains unique insights into how NOT to wage a war!  ROEs, or rules of engagement, are ham-stringing our soldiers and causing unnecessary deaths and injuries.  Of course, you have this conflict being controlled with regard to leftist political considerations and reported on by the left wing media in the USA.  Once again, we have another \\"war\\" being run by politicians.    You get insight into the upbringing, education and training that lead the author to becoming a SEAL. Notable also, you see how men who endure this training become closer than brothers.     I highly recommend this book.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|i received a link from the criterion guys on twitter after mentioning Seven Samurai in a tweet. I tweeted that i was so mad because i realized, during a conversation, that i could no longer find my copy. i received the product with in just a few days. very good price as well
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Most poignantly written show I have ever seen. Extremely detailed and absolutely captures the era in every way.
B00005LELD|5.0|There are currently no reviews stating that this HR-2 hood will work without vignetting with the AF-S 35mm 1.8 DX, so I took the risk of ordering it.  Even the Nikon USA website does not list this hood as an accessory to the AF-S 35mm 1.8 lens.   Since the original plastic HB-46 hood included with the 35mm lens is very short, I wanted something better since I take my Nikon D40 everywhere without a camera bag.  As luck would have it, this works perfectly and photos have no vignetting with this fully extended.  This hood also allows the use of a 52mm Hoya UV filter.  First attach any filters directly to the lens, then screw this hood on the end of the filter (the instructions provided state that any filters should attach to the actual lens first).  The opposite end of the hood is also threaded, so if for any reason you wanted to mount a 52mm filter on the opposite side, you could do that as well.  The original Nikon lens cap will insert perfectly.  The hood extends and contracts with a high quality feel.  This item is made in Japan, and I didn't mind spending a little more money for a genuine Nikon product.  From the look and feel of this hood, it will last for years.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I recommend this book as a useful communication tool. The authors offer a well-researched, well-written take on the subject. Main points are illustrated effectively by examples. There is some redundancy in areas to reiterate their key learning points such as 'the curse of knowledge'. But if the core strategy is repetition, repetition, repetition, then it works well to make these points stick.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|A complete waste of actors talents, complete waste of my time, waste of material it took to make the dvd.Not worth what you spend on it.
0307346617|5.0|Exactly as it was described and an overall great book to read. It arrived right on time as well.
0684833395|3.0|Overall, this book wasn't horrible but I don't believe it deserves the raving reviews it got from others.<br /><br />As a female reading this book, I found it a bit difficult to connect with the male mind. There are many references to prostitutes, one night stands, and \\"love\\" that is actually lust. So, if you're a bit skiddish of vulgar language and references you'll be sorely disapointed in this book.<br /><br />The whole book is full of catch-22s. For instance, a character named Hungry Joe likes to take pictures of naked women that never develop correctly but when he was a citizen, he had been a professional photographer.<br /><br />This book jumps around a lot. It gives tidbits of information that at the time might not seem important but tie into the main story later. Because of this, the book gets more interesting towards the end but seems drawn out and boring at the beginning.<br /><br />All in all, I've read better books but I've also read a whole lot worse.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This was a gift for my niece at Christmas. It came in time and was in great shape.
B002IPDZDY|4.0|This album is a classic as expected. With a ton of songs to keep you entertained all day.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas.  It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I had this movie on DVD and was hesitant to upgrade to Blu-Ray, but I can now say it was worth upgrading.  The transfer to Blu-Ray looks very good, and is surprisingly clear, in both the Black & White & Colorized versions of the film.  I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years, but watching it on Blu-Ray was a new experience as I noticed lots of details in the film that I never noticed or paid attention to before.
B001PMLKLK|5.0|This is modern 50's music with a new twist.  Love the style and what a great voice!
B00280LYIC|5.0|My three children really love this series. It brings Greek mythology to the under thirteen crowd in a fun and entertaining venue. Heres more from my nine year old:   It is a great book! I can't wait until the movie comes out! I will give it back to my dad.   Hopefully this will encourage more kids to pick up Wharton's or Bulfinch's Mythology and have a better appreciation for a study of Classics.
0061730327|5.0|I read this story on the way to be a volunteer in Malawi, and was glad I did. It not only teaches much about the country, which helped prepare me, but it is extremely encouraging and inspiring to learn of the ingenuity of a self-educated young man and then the support he has earned.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I have had two of these watches.  The latest one I have had for more then ten years.  I give it five stars because this is a beautiful watch for the price.  You have to spend more or get a Chinese knock off to get a watch that is so unique.    When I first bought it there were not that many automatics in this price range.  Now there are a few, the problem is that they are even less money.  I have a timex automatic that is a bit better day to day but at night it does not glow.  The timex has markers on the face which is nice.    When coworkers at work say, hey, spent a lot on a watch .... I just point out it is a swatch.      You do have to set it every few days and be carefully with the crystal (or plasticish material  in this case).  Over time the skeleton back will wear as well.    This is a great watch that will last for years but not forever.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Great update and really enjoy how Cinderella found love and able to stand and protect self must see
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I knew by the second episode that Lithgow would take top honors and by the third episode that Hall would too.  It was hands down for them to both get the Golden Globe award.  This season was unbelievably great!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Such a solid disc of unprecedented warmth, and an appreciated ear for uplifting subtlety in between deceptive repetition.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I love this show..this is my best show so far and the good thing was i got this item on time..Amazon is pretty good on shipping stufs...
B002NPUCP8|4.0|I bought this album in Asia and there is actually a bonus track in it as compare to the US version. Hence I have 12 songs instead of 11 which I am grateful for as I really think she is just too good to be ignored. This album is completely different from her first self-written and produced \\"Violet Journey\\". I would prefer to call it her experimental album but with great effect. It was awesome.     \\"Believe\\" takes a different turn in terms of musical direction. It has a combinations of feel good pop songs (According to You, Feels Like Home, Believe) and some really hard-edge rock feel (Suffocated, What's It Gonna Be, Bad News). In a market where looks seem to dominate the charts than talent, I rate this album highly. Yes, it does sounds a little like Kelly Clarkson mix with Avril Lavigne but the one thing that differentiate Ori from the above two ladies is she is a hell of a fantastic guitar player. Enuff said. I guess all her fans know it by now.     So what's next? Hopefully she gets enough recognition (which she deserves 100%) and success that she is able to have more creative control in song choices/musical direction. I saw two amazing Youtube videos of Orianthi playing the blues (Going Down and Trill is Gone) and it really showcases how good and versatile she is. I love it when she just plays (I believe a lot of us do too). I give credit where credit is due and I would recommend this album to anyone who likes a good rock album that brings back the guitar feel of the 80's. Rock on lady.
1401923119|3.0|As a student and practioner of the \\"soft sciences\\" (I've been a Rehab Counselor for 10 plus years), this read was a tad heavy on the biology. Of course, that is less a criticism of Dr. Bruce Lipton who, afterall, is a cell biologist and more a commentary on my ignorance on the topic. Essentially Dr. Lipton concludes \\"genes are not our destiny\\" and states that environmental influences, including nutrition, stress, and emotions, can modify those genes without changing their basic blueprint. He references the revolutionary field in biology called \\"epigenics\\", which literally means \\"control above our genes\\". This discipline submits that molecular biology has shown that the genome is far more fluid and responsive to the envinroment than previously supposed. The immense power of the subconscious mind and the findings of quantum physics that connect energy and thought are discussed. Lipton champions the burgeoning field, \\"engery pyschology\\", which involves modalities that reprogram previously learned behaviors to suppress self-destructive or self-defeating behavior. Finally, the book concludes with a two page addendum introducing Rob Williams' energy psychology techniques called PSYCH-K.The PSYCH-K process purportedly utilizes the mind/body interface of muscle testing (kinesiology) to access the self-limiting files of the subconscious mind. As written by Dr. Lipton, \\"It (PSYCH-K) also makes use of the left brain/right brain integration techniques to effect swift and long-lasting changes\\". What I appreciated most about this book is Lipton's disagreement that that willpower and positive thinking (conscious mind) alone will eliminate those barriers existing in the subconscious. The subconscious mind plays a crucial role in the change process. I look forward to learning more about PSYCH-K...
B002T45VX6|1.0|I was very much looking forward to the new Shakira CD \\"She Wolf\\".  Damn, I was very disappointed!  Honestly, if you blindfolded me and played the \\"She Wolf\\" CD (assuming that I never heard the CD), I could not tell you with reasonable accuracy if I was listening to Shakira or Britney Spears!  Shakira has gone mainstream pop, not only in her music, but also in her appearance.  Now she looks like just another blond pop singer.  Shakira has lost her individual identity for the sake of mainstream music sales!  The \\"She Wolf\\" CD is an abomination of music styles none of which compliment Shakira's abilities or personality.  After listening to the first couple of tracks, I sampled the rest of the 16 tracks (a few of which are remixes and/or Spanish versions of an English track, and what's with all the rappers, those tracks are real bummers!), I ejected the CD, put it in its case and stuck in the bottom of my CD collection.  I am ashamed to say that I shelled out $15 for this piece of trash!  I am hopping that Shakira can return to the roots that got her to the world stage that she occupies today.  Otherwise, to use an old vinyl phrase, she'll be stuck in the back of the cut-out rack!
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Score: XOX is, quite simply, the most amazing live album I have ever heard.  There must have been some kind of weird magic going on in that concert, because bands simply do not sound this good live, especially hardcore prog-metal bands.  This album sounds so good that I've actually wondered if some of it was recorded in the studio with the sounds of an audience dubbed in.  It is an amazing testatment to the artistry and talent of prog-metal's flagship band.  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is performed in its entirety--at least, the part of that album that deals with mental illness is.  Songs like Glass Prison, Misunderstood, and Disappear are left out, and perhaps rightfully so:  they don't share the theme of the rest of the album, which is one of people struggling with mental and emotional problems.  There are a number of DT tracks from other albums, even a couple that aren't on any DT album that I'm aware of, and I'm pretty sure I have them all!  You will be blown away by Raising the Knife and Another One.  The orchestra blends well with DT's jamming, although it seems to me there were at least a couple of instruments in the orchestra that had some tuning issues.  Most of it sounds great though.    Score: XOX is Dream Theater's crowning achievement.  I don't think they'll ever top it, not even with a studio album.  Buy it now, thank me later!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This set has every Beatles song ever written. I grew up listening to The Beatles and this set takes me back to some really wonderful memories. I highly recommend this box set to all Beatles fans. You will NOT be disappointed!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is a 1964 satire built around nuclear war, directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Peter Sellers and George Scott, with unforgettable roles played by Slim Pickens and Keenan Wynn. The story is based on a U.S. Air Force general's ordering a nuclear first strike on Russia, then working with the president and other top advisers trying to recall those B-52s. The rationale for the strike was the paranoid belief that there was a Communist conspiracy involving water fluoridation which will lead to contamination of everyone's \\"precious bodily fluids.\\"  At the same the movie also follows the crew of the sole B-52 that is not eventually successfully recalled or shot down by the Russians, and its 'heroic' efforts to get the job done, ending with Slim Pickens exuberantly riding a thermonuclear bomb down to Russian territory.
0545123267|4.0|I picked up Shiver a bit late.  (Admittedly, didn't get it til yesterday).  But- once I started reading it- I couldn't put it down.  I read it overnight.  I was heartbroken for Grace and Sam- I love 2 POV novels and this one did not disappoint.  I can't wait for Linger to come out.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Works amazingly indoors with bounce flash, I have the SB-400 and a SB-600, but use the SB-400 90% of the time. The SB-600 usually stays home, I only bring it occasionally to family events, but even then the SB-400 would still suffice.
0307593525|5.0|Let's start with the price.  I purchased Vol I at a local \\" big book store.\\" Then came home and checked with Amazon where, for within $1 difference, I could purchase both volumes. Back to the retail store to turn it in and order from Amazon.  So I burned up gas doing all of this, but it was the way to go.  My wife had vol I, but lent it to someone who was reluctant to give it back. My purchase thus made the borrower happy ( she had a book) and wife doubly happy - she had both volumes, and it made my gas station retailer happy for the surge in business.<br /><br />The books are just as good as ever. Julia was a master in every sense and it is such an important work.  Plus she could really cook - unlike the tv \\"stars\\" that a certain food network is foisting upon us<br /><br />Get this set! Now. Go and get it. Now. Use it, gift it to someone, but simply get it. You won't regret it for a moment
0698115635|5.0|My 2 year old grandson loves this book. Simple dialogue,easy for him to repeat. Love the illustrations. Wonderful investment!
031606792X|5.0|This had to be the best book in this series.  I couldn't put this book down once I opened it.  This is a beautiful story.  No dissappointments here.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|Up has a great story and characters for both the little ones and the parents.  Like all the great Pixar stories you know characters and have a story that pulls you in and captures you for the entire time the movie is on.  My kids and I have watched it 6 times in the last 3 months.  The extras are nice and the added story about Doug was nice as it filled in some of the background.  Partly cloudy short rocks and still makes me laugh pretty hard.<br /><br />Defintely worth it.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost season three,  contains many many episodes to enjoy,   unlike season 4, and season 5    and all the more,  seasons 1-3 make much more sence....
B00004RF9B|5.0|I love this film! I have enjoyed it for many years. It was truely unique for its time. Who knew it would have been so ground breaking during its time and would last throughout the ages. I know many young people today would say what's the fuss, but the special effects and the concept of being on another world in the 50's was truely unique. Sit back and enjoy!
B001BPJJ82|5.0|Great film that I discovered by chance when searching for similar results for another film on [...] This is a film that HAS to be seen on Blu-ray!
0061719544|5.0|I have enjoyed Craig's program for years and was interested in finding out more about his background.  The book was excellent and gave an insight into his make up, character and humor.  It is a very funny book that I enjoyed very much.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This was a good artistic talent of dancers with a good story line.I Loved every minute of this dance flick,and so did my teenage kids. we loved it!!We highly recommend it.
0307454541|4.0|As an avid NCIS fan, this book fell right in line with that genre--interesting characters, smart, savvy people, interesting story line.  The sex got a little too graphic for me, and the story went on too long.  But the beginning was very good.  I plan to read the other two books in this series.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Put this album on and play it... again & again  Amazing how fresh it sounds, whilst paying homage to the past  Feeling down... play it  Feeling happy... play it  Just play it  I am now
0385504225|4.0|This is a typical Dan Brown novel. I think he does well with his research and certainly keeps the adventure going. I think he ran the ending a little long and I had figured out the twist before I was halfway finished. I enjoy his books, but know that I am reading them for fun. There is certainly some information that I may further research out of interest, but again this won't become a \\"classic\\".
B001992NUQ|4.0|The Movie still kick ass but the old extras are not HD and the new extras are not so many.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I was so excited, yet sad to see This Is It.  Excited, knowing I was going to see another amazing feat by an amazing artist.  Sad, knowing I was going to see the artist in his last days...knowing there will be no more Smooth Criminals or Thrillers or the 'next greatest thing' to come from the biggest star this world has ever known.     Finding videos from Google and You Tube searches of candid MJ interviews are few an far between.  There just isn't much out there that lets us see who he really was, outside of a formal interview.  This Is It does just that.  You get a peek of MJ at work, how he really is during this process, the level of detail he pays attention to and how happy creating made him.  Clearly, this is why he was as big as he was.      My only let down is that there just wasn't enough. I could have sat in that theater for another 2 hours without a thought.  I left wanting to see so much more and thinking about what a truly awesome show This Is It was destined to be, but will never be.  What a shame.      This Is It is not just a documentary, but a memorial.  I can't wait to own it myself and have a small piece of MJ to always remember for myself.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|Selena's music is extremely catchy, and fun to dance and sing along to.  But ultimately she is a better actress.  Of course that doesn't stop me from still loving her music.  Favorite songs: As A Blonde, I Don't Miss You At All, and a few others.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|This was a great book, I didn't realize when buying this for my KINDLE that it was a 2nd installment. Lots of great twists right up to the end. I had to just keep on reading!!<br />Upon finishing the book,I immediately purchased The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. I found it to be a far superior read, which I also recommend.<br /><br />  I have pre ordered the FINAL installment. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest<br /> (Steig Larsson is deceased)
0375413405|5.0|Forty years ago I was newly married and literally could not scramble an egg.  It was pathetic, but true, so my new husband gave me a copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\"  Being the good student that I was, I treated this tome as a textbook, following Julia Child's directions to the letter.  It saved my life, since we did a lot of dinner parties, so I had to hit the ground running.  I'd never heard of sweetbreads before, but soon it was one of my favorite ingredients, thanks to Julia.  As I grew more proficient in the kitchen, I found that I really loved to cook!  I still have that worn, spotted copy of Mastering the Art, and though I cook now with an eye to healthy ingredients, I'll still turn to this bible for pointers from time to time.  Thank you Julia Child!  Kathy Besag
B002WDL534|2.0|Well, I received my picture disc yesterday and, sure enough, it arrived damaged.  This corroborates the experience of other reviewers here who have complained of poor handling by Amazon.  The disc itself is intact, but the clear plastic sleeve it came in is severely damaged: split open on one side, chipped on another, and curved on yet another from having been stuffed into a too-small shipping box.  Not a big deal to some --and I understand that-- but to a collector like me, it's unacceptable.  I mean, really...is it so hard to notice that the box you chose to ship my product in is too small?    This means I have to go through the whole needless process of having to return this and wait for them to send me another one.  Hopefully, they'll get a clue and package it in a way so it'll arrive in good condition.    UPDATE:  As of today, 02/25/10, Amazon has repeatedly mishandled this order: boxes too big, boxes too small, item not properly restrained within the boxes.  I am now waiting on my FIFTH replacement for this item.  As with the first order described above, each subsequent order has reached me with the plastic sleeve split on at least three sides and severely cracked.  I have contacted the customer service department, and have been told twice that a warehouse \\"bin check\\" would be done.  At this point, the folks in charge of that section of the warehouse are either absolutely incompetent or someone is having a great laugh at my expense.    In any case, if this latest shipment arrives damaged, I'll admit defeat, Amazon will have won, and I'll just go buy it elsewhere.  Nice way to treat customers, huh?
0061730327|5.0|and again W-O-W. This book was amazing!  I wish i could:   1) have lunch with William Kamkwamba just to shake his hand and thank him for sharing his story and   2) give this book a million star rating.  I felt as though I was living right along side of him, he was sad... I was sad, he was hungry... I was hungry, he was determined... i was cheering him on.      I laughed and cried while reading this book, and I continue to get choked up (happy tears) with how much this man has overcome, yet he remains so humble...

B00005A1PR|5.0|I really enjoy her music and find myself listening to this CD quite a bit. This CD is reflective and any artist that makes you think in a positive way is worth a mention, but she makes her guitar sing as well. When you've finish listening to this CD you feel the strength,courage and wisdom she has put in making this music. A great choice for your collection.
B000P12LWY|3.0|I am not of a single mind on Showtime's Henrician bodice-ripper, \\"The Tudors.\\"  On the one hand, the lavish sets and costumes, and generally above-par acting (which skillfully covers occasional dreadful dialogue) certainly make it watchable.  But, it is structured like an extended soap-opera.  In a sense, though, Henry's story is exactly that.  So, for those who like their historical fiction laden with attractive people, much heavy breathing, and sumptuous glamour, \\"The Tudors\\" will not fail to disappoint.      The problem here is from the historical point of view.  Many, many others in this thread have complained, and justly so, of the vast liberties taken with commonly accepted historical facts and evidence to truncate the story-line and move the plot along at the break-neck clip the melodrama demands.  The \\"suicide\\" of Cardinal Wolsey\\" is especially troubling, as is the conflation of Henry's two sisters into one persona.  Alone, liberties like this are not fatal.  \\"I, Claudius,\\" the brilliant BBC miniseries, often used the same technique, and this is sometimes what the limited media of television and film scripting demands.  But, the gross liberties taken will astound anyone remotely familiar with the period to the point the series becomes an off-putting bore, contrived to the point of wanting to shut the DVD player off before the next turgid and overblown sex scene.      Further, while many have lavished praise on Jonathan Rhys-Meyers for his portrayal of Henry, especially as a young man, I cannot enirely agree.  I am familiar with other work he has done, and I find him both an engaging and accomplished actor.  But over the course of the series, while he captures Henry's choleric and lusty nature well, I have not seen him demonstrably grow in the part.  The emotional layering I have come to expect from him seems curiously absent.  Perhaps he is concentrating on the historical Henry's penchant for engaging in bouts of protracted adolescence, but I do not see anydepth to the segue from glittering young monarch to tyrant as much as a protracted exercise in evolving royal petulance, certainly not the probable socio-psychological product of the political and personal forces threatening to rip both Henry and his kingdom into pieces.  And the \\"porn star\\" looks he casts about, replete with \\"come-hither\\" stares and flared nostrils, are sometimes just laughable.  Henry VIII, venal party-boy though he was, could also be a man of fine sensitivities, elevated tastes, hellish and murderous spite, and a brilliant mind.  And I am just not seeing him come through in whole cloth.      So, is it good?  Yes.  Is is accurate?  No.  Can I recommend it?  Yes, and no.  Just depends on what you are looking for.  But if you are one who enjoys, as I mentioned, soap-operatics with a little intrigue thrown in, it's certainly worth a rental if not a purchase.      No firm recommendation one way or the other.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|Very good movie... bought the DVD in Blu-ray for my 13 y.o. niece for Christmas and she loved it.  Great family movie with lots of dancing, singing, good soundtrack and just overall good entertainment; and I'm not a singing/dancing movie fan but this is an exception.  Good movie to add to your collection.

B002JVWR4U|5.0|I can sit here and sing praises about this show but in the end it still won't matter, it won't bring the show back. Bottom-line is that this show accomplished more than any other shows will in five seasons and they did it with only 26 episodes.    Season 2 is one of the finest, best written and planned out seasons seen on television in a long time. The main plot sees Echo (Eliza Dushku) with the ability to maintain her various imprints (personas) after the events of season one, and that further developed into her being able to access those imprints at will turning her into nothing short of a super hero with advanced skills as she plots to take down the dollhouse as well as it's evil founder - Rossam corporation.    As the season progresses, we learn not only of how Echo/ Caroline come to be in the dollhouse but were presented with back stories of Victor and Sierra. Each was given an entire episode where they took the lead away from Echo as the writers tied up loose ends and allowed for further character developments.      Characters like boss lady Adelle Dewitt as well as in-house genius programmer Topher Brink were given opportunities to develop as well in the midst of the massive main plot, as the earlier struggles between good and evil while the latter found love in another evil genius.      One important thing to know for casual viewers is that season 2 does take into account, in fact to a large extend the events that happened in the unaired 13th episode of season 1 \\"Epitaph One\\".  It is evident that you watch that episode first before starting season 2, especially true for the series finale.    Flash forward scenes of the future in \\"Epitaph One\\" comes to play here in season 2, it is extremely interesting and intriguing to watch how those events come to be. Along with a trip to the infamous \\"attic\\", return of Alpha, Dr. Saunders, Mr. Dominic and Mellie as well as more disturbing tech and revelation had me hooked all season long.          I guess I'm thankful that we got a second season even though it makes the blow of losing the show so much more painful and harder. This show ended on a proper note (it is very important for me to say that as most cancelled shows don't), the ending was extremely satisfying, not only did they have a proper conclusion for the story arch in the present time line but they took the effort to conclude the events that happened in the future. My only regret is that the show didn't find its way to more audience as it is truly one of Joss Whedon's finest works.     This show will go down as one of the most underrated shows in television history.    I can't wait to own this season on DVD so I can watch it over again and again and again...

I was happy to see this at a good price and had the award winning music from Composer John Williams, who is the master when it comes to film scores.

0061703257|2.0|Are you kidding me Dennis? SPOILERS SIPOERSL LIOSPRSE ETC ECT TCE: Okay, so the first thing I'm thinking at the very end of the PRO-FREAKING-LOGUE is, oh, Teddy must be one of the patients, or soon will be. 1/3 of the way through the book, Mr. Lehane says here's my super mystery code, and here is how you crack it, because it is so smart that I need to tell you how or you'll never figure it out! Well, that means that when we get the next set of code #'s we easily translate them to: (r,s,d,i,e,d,w,a,l,d,s,n,e). Uh, don't those letters make up A-N-D-R-E-W L-A-E-D-D-I-S, assuming you are not blind? Oh and, I can see another name as well, EDWARD DANIELS. So, they are the same guy. And the next simple code of Rachel Solando = Dolores Chanal? So this is all in Teddy's head, like he's a looney on this island? Surely it can't be that simple cause I'm not even half way through the book yet, I thought! Long story short, that's exactly how it turned out, killing any possible ounce of suspense I had that it took me another 3 days just to finish it, with the slight hope that it was all setup as a prelude to some mindblowing ending....NOPE. To make it worse, Mr. Lehane thought it would be cool to spend about another 50 PAGES JUST TO SUM UP HIS ELCIREBNDI COED which should have taken 2 pages!!!!!! UKFC!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The reason I gave this 2 stars and not one is simply because the ATMOSPHERE, and the POTENTIAL were both there, and Dennis let it slip  through the cracks. I usually don't look forward to a movies version right after reading the same book, but hopefully the Scorsese/DiCaprio tandem can make it more thrilling...it shouldn't be hard!
0805091742|1.0|Obviously I'm not a part of the hit parade for this title. I had very high hopes when I ordered it from Amazon. I hoped to purchase copies for each of the family life educators in my organization. The book's basic idea is great and has face appeal. Unfortunately, the book has an amazingly narrow focus. If you work in a hospital, I would recommend it. But if you want an application of the idea to your life at home or at work, you won't find any useful ideas in this book. Sure, we can ponder its possible application, but the author never takes the time to help readers understand how to create and use checklists in their own lives. Half-way through the book I began frantic page turning to see if I could find something relevant to anything other than nurses and doctors. Sadly, I was surprised to find nothing directly useful at any point. So if you are in med school, I'd make it required reading. If you want to be horrified by mistakes by hospital workers who fail to use this important method, you will be enlightened. Anyone else, your mileage will vary.

B001TH28EY|5.0|This set of the best vocal music created by an incomparable genius is a feast for the ear. This is an epoch-making compilation that is going to revolutionize the public perception and appreciation of Mozart's phenomenal opera production.    Contrary to some reviewers' claim, one of the exciting features of this superb collection is that it includes complete and brilliant performances of Mozart's early operas: the delightful German opera \\"Bastien und Bastienne\\", K 50 (by a boy Mozart of 12); plus the seven \\"early Italian Operas\\":  \\"La Finta Semplice\\", K 51, \\"Mitridate\\", K 87, \\"Ascanio in Alba\\", K 111, \\"Il Sogno di Scipione\\", K 126, \\"Lucio Silla\\", K 135, \\"Il Re Pastore\\", K 208, and the extraordinary \\"La Finta Giardiniera\\", K 196.  All of them have until recently been universally ignored by the contemporary music world.    What's missing in this set is the Latin opera \\"Apollo & Hyacinthus\\", K 38, and the German so-called cantata \\"Die Schuldigkeit des Ersten Gebotes\\", K 35 (in fact, a genuine opera). From age 11 to 19, Mozart wrote no fewer than ten operas, plus a magnificent, gripping, \\"oratorio\\", \\"La Betulia Liberata', K 118,  which, musically, must be included in his operatic productions, for a total of 11 operas.  These three missing operas are rightly included in the Deutsche Grammophon DVD set of Mozart-22 Complete Operas (33 disks in all. A lot of time is needed to get to know Mozart in depth!). These three early operas can also be found in the Philips audio box No.11 of the Compact edition of 2000 & 2006 called \\"Litanies, Vespers, Oratorios, Cantatas, Masonic Music\\", which includes as a bonus, \\"Davide Penitente\\", K 469.    Finally, the Decca set also fails to include \\"Acis & Galatea\\", K 566, which is a 1788 arrangement of the original Haendel's 1718 English opera, a charming \\"pastoral\\" opera, in a genre already explored by Mozart in \\"Bastien & Bastienne\\", \\"Ascanio in Alba\\", and \\"Il Re Pastore\\". Although called again \\"oratorio\\", \\"Acis & Galatea\\" is a full-fledgedstageable opera, and the first entry in the New Grove Book of Operas, by the much regretted expert Stanley Sadie. But Mozart's re-arrangement is in German, no longer in the original English, and, completely re-orchestrated, it should figure as a special entry in the complete list of Mozart operas.  As a special annex,  this Haendel/Mozart work could well be added to a complete set of Mozart's German operas. Peter Schreier's 1983 version of this charming pastoral opera on Orfeo is highly recommended as an adjunct to the Decca set to make it even more complete.    Many of the recordings in the Decca set, especially the early operas, are musically complete - unlike the furious cuts in arias and recitatives perpetrated by, for instance, somebody like Harnoncourt & Co. - and have become de facto reference recordings.  Also remarkable: This is the only set with the two versions of the magnificent \\"La Finta Giardiniera\\", in Italian and in German (\\"Die Gärtnerin aus Liebe\\"), both K 196, and most of the music of the monumental \\"Idomeneo\\", K 366.    A note of caution: The Decca set gives us the music, but not the libretti, in order to keep the price at a democratic level. Libretti are indispensable to fully appreciate the music which follows the action on the stage and the feelings expressed by the beautiful arias. Synopses of action and indexes of tracks and arias are a great help, but not enough.  The missing libretti for the Decca set can be found online through Google: \\"Operafolio.com\\" shows a  complete list of the 22 Mozart libretti available, in the original language (Latin, Italian, or German), and what translations are available (not necessarily English).  Translations can be found in the booklets of individual CD boxes (which often means buying an additional version of a given opera. This enables us to start enjoying the fun game of comparing versions and singers, an entertainment which can last a lifetime).    A good companion to this Decca set is the series of the articles published in Wikipedia on each opera, and on \\"The List of Operas by Mozart\\", offering synopses, analyses, and background information, including valuable links to scores and libretti available on the Web, and to key books and commentaries.  There is also, for instance, the \\"Metropolitan Opera Book of Mozart Operas\\", covering only seven late operas, with original libretti and English translations.  Hopefully, with the release of this Decca set, the Metropolitan Opera Guild will now decide that the time is ripe to publish a book of the complete libretti with English translations of ALL of Mozart's operas (and please, make sure to include the libretti of \\"Apollo & Hyacinthus\\", \\"Die Schuldigkeit des Ersten Gebotes\\", \\"La Betulia Liberata\\" and \\"Acis und Galatea\\".)    Note also that all the full scores of the operas can be found at the Web site of DME, the \\"Digital Mozart Edition\\", which has put online all the works already published by NMA, the indispensable \\"Neue Mozart Ausgabe\\" (\\"New Mozart Edition\\", with a good Wikipedia article).  This comprehensive site contains interesting photocopies of original documents and pages of Mozart's autograph scores. The DME (and the NMA) are the fundamental sources of research for any study of Mozart' life and works. No separate texts of the libretti are offered on the DME site, all shown integrated within the scores themselves.    It is so easy and fashionable to pooh-pooh Mozart's early operas and dismiss them as  \\"immature\\" works, and claim that nobody would find any pleasure listening to such juvenilia. I have to utterly disagree with this glib dismissing (affecting also his other early music, totally ignored as well).  Can we listen all our lives only to \\"Don Giovanni\\", K 527, or \\"Die Zauberflöte\\", K 620, over and over again - although we could imagine worse fates - and never explore the vast range of Mozart's production? Overexposure can kill the strongest affection.  Most people know only the famous five, so-called \\"mature\\" operas: the exciting \\"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail\\" (\\"Abduction from the Seraglio\\"), K 384 of 1782, plus the last group of four all produced in the last five years of Mozart's life (1786-1791) -- \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\", K 492;\\"Don Giovanni\\", K 527; \\"Cosi Fan Tutte\\", K 588; \\"Die Zauberflöte\\", K 620 -- and nothing else. \\"La Clemenza di Tito\\", K 621, has been long royally ignored, as an anachronistic backward return to obsolete, dead and buried, and boring opera seria.  But after an overdose of Sarastro in the \\"Flute\\", it is a delightful refreshing experience to reconnect with the youthful \\"Bastien & Bastienne\\", K 50, and Colas's entrancing \\"Diggy, Daggy\\" spoof on magical incantation.    Mozart did become even more grandiose and complex in the second half of the 1780s, (although never losing his sense of fun, whimsy, and irrepressible gaiety, without which Mozart would no longer be Mozart) but, more vitally, his luck was that he was able to use taut, exciting, satirical, even cynical, and stage-worthy libretti, mostly by Da Ponte, on contemporary subjects. All which made them extremely popular with modern audiences. This is through these five works that most people encounter Mozart's opera music.  But we're not on a desert island, stranded with these five recordings. The earlier operas of his youth are unknown and grossly undervalued, as they have not become popular mostly because of their stodgy, conventional librettos of 18th-c. formal court entertainment. They pose quite a challenge to effective (and expensive) staging able to excite the visual interest of a modern popular audience. DVDs can succeed in rendering these stilted librettos alive.    Mind you, the same thing happened to Handel's operas, which got buried for good after their initial production. In the 18th c., opera goers and music lovers always craved for novelty - not unlike our taste for movies nowadays. Previous operas were immediately forgotten and replaced with new works. The composer was theonly one who knew and could remember his previous operas.  It's only in the 20th c., with a new sense of historicity and the magical power of recording that an interest reappeared in the old forgotten operas of Handel and Mozart. Gradually Mozart's youth operas are finally being dusted off and resurrected, as well as Handel's operas, and their magnificent music rediscovered and appreciated.    The modern tendency to pile disdain on \\"opera seria\\" - \\"dramma per musica\\" on noble heroic subjects mostly drawn from classical antiquity (Ancient Greece and Rome) or biblical stories, and \\"festa teatrale\\" suitable for a royal or aristocratic celebration - didn't improve matters.  Even a grandiose opera such as \\"Idomeneo\\", K 366, was ignored for two centuries and exhumed only recently when Pavarotti and Domingo proved it could make a superlative audience-pleaser, and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle dared to dress up the Homeric heroes in French Louis XIV costumes and wigs.  From\\"Idomeneo\\", it's an easy step to give a new fresh listen to the earlier grand opera serias of Mozart and rediscover the enchanting music in the powerful \\"Lucio Silla\\", K 135, and the remarkable \\"Mitridate\\", K 87.    Opera is about singing. Mozart's music requires the very best voices to shine in its unique glow. And, in the Decca set, conductors Davis, Hager, Schreier, Klee, Marriner, do deliver world-class singers. For instance, Hager couldn't have found a better tenor than the superbly virile Werner Hollweg for \\"Mitridate\\", facing five supreme sopranos: Auger, Gruberova, Baltsa, Cotrubas, Weidinger. In each recording, these magnificent voices make the whole difference.    When Mozart conducted the premiere of \\"Mitridate, re di Ponto\\", K 87, in Milan on Dec. 26, 1770, just short of 15, a performance that lasted six hours (with ballet), music-loving Milanese erupted in shouts of \\"Evviva il maestrino!\\" The opera was performed a total of 22 times, a prodigious success for a new opera, rarely achieved in those days when Italy was flooded by an overabundance of new works.  \\"Lucio Silla\\", K 135, opened again in Milan, exactly two years after \\"Mitridate\\", on Dec. 26, 1772, Mozart being close to 17, with no less magnificent music, and was performed an astounding 26 times.  Only \\"Idomeneo\\", K 366, reached later the same summits of musical grandeur, although it was performed only three times at its creation in Munich in 1781 and never again during Mozart's life time.  Mozart always remembered those marvelous successes of his early Italian operas, and dreamt of Italy for the rest of his life. Listening to the sensational performances of these operas in the Decca versions, we can only repeat :\\"Bravo, Maestrino.\\"  Ponnelle found \\"Mitridate\\" worthy of his DVD-making talent, and it is only a shame that his early death prevented him from tackling \\"Lucio Silla\\".  However, Harnoncourt's exciting and energetic versions of \\"Lucio Silla\\", K 135, \\"Il Re Pastore\\", K 208, and \\"La Finta Giardiniera\\", K 196, all on Teldec/Das Alte Werk, are also worth adding to those in the Decca set.    From the beginning Mozart, a true musical chameleon, could provide exciting and fitting music well adapted to the emotions portrayed by the characters of his libretti.  But he was handicapped and strictly limited at first by the fact that he could not choose his libretti, the more so that he had to surmount doubts that, as a young musician, he could write an entire opera equal in appeal to the works of the many established composers of his time.  Those libretti were imposed on him by court administrators, with the \\"noble\\" subjects deemed fit for the royal and aristocratic European courts of the 18th c. Young Mozart was already grateful enough to be trusted and invited to write for the great European courts of Milan or Munich, at a time when the teenager was not established enough to refuse or modify any text.  Later on, Mozart developed the confidence and sureness of his own theatrical taste to start refusing idiotic or uninspiring libretti and obliging the \\"poets\\" to modify their text to fit his own superbly trained sense of stage effectiveness. Losing interest, he abandoned 3 projects as fragments (\\"Zaide\\" K 344, \\"L'Oca del Cairo\\" K 422, and \\"Lo Sposo Deludo\\" K 430).    But from his early teens on his music was already scintillating, sparkling with tremendous, nearly manic, energy, and a huge, astounding, bewildering reservoir of exuberant invention and vitality.  The mystery of Mozart's phenomenal creativity lay in the fact that he was in music the equivalent, not of a volcano marked by explosive bursts, but of an inexhaustible Yellowstone geyser. Since early childhood he was haunted at all times by a spontaneous stream of music continuously flowing through his creative brain, every day, every night.  For the stage, he could fully give himself to his passion for singing, his exquisite sensitivity to moods and feelings, and his unique ability to write in the style requested by the characters.    Already at age twelve he had amassed an extensive experience of the stage and voices, knew what kind of music was expected from singers in given adult, and sexual, situations, and he could produce the kind of music required. All the standard styles of the age were continuously and thoroughly absorbed by him from all the operatic music to which he was continuously exposed during his extensive European travels. His personal familiarity with the best musicians, singers and composers of the time in the major musical centers of Europe was unrivalled.  He was endowed with an exceptional memory, now legendary, and a fabulous speed of writing down his compositions. Everywhere, with Leopold or alone, he would attend all the theater plays and operas available, which provided him with a huge mental library of contemporary styles. He could immediately imitate any genre in his own style and vastly improve on it.    As soon as he had completed in 1768, at age twelve, the 558 pages of charming music of \\"La Finta Semplice\\", K 51 - all rendering the delicate feelings of romantic love that he himself had not yet experienced, but knew exactly what they should sound like - he proved he was able to express all emotions and feelings in music with a richness unequalled by any other musician.  This was an epochal moment in the history of Western opera, not noticed at the time by anybody (except his father Leopold, his unshakable fan and manager): The sign that an extraordinary phenomenon had appeared in the sky of opera and music.  This was immediately and unreservedly recognized by all the musical experts of Europe, and Mozart became trusted as a true opera composer since his early teens - the Young Faithful musical geyser of Europe, who could always deliver on time and with extreme quality.  Hager and Harnoncourt remain the undisputed champions in the cause of resurrecting Mozart's Early Operas. And you can find Hager's exciting version of \\"La Finta Semplice\\" with a superb cast of unequalled loveliness on Brilliant Classics. And then have the pleasure of comparing it with the Schreier version in our Decca set. It is an intriguing question as to why Hager figures in most of the Early Italian Operas in this Decca set, but not his Finta Semplice.    Before reaching twenty, Mozart had already produced an incredibly extensive body of work. During this period, beside his ten operas and the \\"Betulia\\", Mozart had been writing non-stop concert arias and a huge quantity of sacred music for the voice -- countless masses, cantatas, kyries, litanies, vespers, motets, and offertories.  Mozart was always in his element when commissioned to deliver enchanting music for great singers. He was in love with beautiful voices, like all opera composers. As a boy, he had a lovely soprano voice, and was able to sing his own compositions until his voice broke at puberty. Along the way, during his European travels, he received singing lessons from the best Italian singers, who took a shine tothis prodigy. And when he married, it was in the Weber family, whose four daughters were superlative singers.  His special love for winds, which perplexed or delighted most conductors of his works, could be linked to his natural excitement at sounds that resembled the human voice. In Mozart, music always seems to sing.    Mozart was, first and above all, a born opera composer. He always repeated in his letters how much he loved writing opera music above everything else, and that this put him in a sort of physical and emotional trance where his most creative talent was inspired. An intensely insightful and sensitive person, Mozart fully lived in the stories of his operas, and gave each one his all, from the very beginning to the end of his life.  A master of the human voice, Mozart, in operatic music, was able to join his passion for extraordinarily beautiful singing to most inventive and brilliant orchestration. He loved bizarre and unusual sound effects and his operas are brimming with strange, unexpected, even puzzling, but always exciting orchestral accompaniments, if you care to listen attentively. It's worth paying close attention to the amazing orchestration, the inexhaustible torrent of surprising ideas -- and always great fun.    In opera music and his arias he was able to give full rein to all the fascinating facets of his complex character - from playful, wanton, facetious, to serious, solemn, pathos-suffused, melancholic, and grandiose or majestic, when called for - and to his unbridled talent for invention and experimentation. \\"Il était toujours si gai\\", (he was always so cheerful) reminisced Constanza in 1829. It is striking that this is reflected in Mozart's letters, where he indulged in the same sense of whimsy, love of nonsense and facetiousness, then, without missing a beat, his playfulness switched to the most serious and grave tone to announce disasters.  For he never went to school, was never punished by his parents, and had never been molded into a straightjacket by the rules of any Music Conservatory. He truly was his own self-made man and composer.    We owe principally to Leopold Hager -- but also to Neville Marriner for \\"Il Re Pastore\\", K 208, Peter Schreier for \\"La Finta Semplice\\", K 51, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt for \\"Die Gärtnerin aus Liebe\\", K 196, and Uwe Christian Harrer for \\"Bastien und Bastienne\\", K 50 -- the wonderful productions included in this Decca set of these youthful operas full of extraordinary music sung by some of the best voices in the world.  The enthusiasm, supervoltage electric energy and unfailing beauty of this music are astonishing, and this will be a surprising discovery for most buyers of the Decca set.  Leopold Hager, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Peter Schreier, and a few other conductors have provided in recent years a unique service with their systematic devotion to restoring these great unknown works to the level of attention and love they deserve from opera enthusiasts.  Jean-Pierre Ponnelle did his own bit by turning some into unforgettable DVDs.  And this bargain-priced Decca set is going to add immeasurably to the success and the popularization of this historical recovery of lost treasures.\\" Bastien und Bastienne\\", K 50, plus the seven \\"Early Italian Operas,\\" - \\"La Finta Semplice', K 51, \\"Mitridate\\", K 87, \\"Ascanio in Alba\\", K 111, \\"Il Sogno di Scipione\\", K 126, \\"Lucio Silla\\", K 135, \\"Il Re Pastore\\", K 208, and the extraordinary \\"La Finta Giardiniera\\", K 196 - are all perfect, shining works full of youthful exuberant music and enchanting singing.  The level of popular response to them -- that is, in the past and even now, the lack of it -- is no measure of their outstanding quality.    Whoever would not take the time to listen to them carefully, and make the mistake of keeping the sleeves of the early operas unopened on their shelves, would miss the opportunity to get acquainted with such brilliant music. Each of these operas deserves many listens in succession to be fullyappreciated.  This was a comment already made by the Austrian emperor Joseph II, who had remarked that the difference between Haydn and Mozart was that Haydn delivered his beauties on first hearing, while with Mozart, one needed repeated hearings to perceive his unique beauties. The emperor even feared that Mozart's opera music was too beautiful for the Viennese, even when it generated wild enthusiasm in Prague. Haendel had known the same problem in London.    Most of the time, this is very complex music, which does not easily become popular -- especially in our impatient age, eager for immediate satisfaction -- and is carried by an inexhaustible and extremely fast torrent of \\"little notes\\"  that makes remembering and humming the music extremely difficult.  Remember the famous \\"too many notes\\" quote, also attributed to Emperor Joseph II -- however now considered suspect by scholars -- about the \\"Entführung aus dem Serail\\", with Mozart's witty rejoinder: \\"just as many as needed\\"?  Mozart's unique style involved writing such a huge quantity of little notes that, in his early teens, his hand would hurt at the end of the day. (A computer alone will one day be able to count all the notes written by Mozart!)  Leopold, Mozart's father, continually reminded his son of the need to curb his unbridled imagination and to take into account in his writing that, in his audience, there were 90% ordinary musical amateurs - versus 10% (and nowadays way fewer than 10%) musical \\"connoisseurs\\" capable of appreciating his sophisticated complexities.    The top singers of the age were usually delighted with his arias, often asking for more. But sometimes, they would complain their arias were too difficult, and could he please rewrite the music more simply? Mozart was careful to treat his singers well and eager to keep them happy, always writing to fit their particular voices and technical abilities, whatever their age, lack of experience or declining age, and so obliged.  Handel had already met with the same vexing problem - music too complex and too beautiful for its popular audience. Occasionally some of Handel's top singers had similarly rebelled against the difficulty and asked for a rewrite.    To call the operas of Mozart's youthful decade \\"immature\\" works is absurd nonsense - simply repeating a canard established in a certain genre of glib journalistic writing about Mozart, which likes to distinguish the \\"immature\\" works from the \\"mature\\" works, as if they came from two different composers. Such superficial critics never explain clearly why it's enough to slap the single adjective \\"immature\\" to be entitled to dismiss the early operas without further acquaintance. \\"Early\\" is a much better word than \\"immature\\", and that's the one knowledgeable musicologists prefer to use.  Stanley Sadie, for instance, called his book, \\"Mozart: The Early Years, 1756-1781\\", as 1781 is a convenient date, being the year when Mozart left Salzburg for Munich and \\"Idomeneo\\", and from there went on to Vienna, never to return to Salzburg, except for a short visit to introduce his wife Constance to his father and sister.  Gilbert & Sullivan would have loved to write a whole operetta of their own, where the boy Mozart comes along dragging an enormous stack of music sheets marked \\"My Opera of the Year\\" while the musical critics screw up their faces, looking down their noses and making faces, and walk away from him, all singing in unison, \\"Immature, boy, immature!\\"    This genre of historical description also likes to oppose \\"opera seria\\", in reality \\"dramma per musica\\" (that is, dramatic opera), to \\"opera buffa\\", originally known as \\"dramma giocosa per musica\\" (that is, comic opera), as if they were two different, antagonistic, styles of music in Mozart, when in fact they were for him mostly adapted to different kinds of libretti or different characters. Both of them could easily co-exist in his operas and even in the same character, as long as \\"dramma\\" was preserved.  The \\"opera seria\\" served as \\"grand\\" entertainment for the aristocracy and royalty, especially in solemn occasions, where the sense of sublime was an expected ingredient. While the \\"opera buffa\\" was entertainment for the educated middle class, without serious pretensions at \\"grandeur\\". The distinction was, in essence, a difference of class in the audience, reflected in the difference of class in the characters on stage.    However, in Mozart's music, \\"opera seria\\" style and \\"opera buffa\\" style were intimately intertwined, and in his mind and sensitivity, they were not two different kinds of style, but different ways of expressing different emotions and feelings in music adapted to different characters.  Contrary to the then prevailing practice, and most surprising at the time (and ultimately revolutionary), the music and arias for secondary characters in Mozart's operas were from the very start always as beautiful as the arias and music for the principal, usually noble, characters of the \\"primo uomo\\" and \\"prima donna\\". Mozart was incapable of writing down. And so, whatever the libretto, a sense of \\"grandeur\\" and nobility is always ready to emerge and suffuse the music to express authenticity, intensity and depth.    In none of his letters does Mozart state that he is composing strictly in a given style, \\"seria\\" or \\"buffa\\". This distinction is inapplicable as such to his music. The situation on the stage may be to the spectator truly comical, but if the \\"buffa\\" character does genuinely indicate intense emotion or feeling, the music immediately takes off in a soaring or furious flight of love, pain, anger, sarcasm or rage. In his best \\"opera buffa\\" works, you'll find lofty, dazzling, passages and arias that would not be out of place in any \\"opera seria\\" (better named \\"heroic dramatic opera\\").  This is what Salieri remarked, after watching \\"Die Zauberflöte\\" with Mozart, that this opera was worthy of being presented to any court in Europe. In spite of its buffa characters, the grandeur of the music for the noble characters was truly equal to that of a genuine \\"opera seria\\". Same thing in the other \\"operas buffas\\". In truth, the label \\"seria\\" or \\"buffa\\" applies only to the libretto, and the distinction if of less relevance to the music - for the music is neither, the music is and remains Mozart.  This Decca set is even the more valuable - thanks to Hager & Co. 's unfailing passion and remarkable contribution - for including first-class performances of these early operas (most deliciously uncut), which are bound, as a result, to become better known and appreciated and standard references.    A SPECIAL NOTE ON \\"LA BETULIA LIBERATA\\"    One important work is sadly missing, which does belong to the flow of ardent music of the period of these \\"early Italian operas\\": \\"La Betulia Liberata\\", K. 118 of 1771. Philips classifies it as an \\"oratorio\\", included in the 13-disk box set # 11, called \\"Litanies, Vespers, Oratorios, Cantatas & Masonic Music\\" (March 2006). This is Hager's complete version, 2h 12' long, with his favorite Mozartian singers of the time: Ileana Cotrubas, Hanna Schwarz, Peter Schreier, Walter Berry.    Mozart wrote it while traveling in Italy, between \\"Mitridate\\" of the Milan Carnival (Dec. 1770) and \\"Ascanio in Alba\\" of the Milan wedding of Archduke Ferdinand (Oct. 1771). It offers grand, gripping music, but is rarely played at all. Mozart never heard it performed in his lifetime. Still, \\"Betulia Liberata\\" is a must have. You cannot get to know Mozart's opera music without it.    Historically and musically, Hager's production of this \\"oratorio\\" belongs with the other \\"Early Italian operas\\".  And Deutsche Grammophon does include it in its M-22 DVD set of the Complete Operas performed at the 2006 Salzburg Festival. [Curiously, in spite of \\"Deutsche Gründlichkeit\\" (German thoroughness), nobody felt ashamed to include 23 operas in this \\"Mozart-22\\" set.]    The title of \\"La Betulia Liberata\\" is deceptive. This is the famous storyof Judith beheading Holophernes in his tent at night, to save the Israelites besieged in Betulia, as narrated in the \\"Book of Judith\\" (Old Testament), and adapted by Metastasio in a 1734 libretto.  In Part I, Judith is announcing her plans to visit the Assyrian general's tent before leaving the city, and in Part II, narrating her success, once safely returned behind the walls of Betulia, carrying the famous head of Holophernes in a basket.  No action under the tent -- the seduction and the famous beheading -- is shown on stage, so Judith's arias only deliver a report after the fact, which makes this work, with the \\"dramma\\" happening offstage, technically, but not musically, an \\"oratorio\\" instead of an opera.  This dramatic story of Judith has obsessed European painters and sculptors for a long time, from Caravaggio, Botticelli, Michelangelo all the way to Goya and Gustav Klimt (who painted her twice!)    A Mozart enthusiast will not balk at adding Philips Box # 11 (13 disks!) to the 44 of Decca to get the three missing early operas: \\"Die Schuldigkeit des Ersten Gebots\\", K 35 (Sir Neville Marriner), \\"Apollo & Hyacinthus\\" K 38 (Leopold Hager), and of course the powerful and riveting oratorio-opera \\"La Betulia Liberata\\", K 118 (Leopold Hager).    Another good buy is the terrific 1952 recording of Mario Rossi, with the famous Italian \\"RAI Orchestra\\" of Turin and four world-class singers whom very few of us still remember: tenor Cesare Valletti, bass Boris Christoff, mezzo soprano Myriam Pirazzini, soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Many will flip at the seductive sound of this recording and its beautiful voices, especially Cesare Valletti (much more mellifluous than Peter Schreier in the Hager cast), and Miriam Pirazzini. It is cut, especially in recitatives, to 1h 12', against 2h 12' for Hager, but it is a sensational recording.    The entrancing, visceral, Mario Rossi was listed in two CD versions on Amazon: First, on Opera d'Oro, at $8, a live performance recorded in mono (not mentioned by Amazon) in April 1952. Its cover is a famous gruesome image of Judith beheading Holophernes, by the great female painter Artemisia Gentileschi.  The second version was on IDIS, at $16, dating from one month later, May 1952, as a radio recording. I also bought it, misled by Amazon listing it as a stereo version (with no cover shown, a marketing trick), but only to discover that it was just another mono, however \\"restored\\", but to my ears sounding practically the same as the Opera D'Oro.  The IDIS version mentions on its cover \\"original libretto enclosed\\", which would make it a valuable acquisition. Alas, it is misleading, since it is only that part effectively used in the recording, the 15 numbers, still only part of the total original libretto.    According to the list on \\"Opera.folio.com\\", of all Mozart libretti, the full original Italian libretto of \\"La Betulia Liberata\\" is not found online. Many Mozart fanatics are looking for it. A full German translation is offered on \\"opera-guide.ch\\". However, this libretto can be extracted from the complete score published online by the \\"DME\\", the complete \\"Digital Mozart Edition\\", produced by the famous \\"Neue Mozart Edition\\" (cf. the good Wikipedia article). [See a comment below on how to reach the score on the DME Web site].    So, in addition to the Philips/Hager version, don't hesitate to get the unique Mario Rossi version, with a preference for the IDIS box because of the enclosed libretto of the arias.    Mozart, in his later phase, could not reduplicate the exuberant music of his youth, and he regarded it as worthy of his talent, expressing a much higher esteem for \\"La Betulia\\" and of his youthful music than some modern Mozart cultists. He often referred to it during his Vienna decade. And who are we not to trust Mozart's judgment of his own music?      *********************    Let's remember Richard Strauss's special love for Mozart's operas, often covering the same terrain and selecting stories very similar to Mozart's early operas. While Mozart had tackled Judith in \\"La Betulia\\", Strauss handled the second famous biblical female beheader, \\"Salomé\\".  Not only did Strauss try in \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\" to duplicate the delicate atmosphere of \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\", but he also tried his hand at re-arranging one of Mozart's operas, for which he chose a rewrite of the epitome of opera seria,\\"Idomeneo\\". This is a strange work, worth listening to -- at least once -- by any Mozart enthusiast.  We can hear Strauss softly chuckling in his grave at the mention of Mozart's \\"immature\\" operas.

0061719544|5.0|Wow what a fun book! It was such a page turner that I had to actually force myself to put it down so I wouldn't read it all in one day. It was so good that I wanted it to last. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer! Though, to be fair, it seems pretty thorough and spans his whole lifetime.  I laughed out loud, cried, and laughed some more. He has a very conversational way of telling the story that almost makes you feel like you were there. I hope to read more books by Craig soon!

B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a Star Trek fan I was anxious to see how the producers would be able to create a beginning story for all of the characters we knew from the Star Trek TV and Movie series.    This film is a fast, action packed adventure, depicting our heroes as young students entering Star Fleet Academy. We see the rebellious James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Leonard McCoy, Uhura, Scotty and the other future crew members of the Enterprise as they grow into their future roles as Star Fleet Officers.    The story itself contains the typical villain who has been caught in a time warp and blames Spock for the loss of his family. In this movie he takes his vengeance on Spock's home planet of Vulcan by destroying it with a devastating weapon.    The young trainees, under the command of Captain Pike, are sent to investigate violations of the neutral zone and are soon engaged with this mysterious villain.    Fast paced action and drama are the hallmark of this great movie. If you are a Trekkie you'll love the New Star Trek film.

0316154687|4.0|This was my first David Sedaris book, I know I've read at least one other article, and I may have read others (but I never paid attention to who the author was).  I've read, and heard, that I needed to read some of his other works.  The uniqueness of the cover art on his many books makes it easy to remember that his books are all around the bookstores.<br /><br />So I gave it a try with When You Are Engulfed in Flames.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, and was surprised later to read that many loyal fans considered this collection of essays a let-down.  In particular, I liked his long treatise on his efforts to give up smoking during a long visit to Japan:<br /><br />[In regards to depictions of smoking in high school textbooks,] Sedaris wrote, \\"It seems crazy to cut smoking mothers out of textbooks, but within a few years they won't be allowed in movies either.  A woman can throw her newborn child from the roof of a high-rise building.  She can then retrieve the body and stomp on it while shooting into the windows of a day care center, but to celebrate these murders by lighting a cigarette is to send a harmful message.  There are, after all, young people watching, and we wouldn't want them to get the wrong idea\\" (p. 250-251).  Ouch!<br /><br />But there's a humor there as well that can't help but make you chuckle:  \\"I peeled away my [nicotine] patch last night and was disgusted by the cruddy shadow it left.  It feels like I've been wearing a bumper sticker, so instead of replacing the one I took off, I think I'll just go without and see what happens.  As for my three hundred dollars' worth of lozenges, I still haven't opened them, and don't think I'm going to.  What I've been doing instead is rolling index cards into little tubes.  I put one in my mouth when I sit down to write, and then I slowly chew it to a paste and swallow it.  I'm now up to six a day and am wondering if I should switch to a lighter, unlined brand\\" (p. 276).  I'm chuckling even as I type this!<br /><br />There's enough here that I want more.  Time to look for one of those distinctive covers!Time to look for one of those distinctive covers!
B001QOOCTE|4.0|I was very excited when I saw that you were offering this CD/DVD. I first saw this on PBS/Bill Moyers program and looked all over the internet for someone who offered it for sale. So, I found it on Amazon, ordered it for a more critical review. I wasn't disappointed except to notice that some of the original acts that were on the PBS program were not included in the one offered by Amazon. Other than that I enjoy the CD/DVD very much. One of the churches in my town even used it as a sermon one Sunday morning and it was enjoyed by everyone.

076532413X|4.0|Although I read quite a bit of science fiction, this book would never have caught my eye if I hadn't recently started watching the television series that it inspired.  Anyone else interested in the book because of the TV series should understand up front that there is relatively little connection between the two.  The central idea -- that all of humanity's consciousness is unexpectedly shifted into the future for two minutes -- is the same, and both stories share a character named Lloyd Simcoe, a scientist who may or may not have been responsible.  But otherwise the plots differ in every detail.    The broad themes are similar, exploring variations on the conflict between free will and destiny. There are characters who are inspired by their visions to seek out and cause the future it reveals; others rebel against or fatalistically resign themselves to their disappointing futures, with varying degrees of success.  So the television series and the novel probe the same philosophical questions. But details ranging from the length of the future jump (21 years vs. 9 months) to the characters, setting and storyline are different, giving rise to completely different narratives.  Some of these choices were inevitable due to the different formats. The television show must reach the 9-month event horizon by the end of the broadcast season, after all. FBI agents make for more compelling prime-time drama than particle physicists, and mysterious, partially glimpsed bad guys keep us tuning in to find out what happens next.    It is the wider themes, however, rather than the plot details, which make it an intriguing science fiction book.  The flash forward in time provides an intriguing and original way to explore questions of consciousness, free will, and even time travel. These are all fascinating questions and make for interesting speculative fiction in Sawyer's hands.  I also enjoyed the digressions into the philosophical interpretations of quantum mechanics: the observer paradox, many-worlds theory, and so on.  These were generally integrated well, without sounding too much like didactic asides.    The biggest flaw of the novel is the somewhat weak writing and editing.  There are typographical errors that should never have made it past a middle-school teacher, let alone a competent editor -- \\"you're\\" for \\"your\\", \\"differ\\" for \\"defer\\", etc.  If you're the type to notice this sort of thing, it will bother you.  And the characters and dialogue, while serving to move the plot along fine, lack the depth and sparkle that characterizes a truly outstanding book.    The flaws are enough that the book is not destined to become a classic.  But as some of the Nobel-hungry physicists in the book come to realize, intellectual pursuits need not win awards or immortality for their authors in order to be valuable.  It's enough that the book is fun to read. The characters are fleshed out well enough that we do care about what comes next, and the speculative themes of consciousness and free will should provide ample food for thought for most science fiction fans.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Great series, Great DVD. I sure am glad I have this in my collection. Cleese is hysterical!
B001LRJH0U|2.0|I expected a different film.  The story was drawn out.      Unfortunately, I could not get over the fact that the music reminded me of the television series, The Virginian.  Now, that was a western.      Appaloosa did have some good plot elements.     Anyway, the setting in the New Mexico Territory of 1882 was a nice touch.  In fact the whole concept of the story was good, except the concept was left on the floor as the screenplay flew out the window to the director's hands.    The cast was good, but they did not have much to work with here.  My question was where did the bad guys bury the bodies of the marshal and his deputies? What happened to their horses?  There was an eye witness-he had no clue what his fellow desperados did with the bodies and horses? Really!    And the girl who just happened to show up and take an interest in the main character-wasn't that too obvious except to the two lawmen?  These guys had been around the old corral with desperados and women.  They couldn't tell a ruse when it was in their faces, even though, it was a very lovely one?    The only believable part was the ending.  It was a great ending.  Wish the film had been great as well.    Oh! Well, sorry to be so harsh.  Two stars for the concept, the cast, the ending, and Ed Harris singing-You'll Never Leave My Heart. Nice song.

0439023491|4.0|In many ways this book is similar to the \\"Hunger Games\\".  The first half we learn more about Katniss, Haymitch, Peeta, Gale, and many others of the characters in the first book.  Then, just as you believe you understand this dystopic world, Suzanne Collins hits you with another huge surprise.  You experience Katniss' descent into semi-catatonic despair along with her.  From then on you are stuck with the impossibility of being able to put the book down.<br /><br />From then there are steady parallels from the first book to the second, the differences of these events are glaring.  People from the capital who have obliviously disregarded the suffering of those in the districts become awakened to the horror of these games.  They deal with it through tears or booing, not revolution, but it is obvious that the President has miscalculated.<br /><br />Many reviewers have been negative toward the supposed love triangle, but I think they miss the point.  Katniss isn't trying to decide between Peeta and Gale - she is at her best when she decides to not choose anyone.<br /><br />This book has a few more logical inconsistencies than the first.  For instance, I don't buy the reason for Haymitch not letting the others know his plans.  It doesn't ring true with the rest of the story - especially when he promises no more secrets.  As a result, the conclusion to this book is a little unsatisfying.  Still, I can't wait for the third & final book.

0439023483|5.0|We have all become very familiar with this type of story ³ this could be anything from 1984 to Mad Max; and it sounds exactly like the Running Man with the Governator.    Two tools in Suzanne Collins tool box make this remarkably different.  First she developed the main and secondary characters to a much greater degree than these other stories.  Much of the first half of this book is spent in this characterization.  As a result when good, bad, or surprising events occur you can empathize with the emotions of the characters.    The second key component is the first person narrative of the main character: Katniss Everdeen.  About half way through the book, the children are placed in the Arena where they are to battle to the death.  When you get to this point in the book, make sure you have plenty of time ¡V from then on you will not be able to put it down!  The first person narrative amplifies Katniss¡¦ feelings of isolation.  No Richard Dawson to annoyingly interfere with the horrible events; just Katniss facing the horrors that the Capital (and Suzanne Collins) can dream up with strength, courage, and sheer force of will.    Simply put, this book is incredible!  For days after you put it down, you can¡¦t help but reflect on her sorrows and struggles.  That is the measure of a great story.

0812973992|5.0|In \\"Let the world spin\\", Colum McCann says in his Author's notes that the title of the novel comes from Alfred, Lord Tennyson poem \\"Locksley Hall\\", that was heavily influenced by \\"Mu'allaqt\\", or the \\"Suspended Poems\\" - Arabic poems written in the sixth century. At some point, the poems ask if `is there any hope that this desolation can bring me solace?'. That is exactly the main point in this beautiful, polyphonic novel: the solace that comes from desolation.<br /><br />Set in the 1970's the narrative echoes the past into the present. It hardly mentions the events of 9/11, but, at the same time, that tragedy is always present throughout the story shaping how past turns into present. One of the main events of \\"Let the great world spin\\" is about French Philippe Petite and his walk between the twin towers of World Trade Center in 1974. This action has been the center of books and movies - specially a documentary called \\"Man on Wire\\" - but here is used in a fictional way. Many characters and their actions are related to this event in a loose way.<br /><br />McCann - who happens to be Irish - asks how connected lives change one another. But what seems to be more interesting is the way that characters aren't aware of the thread that ties them to one another. Everything is connected. The various stories in this novels at some point converge. What doesn't mean that the narratives are plastered to a pattern - the connection may occur in the most subtle way - and, many times, only the reader is aware of it. A car crash is at the center of the collision - real and metaphorical ones. When two worlds collide both of them are about to change their route.<br /><br />Routes will be drastically modified in the course of \\"Let the great world spin\\". What McCann shows is that the world spins no matter how we care or not about it. Like the course of lives that are always moving forward adding, however, the past. There are many narratives in this novel that prove so. Most of them begins somehow with Petite's walk. Like a spider web the author slowly develops a net of relationships, cause and effects.<br /><br />The character development is strong - especially when it comes to emotional resonance. Some parts are told in first person, other ones in third person - these different techniques of narrative allow the reader to be closer to some characters than others.

B001F12J0C|5.0|The Bourne movies are intelligent action flicks that my husband loves to watch over and over.  I ordered this set and now he can pull them out whenever he's in the mood for something good to watch, instead of channel surfing.  They came so fast after I ordered them too.  I was impressed.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Katsuhiro Otomo, the creator of a little anime/manga known as AKIRA, made this anime anthology film, Memories. Like other anthology movies such as Neo-Tokyo and Robot Carnival, each chapter in it has a sci-fi element to them.<br /><br />The movie is split into three segments. The first is Magnetic Rose, set in the late 21st Century where some space salvagers recieve a distress call from an abandonned station inside an asteroid belt. Two of the crew go in to investigate, but find out that it is either haunted by the spirit of a famous dead opera singer, or a deranged computer believing that it is her. The next is Stink Bomb about an employee at a pharmaceutical company who unknowingly takes a drug that makes him to give off an odor that he himself can't smell, but which causes anyone within several yards of him to die of poisoning. The Japanese government along with the U.S. military pull out all the stops to try to prevent him from reaching Tokyo, which makes for some seriously great comedic action sequences. The last one is a steampunk story titled Cannon Fodder set in an alternate world where from the point of view from a small boy, his in entire city exists to make cannons and fire them out on some unseen enemy outside their borders. The highpoint of this that it appears to be done in one continuous take.<br /><br />Memories has recieved acclaimed criticism throughout the world, and seen as one of the pinnacle anime movies alongside the works of Hiyao Miyazaki, and as one of Otomo's best works outside of Akira. The animation in each chapter of it is distinct onto itself. Magnet Rose give off the erie presence of a ghost story in space, Stink Bomb is just pure thrilling hilarity, and Cannon Fodder blends the concepts of a children's tale and a George Orwell fantasy. The movie was picked up a while ago by Sony Entertainment on DVD, but in Japanese with subtitles only. If you count yourself as any kind of a fan of animation or great science fiction storytelling, then you must see this movie before you die!his movie before you die!

1594488843|5.0|Okay, so that's the way it really works!     Every now and then, I come along a book that challenges enough lifelong assumptions I've held about myself and others to be \\"enlightening\\", and this is such a book.    The book is easy to read and accessible, and the research backing up the author's conclusions are also laid out to impact.    I spent the first hour reading this book sitting next to my wife, and about every 3-4 minutes, I'd blurt out \\"Did you know . . .\\" or \\"I never knew . . . \\" and then read her a passage. A day later, the book was gone from the end table next to the sofa, and my wife had absconded with it. If you are a professional or manager, you will see major implications into your own behavior and that of others. If you are just reading out of interest, you will learn a lot about yourself I haven't seen in another place.    The writing is worthy of the exciting revelations -- fresh and vigorous, making the book as enjoyable for me as it was informative.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B002PEP4HI|5.0|This book was yet another triumphant book for Mitch Albom.  It was well written, easy to read, yet filled with complexities and inspirational points.  His writing opens one's mind to the views of others without taking away from one's own personal views.   I highly recommend this book and if you have not read any of his works, I suggest you start with \\"The five people you meet in Heaven\\" which is my personal favorite.
006621131X|4.0|I found this to an engrossing read. Primarily for the deft way Smith described the late sixties/early seventies arts scene in New York where it seems one could live with no bathroom and barely enough money for food but still brush elbows on a nearly daily basis with the famous and the infamous- Jimi Hendrix, Alan Ginsberg, Sam Shepard, Janis Joplin  et al, in a sort of makeshift artistic commune that was the Chelsea Hotel. Interesting too that Smith never mentions punk rock, any major figures in punk rock, or refers to herself as punk or shows interest in the early punk rock movement, eventhough she's known as the Godmother of punk. Surprising too, given her hard edgy stage persona in this book she comes across naive, thoughtful, unwilling to partake in the drug scene, not wanting to know much about Mapplethorpe's own forays into the dark world of S&M, bewildered and provincial in her notions about Mapplethorpe's struggle with his sexual orientation and all the while sweetly devoted to her traditonal blue collar family.  I found fascinating the uncertain disorganized way both drifted towards the media that made them famous- Mapplethorpe having had no formal training or interest in photography initially coming to it hestitently only because it satisfied his impatience with traditional media and it could realize his vision almost instantaneously. And Smith not having any formative driving aspirations to become a singer or make music, only coming to it as means to punctuate her poetry. In short, both, but Mapplethorpe particularly, had absolutely certainty they were artists of magnitude, only neither knew particularly in what media. Which seems opposite so many other artists where a love of creating is born of an attraction to a media. Anyway... this seems surprisingly directionless for ones destined to achieve such notoriety- it seems they almost did it through some kind of unique accidental destiny coupled with their belief in themselves and each other. Just as theirmeeting, both homeless and hungry drifting on the fringes of the New York art scene seemed like both lucky accident and cosmic destiny.  The only reason I held one star in reserve on my rating was that so many photographs and artworks were described in the book and only a fraction of the images described were included and it seemed much of the making of Smith's first album and its contents were so rushed through at the end. Maybe because it wasn't the point of the book which was meant to fulfill a promise that Smith had to made to Mapplethorpe before he died. But the pace seemed strange and uneven given the trajectory of her career.   And so appropriately the title of the book suggests this, as it is a memoir of their pre-fame days. One day both were hanging out in a park when a tourist told her husband to take their picture because she thought they must be artists! Her husband replied, \\"Nah, they're just kids.\\"
B001S36X2W|5.0|This is a story of World War  II and a story of computer geeks stumbling onto history.   Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is the main character.  He has what may be Asperbgers syndrome.  In college he meets Alan Turing and a German, they are all math wizs.  The story in the book bounces around with several characters being important.  It gets to the point you can see all the story lines will meet.  It makes a really good story.   The computer geeks are starting a company to do something and stumble onto scavenger treasure.

My bottom line is-this series is a MUST BUYING for all viewers out there on earth and THE LEADERS of all the G8 countries and all other countries,rich or poor. leaders must see this series OVER AND OVER again like a BRAIN WASH in every climate summit.  i personally suggest to release this series in all dvd regions(ntsc,pal,region 1 thru 6) and languages in the world so everyone on earth will be able to watch this and take earth more SERIOUSLY.

0812973992|4.0|I purchased the book from reviews.  It is not one of the best books I have ever read but the characters came alive for me.  I want to continue following their lives.  I totally enjoyed the way the storeis were tied to one another. Am considering whether to recommend for my book club.
B002NFCHBA|5.0|When I first saw this box, I didn't really have the intention to buy it, as I owned already some of the recordings in it - for example all Pollini recordings, and also Blechacz' preludes. But since the price was so ridiculously low (I paid 39 euros at www.amazon.fr), I purchased it anyway, and I must say that I am very, very happy with it.<br /><br />The overall quality of the performances is outstanding. The absolute highlights for me are some of the Polish performances: I find Blechacz' rendition of the preludes incredibly honest, pure and poetic. These are probably the best preludes I have ever heard, equaled only by Cortot's version. As for the two piano concertos, I already owned - among others - the very good Argerich-Dutoit recording, and an older recording by Vasary which I like very much. The recording by Zimerman and the Polish Festival Orchestra was new to me. I must admit that it has blown me away completely! It is incredibly intense and coherent. I am still in shock :)<br /><br />Many of the recordings in the box are excellent. Pollini is playing the etudes, the polonaises, the scherzi, the barcarolle and the second and third piano sonatas, Zimerman is playing the ballades and the fantasy: these are all some of the very best recordings of these pieces, if not the standard references. Pires is performing the nocturnes: this is also a famous and good recording (it is very much \\"cantabile\\"); some people will prefer Arrau or Rubinstein, and personally, I like Moravec very very much.<br /><br />The chamber music recordings are very satisfying (Beaux Arts trio, and the wonderful duo Argerich-Rostropovich). Arrau delivers a nice recording of the \\"smaller\\" works for piano and orchestra. The recordings of the smaller solo piano works by Ugorski, Zilberstein, Pletnev, Li, ... are also very decent. The songs (which have always been underestimated) have not often been recorded, but Szmytka is excellent.<br /><br />The only real weak spot of this box is Ashkenazy's performance of the mazurkas and the waltzes. I have never been fond of Ashkenazy as a Chopin pianist, but in particular the waltzes and mazurkas are not his cup of tea. His sound is somewhat metallic, his interpration is quite dry... For the waltzes, I recommend the legendary recording by Lipatti, or the eccentric but interesting Samson François. For the mazurkas, Rubinstein is excellent, and there is a very nice selection of mazurkas recorded by Kapell (but this recording is not very well-known).<br /><br />That being said, this box contains so many brilliant performances for such a ridiculously low price, that you shouldn't hesitate to buy it, even if you already own some of the recordings. I recommend it without any reservation whatsoever.the waltzes. I have never been fond of Ashkenazy as a Chopin pianist, but in particular the waltzes and mazurkas are not his cup of tea.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|I must admit I made a couple of false starts at watching this movie before I hung in long enough to get the payoff.  The first forty minutes is about as interesting as watching grass grow, but is necessary to develop the story and set up the artistic climax (visually and metaphorically).  I've watched it several times and think I enjoyed it more the second or third time, especially if watching with a friend.  In simplest terms, for me this movie is a metaphor for, \\"Once you have found the magic, don't let it go.\\"  Its a little campy and probably not for everyone.  It is especially cool if you have seen Huell Howser's \\"California gold\\" episode on Newberry Springs (the setting for Bagdad Cafe).
0316017922|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book like I do other Gladwell works.  But, this one is not at the same level at Blink or the Tipping Point.  Gladwell has an anti-talent bias that is now creeping into his thinking and works.  I agree with Gladwell that you do need to practice a lot to become to the best of the best in any field, but I disagree with him that it seems like if you work hard enough you can be anything you want to be.<br /><br />Now, overall this is still an interesting book and I appreciate the thinker that is Gladwell.  I appreciate that he challenges the status quo, and stimulates thinking.  I hope he keeps it up for a long time.

0757302661|5.0|After the aweful experience I had with my first birth, I was looking for something different the second time around.   I had heard of Hypnobirthing but was very skeptical.  I had friend who was pregnant at the same time and she was taking Hypnobirthing classes.  My hopsital didn't offer them and I knew I couldn't afford them.  So I decided to check the book out of the local library about 6 wks before I was due.  I read it and loved it!  I took what felt right to me and didn't worry about the stuff that didn't fit me- like renaming all the parts of childbirth- if it doesn't hurt, why do we need to call it something else?  I had an amazing birthing experience.  It was intense but not painful.  The part that I had a hard time with is that the book says that you won't have a sensation to push and for me that was SO WRONG- it wasn't a sensation but almost a reflex.  It scared me and I lost consentration and it hurt.  I freaked out a little bit at that moment but my husband was able to calm me down and refocus me.  After about 7 min. of pushing my son 8lbs 11oz was born.  My recovery was AMAZING!  I just found out that I am expecting twins and decided to buy the book this time so that I could underline things that I think will be of importance this time around.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is one of those rare movie gems that seems to have come and gone without much notice.  It is, in fact, one of the better movies in the catalogue.<br /><br />Robert Deniro stars, but in an atypical role for him, much to his advantage.  He is simply excellent.  Jeremy Irons stars alongside Deniro and is similarly excellent, matching Deniro's intensity with a quiet poise.<br /><br />What is the movie?  It is about repentance, moral truth, and religious corruption.  It is about colonial exploitation, the politics of power, and the ultimate triumph of good.  The movie will move you, but the score will simply make you weep.  Ennio Morricone composed the score for this movie and if it isn't one of the most powerful, beautiful works made for the screen, I just don't know what is.<br /><br />I won't speak to plot details, as I there are dozens of excellent, professional, reviews that are much better at that.  The movie is an adventure, but not of the rollicking, fun sort.  It has strong themes of power and religion, but is not moralizing.  It is just one of the most moving, beautiful films I have ever seen.

0792839846|5.0|The subject pretty much says it.  This movie would be my number one pick, if I had to choose only one, if I were to be stranded on a desert island.  With a TV.  And a video player.  And a working 110v outlet.<br /><br />Not much else to say here that hasn't already been said before.  This movie is just tops for romantics.  It is so basic and pure in its portrayal of heroism, friendship, loyalty, love.  That's the movie.<br /><br />The packaging was fine, and Amazon delivered it as promised and on time.  This review is for the VHS version, of course.  The tape is in good shape and the recording quality is good.  The case is standard, as any other, but not meant to stand the test of time.<br /><br />It's all about the movie, though; so long as the tape works (it does) and is of good quality (over ten years of use and counting) then it's good.

B00275EGWY|5.0|Director Kathryn Bigelow ([[ASIN:B000GUJZ4G Point Break]]) has an uncanny ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this propulsive 2009 battlefield drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of filmmaking bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.<br /><br />That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. Barry Ackroyd ([[ASIN:B000GH3CR0 United 93]]) is responsible for the vivid, burnished cinematography. The extras on the 2010 DVD are sparse but quite good. The most informative feature is the commentary track from Bigelow and Boal, who both discuss production details and historical context to allow for a greater appreciation of the story being told. There is also a twelve-minute making-of featurette, which is pretty standard as these extras go. Lastly, an image gallery accompanies a 23-minute Q&A session with Boal and Bigelow recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.e need for sentiment.

B002ISID10|5.0|I have much respect for bands/artists that work outside the realm of normalcy.  In a time where, for me at least, finding an album that you can truly love from start to finish has become harder and harder, Asking Alexandria are a breath of fresh air.  This is genre mashing at its finest.  At it's core, SUAS is a brutal post-hardcore offering that gives you everything you could ask for in a metal album:  Guttural growls, piercing screams, and melodic harmonies set to grinding riffs, deep bass rhythms, and fast paced drums...oh yea, and some trance techno that would right at home in an xtc-laden rave! And lemme tell you, the genre duo works beautifully.     The album from start to finish has a perfect flow, and song order definitely sets that up.  The opening track is easily the most important; giving the listener a perfect idea of the different sounds to come. So perfect in fact that listening to the sample should make decision making process a breeze.     This is a great CD.  Metal and melody laced with some trance.  I urge everyone to give this a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed.

There seemed to be a message about how reality programs can cause us to become numb and past feeling, but was subtle so I didn't feel like I was being indoctrinated. There's also a romance woven into the story along with adventure. I love it.

0764207407|5.0|I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books, and Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorites. When I received [[ASIN:0764203886 Pride and Prejudice (Insight Edition)]] as a review copy, I was worried that the text would actually have been changed or modernized, but the words of Austen remain the same, to my great relief. Instead, this version intersperses personal observations, movie trivia, historical background, spiritual insights, and other tidbits of information throughout the text in side boxes.<br /><br />I would also recommend this for younger readers or any other readers who are not familiar with Austen's time period, since it explains some terms and customs of the era that they might not otherwise understand. Any Austen trivia fan will also enjoy it.<br /><br />Some of the comments were rather too obvious and didn't add too much, others were really quite funny. The added info/commentary was really a good mix of just plain good fun and informational. The conversation questions at the end would make this very suitable for book club use, as well.<br /><br />I prefer the side box format to the usual footnote or margin format for \\"amplified\\" versions. It added the information without taking over the book.<br /><br />This is my third version of Sense and Sensibility, and I have to say it might be my favorite.

0307269981|5.0|Stieg Larsson was born in 1954, was a journalist and an expert on anti-democratic and far-right organisations. He died suddenly in November 2004, shortly after delivering the manuscripts for three crime novels - known together as the Millennium Trilogy - to a Swedish publisher. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is the first part of this trilogy.<br /><br />About a year has passed since \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\". Lisbeth Salander, having arranged a very healthy income at the end of that book, has spent much of her time travelling. As the book opens, she's relaxing on Grenada; however, no-one in Sweden has any idea where she is. Dragan Armansky, her boss at Milton Security, has more or less assumed she's resigned while she'd broken off all contact with Mikael Blomkvist before leaving. Blomkvist was both baffled and disappointed, though Salander had seen herself as a woman spurned.<br /><br />Salander's had a very difficult life. It would be easy - and foolish - to dismiss her based on first impressions : she didn't finish high school and has no formal qualifications, has several piercings and tattoos and is barely five feet tall. However, she's highly intelligent, has a photographic memory and is a supremely talented hacker. She's very resourceful and also knows exactly how to handle herself in a dangerous situation. However, she's an exceptionally private person and comes across being rather cold and detached. (Although some suspect she may have Asperger's Syndrome, she has a very limited number of friends - and some at Milton positively despise her). She was institutionalised in her teens - after \\"all the evil\\" happened, when she was 13 - and is still classified legally incompetent. Her mother's dead, and her father's identity is officially unknown - so a lawyer, Nils Bjurman, officially makes decisions on her behalf. (Salander, of course, is more than capable of looking after herself). Bjurman is a nasty, sleazy and corrupt individual, who viewed Salander as his own personal toy - something to use as he pleased. Although Salander has managed to turn the tables - she has an extremely personal video that could ruin Bjurman - the lawyer has had enough to doing as he's told. Now, he's planning to have her dealt with...in a very conclusive manner.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all is going well at Millennium. Having been approached by a freelancer, Dag Svensson, the magazine will devote a themed issue to human trafficking and the sex trade. Svennson is offering an article for the magazine, a very detailed book and a wealth of research. His girlfriend, Mia Johansson, has spent some time researching the same field as the basis for her PhD research. However, where Mia focussed on the girls involved, Svensson has been focussing on the \\"suppliers\\" and the \\"clients\\"...and the results feature some very interesting names. (While they have journalists and policemen, there's a mysterious character called Zala they can't quite pin down. However, he appears to be a terrifyling character.<br /><br />Although Salander now has a low opinion of Blomkvist, he still thinks well of her - for a long spell, he checked on her apartment, and tried to re-establish contact. They finally do re-connect in \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" - although not in the circumstances either would have hoped...<br /><br />Another cracking book - though one that, like its predecessor, can occasionally make for uncomfortable reading. The events of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" are as difficult emotionally and psychologically for Salander as they are physically - with any number of people raking through her past, and newspapers speculating about her private life. However, it also means that we learn a great deal about Salander's past...Absolutely recommended.al toy - something to use as he pleased.

0345440757|5.0|Finally a book worth buying. I love it!  I really like her EASY method but haven't try it yet. My baby is not born yet but I like the idea of looking for clues and trying to follow some kind of routine so the baby knows where she is going.  Now, of course every baby is different so will see what works with mine!!  The thing is it's nice to find a book with a different voice, a non-guilty one especially, where the author tells you about the importance of taking care of yourself, because it simply matters and because it's good for your baby.  I will recommend it.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OVLBFS Jesse Stone: Night Passage]]    A fan of Tom Selleck since MAGNUM, P.I. days, this is a series that was truly MADE for Selleck.  The brooding Jesse Stone, with all his foibles, is excellently portrayed.  That said, the character and stories of Jesse Stone grab you from the first. . .and don't let you go.  The music too is haunting reverent to the story, adding to the suspense.  The supporting cast are also well done, although some deviate from the author's written description, but help bolster Jesse Stone's persona.  I LOVE the books but the movies are the added visually bonus that compel the fan to want more.

B000FA57NK|1.0|Problem I had was I was looking for Blue ray DVD's and was not aware I was being offerred HD instead. Fairly sure I put Jurrasic Park on the wish list in Blue Ray. People usually do not have both players so I am still wondering how I got caught. Perhaps if you start looking at Blue Ray then HD should not be shown to you in case you make the mistake of not noticing you have been offerred something else.    At this point I cannot review the product nor ever will.
B0000CABBW|2.0|The beginning of the movie starts out with Porourangi standing by his wife as she gives birth to two children.  Unfortunately, both the wife and son die, leaving a girl behind.  The grandfather, Koro, is upset because he was hoping the boy would be the new village chief since his own son Porourangi wasn't interested. To make matters worse Porourangi gives the child the same name as the legend Paikea, who rode on the back of an ancient whale bringing their ancestors to New Zealand. Koro is furious, because he knows a girl could never have the right to become what her brother would have been, the new chief. He says he wants nothing to do with her.    The next scene is when Paikea is older and attending middle school.  Despite her grandfather's anger, we see her riding on a bicycle with him. Her name has been shortened to Pai and she has been raised by her grandfather and his wife Nanny since her dad left her to go to Europe to pursue a career as an artist. Her father comes back to the village though for a visit. Father and son embrace closely in the way of the Maori, by touching noses. Anger erupts though when Koro learns that Porourangi is expecting a child with a woman he met in Germany. Porourangi asks Pai to return to Europe with him, but she changes her mind as they're leaving.     Pai knows that Koro is always looking down at her as unworthy and he seems to stay angry with her through most of the movie. Despite his attitude though she feels that she is meant to be the leader of the village, and tries desperately to prove this to Koro. We are constantly seeing the self determination in Pai set against Koro's inability to question his beliefs. She loves her grandfather, but she also has the courage to speak through her actions, in an attempt to show him that she is the future of the tribe.      Koro disciplining Pai is something that occurs over and over, especially when she is interfering with his goals of finding a new leader among the boys of the village. In one scene they are working on the engine of an old boat and Koro explains how the twines of the rope used to start the engine together represent the strength of their ancestors. When the rope breaks Koro goes off to find a new one and Pai re-ties it and starts the engine. This angers Koro and he reprimands her.    Koro decides to form a cultural school for the village boys, hoping to find a new leader. Pai secretly follows the lessons and with the help of her uncle Rawiri learns how use a fighting stick. Her grandfather, once again is enraged when he finds out. As a final test for the boys to see who will become chief, Koro takes them out to a spot in the ocean and tosses his whale tooth necklace into the ocean. The boy who retrieve's it will become the new leader of the future. Unfortunately none of the boys are able to bring it back and this causes Koro to fall into a great state of depression.    Uncle Rawiri, returns to the spot in the ocean that the necklace was thrown into with Pai. She jumps in, and returns not only with the necklace, but also a lobster. She didn't seem to realize what it meant to find the whale tooth necklace only that it would make her grandfather happy again.  .    The climax of the film then takes place at a school ceremony, where Pai is honored for winning an essay contest. She wrote about the pride and love she has for her grandfather.  Koro wasn't there when it began and he got even more delayed when he found himself on the beach when he discovered whales stranded in the sand. The whole village tries to keep the whales alive, especially the largest one. They try using a rope and tractor to turn it towards the ocean in the hopes that it would be able to swim.  The rope snaps though and they decide to give up. Pai stays behind though and climbs up on top of the whale. The giant creature finds the strength to push itself back into the water with Pai on its back. Nanny realizes that Pai is no longer with them and the whale is gone. The crowd is immediately overcome with horror. They finally see her on the back of the whale, riding up and down in the water like the ancestors of long ago did. The water eventually overcomes her and she is forced to let go. The next scene shows her in the hospital with Koro by her side asking for forgiveness. He has finally acknowledged that she is the \\"wise leader\\".  She opens her eyes and smiles.    The final scene shows the canoe that Pai frequently went to when she needed to be by herself. The villagers were pushing it together, towards the ocean with Koro and Pai sitting in the center.

First time director, no name cast, amazing story, great cinematography, and again, amazing story.    If you have never seen it, it is worth your money and more. The most unconventional alien story you will ever see. If you have seen it, you know how remarkable it is. This is an alien story about humans. The acting and special effects are superb.  One of my favorite movie's of all time.     If you don't buy it please rent it. It's a must see.

B00004XQJX|5.0|Whether or not you respond to Pollini's account of the Diabelli Variations depends on your response to his Apollonian approach, which some will undoubtedly find impersonal and aloof (this is a protege of Michelangeli, after all). In the hands of some pianists, the Diabellis are a complex world in which Beethoven unfolds his entire range of pianaistic devices. At their best, such performers -- Richter being the supreme example -- offer an astonishing variety of touch, mood, and invention. Other great pianists -- here I think of Serkin -- take a sterner view and approach the Diabellis as a kind of heroic Himalayan peak; for them there's a spiritual height to be reached. And for yet another class of performers -- here I think of Brendel -- there's an attempt to humanize the Diabellis, bringing them down to earth with wit and dancing rhythms so that this inhospitable, thorny work can be enjoyed by the common listener.<br /><br />Pollini belongs to none of these groups. Instead, he attempts to unify this long, exhaustive work, drawing us into a single, uninterrupted experience. Is this an unyielding, even imperious approach? For some listeners that will prove to be the case. No one can doubt, however, the superhuman ease with which Pollini conquers the technical demands of the music, an ease which makes it sound less nerve-racking. There's not the slightest sense of struggle. Nor is he ponderous, self-important, or rhetorical. As a proclaimed admirer, I should be completely happy, but I think there's a weakness here. In concert Pollini's ability to create a single unified experience is hypnotic; I've heard Carnegie Hall fall silent for half an hour under his spell. But recordings work differently. On disc, this Diabelli reading can sound rather too uniform without being hypnotic. At least that's how I feel about it on certain days. On others the magic works.  At least there's magic in the offing.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I loved this movie!!  It was funny, exciting, great story, great casting--when J J Abrams is involved (Lost), things are never dull, esp. the Commentary.  I am not a hard core \\"Trekkie\\", but I very much enjoyed this prequel story of all the beloved characters in their youth.  Karl Urban as \\"Bones\\" is hilarious.    The Blu-ray set is great.  The Special Features disc is packed with goodies, plus on the movie disc is a great Commentary.  I highly recommend this to just about anyone.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|I have noticed that in most American films there seems to be a cultural preference for neat happy-endings. Certainly judging from many of the comments on \\"Doubt\\", I see that many viewers were left dissatisfied and annoyed by this aspect of the film. A film entitled \\"Doubt\\" could really have no other ending.     The film is a metaphor for the value of doubt within religious faith. Since in the absence of empirical certainty to prove the existence of God, there should always remain some elements of doubt within the human mind. While faith serves to bridge the gap between empirical certainty and the belief in God, the element of doubt allows us to critically examine faith so as to avoid the evils of a mind entrenched solely in fanaticism and dogma.     If we look at this film in the context of the revelations of sexual misconduct that have shaken the foundations of the Catholic Church in recent years, then it seems natural to conclude that the plot simply involves a heroic, strong-willed nun who must deal on her own terms with a pedophile priest within a male-dominated hierarchy that insulates and protects such predators. There are allusions within the film to support this popular impression, such as the priests dining on rich red meat, smoking and joking in the club-like rectory whilst the nuns are primly supping on the cheapest fare in monastic silence. Also, Mr Hoffman, who plays the accused priest, does have an aura of sleaziness about him and the emphasis on his keeping his fingernails long lends itself to something a bit creepy and out of the norm. (I do not agree with the superficial and rather invidious conclusions of other commentators that this necessarily means that the priest is gay -let alone assuming that being gay automatically corresponds with pedophilia!) Within the context of all that we now know about the the unpleasant history of institutionalised pedophilia within the church, we are initially led to despise this likely pedophile priest and to sidewith Sister Aloysius in her battle... but in fact, the film is far deeper that would at first glance appear. There are multitudinous shades of grey and we, as an audience, are being challenged to examine our own perspectives and beliefs.     The stern sister's innate belief in the validity of her suspicions against the priest correspond strongly with her comprehension of her faith and indeed her personal identity. She is utterly dogmatic in all her beliefs, whether regarding the Church, decorum for her nuns, child pedagogy, or even penmanship. She holds even trivial opinions with the same unshakeable vehemence that she holds her Catholic faith.     The conflict between the priest and the nun is precipitated by his sermon about doubt. Almost as soon as the topic of this sermon is enunciated, the nun does not seem to be able to sit and concentrate on the content of the sermon, but arises and distractingly begins correcting the slack posture and other superficial misdemeanours of the students in the congregation. Nevertheless, the topic has obviously struck a chord within her since she later disrupts the habitual silence of the nuns' mealtime by implanting the notion that something is not quite right with the priest and he needs to be watched by the nuns, which later leads the impressionable, eager-to-please young teacher to provide fodder for suspicion against the priest.     Perhaps it was the fact that the priest stood on the pulpit and admitted the possibility of doubt that threatens the very foundations of the sister's faith and subsequently led to her efforts to depose him. Sister Aloyisus's entire world-view is based on a highly dogmatic and sanctimonious approach that admits no room for the doubts and uncertainty of a church in the midst of reform. We see later that Sister Aloysius personally dislikes many aspects of this priest- his manicure, his ball point pens, and perhaps most of all, his agreement with the need to reform the the pre-Vatican II Church. Evenher impressionable young novice recognises the possibility that this has more to do with her superior's personal prejudices than the alleged pedophilia. Sister Aloysius likely views this priest as the personification of the perceived threats to her Church and indeed her entire world view.     Sister Aloysius is later convinced that she was right in her accusations against the priest since he resigned in the wake of her direct confrontation and her false allegations of corroborative evidence. Her reasoning however does not go beyond the simple logic she uses in her discipline of her students.  As any good lawyer would recognise, the circumstance of his eventual resignation does not in fact prove anything. Perhaps the priest finally realised that he was dealing with an irrationally fixated person who was determined to do significant harm to his reputation even without evidence, so he merely acquiesced to her demands to avoid incurring personal damage.  As shown by his beautifully illustrated sermon, it does seem that the priest fully understands the powerful negative effects of gossip.    Another theme that seemed to crop up was the nun's resentment towards the male hierarchy in the Church. Obviously she was a strong, dynamic person but found her authority limited to the role of a stern disciplinarian over children and had to defer even her own desk over to the male hierarchy when in their presence. She alluded to other instances of her opinions and authority being disregarded by the male hierarchy and she seemed to scoff at the friendliness of the priest and the monseigneur having a chat in the street. Perhaps this priest was simply an available target against which she could unleash her extreme resentment of her male-dominated world?     What is striking about Sister Aloyisius' behaviour is her lack of any sympathetic contact with the supposedly victimised youth. She does not seek any direct testimony from him to corroborate the circumstantial \\"evidence\\" of the priest's actions, nor does she make any attempt to counsel or provide any support to him as the victim of alleged pedophilia.   She says it would be pointless to ask the alleged victim because \\"they always protect them.\\"  This aspect alone seems to indicate that she is not so much a concerned advocate and protector of the child, but rather a person using him to promote a vendetta against the priest.     When Sister Aloysius attempts to involve the child's mother in her campaign against the priest, she is shocked by the mother's unwillingness to support her. The mother instead proposes the radical notion that even if the sister's accusations of pedophilia are true, they do not outweigh the many positive benefits she has ascertained her son to be receiving from his relationship with the priest. Indeed, she suggests that her son might be a willing participant in such a liaison. This conversation is staggering in that it introduces new dimensions to the oftentimes reactionary popular response to childhood sexuality and pedophilia.     There is nothing in the film that overtly implicates the priest in a pedophilic relationship with the child. We are left to draw our own conclusions based upon the circumstantial evidence gathered from the nun's perspective. As we can see from the many commentators who believe that this was sufficient to prove the priest's guilt, the film has succeeded in showing just how easily people can be swayed by circumstantial evidence.     This film affords a profound challenge to examine the rigidity of one's belief systems. It calls upon us to recognise that there is never an absolute perspective on right and wrong, and even a subject as sensitive as pedophilia has many shades of grey. The reason Sister Aloyisius breaks down in the end and admits her doubt is because she finally is faced with the awful futility of her dogmatic black-and-white approach to both her faith and her life.

B000ZELISO|3.0|While I am a real fan of the Harry Potter Series, the Half Blood Prince - which was one of the longer books in the series - seemed to receive short attention by the producers of the latest film version.  So much of the book was omitted, the viewer is left with broad gaps in understanding the overall plot.  The film makes great assumptions in viewer prior knowledge and I think it would be very confusing to anyone who has not read the books.    The film does have a number of interesting digital scenes and good visual effects.  Compared to the other films in this series, I would have to rate this one somewhat disappointing.

0841601615|5.0|Handmade shoes for men takes everything you need to know about shoemaking and distills it into one book. While not a \\"How To\\" in the strictest sense, this book provides you with enough information to make a pair of shoes from little more than a cow and a tree. It details everything from the selection of wood for the lasts down to the angle of the rubber heel caps, touching on everything in between.   This book is probably the best resource for any cordswain, aspiring cobbler, or anyone else who has an unhealthy obsession with shoes. The detailed color photographs of traditional shoe making give you clear enough explanation that you could reproduce the works within if you cared to try.
0316069906|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I thought the information was presented in an extremely excellent manner - not a \\"slaughter\\" book but informaton on making choices and helping to stop factory farming as much as helping the suffering of animals and changing the slaughter practices.  Also, you can help without becoming a vegetarian.    I am going to help through the organizations mentioned to make what change I can and have also stopped eating almost all meat (am having a hard time with seafood and fish).  I recommend this book highly to those interested in making a difference for the planet
1401323820|3.0|To be very candid, I don't watch much television and have never heard of the program that other reviewers are referring to.  Because I am not a fan of the show, there were no preconceived notions or expectations on my end.  My book group selected this book for our February read and I just finished it in preparation for our getting together this week.  I do read quite a bit (100 books a year or so) and my review is based upon my impressions of the book as a stand-alone novel.<br /><br />The beginning of the book starts out pretty poorly.  The writing is not good and the character names just drove me nuts (Nikki Heat is just way too much like a Saturday Night Live skit character for me).  Around page 13 or so, I would have put the book down and stopped reading if I hadn't felt obligated to finish.  There are only so many times you need to tell me its scorching hot in NYC before I want to scream - dripping perspiration can only take one so far.  Two characters nearly touching while standing at a murder scene and feeling all kinds of attraction was just weird to read about.<br /><br />With that being said, I stuck with it and it turned out to be an all right read.  The writing largely seemed to improve (except with continuing references to the heat that I could have done without) and the storyline itself picked up.  The book kept my interest and I found the story to be enjoyable.  It's not great writing, it's not great literature, it's definitely hokey at points but once I got past all of that it was largely fun.<br /><br />Bottom line:  A very quick read that is entertaining.
0446580945|4.0|Dear John was a very \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" type love story. If you like him (or the Notebook), you will like this book.    It's about an I don't give a fish sort of guy who meets a sweet, innocent-like girl, Savannah. They fall in love (shocker!), but since John is in the army and is on leave, he must go back to where he's stationed, Germany. Their relationship is again, very Nicholas Sparks in that it's just like any normal relationship. It gets rocky then calm again.    Why I gave it four stars is because  I didn't like the ending, but you will ahve to read it to find out!!    Can't wait to see how they turn this one into a movie!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I went into this film expecting \\"The International\\" meets \\"Minority Report.\\" Instead, the film plays out more like \\"28 Days Later\\" meets \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Either way, it's a solid piece of filmmaking that stands out due to it's emotional stance and amazing performances. I was genuinely impressed at the calculated tension the film delivered (the scene with the stalling car nearly stopped my heart!) I rate this movie as a solid 4, and it could have been a 5 if the ending were a little better. (As it stands, it's a sort of sad/abstract ending. Hope is coming, but there's no REAL climax.)     Highly recommended work of art!
B002N9MK8G|4.0|I remember this from the double LP at the Jazz School where I trained. The Basie Bands swings like you can't believe and Sinatra's singing is golden. The thing that made it memorable for me though is his patter. Genuine laugh out loud stuff. Here the CD has been compressed into fewer tracks and a lot of that glorious patter edited out. There is one fantastic monologue though, so short of finding a copy of the double LP this is a good compromise.
B002061WCC|4.0|I love this movie! though, after watching it a couple times, you get sick of Katherine MacCols character. If you made this into a drinking game where you take a drink every time you hear Bobs name, you would never remember how it ended, and you might get pretty sick. BUT, its a great movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I HATE working out. I am 23 and used to be a gymnast and cheerleader in high school, so I was in naturally decent/good shape. Well now I've discovered the \\"joys\\" of grad school and 24/7 studying. My body has taken a serious hit. I'm still fairly petite but all of my muscles have lost their tone and I've gone up a pants size or two (in six months...). I decided it was finally time for a change. I bought this one (30-Day Shred) along with No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I have yet to try Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, but if it's anything like the other two, I will LOVE it. I don't really like cardio, but Jillian works it in with the exercises so that you barely know you're doing it until you're about ready to collapse. I find it much more enjoyable than running on a treadmill. Every muscle in my body HURTS. I haven't been at it long enough to see results, just a few days, but I'm already hooked :) I highly recommend this DVD (and the other two) for anyone!
0553582038|3.0|...that I accidently re-bought this book (with the new cover) thinking it was the next book in the series.    Stupid me.    Of course, since it has been so long since I'd initially read it it took me a good 3-4 chapters of \\"deja vu\\" before I finally had the eureka moment of \\"Oh crap, I've already read this.. and it wasn't all that great the first time.\\"    Long, disjointed, and will make it very hard to follow the next book (well, actually the NEXT next book since this is supposedly only the first half of one big book that got cut in half) unless you read it again when the book does get published.    Not sure if I'll ever get to \\"Dragons\\"...if it ever gets published.    What I'd recommend is not to start this series at all--until it's all done.  Then you'll be able to read it altogether rather than have fragments years and years apart.

You could just tell that Brandon Lee was going to be a big star like his dad. Unfortunately, both of them lost their lives too young.    If you like fun, martial movies, this is one of the best.

B000E41MRC|3.0|Hitler and the Nazis. What can one say? Leni Reifenstahl directed a visually stunning film, but it possessed all the earmarks of the  fanaticism you see today on any one of the various religious channels on cable or satellite TV. The Nazis were people caught up in a frenzy of hate driven on by a madman with dreams of world conquest and ultimate glory. When you also consider that before and during the Second World War, there were some in America who considered facism the wave of the future. Could any sane and rational person exist under such repression? Let's hope we never have to find out!

B001EN71DG|4.0|Maybe I'm not a Star Wars purist, but I've enjoyed the movies and so I have my kids.  Quality is great and I'm fine with the minor modifications.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy the original 3 again and maybe share them with the next generation.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a remarkable CD in more than one way. As I'm Scots I'm familiar with the town of Blackburn, near Edinburgh. It is definitely the place to come from! That Susan Boyle, at her stage in life, could rise up and become a star from this location is emotive enough. However, after having what could only be described as a pretty miserable life it is ironic that it's a song from Les Miserables that got her world wide attention. I bought the CD for my mother who will be 104 in March 2010 and she enjoyed it immensly.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have not read the book yet, but I plan to. Therefore, I am not rating this having been biased by the book. This series was excellent! I was moved to tears about 4 or 5 times. From the \\"Making of John Adams\\" part of the Special Features, it seems great efforts were put forth to create a very historically accurate portrayal. If you've ever found yourself falling asleep in a history class (whether recently, or 30 years ago), I highly recommend this DVD series. It brings our Founding Fathers and the beginnings of our country to life and I don't see how one could possibly nod off while watching this. I believe it is a rare person will NOT learn something.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have watched this series from the very first episode and could not wait for the DVDs to come available. Excellent quality, and the bonus features give an extensive inner view of the cast and storyline. Very pleased!
B0029LHW68|1.0|Man, I cannot believe how disappointed I am in this release. How the hell do you follow up a brilliant album like \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" with this piece of boring garbage? What the hell is with that overused Boys Choir too? One song, fine...but the entire album? Give me a break! Same thing with keyboards - I can tolerate a song or two if the keyboards are in the background as ambiance, but out front? Not my cup of tea coming from a band that USED to rock their balls off. Then again, apparently the producer forgot the guitars in the recording and might have had to go back and add keyboards as filler since there is no full time keyboardist in the band. I loved these guys until this CD came out. If this is what I have to look forward to as far as their musical future goes, then I am done with this band. If you are a huge fan of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", then you will find that there is barely even one listenable song on this release. However, I cannot deny that Jared Leto has an amazing voice and can probably sing over any type of music, but this is not a Jared Leto solo album - this is the band 30 Seconds to Mars....although you would never be able to tell if it weren't for Jared's vocals.

0446691437|5.0|The War of Art was a gem to read. It was full of spiritual connections between God and creative work, coupled with real-life practical ways to work through \\"The Resistance\\" and accomplish your goals.<br /><br />As a writer, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I also found it to be a relevant read for other areas of my life, including my marriage and the daily grind.<br /><br />Even if you're not an artist, this book is well worth the time of anyone who has been frustrated with procrastination and the roadblocks encountered in achieving your dreams.
0618918248|3.0|I read The God Delusion over a year ago.  I recall that everything appealed to my reasoning and nothing went against it, but the book didn't give me a set of concrete examples that could prove evolution even though I find evolution to be the most complete explanation to guide the various events in the universe to produce increasingly complex, self-organized systems [including us].  The rhetoric in the book is fitting to the title.  I think, and hope, that his new book \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\" will be more of what I am looking for without the rude attacks on religion.  But I can understand the frustration that Dawkins experiences when trying to be respectful of superstitions.
1591843162|4.0|Seth Godin is a genius. There's no two ways about it. He has an uncanny ability to get at what's wrong with our current business culture and recommend ways to position yourself -- and your company -- for success.    In this, his latest book, he takes on the idea of the artist. Artists, he says, are not those who work merely in clay, paint, and ink: Anyone can (and should) be an artist in their field. Artists can be marketers, salespeople, CEOs, accountants, and garbage collectors. What separates artists from workers is their passion and their desire to effect change in those they come in contact with.    The big message I got is that my job is to create art -- to generate (in my case) writing that changes others. I need to \\"let my little light shine\\" and be a problem-solver, and therefore I will make myself indispensable.    While I love everything Godin has written in this book, I disagree with his avowal that you can't teach people to be leaders or artists. I think he could have written a much stronger book by giving detailed examples of those he believes are artists in their own areas. He mentions many examples, but he doesn't go into a great deal of detail -- it's a mere introduction. I'd like to hear more about how people became artists (according to Godin's definition) in a variety of fields.     Also, the end of the book was quite repetitive. Instead of a cohesive theme, it felt like short blog posts over and over on the same topic, repeating what had already been shared. I would remove the last 100 pages or so and replace them with case studies of remarkable artists.    In any case, this -- like all of Godin's books -- is a must-read. It will change you, if you let it.
B002OEBMN4|3.0|What can I say - SLAYER is SLAYER and will probably remain that way. I do not find this album any more heavier, louder, faster, more aggressive or brootal than what they have done in the 80's, 90's or 2000's.     The production is actually weaker and I was close to comparing this to Metallica's ST. ANGER. I wasn't sure if this album was supposed to appeal to metalheads, punks, both or neither because I found it a bit lame on both accounts.    What also has not changed was their lyrical subject themes such as looking at the world from a bleak and dark point of view of some would-be murderer and their leftist political commentary of oil drilling, greed, human suffering and how all of it is to be blamed on the American government and corporations.    I think from here on, I will stop purchasing SLAYER because I do not see a need for their continued existence.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Our son got this along with the Baby Einstein fish aquarium for our baby shower.  I will tell you he thinks this mobile is so great.

B00005N6KG|3.0|These headphones have okay sound quality, but two things definitely would make me recommend to everyone not to buy.  First, the length of the wire from where you plug into your mp3 player, to your head is very short.  I am 5'9 and couldn't put it in my pocket and run because it would just rip out of the headphone jack.  If you are about 5'9 or above, I would definitely recommend passing on these.  Second, was that the right ear stopped working after about 3 weeks.  It now just cuts in with static every now and again, which is very annoying.  So in the end, length and quality are major issues, and I would definitely not buy again.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I've only seen the first four...so far, honestly I didn't have an interest in this series until I started it, after months of people trying to get me to give it a shot. Let me say, color me impressed, this isn't your typical slasher series. Tobin Bell does a very creepy charecter, but he's a demented genius concerning what he thinks of in the series. This makes SCREAM look like Disney, I only have two complaints-the violence is very graphic, and doing 8 parts maybe overkill, no pun intended. However, I do look forward to the rest of them. A word of caution though, the images in these films will Not leave your mind easily, they could also cause nausea for anyone with a weak stomache, so if that's the case you may want to avoid them...like a disease.    August 08,2010    I've seen the whole series at least 4 times as of recent. I also recently purchased/watched the 2-disc uncut edition. Let me start by saying the uncut is not much different than the theatrical version-the twist never fails me either. The special features are plentiful unlike the first DVD edition. I do feel that Lionsgate should've retained the traditional clear case/dust cover treatment with the 2-disc. Are there any added scenes with the uncut version? Not really, dialogue is a little different in the end scene, but it doesn't ruin the story, I don't have the blu-ray edition yet but that may change. The plot of the whole series (to me, at least) is alot more impressive  than I ever expected, in part one-the game per se, involves two men shackled in an abandoned restroom and they're trying to figure out how and why they are there, the twist at the end makes my jaw drop every time.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I didn't get to see \\"This is it\\" when it was in theaters because it wasn't playing in my area.  I am so glad that the DVD was released!  What can I say about \\"This is it\\"?  Awesome is the only word that comes off the top of my head because words cannot really describe how wonderful it is!  MJ still had the moves, the voice and the sweet personality.  While I was watching the movie it was easy to forget that these performances were just rehearsal.  It didn't bother me that he performed at 80 percent what he usually does, it's understandable that he had to conserve his energy and his voice.  His energy though is just amazing and he's just so mesmerizing to watch!  I just got the movie two days ago and I've already watched it 3 times. So many momemts in the movie gave me chills, other momemts had me dancing and singing along with him.  I even felt myself blushing during some of the sexier moments in his songs. While it's fun to watch him dance and listen to him sing it is also interesting to get a glimpse of how he interacts with those around him.  He's so sweet and soft-spoken and I especially love his interaction with Kenny Ortega.  I am still sad that the world has lost such an amazing performer and human being but I am happy that his legacy will live on through countless songs, videos, captured performances and most importantly \\"This is it\\".  RIP MJ, your legacy will live forever!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The usual versions of a Christmas Carol are often freightening for children.  My 7 year old granddaughter was afraid the whole time she watched the new version with Jim Carrey.

B002AAC90C|2.0|I don't know what to tell you dear future owners of this cd... Do you want an amazing Queen interpretation piece? Then, by all means buy this CD! Do you expect a great sound master like Queen Rock Montreal, LIVE Magic or Wembley? Then let's all join hands and ask dear old Brian May, Mack and Dave Richards take the 24 track tapes of this concert and remaster them!    Don't get me wrong, the sound itself is very good but the decision upon the levels of each channel is an extremly poor one!!! Freddie is somewhere backstage on most of the tracks, Roger's beat sometimes sounds like he was hitting the mike and, the worst of all, the public is either EXTREMELY LOUD or fades for no reason whatsoever!!!    Dear producers of this CD... it's a pitty for such a great performance to sound this bad! And it's never a shame to say you were wrong and remaster it! We would all love you so much better if you would reissue it in a better mix! You would even make more money!!! Queen's all worth it!    To end my plea, for all those accustomed to amazing sound mixes, it's exactly because the Queen staff is nowhere in this production but for the grand four playing one of their greatest performances!    God save the Queen!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is the most beautiful-to-look-at movie I have ever seen.  The special effects are stupendous.  If you like breath-taking scenery with huge depth of field that goes on for miles, you'll love this movie.  The rain forest scenes are spectacular.  The detail is amazing.  For example, in the forest, there are all kinds of little insect-like creatures flying around in various directions, making it feel like you are watching a real living scene.  The delicateness of some of the plant life is so realistic, such as the tree-seed things floating around that resemble jelly fish.  The luminescent night scenes where the plant life gives off a fairy-like glow is so dream-like, they have to be seen to be truly appreciated.  In some scenes, the 3-D effect was so excellent that some of these floating luminescent things seemed to actually pass by my seat.<br /><br />If there was a slight negative, it was the predictable storyline.  Despite that, it was very movingly portrayed.  You really felt for the tall blue natives fighting for their homeland.  The plot elements and action sequences reminded me of such movies as Broken Arrow, Zulu, Alien, Jurassic Park, and Starship Troopers.  The female lead, played by Zoe Saldana, makes this movie.  I think she is what made me give it that fifth star.  She should be nominated for an academy award.<br /><br />I have a couple of nitpicks, but it should not be an excuse for not seeing the movie.  In one scene, there was a floating mountain with a waterfall.  The waterfall should have depleted the source of the water within an hour or so, even if the 150 foot wide mountain got rained on every day.  Perhaps we were seeing it during one of those several hours.  More importantly, the planet was so dangerous to live on (one clumsy move or lapse of attention would cost you your life), you wonder how the natives could survive.  One slip off the tree trunk, and you'd fall 500 feet to your death (everything is huge on this planet).  The place was crawling with vicious animal life intent on killing every living thing they came in contact with.  Concerning the plot climax, I knew it was coming, and it did:  the main bad guy and the main good guy duke it out in a battle near the end.  In movie after movie, you have \\"casts of thousands\\", yet somehow these two characters always manage to find each other on the battlefield.<br /><br />My final assessment, despite a little weakness in the storyline, is this is a movie that should not be missed--a veritable smorgasbord for the aural and visual senses.  See it tomorrow!ious animal life intent on killing every living thing they came in contact with.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Must have collection. Blu-ray quality is not so great. You can buy a DVD instead. But the documentry as such is too good and we can see and realize the pain that the camera crew took in capturing the moments.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|Ok. For all those who are saying. \\"If you are looking for a faithful version, adaptation, etc look elsewhere...\\" I ask you: Have you actually read Sherlock Holmes or are you basing that statement on your image of Sherlock Holmes as has been portrayed in the past?        Where in all of the stories does it state that Holmes wears a deerstalker hat and walks around with a Calabash pipe? Sidney Paget, who illustrated the stories for The Strand magazine, interpreted the descriptions in the stories. That was his version of what Holmes might look like.       This new version is Guy Ritchie's interpretation and it is quite refreshing. In the stories, Holmes is a boxer, bare knuckle fighter, marksman, swordsman and an accomplished martial artist in addition to being brilliant at deduction and a master of disguise. There was only one woman whom Holmes was impressed by in his life -most of these qualities are portrayed in the new film so how is this \\"not faithful\\"? If anything, it is one of the most faithful movies to deal with Holmes that I have ever seen.       I will admit that for \\"classic\\" Holmes there is no better than Jeremy Brett in my humble opinion. His performance will never be matched. However, that is an entirely different interpretation of the character. I approached this new film with an open mind and was very pleasantly  surprised.       Robert Downey Jr. is, in my opinion, a perfect fit for this role. His ability to reflect the intelligence, physical prowess and sardonic wit of Holmes was dead on. Jude law was exceptional as Dr. Watson. Not some bumbling, moronic sidekick of the past but a true companion possessing formidable skills of his own. Just as in the stories.       Downey and Law's performance was a pleasure to watch and they have great chemistry on screen. I was also very impressed by 19th century London. CGI has come a long way.       The main reason that I do not give this movie 5 stars is due to the plot itself which I will not go into here. (I don't like SPOILERS)  I will just say that though we are most likely being set up for a sequel I felt the story could have had a little more meat on it's bones.  Overall though,  I thought it was extremely entertaining.       I still do not understand why there are so many saying that this new film is not faithful. Is it a word for word adaptation of the stories? No. The worst that could be said is that like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, Guy Ritchie has maintained the true \\"spirit\\" of the Holmes character -though I would say he has done much, much more.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|Though I watched Season Five when it aired last season, I bought the DVDs in preparation for Season Six. What a great way to watch a whole season of Lost. There is something even more compelling about watching it over the course of several days rather than several months. The production values here are good, as you would expect, and a few of the extras were fun, but there were so many possibilities that would have been really cool as extras. I can only assume that they are waiting until the whole series is over to release even more goodies. That is a pet peeve of mine, but I can understand it. I can't give five stars for a DVD with such limited extras, but for the show itself? Definitive \\"A\\".
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This one season got us hooked on the show!  We can't wait to get Season 3 now.  Everything I watch it, I feel I need a smoke and a drink. haha
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is one of my favorite films with Leonardo.  I was not a fan of his when he first came out as a \\"heart throb\\" years ago.  Now I am convinced that he is one of the top actors out there.  This show is a must see.  Yes, I just talked about the acting--but the message of the show is something I feel that everyone needs to be educated on.  The situation involving the diamonds is a real life concern and I think this show, even though hollywood, does a beautiful job expressing it.

1594488878|3.0|Juliet, Naked is about three people: Annie and Duncan have been in a relationship for 15 years and who have long since grown apart.  The third is Tucker Crowe, a retired musician who was big in the 70s (his seminal album was titled \\"Juliet\\") and who Duncan has long idolised.  While very different from one another, all three share the fact that they are middle aged and facing the big questions about whether they're happy with where they are in their lives.  Duncan and Annie contribute reviews of a new Tucker Crowe CD to a website.  Tucker reads the reviews and strikes up an email correspondence with Annie which will lead them both to initiate changes in their lives.<br /><br />I feel pretty lukewarm about this book. I got bored in sections and I actively disliked the pompous, self-centered character that was Duncan.  (Thankfully Hornby also seems to lose interest in him).  The plot develops slowly, seems like it's going somewhere, then goes somewhere else.  The net effect is somewhat underwhelming.  However I really enjoyed Annie's character and Nick Hornby's witty little observations on life in a small English town.  He has a great ear for dialogue too.  So it was a mixed bag for me.  A perfectly okay read, nothing more.
B00049QQHI|4.0|Good movie.  Gave it to my grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  Would buy it again.
0545123267|5.0|Shiver is an entrancing novel.  Keeping with the latest fashion, it is a young adult paranormal romance: werewolves instead of vampires  But unlike many other paranormal romances I've read lately, I was kept spell-bound by the writing and the character development.  The book is told between the alternating points of view of Grace and Sam.  Sam is a werewolf.  Grace is a teenaged girl who was attacked by the wolves as a young child yet did not become a werewolf.  She is fascinated by the wolves as she grows up, particularly one yellow-eyed wolf, Sam.  After Grace rescues Sam they fall immediately in love.  It is as if they've known each other forever, which in a way they have, but as different speicies.<br /><br />The book is extremely readable yet unfolds slowly. I didn't feel like I really understood the characters until far into the book.  This is typically a bad thing - easy to lose focus - but the writing is so consistent that I had no trouble getting sucked in.  Stiefvater's writing reminds me of the northern Minnesota setting: stark, cold, beautiful, simple yet complex.<br />One of my favorite parts of the book is her use of poetry to describe the character's feelings: Rilke.  I've never liked poetry, but after reading Shiver, I want to go pick up a book of Rilke's poetry ASAP.<br /><br />I highly recommend Shiver and cannot wait for the sequel, Linger.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the absolute best version out there. It is long, but well worth curling up with a cup of tea and a Snuggie. Especially when Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) jumps into the pond. It is also very true to the book. Great for the Austen fan in your life!
0393075966|5.0|Professor Stiglitz has repeatedly spoken truth to power. He wrote about the perils of unchecked globalization, the disaster of the Federal Reserves policies in the 90s and 00s, the wrong-footed solutions to the Asia crisis, and the cost of the Iraq War.  Here he lays out in simple, straightforward jargon-free language, what happened to cause the worst economic crisis since the Depression and what steps we need to take to prevent it from happening again. Highly recommended.
B00005NX0L|5.0|First let me say I have been looking for this DVD for quite a while, so I am going into this review with the excitement of having found a piece of history.      This dvd  is a snapshot of a day in time with the Newport Jazz Festival as a background to an era that is now gone. The audio is amazing given the conditions under  which it was produced. For those of you into jazz, I think you will agree that the late 50's produced the warmest sounding jazz recordings...this is no exception. There are some outstanding performances by Anita O'Day, Louis Armstrong, Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Guifre, Mahalia Jackson and others. There are no full sets from any of the artisits mentioned but I will take well recorded video and audio any day...as long as I know what to expect before making a purchase.    The film presents itself in  vibrant color  and I found the shots of the people and places as entertatining as the music.      To my surprise the dvd contained may extra features like biographies of the film's artists and Bert Stern's insight into the making of the film, as well as a soundtrack CD!      If you are looking for complete musical performances from as many artists as possible, don't buy it. If you find merit from the viewpoint of  \\"What did they have to say?\\" ...buy it! You will not be disappointed. You may end up watching it repeatedly...each time  sharing  this piece of  musical history with more people  .
1416550534|1.0|I really wanted to like this book especially after reading so many of the 5 star reviews.  The story never did grab me and the author tries and tries to give hints about Grace's paternity - which was a no-brainer and again about what happened that night at the lake - which again wasn't much of a surprise or important to the plot.  This was for me a dis-jointed read that became a chore to finish rather than a joy to read.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I was pleasantly satisfied with Season 3!  Dexter is one of my top shows to watch and as always I had a hard time turning the dvd player off after watching any number of episodes.  I was surely sad when the season was over!!

B0000CABBW|4.0|The movie Whale Rider is about a young girl named Pai who lives in a small Maori village with her grandparents after her mother and twin brother die in childbirth and her father leaves to travel around the world.  Pai's twin brother was supposed to be the next leader of their village and his death causes Pai's grandfather, Koro, much distress.  After realizing that there is no hope for another grandson, Koro begins to train the first-born males in the village in the traditions of their people.  Pai desires to learn with the boys, but Koro does not allow this, as only males can be chief.  Pai is not discouraged and turns to her uncle for help.  After all the boys in the village fail the final tasks of retrieving Koro's whale's tooth from the ocean, he becomes very depressed and feels there is little hope of finding a new leader for his people.  Koro calls to the spirits for help, as does Pai because she cannot stand to see her grandfather depressed.  Soon the spirits answer and send the whales that help bring their ancestor Paikea to help.  The whales become beached and the village people attempt to help them back into the ocean but are unable to.  Pai however communes with the leader whale's spirit and climbs atop him to try to convince him to go back to sea, as her ancestor had done.  The whale responds and swims back to sea, with Pai atop, a vision of the Maori ancestor Paikea is seen by the villagers.  Koro then realizes Pai's destiny as the next chief and accepts her for who she is.   This movie relates to World Religions because it demonstrates many aspects of indigenous cultures through the Maori village.  The movie shows the importance of family and heritage to the people.  It also shows the importance that the Maori placed on their beliefs in the spirits as helpers.  The whale spirits showed the village who the next chief was, when they were unable to see it.  The movie displays traditional ceremonies, such as the one at the end with the dancing and chanting.  The education and initiation process for the new chief of the village is also shown in the movie, and most indigenous cultures have some form of education and initiation of the spiritual leaders for the next generation.  The movie also shows how important the customs are to the people.  There is also insight into how the modern world is influencing and changing the indigenous people.  During the movie, many of the women smoked which was a big issue to Pai.  Also, some of the Maori people had abandoned their traditional ways and moved away or joined gangs.  This is causing generational gaps and history is being lost.         -Review Written By James Beasley
1416562605|4.0|Adiga knocked it out of the park with this impressive first novel. The main character, Balram, is a chauffeur in current day India. The book explains India from Balram's view point - he describes class differences as well as differences between city and village dwellers. Balram illustrates these issues in everyday, almost folksy, language in letters he has written, strangely enough, to the Premier of China. Balram's narrative is a \\"rags to riches\\" story of sorts. The lengths to which he strives to advance in the world are shockingly extreme, criminal even, but he portrays it all in such a matter-of-fact style that the reader is tempted to accept his reasoning without question. In this well written book, Aravind Adiga's obvious talent shines.    This is a thought provoking novel. I've never been to India, so I'm not sure how valid Balram's perspective is. As I read this novel I wondered, more than once, if the book is offensive or if it is remotely representative of modern India.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|If you read the book, you are going to be disappointed in the movie. So much was left out...including the huge battle at the end (I don't care what excuses the producers, etc., used for eliminating it...it needed to be in the movie). This was a major disappointment for those of us who waited all the extra months to see the movie. However, as a \\"stand alone, I didn't read the book\\" movie, it was great. I can't take away the fact that the movie really was good, once I separate myself from the book. Rupert's (Ron) performance was excellent...I loved it!    A word to the studio...don't make us wait so long for the last two movies...the popularity is fading and you might find you're making a mistake by dragging this out. Let us see the last two movies soon and be done with it so we can buy the videos and enjoy them every time we need a Harry fix. Everyone has made more money than they will ever be able to spend on the series, so why not give the public what it wants?
B000002OR4|5.0|This album spoke to my core.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys substance in their music.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Universal is repackaging the series to include the telefilm \\"The Plan\\" and in all new slim packaging.  The only thing known at this point is that the discs will be in \\"slim packaging\\" surrounded by an outer slip box cover.  I'm guessing they'll be four 6-disc blu-ray cases (similar to the Sarah Connor Chronicles) in an outer box.<br /><br />EDIT:  Apparently the packaging will be a series of digipaks, one for each season inside of the outer box.
B002GZQY6Q|1.0|This album is in no way or concept or a coherent work. It is 14 pieces of music, and I will review it as such:<br /><br />1. Occam's Razor: What an unfortunate title for this song - if I were to remove everything unnecessary, nothing on this CD would be left! This song is just a bit of noise. If it's supposed to put me in some kind of mood, it doesn't.<br /><br />2. The Blind House: This is the definition of a song that makes 5 minutes feel like an hour. Now I love having an hour filled with good music like Tales from Topographic Oceans, but this song has no real melody, and a really hollow, empty sound. The lyrics about \\"Real love/breath out/blind house\\" are very infantile, and delivered in a weak whiny voice. Wilson just isn't trying at all, and it shows - that's the point of it, I guess, but it really ticks me off to listen to such droll, grungey rubbish. With a bit of effort, *I* could give a better vocal performance, and that's pretty tragic. The song tapers off to nothing for a while, and when the guitar comes back in, it feels so forced and strained - the song had no momentum to begin with, so playing this stop/start trick has no effect other than highlighting how insipid and uninspiring the track is.<br /><br />3. Great Expectations: Another terrible choice of titles: Yes, I had expectations for PT, and boy did this album destroy them! The song starts like a ballad - will it be something like the fantastic acoustic sections of Aqualung or ELP's Works albums? Maybe it could have been, but it is quickly destroyed by some growling guitar work. The whole piece descends into meaningless lyrics peppered by gratuitous electronics - quite a feat for such a short song.<br /><br />4. Kneel and Disconnect: Most things on this album just don't work - bad choices, badly implemented, weak writing, uninspired playing etc. However, this is the song where we get an overt, utterly unforgivable sin: Whinging HARMONY. If you're going to sulk, do it in a corner, don't get a choir together and do it unison. Unlistenable.<br /><br />5. Drawing the Line: Well, it's been over 10 minutes of faltering, halting faff, so I guess it's here that Wilson gives us the inevitable \\"rocking, rolling, riffing, rollicking\\" kind of... thing. If he took the peg off his noise and didn't just repeat the same four words endlessly, it may have worked. Instead, what we get here is an incredibly predictable, throw away piece of pop piffle - without the texturing and layering that usually makes such a repetitive rehearsal at least bearable. When the guitar solo gets lost in its own echo, and Wilson actually tries to get anthemic the fiftieth time he tells me he's shutting me out, the song proves just how laughably stupid it actually is. Most songs like this try to keep a fact like that a secret.<br /><br />6. The Incident: Now Wilson realises he shouldn't get through half the album without mentioning the supposed theme that ties these songs together (but doesn't), so he gives a moody spoken word `song' about - you guessed it - an INCIDENT of some description. I guess this is supposed to give some weight to the ridiculous pretence that this is a prog rock epic. Sorry - it doesn't walk like a duck or quack like a duck, so writing that it's a duck on the back cover won't convince me otherwise. I really don't know how spoken word can be made to work on a music album - and after listening to this, I remain mystified. Trying to save a half-baked, drawn out, boring song with some ridiculous high-hat work half-way through is a particularly poor choice, I might add. I understand that Wilson just wants to be loved, so maybe he should make an album that's not so punishing and unrewarding.<br /><br />7. Your Unpleasant Family: The first six tracks are bad enough - bad enough to make anyone who's not a hopeless fanboy run for the hills, I mean. But here we really drill down below rock bottom into the nasty stuff lying beneath. \\"Your unpleasant family smashed up my car/Perfectlyuncalled for...How vile they are.\\" This must be some kind of joke; it IS a joke, no doubt. But then we get falsetto - REALLY whiny falsetto! - and an emotive, droll, guitar solo. Yep folks, we're supposed to take this seriously and get all broken up about this. But families don't smash up cars (unless the dad is Mr T). CARS smash up cars - it's called a collision. What he's describing here isn't an incident at all, it's an ACCIDENT. The album falsely tries to craft all this emotion and depth where none exists. It's all so facile and transparently silly.<br /><br />8. The Yellow Windows of the Evening Train: This song plays 1 organ note for a minute, and adds a second note for the next minute. No more than 2 notes for you! Another song that makes me feel better about myself because I could record something better - and I'm not a musician! Maybe this song is on a mission to offer *less* than any of the previous seven songs? Tall order, but it does fit the bill! Maybe the unpleasant family was on their way to church? Maybe this is background music that was supposed to be `filled in' later, but PT realised the rest of the album was already filler, so they just left it how it is? So many questions, so few answers - leaves us all dark and moody, doesn't it? One thing for sure is that we can appreciate the respite from the torrent of silly lyrics that rest of these songs assail us with. Wow - the song with the longest title has no lyrics - not even a beat! How artistic and EMO!<br /><br />9. Time Flies: Nice melody on this one, but one melody does not an album make. Wilson tried to fix everyone's attention onto this song: He called it the heart of the album, extracted the single from it, and recorded a film clip for the single for good measure. Too bad it has nothing to do with an incident! I'll tell you what's really wrong with this song, though: It's about Wilson. Singing a twelve minute song about yourself - especially on an album that's supposed to be about something else - is the ultimate way an artist jumps the shark. And then he does all these interviews telling everyone \\"Listen to this bit first; it's the greatest of them all\\"??? Unbelievable! Reminiscing about the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix really highlights how little PT have left to offer - and YET AGAIN I ask myself WHY they keep reminding me off this fact! I guess the target audience of this album agrees that \\"the best thing that you can do is take whatever comes to you\\". But I disagree; I'd rather go listen to Are You Experienced. Aside from the woeful subject matter, the song gives us what feels like an hour of ambient waste: guitar scales, alternating synth chords - it's nothing they haven't done many many times (and better) on previous albums. Musically, there's just nothing new here, even though they REALLY sound like they're trying: Even if the melody is catchy and all, the overall feel of this song is totally recycled: it's old, it's tired and it's trite. Throughout the build-up at the end, I spend the whole time saying to myself \\"This won't go anywhere, I know it.\\" But then, when it goes nowhere, I *still* feel let down! Prog groups have found plenty of great places that build-ups can go; but here, it's like PT don't even want to try. Actually delivering something the end of the build-up wouldn't be dark and EMO enough, so instead we get nothing.<br /><br />10. Degree Zero of Liberty: Musically, this is the same as Occam's Razor, with an equally disingenuous title. I understand that this album takes zero liberties with music, but that doesn't change the fact that I wish it did. I really do wish it offered me something worth listening to on any level.<br /><br />11. Octane Twisted: I just dread writing about this song because I have nothing to say I haven't already said. And I guess that statement sums up this song quite well... Guess what: The layering of vocals highlights how repetitive the lyrics are! Who knew? And would you believe it - overdriving a guitar in ahollow, melodically weak and instrumentally vacuous song just sounds silly. What a revelation! This farcical song seems to have something to do with someone haemorrhaging. That certainly connects with my experience of listening to the album, but given the droll beat, I don't think we're supposed to care this time.<br /><br />12. The S&eacute;ance: Well, this song does seem to describe a s&eacute;ance. Not sure what makes that an incident as opposed to an EVENT, but we get the same vocal/harmonic section in this short song that we already endured in track 11 for some reason. Ha! Maybe, because this song contains a bit of song 11, and song 10 repeats song 1, this is a big concept album! Wow, I guess that makes it all clever and artistic and stuff. Too bad I seem to be missing the clever artistry of it all.<br /><br />13. Circle of Manias: I think this song is supposed to be all dark and menacing - let's face it, `manias' sounds like `menaces'. The problem is that it sounds MORE like `bananas'. And given how quickly the menace dissolves into nothingness, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do other than throw a banana. Or perhaps a circle of bananas. Man, I'm hungry. Maybe this song is supposed to leave me hoping that witches in a coven do their thing to a synthesised guitar track? What it leaves me sure of is that PT completely lack the lyrics, vocals and drum work to do anything even slightly menacing or thrashy. So... why try? Why, Wilson? Just leave it off and stop trying to fill out this 55 minutes of faff for bananas sake.<br /><br />14. I Drive the Hearse: And so this boring, faffaological album finishes in a big drawn out ho-hum about a hearse. It doesn't come to any conclusion or anything - any hopes from track 13 that there would be some kind of build up here are quickly dashed. PT lack the courage to match their dark guitar work with any beat or any vocals - and there's no way this lyrically bloated album would close without... more lyrical bloat. But rather than aim for some kind of integrity, we just get reminded that \\"silence is another way of saying what I want to say\\"... So, Wilson, you knew this, and yet still tortured us with lyrics like \\"she said nothing ever happens/If you don't make it happen/And if you can't laugh then smile\\"??? Well, I'm afraid I just can't take that advice. I am totally unable to smile at this album, but I am good humoured enough to laugh at it. Fine, hold your hand up to my face, but I'm still lauhging at you! It's surely better than taking out the razor blade like the album seems to want me to.<br /><br />Overall, rubbish. Don't bother. Stay clear. Listen to a real album like Close to the Edge.l these interviews telling everyone \\"Listen to this bit first; it's the greatest of them all\\"??? Unbelievable!

0307716988|5.0|This is Michael in his own words. I couldn't put it down. If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also \\" The Magic and the Madness \\" By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian. But most people forger that and want to focus only on the negative and what the media says. Michael was one of the greatest entertainers of music history and there will never be another like him.
0446567337|4.0|I was optimistic on reading this book. I really want to see the movie. But I read it anyways. I really enjoyed this book. THe ending though I did not love.   It is a great love story of a young couple that deal with the trials of the amry. I would recommend this book highly.   Great read! I think that I will read more of Spark's books!
0330485385|5.0|This is a great book. I have not finished it yet because in between receiving the book and now I had eye surgery. However now that I'm home recuperating from the eye surgery I'm continuing to read the novel. I really enjoy the storyline, characters, the way Ms. Sebold weaves together the characters and the plot. The Lovely Bones is a wonderful read. In fact it's a Must Read! Please buy a copy today!

His vocal genius speaks to my soul and this long-anticipated album does not disappoint. Pretty Wings deserved it's Grammy award and the rest of the album just makes you feel good. My only complaint is that I wish it were a bit longer.

Hulk.<br /><br />And the military knows it. They were there. They saw what he became--a hulking, big green behemoth made of pure muscle, rage and power--and the damage he caused.<br /><br />Bruce (Edward Norton) has been on the run from them ever since, keeping a low profile and doing everything within his power to find a cure for the gamma poisoning that created the beast caged inside him. And now he thinks he has one, so he ventures back to the States to meet a scientist codenamed \\"Mr. Blue\\" whom he's been chatting with over a secure internet line to work up a cure. He also accidentally runs into the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the two are now on the run from Betty's hotheaded military father, General Thaddeus \\"Thunerbolt\\" Ross (William Hurt), who wants to turn the Hulk into a weapon.<br /><br />They evade him for the most part until General Ross decides to supe-up his special soldier, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), and, once that super soldier proves not enough of a threat to the Hulk, Emil takes it on himself to make himself a greater match and forces Dr. Blue, aka Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), to turn him into something else--an Abomination.<br /><br />Now only the Hulk can stop this new mammoth creature and the two wage a crazy, awe-inspiring war through the streets of New York.<br /><br />It's time for Hulk to smash.<br /><br />I admit when I first heard about this movie I was leery. It was only five years before that Ang Lee's Hulk came out and I knew that The Incredible Hulk was meant to be a reboot, so I wasn't sure what to expect and, really, a reboot after only five years was just plain silly.<br /><br />As it turns out, this movie wasn't a reboot per se, but more of a do-over, in that during the credits it quickly gave the Hulk's origin story and then got into a story of its own without referring to the Hulk movie of 2003. And to make things even more \\"separate,\\" there was that oh-so-cool cameo at the end by you-know-who that cemented this new Hulk movie into the current timeline that Marvel's got going on in the movies, one that will take us up to The Avengers in 2012.<br /><br />What can I say? This movie was way better than Hulk. More action. Cooler story. More realistic. This really was a solid Hulk-smash type of movie that didn't get bogged down in so much drama like the one in 2003. I loved Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Not only did he look the part of a scrawny scientist, he also acted like one plus also did a good job conveying the burden he carries and the suffering he has to go through because of what he is (i.e. sometimes living on the street).<br /><br />There was a chemistry between him and Liv Tyler, too. The two of them could easily pass as real-life lovers. This kind of realism was crucial in showing the sacrifices Bruce had made in order to protect those he cared about from the Hulk.<br /><br />The sheer power shown by the Hulk throughout this movie was just plain awesome. The strength displayed was astounding. The coolest display, in my opinion, was when the helicopter Betty was in caught fire and Hulk clapped his hands together so hard it sent a shockwave through the air to put out the flame.<br /><br />I enjoyed Tim Roth as the good-guy-turned-bad. He's always convincing. And when he became Abomination, the big fight between Abomination and Hulk was terrific: two giant titans going head-to-head, muscle against muscle, power against power. Fantastic.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk was such a great movie and made you look forward to any sequels or cameos the Hulk will have in the future.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

This really was a solid Hulk-smash type of movie that didn't get bogged down in so much drama like the one in 2003. I loved Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Not only did he look the part of a scrawny scientist, he also acted like one plus also did a good job conveying the burden he carries and the suffering he has to go through because of what he is (i.e. sometimes living on the street).    There was a chemistry between him and Liv Tyler, too. The two of them could easily pass as real-life lovers. This kind of realism was crucial in showing the sacrifices Bruce had made in order to protect those he cared about from the Hulk.    The sheer power shown by the Hulk throughout this movie was just plain awesome. The strength displayed was astounding. The coolest display, in my opinion, was when the helicopter Betty was in caught fire and Hulk clapped his hands together so hard it sent a shockwave through the air to put out the flame.    I enjoyed Tim Roth as the good-guy-turned-bad. He's always convincing. And when he became Abomination, the big fight between Abomination and Hulk was terrific: two giant titans going head-to-head, muscle against muscle, power against power. Fantastic.    The Incredible Hulk was such a great movie and made you look forward to any sequels or cameos the Hulk will have in the future.    Recommended.    A.P. Fuchs  Canister X
0142407909|5.0|I found this play purely by accident.  Our school is intending to perform this play, and I was looking for the actual book and other resources that might help us with our production when I came across the play.  It is actually the same script (in a different cover) as the one sold by a script company, but the price was much cheaper.  We still have to pay the royalties to the other company, but we were able to save a little by purchasing the script from Amazon.  Imagine our surprise to be able to get them at Amazon's special four-for-the-price of three price.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Yes, these headphones are about $10.  Yes, they work good enough to listen to tunes or TV while you workout.<br />However, these headphone will only last you for about 6 months.  After 6 months, one of the ears will go out.  Listening to music and TV through one ear is very annoying, as I am sure many of you will confirm.  I have gone though about half a dozen of these same headphones in my lifetime and all of them have ended up in a landfill.<br /><br />Why did I go through half a dozen of these headphones you ask?  1. I am a cheap mofo.  2. I trusted you Sony!<br /><br />Do your wallet and the Earth a favor and spend a little extra money for good quality headphones which will last you for years to come.  I know I learned my lesson... the hard way.<br /><br />On a side note, the chord on these headphones are little short, so plugging them to the TV on a treadmill at a gym creates a little discomfort that you will get used to.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I came to this theater for the first time to see Avatar, also for the first time. The Buttkickers and the Tempurpedic seats were pleasant surprises and both added greatly to the theater experience. It was really amazing to feel the ground tremble violently while a helicopter was taking off, or when Jake high-dived into the base of a waterfall. Fantastic sound, massive screen, bright projection, and a movie so overwhelmingly beautiful it brought tears to my eyes. Definitely sit in the front half of the room towards the middle for a fully immersive view. For those who get cold easily, be forewarned; it did feel a bit drafty during the latter half of the movie.     For the first few scenes, while I was adjusting to the 3D glasses, I had serious double vision, especially in the corridor scene when Jake is first being retrieved from storage by technicians. I also observed some ghosting in the smaller objects floating through the foreground, like water droplets and flowers. However, the 3D effects worked flawlessly after the initial trial and error (with the 3D glasses on top of my own glasses), and after Avatar was done and the credits finished rolling, I walked away in a daze, reluctantly, as if I had left a higher grade of existence. As an aspiring artist, I get out of bed in the morning dissatisfied with my current goals--any thought of finding satisfaction in the mundane or mediocre has been utterly compromised in view of the outstanding craftsmanship on display in Pandora and among its inhabitants.     I have since watched every behind-the-scenes video I could find, including interviews with the special effects team, concept designers, environment painters, camera technicians, etc., and I submit that the closer you can get to stepping into the shoes of James Cameron and his crew, the greater your appreciation for the film will be. After seeing how eagerly the actors wanted to perfect their roles, and how disappointed they were when no more work was to be done, I could not help but feel envious of how fulfilling their work must have been--and Cameron's own work most of all. I am also in awe of the staggering number of technical obstacles that were overcome in the name of realizing Cameron's dream. Achieving this work of art is unthinkable at this height of excellence if not for one man at the helm whose determination, technical expertise, and relentless ingenuity are so strong that solving impossibilities is the order of the day. If you want further evidence, I recommend watching \\"The Making of The Abyss.\\"     I am not one to nitpick the dialogue because in Avatar I believe the actions speak much louder than the words. I think the purpose of Avatar's dialogues is not so much to tell us the story as to provide a plausible context, so that during the most emotional scenes, the visuals, the sound effects, the score, and Jim's compositions can communicate with us using as little verbalization as possible--I think the emotional impact is more deep-seated this way, and exploits the greatest advantages available to the film-maker's craft. If one could watch the movie with the recordings of all conversations edited out, it would be interesting to see how well the story holds up. I would love to nitpick a number of things, but I'll need to watch the movie several times more before I do so. I will go so far to say that any review not based on IMAX 3D is not getting the intended experience.     Both the haunting beauty of the film and the achievement of it's creation stand as testaments to the electrifying ambition of Cameron, who not only shot for the stars, but succeeded beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Believe me, I think the theatrical release of Avatar is far from perfect, and yet--combined with a glimpse of how the film came to be--nothing in recent memory has pushed me to ask more of myself, has commanded more awe and humility, and for this, Avatar and its production deserve the greatest appreciation that I can muster. The mostimportant thing I want to say about Avatar is that it is a blessing that this movie exists at all, and that the more I open my heart to what it offers, the more I find myself shedding tears about something in every scene.    To reiterate, my review is based on my first and only viewing of Avatar in IMAX 3D with Buttkickers, Tempurpedic seats, sitting in an ideal location in the theater, and having watched afterwards a large assortment of related reviews, interviews, b-rolls, behind-the-scenes footage, and having read the first half of the script and published interviews with the special effects artists.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|I think the title says most of what I didn't like about the movie, other than this good flick.  Nice change to the star trek universe but with all the previous TV shows and movies out there where is the Temporal Police? They travel through time righting wrongs that are outside of their written history. Technicaly speaking as neros ship came out of hyperspace a small vessel should have come out next to it tell them they are in the wrong time and pull them unwillingly back to their own time line. though this small craft is a one man craft and the size of a small shuttle craft the 200 years that separate its technology from neros would be more than enough to defet his systems and drag him back to his present.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The Pocket Pal is a quality sharpener and it does a fairly good job of putting a serviceable edge on your knife. However, I get irked by companies advertising these sharpeners as needing only \\"3 or 4\\" strokes on the carbide rods to produce a good edge. These sharpeners work but be prepared to spend more than \\" a few strokes\\" worth of time getting your knife sharp.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor? I would have prefered a no name actor to play John Conner.  The first time watching the movie I almost expected him to say I am Batman and throw a batarang or something. but other than this it is a great flick and follows well with the terminator line.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|the seller of this item has been very kind and responsive but the product itself has not lived up to my expectations.  the first disc of the collection played without any problems; the second won't play at all, saying 'wrong disc type' after endless minutes waiting to load.  and, of course, the third disc played perfectly.  i suspect the problem lies with the retailer that this seller bought the collection from -- and i don't think he'll be using that retailer anymore -- but it still stinks to not have a pristine set of discs.
B0024FAR5M|2.0|I gave this to someone for a present in another state and instead of discs 1 through 5 it had discs 1-4 and a double disc 4 so the person had to take it back to a store and change the entire season for discs 1 thorugh 5!!!  Somebody should check the contents of the discs - I would definitely think twice about ordering tv shows through amazon again.  It was so embarrasing and the person was very inconvenienced.

0446619078|5.0|Harry Bosch, the best homicide detective in the LAPD's Hollywood Division, is also a loose cannon and often his own worst enemy (and all those other clich&eacute;s). When his lieutenant -- a weasely bureaucrat with zero detecting experience -- fatally screws up one of Bosch's cases through willful ignorance, Bosch shoves the man face-first through the glass wall of his office. Now Harry is on \\"involuntary stress leave,\\" assigned to sessions with a department shrink, and in danger of losing his job. Relieved of his badge and his gun, he decides to undertake the freelance investigation of a thirty-five-year-old homicide with a strong personal component: The murder of his mother, a Hollywood prostitute, which was never adequately pursued. It was an event that led directly to Bosch being the sort of angry, driven person he is today, and which he feels guilty for having stayed away from all those years. Freelancing is forbidden by the department, of course, and Bosch has to come up with some ingeniously underhanded, not to say illegal, methods -- including lifting his lieutenant's badge to give himself identity and leverage as he pursues his mother's case. He also uses the lieutenant's name when making official requests by phone, figuring the guy has it coming for being such a jerk. (He will come to greatly regret that light-hearted scam.) The case itself soon leads him into high L.A. political circles and Harry makes some serious errors in the process (and knows it). Meanwhile, his sessions with the shrink move slowly from confrontational to semi-conspiratorial and Harry reveals much more of himself than is his habit. And on a trip to Florida to interview the now-retired cop who handled the original case, he meets a woman artist with whom he immediately hits it off -- a therapeutic relationship for both of them. This fourth \\"Bosch\\" book is fully up to the high standards of the first three, concentrating less on official procedures (which Harry is selective about at the best of times) and more on his own multilayered and often dark personality and how he got there. At the same time, Harry is very much one of the Good Guys and is quite capable to tender feelings for those he comes to care about. The solution to the case caught me by surprise and was justified by the story, though it wasn't very satisfactory to Bosch himself. (Life is like that.) Connelly is also very good at delineating all the supporting cast, both the continuing characters (like the deputy chief with whom Harry has a mutual carefully respectful relationship) and the one-offs. In his more recent books, Connelly appears to have become a bit sloppy -- perhaps coasting on his reputation or simply bored with his characters -- but his earlier work is of very high quality indeed.best of times) and more on his own multilayered and often dark personality and how he got there.

0740748475|5.0|This by far was one of the best comic strips ever written. It brings back so many memories as it probably does for most young boys or girls about how much mischief one kid can get into!!! I have read through most of the the three books but I don't plan on opening them too much to prevent wear so I can't comment on the durability. I will crack open the individual paper editions if I need a C & H fix which are considerably worn. Happy reading!!!

B00009NH5W|5.0|Terence Trent d'Arby, one of the greatest musicians and vocalist to ever create music. I have been listening to TTD since 'Wishing Well' and I knew then, with his singular, UNIQUE style, he was definitely something different and fresh. As I drove around with his 'Introducing the Hardline' blaring out of my car, everyone wondering what the hell I was jamming to, telling everyone, \\"You need to get with this TTD. Its the JOINT!\\" As everyone caught on slowly, missing out on some of the best music I had ever heard, I was lost in his playing ability and his lyrics were nothing short of genius. And, that voice of his...like smooth butter... If you listen to any of TTD's music you know exactly what I speak of. From 'The Hardline...,' to 'Neither Fish Nor Flesh,' to 'TITS...,' to 'Vibrator,' to 'WILDCARD!,' TTD does not disappoint. I love the way he stays true to his style of music and not changing his style for anyone or anything. I like ALL of his cds but I have to say that WILDCARD! is my favorite, and that is hard for me to admit, due to the fact, I like all of his previous cds. If you love great music and many different styles rolled into one, this is the cd and the artist for you. I can't recommend in certain track because I like them all for one reason or another, but if I had to name a few, I'd listen closely to 'What Shall I Do,' 'E'vrythang,' 'Shalom,' 'Sweetness,' 'Testify.' Believe me when I say, \\"this is an amazing collection of music!\\" I am listening to it is I write this review and knodding my head to the genius. TTD, FOREVER!!!
6305841861|5.0|Most of the time I like the first movie more than the follow up. But I think that this movie is even better than the first.   Made in 87' Ash goes back to the same cabin he was at in the first one. His girlfriend is taken away by the evil things that are in the woods. She comes back from the dead and tries to kill him. The trees come to life, His hand goes crazy and tries to kill him, There is a zombie down in the basement. There is a bunch of other scary cool things that happpen in this movie as well. If you liked the first one I really think that you will like this one.   There is more humor in this one than in the first one. Which I thought was cool. Pick it up at amazon.

B001BTG3OQ|3.0|I generally agree with most of the reviews here.  This flash has some really nice features.  The controls are much easier to use than the SB-800, especially the CLS settings.  Expanded zoom and 3 light distribution pattens sound interesting, though I didn't get a chance to use them.  I'd read the reviews, including the caveats about the \\"Flash Tube Overheat Protection\\".  I assumed that the relatively few who mentioned this problem were far more demanding of the flash than I ever would be.  It happened that I got my flash just before I'd agreed to photo a church service for a family member, so I'd get to try out the flash in a realistic but non-critical situation (i.e. a non-paying gig).  The flash worked well until it shut down as I popped a series of shots of an assembled group.  I used the flash on and off for about 2 hours.  The shut down occurred after taking 47 flash shots in 19 minutes after a fairly long session of shots without using flash.  In those last shots I started shooting at f/2.8, ISO 400, bouncing off a low ceiling.  I went to f/ 3.5 when I needed a bit more depth of field, and ended with 12 shots at f/4.5 in an area with a very high ceiling, flash angled up with the diffusion dome.  Those last 12 shots were more rapid, ~12 in the last 3 min before shut down (about 15 sec. between shots)  These last shots may have been at or near full power due to the high ceiling and my efforts to avoid direct flash shadows.    Many have pointed out that flash shut down is usually preferable to damaging the flash, pointing out that the SB-800 manual also cautions against too many full power flashes in sequence.  After considering the facts, I returned the flash for the following reasons: (1) I could purchase it again anytime, but I had 15 days to return it(!); (2) Like many others, I'd never had a shut down or damage to my SB-800's in years of use; (3) Even SB-800 warns of burning yourself on flash tube and/or batteries after a rapid series, but tube/batteries were barely warm to the touch immediately after shut down in the SB-900.  (4) I looked for some leftover stock of SB-800's; they're listed on Amazon for $899!     I really didn't think the thermal shut-down issue would be significant, at least for me, but I'm going to wait and see if Nikon can come up with a solution (though I suspect they'll do it quietly if they do).  I gave it 3 stars because it seems to be a great flash if you don't do events that require at least a moderate frequency of flash shots.

0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown, in my humble opinion, is at a crossroad. His novels are built a certain way and we've come to expect it. His structure keeps repeating. The same kind of vilains, the same kind of twists, the same kind of historical facts, the same kind of thruth mixed with the lies, The same kind of blur between facts and fiction, the same kind of suspense, the same kind of hero (male or female)... except that in \\"The Last Symbol\\", he ran out of juice. He squeezed everything he could possibly squeezed in terms of revelations. National secrets, extra-terrestrial life, Vatican mysteries, descendants of Christ... what could he possibly come up with after Jesus? Ancient mysteries?     It was looking good. This so-called lost symbol. But at the end, you go: \\"what? All this for that?\\" I kept expecting to see a giant golden pyramid hidden somewhere underneath the U.S. capitol with some kind of a \\"Stargate-like\\" portal to another dimension. And with the soul actually weighing something thus having the proof that there is a life after death, i was sure to see some kind of closure, some kind of grandiloquence and dramatic connection where the characters, Robert Langdon particularly, would literally \\"taste\\" Heaven and talk to God himself.     Instead... you have a cheap metaphore serving as a cheap moralistic conclusion. All this for that.    That is what happens, i think, when an author runs out of inspiration but still feels like he as to surf on his reputation. Like the director M.Night Shyamalan with his dramatic 360 degree twists at the end of his movies. The story exist ONLY to make that dramatic conclusion work, thus putting the characters within a narrative prison that they can't get out of. Therefore, it doesn't feel natural. It feels forced. The characters are doing things because the story wants them to do these things.    That is why i think Dan Brown is at a crossroad. It worked so far but this time, readers are catching on. He has to find a way to re-invent himself. Ifnot, what's next? We'll find that the landing on the Moon was all fake? Or that the Moon itself is not real? Again, after dealing with Jesus, where else can you go? Can't really go bigger than that, can you?    Maybe go smaller?

B002XTBE6K|2.0|I was so disappointed in this version of \\"Emma\\" on Masterpiece. Being broken into three parts, I was hoping it would be of the same caliber as A&E's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that was not the case. Jane Austen's carefully crafted dialogue was dumbed down into a bland, modern-day screenplay that frustrated more than entertained.   From language to posture to expressions, the true essence of the characters, from Emma to Mr. Knightly to Harriet, was completely lost. As other reviewers have mentioned, the 1997 version with Kate Beckinsale is infinitely superior (though too short) in its authenticity, and that's the one to which I'll always turn when I don't have time to turn to the book itself.

0547258305|4.0|This is Kristin Cashore's debut novel about a young woman graced with powers. In her land, people with powers are called Gracelings. Gracelings have eyes of two different colours. The novel's heroine Katsa (her name reminded me of how some people say Ketchup) has one blue eye and one green. She is learning about her powers and how to control them when she meets a someone who throws her into uncertainty. It had good pacing, if there were holes, I don't remember them. The characters were well developed and flawed which was nice when the main characters were graced with extra powers. I will be reading more fantasy fiction I think. I'm going to have to add a new category. Kristin Cashore's second book came out this past October, I'll be reading it as soon as I can get my hands on a copy.
B001YV504U|4.0|This is my all time favorite movie so I thought I would get a blue ray version. Blue ray version is nothing special when compared to any up-convert DVD version of the same movie. Blue ray did not have any wow factor when I compare it to other blue ray movies I have watched, like the recently released Star Trek movie which did produce that wow factor.
1400032717|4.0|This novel is unlike any I have read before. It is told in first person from the point of view of an autistic teen. He lives in a town in England and confines himself to a strict routine. Until one night he finds a dog that has just been killed. He loves reading Shirlock Holmes and decides to write a murder mystery novel about \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\\"    The novel is meant to be written by Christopher (our main character) as he searches for clues to the mystery. He loves prime numbers so the chapters are each assigned one. About half of the chapters are descriptions of his surroundings or past memories that don't move the plot forward and sometimes happen right in the thick of things but are very interesting. Short novel, but surprisingly moving.

0439023491|4.0|This is the second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. It continues the story of Katniss Everdeen after she wins the Hunger Games (sorry if that's too much information for those who wanted to read the Hunger Games). This fast paced novel is full of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. And now I have to wait for the third one to come out to find out what happens. This will be a problem for me. The next book won't be released until August of 2010! I can handle eight months of waiting right? This is why I start trilogies after all the books are out.<br /><br />The one problem I have with this novel and the first is the voice used. It's told in the first person but more like she's telling a story. We don't have access to all of her thoughts. She uses phrases like \\"and then I'm going after him..\\" but why Katniss? Why are you going after him? It wasn't easy for me to lose myself reading it. But after I got used to that, I really enjoyed the story.

Carrey plays an amazing part playing as the Grinch and even adds in some of his own goofy personality which makes this movie more delightful to watch. This is truly a must see film that shows the real meaning of Christmas joy/love and will leave you with a huge smile and a bigger heart.
B0026P3G12|5.0|A beautiful voice making beautiful music with carefully chosen songs. Susan Boyle has shown why she won. Her voice in the torch songs is full of meaning and nuance. Wow! I can't wait to hear what she does next.
0470747447|3.0|The Good:  - 300 Official retired GMAT Questions  - Questions are arranged in order of difficulty    The Bad:   - Mostly medium and easy questions  - No explanations or any suitable review section  - 44 new Problem Solving and 31 new Data Sufficiency Questions (a total of 75 new questions out of 300).     --- List of Changes:---   Problem Solving (PS)   - 4 new easy questions   - 21 new medium questions   - 19 new hard questions   Data Sufficiency   - 13 new easy questions   - 8 new medium questions   - 9 new hard questions     The main issue with the first edition was low question difficulty. This edition addresses the issue slightly, but as you can see, not by much. One issue that was fixed is the total number of questions. The first edition claimed (just like this one) to have 300 questions, but only had 294 - how can you make that mistake in the Official Guide for Quantitative Review? The question split is 176 for PS and 124 for DS.     As to content, changes, it is interesting to see many of the tables and data-interpretation questions go and addition of sequence questions. Also, DS lost many of its arithmetic questions, which were replaced by Word Problems.     Overall - pretty much the same book - would have loved to see more new questions, but $12 for 28 new hard and 29 medium REAL questions is not bad. By the way, the first edition is on sale right now The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review for $6.78!

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I loved this movie. The acting was superb, the story was enchanting, and I was sad to see it end.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|For the past several years all the girls in my family have become devoted fans of Jane Austen.  We've been going back over the novels & have purchased ALL of the old & modern film adaptations of her novels as well as random movies relating to Jane (Jane Austen Book Club) & even Clueless (loosely based on Emma)--you get the idea--we've become a little obsessed...  We all felt, hands down that Pride & Prejudice with Matthew MacFadyen & Kiera Knightly was the best of the best.  Anytime someone says the title, we have to pull it out & watch it.  For awhile there it was a weekly occurrence...    All I have to say is watch out Darcy---Mr. Knightly has caught us by surprise & I think I can safely say is currently topping the list of Austen Film Adaptations in our family.    It's a wonderful version--far superior to the old BBC & the Gwenyth Paltrow Emma.  All of the characters are spot on & we have loved watching every minute of them on screen.  I can't wait until February 9th!
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was a little disappointed that I dreamed a dream was a bit different than on Britain's got talent.  That song  as well as others seemed a bit too toned down.  Susan is a singer who can evoke a lot of emotion when let loose.
B00005A0BC|5.0|A great album.  If you're just getting into soul, it's hard to go wrong with any of the classics and this one's no different.  If you're already an Otis fan, it's still worth every penny.  Great versions of classics.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable is great for the price. There is no need to spend any more than $7 on an HDMI cable and there are plenty of independant studies to prove it. The end pieces are pretty small also. This was necessary to accommodate my installation where I had to get the cable between tight spaces.    The only thing that was frustrating was the packaging. Amazon claims that its frustration-free, however the size of the box was a little frustrating. It wasn't frustrating to open the package, just how much cardboard was wasted. I would expect Amazon to pay a little more attention to the environment. It was a pretty big box to put the cable in. I don't mean the box to ship it with, that one was even larger. I mean the actual packaging that the cable came in. That's the frustrating part. I ordered two cables. You would think I ordered a new refrigerator with how much cardboard I ended up with.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like a blond Bond, but I love him. This story takes you to the begining and guides you to understand how he became the Bond he is. He does most of his own stunts, much more elaborate than his predecessors, and steals the show. The follow up of Quantam of Solace completes he image of Bond. Definitely a must see.
B001684L0A|5.0|My husband and I watched the entire series DVDs over the Christmas holiday break.  We learned so much about our founding fathers and how the Constitution and Declaration of Independence came about.  It's great for school aged children to also watch and learn... this part of history is not covered in depth in school books!   Got to know exactly what type of person John Adams was and how Abigail managed to stay married to him and by his side despite his grouchy disposition.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|It's been 30 years, but Bowie's SCARY MONSTERS still sounds modern, with complex, propulsive, interesting, arrangements, and well-craft, surprisingly personal songs with some compelling vocal performances. It does not sound like a product of 1980, 1990, 2000, or 1970, for that matter. The most famous tracks here are \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and \\"Fashion\\", but equally good material like \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" and \\"Because You're Young\\" are just waiting to rediscovered. It's become cliche to call this Bowie's last great album, and it's true that he's recorded quite a few great albums since SCARY MONSTERS - like the BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA soundtrack and REALITY, for example - but part of the reason SCARY MONSTERS is often called the \\"last great album\\" is because it set the bar so high.<br /><br />(If you can find it, the 1992 Rykodisc CD reissue of this album is preferred as it includes four bonus tracks, including a stark reworking of \\"Space Oddity\\" from 1979 that ties-in well with \\"Ashes to Ashes\\").
B000W799NU|5.0|awesome the person i bought it for still loves it the shipping was fast the product was safe it was great
B000VDDDVO|5.0|it is great to have both the color and black & white versions of this movie....
0060849827|5.0|You want the Best ..... SAS seems to have more information and detail than any of the other manuals around.  Well written and organized. Whether it is the larger 5 x 8 size or this small pocket size 3 x 5 version.  You will be surprised at how much information is in the small pocket size. . . .  and illustrations of snakes, plants, insects, and fish are in color. This manual would most definitely SAVE YOUR LIFE.  It has sections on first aid, shelter, trapping, improvising and living aids. If this was all I had I could survive.
0792833260|5.0|Rain Man is a very touching movie, Dustin Hoffman does a great job as do tom Cruise. The movie being a Man(Cruise) Who is thinking he is going to inherit some money from his father,well that doesn't happen as he didn't know he had a Brother(Raymond aka Rain Man portrayed by Hoffman). At first he *Cruise* is very verbally abusive to his Big Brother Raymond who is autistic yet Brilliant. So he kidnaps his Brother Raymond to blackmail and get \\"His Share\\" of the 3 million left for raymond..Anyhow, you have to see the movie. The Movie Features A Beautiful 49' Yellow Buick Roadmaster Roadster in most of the movie, and In the beginning we learn Cruise' Character is an Importer For Lamborghini. So pretty cool Countachs briefly shown. The Irony is Cruise in Real Life later on belittles Others who see doctors for their problems, because of his wacky sciencetology beliefs. Which I believe was his Downfall. A Once Good Actor maybe annoying,became representative of all that hollywood believes in, Crazy stuff.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|\\"Lolita\\" is a true classic of film history, created by arguably the greatest filmmaker of all time. The quality of the movie and the quality of the cast are evident in every frame of the film. A top-notch cast includes James Mason, Shelley Winters, and Peter Sellers, and they make the movie unforgettable. Not to mention, the title character, Sue Lyon, who makes you love to hate her!<br />The only regret is that Kubrick was so influenced by the controversy surrounding the production of the film that much, much, MUCH of the original novel was dumbed down. Including the age of Lolita (much younger in the book) and the general relationship between Humbert and Lolita is left very much ambiguous, even though it's strongly implied.<br />But these modifications do not touch the quality of the film and the end result, which leaves you wanting more.
B0002WZTOI|3.0|Tom Cruise in Top Gun, Good movie, with good Footage, cool Jets. and good goofy music. \\"Highway to the danger zone\\" ? I guess cool at the time. good movie, not great unless your a cruise fan.
B00023BLXK|5.0|For people who grew up watching the original, a lot of them don't seem to like this one as much. However, I love the soundtrack in this one!
0790740656|3.0|Movie is pretty decent, Cruise can be annoying, But it's a good \\"Coming Of age\\" no pun intended movie. Miles Jackson aka booger from revenge of the nerds movies is in the movie, Bronson Pinchot from Perfect Strangers tv show who's funny is in it. some nudity and hijinks, Of course it has nothing on Porky's.
B000002MU3|5.0|Was just listening to this yesterday.  Really good album. Quite energetic.  Peter uses some cool effects on his guitar as does Michael on his voice throughout most of the album. Reverb, Distortion, Feedback, excellent.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This film is very entertaining. There is a scene where a house and a child come out of the water and it is just a brillant moment in cinemotography.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are amazing in this movie.
0312944926|4.0|Good book.  Fast paced like all his others.  Kept my interest throughout. I havent read any book by Dan Brown that I didnt like.
0312539517|5.0|Mallory's amazing life is vividly told.  Perfect for anyone interested in real-life adventure.  Much more than \\"because it's there.\\"
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I am new to Nora Jones and this album is amazing. She's such a terrific songwriter here, music and lyrics. They are not just songs -- they are little contemporary operas. So deft and intelligent. Just about every turn of phrase, musical or verbal, is quietly revelatory. \\"Chasing Pirates\\" is about insomnia but wonderfully lyrical and charming. \\"Man of the Hour\\" is hilarious from the title on. And \\"Back to Manhattan\\" is deeply wistful, a grown-up ache.<br /><br />It's hard to think of a complementary performer. Joni Mitchell, maybe. But Nora Jones has a richer, more expressive voice than Joni and she may be her equal as a songwriter. (If not it's the fault of this age.)<br /><br />This album is a keeper. Every song is full of authentic feeling and there's not a superfluous or false note anywhere.
B0026P3G12|5.0|WE LOVE TO HEAR HER SING,A VERY GOOD ALBUM. YOU GO GIRL. A TRUE TALENT.  WAITING FOR MORE SONGS FROM SUSAN.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Grew up with this one and never here it anymore so i bought it at a great price and am very glad i did. Get you one.
B000001FQI|5.0|I love Tears for Fears but I gave this one to my son who likes this better than me. I don't think this is one of the band's best albums.
B000000W5B|5.0|The only place i know of to get the song Dancing with Mr. Dee so i bought it then i got 40 lics for the rest. Great tunes at a great price.
B001PK47C6|5.0|Excelent soundtrack. I purchase it in vinyl and the sound is beautiful! It joins bob Dilan , Philip Glass and Nina Simone in the same selection. Tastefull !
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Our family loves this DVD. It takes you on a magical ride as a boy and a snowman explore their world together. Beautiful imagery with a captivating soundtrack that keeps you entranced through the entire time. Although there are no words with the exception of one song, my children can't seem to take their eyes off of it. They want to watch it over and over again. It is a holiday favorite in our home.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Truly truly amazing to see that the king would of been even better today than so many years ago...Gone too soon but his legend will live on... A must have!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is agreat CD and was surprised that some critics \\"panned\\" it as karoake-type music.  Susan Boyle has an amazing voice and the story behind her success is very special.  I look forward to her next CD.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Ha ha, a gift for my 18 yr old. Avatar is repeat of this classic Disney tale.
1584233494|5.0|I gave a couple of copies away for Christmas and the response was amazing. Probably one of the best gift choices I ever made. Highly recommended for anyone in boardsports, art, design (of any kind!), photography, and anyone considering going to art school. It's very inspiring and an easy 5 stars in my book.
B002VH7P4O|2.0|The 24-bit files are 0.2dB \\"louder\\" than the 16-bit files. THIS difference may be audible, and detectable in a blind test.    I've taken the 24-bit files (from The Beatles [USB]), reduced the amplitude by 0.2dB, and subtracted the result from the 16-bit files (from The Beatles Remastered 2009 CDs). This lets me look at the real difference.    What is the real difference?    Noise shaped dither. That's it. That's all there is!    -No more Dynamic range  -No more Depth  -No more Headroom  -No more Clarity    The difference between the two sets of files is -100dB or lower (below a frequency of 16kHz).    The noise shaped dither adds progressively more noise above 16kHz (where human hearing is far less sensitive - or non existent if you're older!), peaking at about -70dB at 22kHz.    This is exactly what you would expect for 24-bit vs 16-bit if the same source was used for both, and the conversion was done properly.    These are not audible differences at normal listening levels.    Also the hiss on the original master tapes would be at a far far higher level.    Why so many positive reviews? I'd suggest a few people may be hearing the level difference, and many more people are \\"hearing\\" pure placebo.    What's really sad is that the 24-bit files have the same peak limiting as the 16-bit files. 144dB of theoretical dynamic range, and they still used extra compression to change these historic recordings.    Cheers,  David.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I was not sure if this was going to be a typical Ryan Reynolds movie and if Sandra Bullock was going to be able to impress me with a comeback. Well, this movie had me dying with laughter! I have to say I rarely watch movies more than once, but this one I have played many times and still laugh. I would definately recommend this romantic comedy to anyone!
0385736002|5.0|I can usually tell within the first 40 pages of a book whether or not I am going to like the book.  I was hooked on page 16!!!  The author brings to life many of our childhood stories of witches, vampires, and things that go bump in the night!  I enjoy action thrillers with some science or history thrown in.  This summer my Intern, at work, introduced me to the Harry Potter series and the Eragon Inheritence books.  I loved them and you will absolutely love this book also.  After only reading a few chapters I went on line and ordered the next two books in the series.  Keep up the awesome story telling Michael Scott!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney's voice is crystal clear and delivers a fantastic performance, even going up into his falsetto at times.  The criticisms of his voice in relation to his age are really bugging me.  Singing LIVE is different than a recording studio people.  Same ole Paul McCartney voice, even at the ancient age of 67.  The new songs are incredible.....such a talented guy.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|This is an excellent mystery.  I read it after reading \\"The Woman in White.\\"  I like the Woman in White better, but both are incredible. Once I got used to the style (1800's British), it is a great read.  He is one of my favorite authors.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I loved this movie, I saw it for the first time only recent and I know now why it is a cult classic. It is now one of my favorite Blu-Ray movies.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Great idea and I love being able to play load games without waking the house...except when I yell. the sound is great and very clear. Great that you can adjust volume and chat by themselves. signal strength is great. best price around.
0783226152|5.0|This film and the Last Picture show capture the feeling of being a<br />teenager in the late 50's in the right way. And therein lies the difference between<br />us and the kids who grew up in Europe in the same era. Rock 'n Roll, drive-ins, and drag racing<br />vs. any notion of serious study. It was a blast, and not much nore.
B002VXKYCS|1.0|This is a highly rated movie??  Are you kidding me?  My wife and I watched this the other night and we were astounded that we wasted two hours of our lives (much less the $3.99) on this horrible movie.  Does Meryl Streep do a good impersonation of Julia Child?  Yes.  However, the storyline is absolutely boring, incongruent, and haphazard.  What a waste...it could have been a good movie if it had been done completely different than how it was.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Very professionally done series with solidly drawn characters well protrayed by actors mainly new to my experience, the exception being Blair Brown who has entertained me for years.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Greatest price online and best deal ever for being prime, with free 2 day shipping!  It actually arrived 1 day ahead of time from when i ordered, so basically 1 day shipping, free!  Works like a charm, no problems!
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I consider this to be one of the very finest examples of it's kind that I have ever been privileged to participate in, if only as a viewer.  The writing and acting is almost faultless and it's hard not to watch the whole thing in one sitting.    It is never predictable or tedious and the actors were clearly motivated to dig to profound levels within themselves to rise to the personalities of their characters.    Although familiar with much of the subject matter, I found myself constantly in awe of the truly astounding depths that the creators of the series managed to penetrate.    Although I ordered the second series more than one year ago, I remain anxiously on the waiting list.  Yogesh Pama
0765348780|5.0|Steven Erikson's fantasy epic Gardens of the Moon is nearly as daunting a challenge to read as it must have been to write. However, this novel and the rest of Erikson's series \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" is a significant positive contribution to the fantasy genre. I encourage dedicated fans of this genre to embrace the challenge of dissecting the complex story line; with all of its twists, conflicts, and revelations.    It may be difficult to grasp the full scope of events at first, but this is not a novel to declare \\"needlessly complicated\\" after the first 200 pages. That was my initial opinion, but it changed as I improved my understanding of the world, its characters, and the interweaving plot lines. Novels later in this series become progressively better, and one reason is that you have more information available to analyze characters' actions as the plot progresses. This makes you feel increasingly involved in the story as you become emotionally attached to certain characters and attempt to predict future events.    If you are looking for a plot and characters that adhere to the Tolkien ideal, then you should search elsewhere. There is no linear story line with a quest set from the beginning. Instead, multiple mortal characters and gods have their own agendas, which change over time based on world events. Important characters are not painted in black and white as stereotypical villains and heroes. Instead, they have internal struggles with the morality of their actions and our opinions of them may be reversed later in the story. Magic is not an arbitrary force; it involves intricate links between powerful \\"ascendants\\" (gods) in each \\"warren\\" (magical realm) and mortals who have limited access to their power. Fantasy races do not include the typical hobbits, dwarves, elves, and orcs. Erikson imagines many unique and original races, complete with back-stories and different motivations.    I find all of the previously stated differences between Gardens of theMoon and typical fantasy novels to be compelling reasons to read Erikson's series. Compared to all other authors in my reading experience, Steven Erikson is unparalleled at constructing imaginative worlds, creating believable characters with human flaws and virtues, and crafting beautifully detailed stories with them.
B001NP8PQW|3.0|Been a Cure fan forever.  This video's pretty good, I have no qualms with the performance.  Here are a couple of criticisms I can add to the mix though:  The video quality is good but not great.  HD is not always the same; I can see differences in broadcasts on cable and from other sources and the HD off this blu-ray is not the best I've ever seen.  It almost looks kinda quasi-HD compared to some of my other BD's played on the same equipment.  Also, a note on the audio mix/equalization from a life-long musician-- the bass guitar is not EQ'd right at all.  Not enough low end, way too much mid.  It's not too bad though, you can always adjust for it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|One of the most amazing series I've ever viewed.  Every episode is like watching a short monster movie.  The special effects and acting are top-notch.  I highly recommend this series for anyone who is into fantasy, scifi, or horror genres.
