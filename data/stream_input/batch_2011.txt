B009E3EY38|5.0|I finally got to watch this concert after receiving for Christmas. I was BLOWN AWAY! I am a huge Zeppelin fan but unfortunately never got to see them live. I have watched Song Remains the Same about 100 times but watching this concert in blu ray was amazing. These guys sound just as good as they ever did. I know I will be watching this concert for many years to come!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The story is narrated by Pat Peoples who is in a 'bad place'. That's the name he gives for the Neural Health Facility. He's in a therapy and hates it. He believes that he is in a \\"away time\\" from his wife Nikki because he was a bad husband and he will reunite with her as soon as God forgives him for his past mistakes. So he tries to be \\"kind instead of right\\". He believes that his life is a movie produced by God and he will have a happy ending by reuniting with Nikki (his silver lining). One day his mother takes him home from the institution. He still doesn't remember what happened before he wakes up in the institution but he continues therapy.<br /><br />This is a poignant story of a person who has to come to terms with what happened to him and learn to move on with his life. The voice of Pat is refreshing. He is a very nice person. He is funny and his view of the world is endearing because of his child-like innocence that brings smiles to readers. The narration is so well-done that we forget that we are reading a fiction. The author takes us into the mind of Pat and we start to feel that he is a real person. His thoughts, fears, struggles with inner-self, the problems he face with people around him, anger issues are all well portrayed. In the process, he makes new friends and he lets go some old friends. All other characters are also brought to life.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written book that made me laugh and cry. It left me a little sad but it also left me happy that he found his silver lining. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It is a very fun game to play.  Plenty of puzzles to solve.  Easy to spend lots of time playing.  No ads or excessive permission grabs.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|It appears you do need to have All-play, which my TV does not have, but my Blu-Ray player does. I switched everything on, and it picked it up no problem. Worked great for me.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is addictive and fun. I have not found detailed instructions or descriptions of the various special powers. best part is improving on your perivous attempt.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO WIND DOWN. I  can play the old fashioned Mahjong at .my own pace if I feel like it. Then if I want a challenge, I will try my luck on the timed games.  This APP is terrific because I. Can control what I want to do. Wish more apps were like this one!!!
B001HN6918|1.0|My dvd player simply can't read the disc that was sent to me (The player reads every other disc just fine).  I didn't bother trying to return it though (since I purchased it 6 weeks before xmas, and didn't figure it was worth the trouble given we didn't realize it was bad until a full 2 months after purchasing it), so I can't comment on how this company would've handled the problem, but regardless, the disc they sent me was junk.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|As a lover of all strains of feline and the author of [[ASIN:B00ATQQHJS Vague Signs of Intelligent Life & Other Wickedly Funny Fables for Adults]], I was expecting a book of bizarre humor and didn't expect anything so mild and unoffensive as this work, but as I say, I loved it!  The graphics are really fun and the narrative is camp and unpredictable, especially the episode about the cat firing humans, and doing so with the compassion and sensitivity we all expect from our little carnivorous friends. \\"Bob\\" the cat is one alpha dude and should not be messed with under any circumstances, particularly if you are a human being.  This book is worth every can of tuna you had to deny your companion, be it animal, vegetable or otherwise, in order to spring for this book.  I like humor...quirky, weird, marginally irreverent, and like this work, oddly relevant.  So, just think of your bucks as a hairball and cough it up, readers, you'll be laughing all the way to the litter box.
B005HSL626|2.0|my cousin downloaded this app and is currently unlocking the swords and backgrounds she already has... this is very unfair.. if this is happening with more ppl ... an update on this game would be terrific! thanks.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|...it was still hard to stay awake watching this one. Acting was predictably wooden, and though I'm sure it provided hefty paychecks for the many \\"name\\" acors, the result was ponderous and frankly boring. Read the comic book instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It keeps entertained on long car rides. I am surprised that this is a free app it is so good
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This action packed movie was simply great fun to watch.  Storyline not important at all except that Batman had to get the bad guys.  Almost no romance, all metro scenery and almost believable props.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I look at this book as an investment in my future writing career.  I just finished my second book but never thought of what it took to market them successfully. John Locke has neatly laid out a plan for me to do so in the future. If you want to write or have in the past this is a great book to read before you publish.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|I thought this was going to be dramatic, but ended up being hard to follow with characters that weren't quite believable.  It DID keep me engaged however, but simply because I kept waiting for the fog to lift which it never did and then ended abruptly leaving quite a few unanswered questions.  It appeared that the movie's creator was trying to give this movie a feel like that of &#34;Naked Lunch&#34;, it just really wasn't done very well.  Someone told me that this movie was based on a book.  This movie did NOT make me want to run and read it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was a great walk down memory lane with all of the references to the 80s.  The story was engaging and totally pulled me in.  I read the book straight through in one sitting!  I couldn't put it down.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The characters in this book are well etched, as the book progresses one really begins to identify with them. I enjoyed it!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I'm so glad that Ian rankin has decided to bring rebus back. After reading all the rebus books its like you know him. gripping from page one
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I'm such a huge Matt Damon fan though!  But this one is a must see!  Brilliant storyline too.  It reminds me of an old Twilight Zone episode.... I'm a pretty huge Twilight Zone fan too.  LOL!
B0083GQKQG|1.0|I like Tilda Swinton, but the movie was just boring as heck.  Not creepy, just predictable, and devoid of any action.
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|I sometimes wonder whether Fox Searchlight is a term meaning indie stuff that Steve is quite likely to enjoy. It's amazing how often that's true. My favorites from Fox Searchlight include The Descendants, Juno, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Darjeeling Limited, Slumdog Millionaire, Thank You for Smoking, Once, 127 Hours, Black Swan, Little Miss Sunshine, and Martha Marcy May Marlene.<br /><br />The movie immediately grabbed my attention during the opening credits which contain the following message:<br /><br />AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.<br /><br />Especially you Jenny Beckman.<br /><br />B*tch.<br /><br />Yes, (500) Days of Summer is deliberately quirky. It tells the story of the relationship between Tom Hansen (Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Deschanel). Because the majority of the events have already happened, the story is told in a series of flashbacks from Tom's viewpoint. To muddle things further, it jumps around at random, using title cards to show which of the 500 days of the relationship is being remembered. This has the effect of keeping us off balance; one moment we are sharing Tom's hope that he will end up with Summer, and then we see the relationship already established and about to fall apart. If it had been told in a strictly linear fashion, it wouldn't have worked so well.<br /><br />Other storytelling devices involve the use of a sarcastic narrator, a split screen showing Tom's expectations and the reality, and his discussions with his sister, Rachel (Moretz), who is about 11 years old. I particularly liked Rachel's character. Although she's just 11, she makes a lot more sense than her older brother. She's deliberately portrayed as being wise and intelligent, and her simple advice seems so obvious that we wonder why Tom has made his relationship with Summer as complicated as it is.<br /><br />Why is it complicated?<br /><br />Summer doesn't like to label things, so she doesn't want to be thought of as Tom's girlfriend, insisting that they are friends. Tom feels insecure without that defined structure, and wants to know where the relationship is heading. He thinks that two people who regularly have sex must be more than friends. Summer insists that she doesn't believe in true love, and just wants to have fun.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are genuinely funny. Tom works as a greeting card writer, and his failing relationship starts to bleed into his work. I can't reveal exactly how, but you'll laugh when you see the scene. Another strong element is music. Tom is portrayed as someone who grew up listening to sad British punk bands, and I smiled when he's shown wearing Joy Division T-shirts. He first attracts Summer's attention by listening to The Smiths when she bumps into him in an elevator. There's also a good scene which takes place at a karaoke bar, which showcases Deschanel's singing ability and has Tom performing a passable version of The Pixies' Here Comes Your Man.<br /><br />Apart from wanting to be in a serious relationship with Summer, Tom also dreams of being an architect. One of his favorite spots to view buildings sets the scene for several of his memories from the 500 days. Summer is an administrative assistant at Tom's company and apparently doesn't dream about doing anything else with her life.<br /><br />Relationships are unpredictable, and I think that the movie is using the unconventional narrative to stress that point. It's not something to be taken seriously, but there are a few truths revealed along its meandering journey. I've watched it several times, but I have to be in the right mood. It's the sort of movie that might be annoying if you are looking for something with a definite message.<br /><br />The $7.5 million budget seems tiny in comparison to director Marc Webb's next feature, The Amazing Spider-Man (estimated at $230 million), but it's a good first effort.<br /><br />Zooey Deschanel seems idealfor these kind of roles, whereas Joseph Gordon-Levitt has shown that he can mix comedy with serious drama. If you want an example, look no further than the excellent 50/50.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for quirky comedy, or like the actors involved, (500) Days of Summer is worth checking out.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5for these kind of roles, whereas Joseph Gordon-Levitt has shown that he can mix comedy with serious drama. If you want an example, look no further than the excellent 50/50.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for quirky comedy, or like the actors involved, (500) Days of Summer is worth checking out.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Very good book, because it,s large source for new vocabulary specifically for new English learners, also very good for children because it makes their imaginations pretty wide, furthermore they can learn from it a lot of things with big valium, as example help the others if they need
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Another one I think I'm going to have to buy!!!!  It was a darling story set in a gorgeous backdrop!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Overly flowery Victorian-isms in his journal are making my stomach hurt.  The beginning is so slow going, that I may not have the will to continue reading.  However, the film was highly recommended.  Maybe the theme, which I have yet to discover, is absolutely great, but the delivery is very flowery and pretentious -- not in a good way... ;)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great period drama about changing times in England and how they affected society members. It's very interesting to see how each character adapts to the more modern ideas and grows as a person throughout the series. This season promises to be just as good as the rest!
B001OFJPIS|3.0|The movie transcended two realms, and possibly three and that of the earth and those who were aligned with humans were then pitted against those of the earth but not linked to the dimension inwhich humans reside and there was no ability for their plight to be realized except through that of inilliation,  it would be good if the writers, and then ultimately the directors, would portray a well rounded voice of the conflicts that exist but do not result in the abolishing of connectivity.  Truth comes from everywhere and their were fragments and then fiction, which is sad.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Another Will Ferrell winner!!!  Yes, indeed, this one was very well casted!  I think I might buy this one for sure.
B0000JCFPE|4.0|This movie is very good!  Michael Douglas makes the perfect villian, and makes you like and fear him at the same time.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fast paced writing and a taut plot line keep this show exciting.  I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|wanted to cut her hair.  The horse was great and so was the cameilion, but the acting dialog was a bit lame at times
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Honestly I was afraid that this book would be terrible.  I can sit here and whine that it seems as if the author has an issue with people doing the right thing.  I can complain that at some times the book did something that was fully expected.  However, these incidents are very few and far between.  There are the occasions where I had no clue that something was about to happen, and when it did, I was shocked or thrilled.    My ONLY complaint about this book in particular was several times during the course of reading, something would happen and nothing surrounding the incident would be explained before or after.  Maybe all will be revealed in a later book, but I do not like such big gaps in the story at these times.  I want so badly to explain, but if I do, there will certainly be a spoiler...    Most importantly, I have not grown tired of these books or their characters.  There are horrendous pitfalls for the \\"good\\" characters that make you scream \\"WTF?!  REALLY?!\\" and there are moments of \\"just desserts\\" as well as moments of \\"Holy s***!  So-and-so actually did it!\\"  So yeah, time to keep on keepin' on and move to the next book in the series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am soo soo glad that my children recommended these books for me to read on my Christmas gift this year.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I like the shorter book and I am enjoying reading it. It  is great to have it on my iPad and don't  have to go get or carry a book everywhere
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great book that keeps you turning page after page. By the end of the book you find yourself wanting more. The twist at the end was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this for anyone that finds pleasure in a book that you can't put down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love being able to keep track of my ebay items from my Kindle. It's so convenient to be able to take it with me when I'm watching something and I can't stay home!!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book made my husband and me put down meat and dairy and we are much healthier for it. This is an amazing book and everything he said has come true for us with regards to our health as a result of it. Highest recommendation ever. In fact, everybody in my family got a copy for Christmas this year.
0930289234|5.0|Due to their origins, comic books are not taken seriously in the literary world. They are considered lesser literature because they do not contain the vivid images of poetry or deep, human stories told in novels, however, Watchmen is a brilliant piece of literary fiction and it should be treated as such.<br /><br />The story spans two generations of super heroes and how they struggle to readjust to normal life. It is a window into their private lives in a way that hadn't been tried before and it allows us to see these people as weak and afraid trying to do the right thing (or sometimes just in it for the fun or for the violence). Characters are multi dimensional, they make decisions and have to live with them, they grow and change with time and they learn things and they change the way they look at the world. More importantly, the way time is handled is flawless; about midway through the novel there is an experiment with time where a character constantly changes the time frame while telling multiple stories and this allows us to understand a lot more about how the character views the universe and time.<br /><br />All in all it is a great experience and one that literature fans, not just comic book fans, should not pass up.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I haven't been this engrossed in a book in 2 decades.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  My mind was blown.  I have new ideas I can't wait to bring back to work.  I'm going to give this book to my boss on Monday and ask him to read it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this is a pretty good game. I love Mahjong games. This one is better than most I play, it actually lets you win. I play this one over the one on my computer. Good game.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|My uncle first told me about these books over a decade ago.  But, I never saw them in a book store--I probably wasn't looking very hard--and I never bothered to order online.  So, this was the first book I bought using my iPhone's Kindle app.  So glad I did!<br /><br />There is a labeled drawing of a ship at the beginning of the book, necessary because O'Brian doesn't simplify the nautical terms as he spins out his tale.  Despite the nautical terms and the manner of speaking--that I assume is accurate to the era--this is a very easy book to read, and the pages flew by.  The descriptive writing that describes naval strategy of the era, details of life aboard ship, and the personality quirks that make characters breathe all add up to top quality nautical literature.  I wish I had started reading these in my teen years.  I can't wait to read the next one!
1451683405|4.0|To make it long enough for a book the author had to repeat a particular point over and over and over again. But a very good message and should be read by all.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Enjoyed the movie plot was a little thin Helen Mirren was awesome Bruce Willis was his usual action hero self
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read Mr. DeMille for years.  This book didn't disappoint.  Would recommend for a rainy day when you want to be totally immersed!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is addicting. No one is allowed to touch the game that's how much I love it.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I love this adapter . We used it on iPad 2  and no problems with watching movies in the cloud. Very happy
B0063IH60K|1.0|I never got to play solitare because too many pop up ads turned me off, so I deleted it from my carosel.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|very good family movie for all.Still has the appeal for young and old. Worth the time to watch with the entire family.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|so I had this app for a while and i updated it and ot lost.every thing then todayit also lost all of my stuff it is a great game but a pain in butt
B004EBT6HE|5.0|Ken Follett is a great writer. His mysteries are excellent . I am eagerly awaiting the release of the third book of his current trilogy.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Maybe we weren't paying close enough attention, but both my wife and I got<br />lost about which time continuum the main characters were from.<br />It was just too convoluted to be an enjoyable movie &#34;to us&#34;.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Bought for my husband for Christmas at his request.  Arrived quickly which was good as I got the flu and wasn't able to go to a store and shop right before Christmas.  He was very pleased.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints. The imagery is brought to life with brilliant clarity in this book. I laughed, gasped, and cried so much my husband thought I was hysterical! I would recommend reading this fantastic book before seeing the movie.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Display and sound was great. I loved watching this movie. I would highly recommend it to everyone I know. Star!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I love games and this game you can really have fun playing it. if you enjoy war games you'll like this game definitely recommend this game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who would think a game that is free could be so great. I can spend hours playing this game, the time just fly. I have to make myself stop.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Angry Birds Space HD<br />The least enjoyable of all the Angry Birds I have played. I would never tell a friend to buy this.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I don't usually read romances but I liked this one. The characterization I felt was very well done, they were believable and troubled without coming across as overly angst ridden.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I'm not a knife expert. I have a few and have spent a good amount of time researching all of my knife purchases before buying. I also have spent a good chunk of these last few months on survival and knife boards. That little experience as well as experience with a few different KA-BAR's on camping trips was what let me to this knife when I decided I wanted to do away with my hatchet. Clearly this knife isn't a USMC fighter, but I was somewhat surprised at it's 1/4 inch blade width, this was the first knife I'd ever held with a blade that thick that I can recall. I knew I was getting a thick sturdy knife but this can only be described as a slab of steel, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it surprised me.<br /><br />Mine didn't come dull but didn't come razor sharp either. It didn't take very long to get it near razor sharp however. I may not be the best at honing an edge but I've done it enough on other knives with success and I doubt no matter how hard I work at it this knife will ever be as sharp as my Moras. But it seems to hold the edge fairly well. Anyone looking for a razor sharp, agile skinner or dicer probably should look elsewhere. This is a knife for the bigger tasks.<br /><br />I truly enjoy the simplicity of this knife. Good, strong steel, forged into a solid, thick single piece from the formidable drop point to the end of the tang which extends well past the scales on the handle. This gives it a solid, indestructible look and feel. The handle is just a flat piece of the blade itself, with some scales alongside for comfort. I know most good survival knife are made like this, but how many are made like that with 1095 steel 1/4 inch thick and for less than $60 dollars. None that I know of. This is one of the best deals in my most un-expert opinion.<br /><br />I think the sheath is okay, I have a Kydex one on my ESEE LS that is supposed to be a million times better than the one on the BK2, but after I took off that stupid nylon belt loop thing with the snap in strap and put on a Tek-Lok I kind of like the BK2 sheath. The BK2 is a workhorse that is plain to see.<br /><br />The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it might be a bit thick and heavy and not quite suited to dicing vegetables and gutting fish as advertised. The blade is just too wide as well as thick. In addition the handle is a bit too long for my hand and too thin. It has good ergonomics but not the best.<br /><br />But over all this knife is worth every dollar. I spend more on dinner a lot of nights when I go out to eat and this will likely last decades even with hard use. I can't remember what I ate two weeks ago.<br /><br />And beyond that if you want to spend a little more coin and time it can be a handsome knife too. Look for pictures online, wood or micarta scales, stainless steel hardware, strip the blade of the black coating and give it a leather sheath and that's a knife any outdoors-man would wear with pride.
B007549W62|2.0|This is one of the grimmest movies that I have ever seen.  It starts out bad and only gets worse as time goes by.  If you ever thought that the end of the world might not seem so bad, watch this and you will save the last round for yourself.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|What a disappointment.  After reading the great reviews I couldn't wait to start reading this book.  It just seemed so lame.  After the first quarter I knew I should just put it down but was hopeful it was going to surprise me.  I still can't believe I actually finished it.  Time spent I won get back.  Some times I had to skip pages to just get over the nausea of the same romance scenes happening over and over.  What a cheap way to fill pages.  I really hated this book.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|I have been a Linkin Park fan for a long time. I waited until this cd dropped in price to buy...their newer stuff has been hit or miss. This cd is mostly a hit. Softer sounding than Meteora with not a lot of standout tracks, but it's good music to drive to. If you are a big LP fan, then this is a must have. If you're just a casual listener, skip it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|So fun and appropriately challenging as the levels increase. It's also very soothing and simple. The colors are great and I love how many options you have within each stage to complete a level,
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|Amazing book. Will change YOUR brain too! Not only is the content fascinating, but it has been written in an easy to read way.I suggest you read it one chapter at a time so the information can sink in. I lent my hard copy to a person with autistic children so now have the Kindle version. I have read it twice and it is one of the most interesting books I have read in terms of changing the way I thought about the brain. The future is exciting . If, up until now, you have accepted your mental deficits or those of people you know, such as memory loss and learning difficulties in general, as being fixed with no hope of change, you need to read this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I loved this series and am waiting patiently for season 2.  I purchased a few copies for friends for Christmas.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|A quick read with good sense advice. Filled with common examples we all face. Perfect for the socially challenged and a great refresher for the experienced.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I don't know what those other people are talking about. When I had Stock Android on my phone I didn't have my Samsung All Share app so I was using the free one from the Play Store. It connected to my PS3 just fine. No issues at all. The only thing I used was the DLNA services though. I don't know about that internet service. Seems useless since I have Netflix. I'm using this for my Nexus since I have a Touch Wiz ROM now. I like this app. For the DLNA services at least. Not vouching for the other stuff. LoL!! I'm glad this is free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|From the first time I played this game I became addicted to it. It's simplicity is rather refreshing as well as compelling. I will be playing this game for some time to come. It is my secret haven I run to when I need to get away.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was incouraged to read this series but no plot just a lot of sex which after the first 6 times in one day it got really old for me. No I didn't like the series.
B0058VW36U|1.0|loved  playing this game. then it switched to another language. reinstalled and worked for about 15 minutes then switched to another language again. anyone know how to fix?
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Raised many questions about suicide and euthanasia.  Excellent character development and analysis of  relationships. Very believable and made me aware, again, that situations are rarely black and white. Loved it
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel<br /><br />I enjoy all Michael Connelly novels . The Harry Bosch series is my favorite. I am looking forward to the next one.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was my Book Clubs choice as I had never heard of this author before. It was a quick read and I could not wait to the end to find the truth.  Most of the book club members gave it a 4 star rating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft especially pocket edition. I got it for kindle fire. it is really fun you really should get minecraft for kindle fire
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Scary technology, cyber warfare, spies, distrust, full compliment of characters, very readable.  Tom certainly didn't phone this one in by a long shot.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I never really even got the game to work.. so I didn't really know how to rate it.. If you can get it to work then good for you..
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't usually read mysteries but was drawn in by the rave reviews and I am so glad I read this.  It's a tough read, from a psychological standpoint, but worth it, because Gillian Flynn is a wonderful writer.  Her characters are richly drawn and she writes beautifully and with humor.  But her stand out quality (at least in this book) is her ability to craft a intricate, clever plot (with twists) with virtually no holes and well-hidden clues.  Equally as impressive is her detailed and fascinating portrayal of a dysfunctional, co-dependent marriage.  I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling the book, but this is definitely worth the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved every second of this book! You can't not fall in love with holder!! Well written and full of twists and turns!
B006LSZECO|5.0|My book club selected this book (I hear the author cheering) and it made for an excellent discussion since so many of us have known the characters in the book (no spoilers here, but read it and you'll know what I mean).  I literally HAD to read just past the midpoint without stopping.  I finished the second half the next day.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|It's a fun and addicting game for awhile, but when you've got like 50 recipes, it just kinda gets time consuming mixing everything together, but if that's your thing then definitely give this game a try.
B005LAII08|5.0|my whole family loves Brave! my husband and almost 6 year old and i have watched it multiple times! definitely would rec to a friend :)
B004XMMSZG|5.0|This is a great product! I am using it in an Altec Lansing iM7. There are minimal instructions included, but I got it working in less than a minute. For my iPhone, I just turned on Bluetooth, and used 0000 as the pin number to connect to the dockBoss air. Then when playing a song, click the symbol to the right of the volume and select dockBoss air. I didn't notice any difference in sound quality as compared to plugging the iPhone in with an audio cable.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie makes 3D great and also the bluray is wonderfully done.  Highly recommend this movie as a reference of all others to compare!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I loved this app, it was pretty much the most commonly used app on my Kindle Fire, but for some reason I can't find it anymore so.. I'm disappointed in that.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|the writing is choppy and the storyline predictable, but colleen hoover captures my attn every time. this book was ok.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have enjoyed the game and graphics. It is entertaining and each level brings something fun and different.  hidden objects are my favorite
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I watched several evaluation videos on youtube before buying a second one of these.  I had bought my first Audi0-Technica ones several years ago and found it to be satisfactory.  When I needed to buy a second, I wanted to see if there was anything out there worth stepping up to, without spending a lot more money (not using it professionally).  After watching several videos, I found out that if I was willing to purchase a wireless system costing hundreds of dollars more, then this mic would do the job.
B005IS565S|5.0|This CD was bought as a gift for my husband. It was in great shape, shipped quickly and it was a great purchase! Couldn't be happier with this purchase!

B003D0ZNM4|5.0|I can't pick my fav on this album.  They all seem to be essential Arvo Part.  A worthwhile buy for anyone.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this program! I think it's awesome. The plot is captivating enough for adults. The series has a &#34;spooky&#34; feel to it. But, even if you don't like scary things you will probably still like the show...a lot!
B004UJCYYW|5.0|Beatiful.Makes you remenber what is good literature.Great opportunity to be able to read it.I cant installed the french dictionary in my kindle fire but even so was good.
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|This is a good RedBox rental. You won't get your $1 rental tipped off.<br /><br />The review contains spoilers.<br /><br />The problem I had with the movie is the contrived plot and the massive loop holes. At the beginning of the movie, they show an older woman terrified of the box and is savagely beaten and thrown about the room eventually to crash face first into a coffee table.<br /><br />Later, the family has a yard sale, and sells her box. Apparently, this is weeks later form the old woman's attack, and nothing else happened to anyone who touched the box?<br /><br />Later on in the movie, the box is taken from the little girl and locked at school. Her teacher is alone in the room with the box after school. She is attacked and killed. The old lady went through just as savage an attack, but she wasn't killed?<br /><br />Later, the box is left in a open parking lot for quite a long period of time. At least a good ten hours plus. Right out in the middle of the lot. And no one disturbs it?<br /><br />The father is trying to destroy the box. He even carries it to the Jewish people to try and help him rid him of the demon/spirit. Not a peep from the demon. The thing in the box does not attack him until towards the end of the movie.  But the thing had beat the old woman to a pulp who approached it with a hammer, and killed the teacher who did nothing towards the box other than keep it in a room. But it won't attack the dad who was the biggest threat of all?<br /><br />The father only sees the girls on weekends. The girl only acts strange on his weekends? What about the other 5 days of the week? Did the mother just not pay attention?<br /><br />Fans of this movie will find thin threads to sew the loop holes up. But people with common sense will scoff.
B002AS463W|4.0|This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. The cast is perfection and it shows a common problem in relationships with beautiful men. The issues i had with this was the lack of special features on this disc. Overall its definitely worth owning for a Rourke fan just don't plan on any extras.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I mainly got it to see what the physics was like. It's mindlessly addictive, though you have to be patient and come back frequently at the lower levels. Eventually you get to a point where you stop playing because you have to do something rather than running out of coins. I'mactually not sure what tjhe point is any more but I still keep playing.
B004DM0UII|5.0|The best and widest music selection I have ever seen from any app. Hardly any breaks in the music. Simply awesome

B009NPKTN6|4.0|Really thought the music was great! Tom Cruise sounded really good ,didnt know he could sing.For amusical it was good
B004N66XYE|5.0|Great episodes, great acting, great story lines! Upstairs Downstairs is a fun series for the whole family to watch because while teaching values, it is also put together extremely well.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Just shows you're never too old to love a movie like this!  Made me cry, made me cheer!  Loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a well written book. Very creative. You learn to care about the characters and want to fight the capital yourself. I look forward to the next book

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Has everything I need in a timer.  A list of all alarms comes up at the start, this is helpful.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I thought the first half of this book was life changing. I highlited many passages and have referred to them several times after I had finished the book. There was just enough story mixed with philosophy to be on my level of understanding. His ideas are in line with my own form of thinking, mainly, our thoughts are the only control we have over our situations in which life leads us. Worth reading more then once!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's now my favorite. But in have to know what happens to her mother and father. Or if Peter ever writes a sequel! Does hazel die? I need to know!

B006YZOXHQ|5.0|didnt know what to really expect from this when i bought it. it was very funny,and extremely cheesy. need more films as fun as this one
B00110K62U|5.0|I first saw Les Mis in NY in 1992.  It was a surprise Christmas gift, I didn't know the story and was not accustomed to an opera where lines are sung.  We were in the mezzanine, too far away see facial expressions and it was before they had individual mikes.  So, I left thinking, &#34;what's the big deal?&#34;  Since then, I've been listening to the recording and have learned the story.  When the 25th Anniversary concert came out on PBS, I recalled seeing this 10th Anniversary concert on PBS and liking it better.  So I bought it.  Now that I've seen this production, I am absolutely enthralled with Les Mis.  Of course the cast is the best, but the best part is &#34;being up close&#34; and not just understanding the words, but actually feeling the words with the character.  I've watched it over and over.  (I've now seen the new movie version - twice- and it is excellent as well; the close ups and emotions are even closer.  Can't wait for that DVD to come out.)
1423113497|4.0|Unfortunately my granddaughter already received the book set from Santa Claus so I have an extra set.  I hope to find another teenager to enjoy the set.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It really is a nice app that just is relaxing. It teaches you the basic then leaves you to become a master with your horse.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent job and I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading this author's books. It kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole book.
B004N6369Y|3.0|I'm a big fan of the author, this story was very heartwarming<br />it did lack the usual drama of her books
B000V6I7WG|5.0|one of my favorite japanese films. they always seem to raise the bar on telling an over the top story
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Good, good, good! One of the better listening music pieces available.  I enjoy music that makes me want to tap my toes.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I love the plot behind this series. This particular book is a little strange, just because of the budding romance situation. Can't wait to read the next book in this series to find out what happens! Definitely leaves you wanting more.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|My cousin recommended me this book to me and I loved it so much! I am not a big fan of third person books but this time I had to make an exception.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|fun little movie only payed 5 bucks so it was a steal. if looking for a deep plot this is not for you lol
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book so much the author is good GREAT but what is weird that this goes to the end of the first episode of the show
B00A757EFW|3.0|I wish this game felt like you were at the arcade in the fifties, but unfortunately I didn't get that feeling. The controls are confusing and make the game bad. If there were easier controls it would be perfect.
B005XQ973M|4.0|Being a history buff I had read accounts of the rape of Nanking prior to this book as well as atrocities such as the Batan Death March.  This one went into far greater depth than anything that I've read before.  At times it was a little repetitious hence my 4 rating rather than a 5.  There is no doubt in my mind that this was known to the highest levels of government in Japan including the emperor.  Hirohito's uncle was one of the commanding officers at Nanking so it's unlikely Hirohito was unaware of what was going on.  Mrs. Chang brings all this out.  Yet this has been consistently down played as not having happened or being a minor incident not only by Japan but by most of the other nations involved.  War criminals in Europe were hunted down, tried and punished.  Very few were punished in Japan and in fact many went on to successful careers in business and government.  Of course there are those now saying the Holocaust didn't happen either.  It's become a cliche but it is true that those who ignore history are destined to repeat it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|ok ok i know there are people who hate the beginning three movies. people also verry displeased that lucas tamperd with the originals, i as well. however this box set is great for the product that is available at the moment. people need to relax and just appreciate the movies for what they are.
0446547646|3.0|I love nicholas sparks.  Since I am 40 myself, I liked the idea of the main characters being older and it touched on a lot of feelings and thought I've had at this stage in my life.  So, I really liked it in the beginning but toward the middle it just lost something and then, the story was so predictable that I just lost interest.  Oh well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great if your looking for a puzzle and mind boggling game. I can be on this for hours and never get bored. The levels get more challenging than than the last. Great boredom buster.
B009RWRIZ2|1.0|I have 3 blu-ray DVD players. This DVD will not play on any of them!!! Had to return it. I'd really like to find out where I can get a U.S. version.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|what can i say that everybody don't know already. great ending to one of the greatest hero franchises of all time
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So sad its the last but it was a great book is all that i can say but i will download the parodys
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|The Application works great. It found my DLNA enabled Sony Blue Ray player in seconds and I was playing a movie right away.  Definitely worth getting.
0316056863|5.0|Got this as a gift for my gf she loves it, great book, great actress to read about. Ok done.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I loved every page of this book.  Didn't want to put it down - wanted to just keep reading and reading.  Follett has done it again!!
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.<br />No wonder why it's free, though...
1478230096|1.0|This would be okay for a book club, with 1 paragraph and room to write your own thoughts. I wanted something easy to read that would answer all of my questions about the history of the time.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I am a HUGE fan of Jack Ryan and Tom Clancy.  This is the first Clancy book I have not finished (and probably won't).  I have literally read everything else Tom has published, even if I wasn't really interested in the subject.  He has previously consistantly grabbed my attention, sucked me into the action, made me care about the characters.  Did I mention I haven't finished this book?<br /><br />I have started reading this five times thanks to the portability of the Kindle Books.  Each time I would read for about an hour and decide I had other things to do with my life.  I am truly disappointed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't precisely identify why I am not interested in finishing it.  Clancy's wonderful characters are there.  A complex plot to change our nation is there.  The bad guys are really bad, the good guys are really good.  But the magic isn't there.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Clancy novel.  Yes, I will buy it.  But you might want to read the sample completely before paying the relatively high Kindle price on this one....
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game has quickly become one of my favorites. I just wish didn't have to wait so long for another free coin. :-)

B004WR125O|4.0|I recommend this adapter to Onkyo owners that would like to add wireless to their compatible receivers. The physical footprint is very small and the setup is typically easy. If you have an open WAP, it should literally take a minute or two to setup. My router has line of site, less than 20 feet away, and the signal strength is 91%. It should be more in my opinion. Wired connections always work best for streaming, but you wouldn't have this adapter if that was a practical solution :) Moving on....<br /><br />Internet Radio and pulling in music from my DLNA server both sound great!  The Onkyo Android app requires network connectivity (wired or wireless) and is simple but effective for managing music.<br /><br />Initial setup can be a little tricky, so I wrote these steps to simplify the process:<br /><br />Let's start with notes from Onkyo, “To achieve a wireless network connection, it is necessary to perform the wireless LAN setup. The setup can be done either automatically or manually. Note • Do not connect any other wireless adapter than the UWF- 1 to the USB port of your network-capable AV receiver, as other wireless USB adapters are not supported. • Depending on your connection and the AV receiver’s functionality, menus won’t be displayed on screen. In this case, use the AV receiver’s display to make the settings. • The wording of displayed items varies according to the AV receiver’s functionality.”<br /><br />My setup instructions based on a TX-NR509:<br />1. Turn off the Onkyo receiver<br />2. Insert the USB UWF-1 WiFi adapter<br />3. Wait 60 seconds<br />4. Turn on the Onkyo receiver<br />5. Select the USB button on the Onkyo receiver or remote control<br />6. Wait for the, &#34;Initializing,&#34; message to appear with a status bar (if the initializing message does not appear, you may see a different message referencing USB storage. If this happens, remove the USB WiFi adapter - turn off the receiver - wait 10 minutes – return to step 1)<br />7. Wait for the,“Initializing,” message and status bar to disappear (this may take up to 10 minutes)<br />8. The, “Wireless Setup,” menu should appear<br />9. Select, “Auto Setup,” and press enter<br />10. Select, “WPS,” and press enter<br />11. Press the, “WPS,” button on your router<br />12. Wait for the update to complete. If it fails, press or select the, “Return” button or screen option<br />13. Select, “Manual Setup,” and press enter<br />14. Select your router’s access point and press enter<br />15. Enter all of your router’s authentication information and press, “Enter,” when finished<br /><br />That should do it! All settings can be confirmed by selecting the, “Status” option via the USB menu.<br /><br />Please note that it was never necessary to go to the, “Net,” option in the Onkyo’s main setup menu, which should only be utilized for advanced users setting up static preferences directly from the receiver.<br /><br />For those of you still having problems, power off the receiver and try the steps again.  This is an old adapter with only a limited amount of router channels - (United States) 2.4 GHz band (2400 MHz - 2473 MHz, 1 - 11 ch) – for connectivity.<br /><br />If all else fails, Onkyo has excellent customer service (they have already replaced the circuit board on my receiver twice, free of charge) and you should give them a call.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There are only about five books/authors that I publically and consistantly recommend to even non-readers - The Stand (Stephen King's best), The Seventh Scroll (Wilbur Smith), JD Robb's \\"Death\\" series, The Past Through Tommorrow (Robert Heinlien at his prime), and Ender's Game.<br /><br />I once gave my \\"non-reading\\" son-in-law Ender's Game to take with him on his deployment.  He said he didn't read, but I made sure he packed it anyway.  Two weeks into his deployment he emailed that he needed another copy, his was worn out from use.  He now collects the series and encourages my grandchildren to read it.<br /><br />If you believe in the power of the human mind, read this.  If you like science/futuristic fiction, read this.  If you like stories of children outsmarting adults, read this.  If you just like a novel that sucks you in and refuses to let go, read this.  If you have never read an entire novel, start with this one.  If you consider yourself to be a reader and you have never read this series, you are missing something huge.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Well, I really don't have anything to say, since this is a dictionary! I know everybody knows that the dictionary has definitions of words. But I did use it a lot though!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love these games!!!! so many to choose from. can stop playing it...some hard some easy. when the are a challange the better.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|There is a ridiculous amount of content in this game, any only one world is  locked until you pay. However, these levels can be unlocked for free by getting three stars in every level. If you are getting this game for a young child or you have a lot of trouble getting three stars, think of this game as costing $5 instead of $3. Also, there are probably even more levels coming in the future.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|My review is second-hand. I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter, who's away at college.  She's pretty picky, but she loves this group. She loves this CD and says she has practically worn it out already! That's a pretty good endorsement, I think.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I am a big Jane Austen fan, but I like the version with Rupert Penry-Jones.  This version has Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth - he certainly didn't fit the part of a young, handsome Captain - I didn't like the casting at all.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my LifeProof case! This case has saved my phone more times than I can count. Sure, I miss switching my case to suit my mood every few days, but to keep my phone safe it's worth it. I've dropped my phone, used it in the rain, and use it in the shower every day without any damage. If you're hard on your phone and don't want a bulky case to keep it safe, this is a wonderful option.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version is worth it for Rupert-Penry Jones as Captain Wentworth.  I thought all the characters worked well.  It did have an odd running part near the end, but I still liked the movie a lot.  I wonder why movies are changed so much when the books they are based on work so well as they are.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app is so easy to use. It's like flipping through a magazine and you can browse really easily. This is my new favorite way to get updated on what's important to me.Bye Bye Pulse

B006PHD0RW|5.0|this app is so so so fun I LOVE this.<br /><br />1thing I don't like is it will erase my stuff
B008XG1X18|3.0|It crashes a lot & not all the features work 100% of the time. I have to put 6  more words
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It's a little grainy but it works just fine for the occasional friend picture. Plus it takes it fast and from Facebook I can send it as a picture message.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Read this book b/c we had read many on the top 10 list. Loved the main character. He added a bit of amusement to a rather dry story line. I found the author's style rather dull and lacking variety of \\"somebody said\\" or \\"he explained\\" etc.<br />I wouldn't go out of my way to read this book. I would say only the last 5-10 chapters are worth the read.
1451695195|3.0|This was a well written and fascinating account of the out of body experience by the author while he was clinically dead for 8 days. I couldn't put it down for the short time it took to read it.<br />Once the story was told, a great deal of scientific data was presented (which one would expect from a neurosurgeon defending and analyzing his case).Although I did read theses appendices, they did not have the compelling interest of the story.<br />I would recommend.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Will this one be a movie? I don't know but it is way good enough to be. Like all of his books anything can and does happen even to the main characters. You will not be disappointed if you keep Nicholas Sparks style of reading in mind. I will read this book again like I do most of his books.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This romantic comedy has many of the peccadillos common to the genre -- a ridiculous premise, characters who sometimes act absurdly, and characters who are so imperceptive it's scary.  This movie is a very enjoyable watch despite all those genre problems, because, like all the other good entries to the genre, it gets us to suspend our disbelief and connect with the characters.
B007HO392S|3.0|I bought this for my wife and she only liked like three songs on it & said that it wasn't one of her best cd's but it was ok & she is glad that she has it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|If you read all the reviews you'll quickly see why it's so popular. Once you play it you'll find it hard to put down. Each plague type is unique in it's game play, strengths and weaknesses and requires real strategy to beat. My only issue (hence 4 of 5) is I can't view my achievements. I tap on high scores and it brings back memories of my most devastating pandemics. I tap on achievements and nothing happens. I'd like to see them someday.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My granddaughter loves building with these blocks.  Her mom said that with these and the earlier set she had received, gives her more blocks to use her imagination.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book was weird!  It was a page turner that was difficult to put down.  The suspense is very dramatic, and the plot keeps you guessing at every page.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|good to see John Rebus back - I missed his character and pleased to see Ian Rankin writing him back
0060930349|5.0|This book is excellent.  It's extremely informative as a history resource, but it almost reads like a novel in terms of its flow.  I found it more enjoyable to read this than many of the books in my literature course.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This is a trilogy that I will never go tired of reading.  If you are contemplating reading this series because you have watched the film's and want to know what happens next then do it because you won't regret it :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a marvelous series - one I recommend to everyone.  Somehow I failed to get on board when Season 1 made it's debut, so I am particularly pleased to be able to download it now.  I have watched both Season 1 and Season 2 and am watching Season 3 on our PBS Channel.  It's a blockbuster for sure!
B001MSMUH0|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I was expecting, however, for a bit of guidance in \\"finding my own element\\". I would highly recommend this for teachers, parents of school age children and school administrators. There are wonderful ideas about how to educate our children in here.
0140386335|5.0|The Neverending Story is so beautifully descriptive. It is a vivid tale of philosophical fantasy, as enchanting as an adult as it was as a child...I will read this to my daughter with delight and would recommend it to anyone with imagination.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely adore this game!!! it is very fun.  you get to take care of a horse and be inside or if u don't have one u can.

Needless to say I think you should get it I would give it 10000000000 stars :-) so if your thinking about getting it I would plus at my school this book is 16 at points so I would check with your school to see how much it is at your school ok well to shorten it up ITS GOOD!!!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is great, I've read all the books in the series. Everyone should have a chance to read it
B000I186FW|5.0|Love this Story showing how corruption has oppressed human beings, mainly through Greed and Ego. The Ego is really what they called the Devil or Satan long ago but we have not learned many truths along the way. The Mask represents an idea coming from the heart and intuition, our direct connection to the One and only Source
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The different perspectives from which the book is written is a little confusing at first, but as you continue reading it gets you even more interested in the story.
0374214913|4.0|Funny mash-up of DaVinci Code and Mission Impossible, complete with an Hercule Poirot drawing room ending.  Don't expect \\"all to be revealed.\\"  Do expect tweaking the noses of those who love books and those consumed by technology and everyone in between.  Think Google and Gutenberg in a do-si-do.  Into each life, a little tiramisu must fall.  This is its literary equivalent.  Enjoy!

B003WKOU0G|1.0|I love babies, and my hubby and I have a sweet lil baby boy.  I heard about this video from a friend, and seeing the great reviews decided to stream it from Amazon on demand.  We were both horrified at the way it was progressing and feel that before watching, readers should know:<br />* There is no dialogue, it's all music<br />* There are many shots of women breastfeeding<br />* There is one scene of an actual birth<br />* Very very artsy fartsy<br /><br />I must say that I think the premise is cool -- showing babies from different parts of the world and how mothering is different.  It's done respectfully and the scenery is quite beautiful in the different countries.  But there are too many shots that are hard to watch, and it felt like peering into people's very private moments with their babies/families.  The fact that there's no talking also removed it from all reality, for me personally.  It was really disappointing for us and not our type of movie at all.
B0049VZ222|5.0|i love this show , there is so much good action , hopefullly there make another season , its one of my fav.
B001FE4I6C|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and characters. Wish I knew the rules to rugby before I watched it. I Recommend to others
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not like this book because it is so far-fetched and not my type of book.  Read about 4 chapters and stopped.

B008HTQ28K|4.0|The book keeps the reader totally involved with an interesting choice of excellent characters and plot until the last page.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Like so many others, I bought this just to see what on Earth JKR would come up with as an \\"adult\\" novel since her work for children was so incredibly inventive. As I made my way through the first two or three chapters, I was starting to feel really disappointed - there wasn't much in the way of off-the-wall creations or even action; we were just looking in on the day-to-day lives of normal (and in some cases downright dull) people. I actually put the book down for a day or two while deciding whether it was worth finishing. Not presuming to speak for anyone but myself, I have to wonder if this might be a common problem: we half expect to find ourselves reading something like a \\"Harry Potter for Grown Ups\\", and that is NOT what this novel is. It's almost the exact opposite of HP - where that series was all fantasy and invention, this book is a searing close-up on reality. And in the end, that's what kept me reading it. Rowling has an amazing sense of what motivates people, and a sadly accurate view of how often self-interest trumps the common good. Some reviewers have said these characters aren't likable, and I know what they mean - it's all but impossible to find someone to root for in this mess! Then again, if I'm being honest, their imperfections and shameful faults made them more relatable to me. I HOPE I'm not as morally bereft as some of the more pronounced villains who represent the extreme fringes of bad decision making, but the majority of these unlikable characters are just lost, or searching for they-aren't-sure-what, and taking wrong turns as they try to create a better life for themselves and their families. I felt sorry for them because I know how hard it can be to feel fulfilled, or how hard it can be to look yourself in the eye after at the end of the day. And that's only speaking of the individual characters - the larger storyline of the haves vs. the have-nots was equally sad, shameful,...and accurate. It didn't make me feel warm and fuzzy, but it kept my attention and made me think about myself and my responsibility to improve the world around me.<br /><br />I knew going in that this wouldn't be Harry Potter Book 8, but I don't think I was fully prepared for it to leave me with such a sense of sadness and emptiness where the HP books always ended on such high notes. But real life doesn't tie up neatly, and most moral questions are more gray than black and white. Rowling has capture that brilliantly, and I think (without spoiling) the ending leaves us with as much hope as we can reasonably expect in the real world.<br /><br />Harry Potter said \\"good always triumphs over evil if you believe in yourself and your friends etc.\\". Casual Vacancy says \\"You get up every morning and you try. Mostly you'll fail - sometimes spectacularly - and then you get up and try again the next day\\". I guess, to Rowling, THAT'S the difference between a book for kids and a book for grown-ups. And I agree :)

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My son got a blue-ray player for he and his wife. He has always LOVED the movie Polar Express, so I wanted to get it for him.  All of the stores (Wal-mart, Target, etc) did not have it in Blue-Ray. I checked with you and there it was. I have yet to see it, but he says it is magnificent in Blue-Ray. I'll take his word for it!!!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the greatest novel of the French, and will remain a classic of world literature. This particular kindle edition is beautifully executed. Flawless copy.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|You can't believe the depth and description. I want to keep moving forward to learn more of their lives... but I hate for it to end.<br />Epic.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is a story about non conformists and the consequences of not fitting in.<br /><br />The main character Vienne (Juliette Binoche) is born to wander, directed by the north wind, from village to village to dispense the ancient remedies of cocoa.<br /><br />What's interesting is that cocoa can be used to suit various personality types and even solve sexual problems.<br /><br />As Vienne declines to attend mass, it causes problems between her and the village Comte (Alfred Molina) who brands her an agent of Satan. Through her genuine interest in people and irresistible chocolate concoctions, Vienne wins over her landlady (Judi Dench) and a battered housewife (Lena Olin).<br /><br />The real villain here is of course religious bigotry and the refusal to embrace diversity - represented by the Comte. He gets the town folk to shun Vienne and her shop and to even boycott immorality - in the form of riverboat pirate Roux (Johnny Depp). An act of vandalism is justified as an act of God. Very diabolical.<br /><br />As more people flock to the chocolate shop, including the Comte's secretary (Carrie Ann Moss), the Comte is overcome with rage and jealously and there's a very memorable scene where he gives in to temptation. I personally think it's of the harmless kind.<br /><br />I like the dinner party scene where the characters really savour the food, making it seem such a sensory and sensuous experience. Makes me look at food from a different angle. Chocolat is one indulgence you should not miss!
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|I found this novel hard to follow, and it did not keep my interest for an extended period of time.  I did like the historical background and the ploy to get the U.S. involved in the war.
B000GRUMPU|5.0|This is basically a cut to the chase let's get down to action type of disaster movie. It does not devote too much time to that thing called character development. Leave that for the dramas. It moves  along so quickly that in 15 minutes you will see the major scene where the rogue wave overturns the boat. And then it's action sequence after action sequence...<br /><br />Some of the scenes can be unbelievable - like the one where the hero dives several floors into the water in the upside down ship and NEVER get hit by the debris underneath. Like they say it only happens in the movies.<br /><br />Fans of Fergie (Black Eye Peas) will be delighted as she makes an appearance as a singer who gets swept up by the waves.<br /><br />For film students and people who are curious about how they made Poseidon, the 2 disc is a good choice.<br /><br />The film is made by using lots of sets. Like the scenes where the room flips over, it's actually a box rotated so you see people and furniture falling over. The wave that hits the cruise ship is actually computer generated using technology from some university. Very interesting stuff.<br /><br />There are the usual cast and crew interviews plus a rogue wave documentary and a film intern's experience.<br /><br />I have not seen the 70s version so I can't make comparisons but this one is an action packed 90 minute adventure. Welcome aboard!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A must read! Held my interest the entire time. I did not want to set it down.  Highly recommend if you truly want to read a great book.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this app!  It's better than tapzoo! I really like being able to catch the animals that need to be cared for and caring for the animals as a whole.  This is different than all the &quot;tap&quot; apps and that is appealing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Free and fun, can't ask for much more than that.<br />Definitely keeps you entertained for as medium duration of time. Great for quick entertainment. Pretty addicting as well.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Even if you don't go \\"all in\\" with what it is saying it can still make you feel better on a daily basis just realizing that what he us saying is true.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I run this on my new Nexus 7; it is loaded with features and widgets; I highly recommend this app.
B008X8QCTO|3.0|I really like the game, although I didn't like being charged for the second half of the game. I would have paid the $2 to begin with for the game. The way they did it, charging you to keep playing, just made me feel like I was getting ripped off. I only rated 3 stars because I'm at the part where you use the paintbrush on the canvas and as soon as I put the brush on the paper, the game freezes and I have to force it closed. I keep going back into the game and trying it again, but it does the same thing every time. All it does is play the music. I'm really pissed I can't finish. When I pay for a game, I expect to be able to play it all the way through with no problems!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Loved the Lorax, it has good saying for those who want to cut down all the trees.<br />I liked the unless. It was a great movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easy read! Great story, keeps you guessing right until the end! Wish there was a second book to finish the story.
B00000K3CR|5.0|Loved it when I was a kid and love it now as an adult.  You have to love Tom Hanks.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|I not only love this movie, my boys loved it as well. But, it's the ease of renting it online thru our tv that is the best part!! thanks Amazon, keep up the good work!
B008AU7F3C|4.0|You can't judge an album by its cover, especially the art on little CD boxes. But it wouldn't be surprising if some people are buying &#34;The Haunted Man&#34; JUST for its cover. Naked except for a necklace, and a slender man (don't know if he's a band member) strategically draped over her shoulders, singer/songwriter Natasha Khan reveals herself as an arrestingly beautiful woman. And apparently strong, too -- as the man rests on her as though he were weightless. Could be Photoshop, but it looks real enough.<br /><br />Fortunately, the music inside is equally arresting. While I can't say that any one song on Bat For Lashes' new album is better than &#34;Daniel,&#34; or &#34;Moon and Moon,&#34; from the previous album, overall it's a much better recording. Every track is good, and some tracks are great. Ms. Khan and her band have concocted a seductive blend of New Age / alt-rock tunes that whisk the listener  to faraway lands and travels through time. &#34;The Haunted Man&#34; produces a visual experience as well as an aural one, with Natasha Khan's distinctive vocals always remaining the focal point throughout. Particularly evocative are &#34;Horses Of The Sun,&#34; &#34;Oh Yeah,&#34; &#34;Laura,&#34; and &#34;Deep Sea Diver.&#34;
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I was recommended this book by a Psychologist as I am studying at the moment.  It is an amazing<br />story, the book is divided into 2 parts the first being his encounters of his time in a POW camp during<br />WW2. The second part being about how he survived the atrocities by using skills he taught himself &<br />later developing the techniques used today known as Logotherapy.  Easy to read & absolutely riveting...
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|I thought that this moive would be good , however I was very pleased when I watched it to see it was even better than the trailers !!
B007HWSWQS|4.0|Siegel and Payne Bryson have written a very practical book. One senses their scientific involvement, yet their style and examples are really easy to read and contemplate. There are even helpful diagrams and summaries (reproduced in the Kindle version).<br /><br />The book itself works through some basic neurological issues in children's developing minds, and offers parents some practical tips on how to accommodate little Master and Miss at these various stages. How should I respond to this or that kind of tantrum or other problem?<br /><br />My only hesitation is that the book doesn't develop as far as I was hoping. It seems to me that this is more a useful starting point for parents completely bewildered by their kids' behaviour; it may not satisfy some of the more complex questions we might have. That is, the book works at the level of a &#34;primary school&#34; interest rather than &#34;high school&#34;, and is indeed best applied to kids aged 3–10 rather than much older.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I am enjoying this game quite a bit. The only reason I am not giving it full love is that it has crashed a couple times on me. But it lets me start back where I left off... so still pretty great. :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good!!<br />I enjoyed reading this. Connor sounds hoooootttt!!! Would recommend this book to my friends definitely!!  Will read again
B009VB97EY|2.0|I had hoped there would be some story with this movie, not happening!<br />Not at all entertaining. Handsome guys with good bods!!!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|nothing ground breaking, but if you like straight forward action movies you'll probably dig this. it's pretty enjoyable as a rendition of the comic; definitely leaps and bounds beyond the horrible stallone picture.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Regardless of one's opinion of MJ, the guy was a creative and talented. Classic tunes from him.  Will always be in vogue.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put it down! If I don't like a book in the beginning, I can't finish reading it, like this on it was hard getting passed the beginning but then after that I couldn't put it down!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very enjoyable pass time that grows in challenge with each level.  Hard to put down.  The game is also easy to master...good pass time for all age groups.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read lots of books from other people on NDE near death experience and books from well known mediums.But to finally hear that Heaven does exit, especially from a nero-surgeon was just mind blowing! I've always believed in Heaven, now maybe the rest of the world will too.  If you are a doughter, read this book.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Did not realize this was a teen flick when I ordered this one. That being said, for a teen movie it was quite enjoyable. The plot line was good, the acting was passable and I wanted to stick around for the ending.
B004G600A4|5.0|The movie showed up in time for Christmas Eve movie night and so far even with the repeated views still works great!!
0765325950|5.0|Excellent work team Jordan!<br /><br />This book is full of surprises, not the least of which is the final set tweaks to some of the characters themselves. A few events in some threads are not fully clear on the first read, and not all questions are answered definitively, but it brings a fascinating close to a truly vast collection of characters. In reading reviews of the series, some people prefer the drama, some the action, and this is much more like 4, 5, 11, and 13 than 2, 6, 8-10, though it is hard to characterize books on a single scale.<br /><br />In re-reading the series for the third time in preparation for the final book, I found that the quieter books took on more significance and interest. Perhaps these books which were much more interesting on re-reading will grow in stature and the more active ones will be less so. Nonetheless, I think A Memory of Light will rank in my top 5 WOT books for a long time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Seaon 3 is just as good as the previous seasons. Absolutely one of the best drama miniseries  ever, if not the best!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved this movie and had to have the DVD - have not watch this dvd yet - but know I will be pleased!

B006QS0PF0|5.0|I'm going to be really honest right now.  When I asked Allison @ The Book Wheel for a \\"U\\"-titled suggestion in order to complete my A-Z Book Challenge, I was kind of underwhelmed about the idea of reading Unbearable Lightness by Portia de Rossi, the actress that I basically have no idea about except for the fact that she's married to Ellen.<br /><br />I was so wrong about my first impressions of this book.  It was REALLY good.<br /><br />Portia de Rossi (born Amanda Rogers, a name so boring and common that she wanted to change it in order to be unique) started out as a model then turned actress.  From the time she was a young teenager, Portia battled with weight issues, dealing with forms of anorexia, bulimia, and extreme exercise and dieting.<br /><br />She also was a closeted homosexual, hating basically everything about herself.  But she knew it would be better once she reached that \\"perfect\\" weight.<br /><br />Portia de Rossi really let you inside her mind for this novel.  I've read books about eating disorders before, but I have to say, this is the first book where I UNDERSTOOD what was really going on inside the mind of someone with a severe eating disorder.  She gave me a viewpoint that I hadn't received before, and it was enlightening.<br /><br />And the Epilogue was really good, discussing issues with dieting and her path to healing.  Don't skip it if you read the book.<br /><br />The only thing I would warn you is that if you personally have battled an eating disorder, be careful about choosing to read this book.  I felt like I understood Portia's rationale, which could be challenging for someone who has dealt with an eating disorder, maybe even at some points reminding you as to why you felt that way in the first place.  Read a sample first before making the decision to read Unbearable Lightness.<br /><br />I loved this book, and sped through it.  I really connected with it as a woman, since we are all thrown images of \\"perfect\\" women all the time.  Should I gain weight?  Lose weight?  Have some plastic surgery?  Go to the gym?  Eat that cookie?  Eat the vegetables?<br /><br />Portia was able to find happiness and acceptance.  And I know that once we're all happy with ourselves as we are, then we can find the same.<br /><br />Let's build some self esteem here: What do you love about yourself?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Bookd I gain weight?  Lose weight?  Have some plastic surgery?  Go to the gym?  Eat that cookie?  Eat the vegetables?<br /><br />Portia was able to find happiness and acceptance.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Oh how I love this game. It really has some good stuff it even looks like Battlefield 3. It should be a 2013 best game awards. And it also has new gadgets and game modes that are unknown to man so now I'll play this everyday.

B0036UMM84|5.0|This show illustrates that love doesn't conquer everything.  Some of lifes problems must be faced alone, even though the one who lovesyou can cheer you on, you must battle your own demons.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If I could give this a 4.5 star rating, I would.  I enjoyed &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; because it kept me guessing until the end.  Why the 4.5 rather than 5...well, I reserve 5 stars for books that are all around classics...great story line, great ending and superbly written.  I thoroughly enjoy Kate Morton novels, but I would consider her books to be quick and easy reads.  Nothing wrong with that.  Just to give you a sense of my enjoyment level...I bought this in Kindle version, but I will be buying a hard copy for my &#34;favorites&#34; library.  I put books in my library that I want others to read, that I pass along to friends.  I believe if you are into this genre, you should give this book a go, you won't be disappointed.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|The problem with this movie is that it is not very good. From the moment that the heavily recruited player shows himself to be a first class jerk and insults the kid who THROWS him a bag of peanuts you know exactly where this movie is heading.  The lines of plot are so clear and foreshadowed that the end can be predicted within the first 30 minutes.  The baseball talk is less sophisticated than that found in The Sandlot and overall is a third class effort.  Bull Durham had a lot of chick-flickiness as well but you could tell that it was written by someone who knew and loved baseball.  This movie is a weak backhand rebuttal to Moneyball and I have to admit, the minute I finished this movie, I had to watch a few scene selections from Moneyball to get the taste out of my mouth.  There are some sweet moments but  I am pretty sure that if the characters in the movie were to walk into this movie, they would snort and walk out.  Excellent baseball movies may be romantic but they are not allowed to be sentimental.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is one of my favorite games on my kindle fire.<br />It is a fun game that you can buy in game items with real money. You can get stuff from friends and help them too. Over all, it is a very fun game.

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really like the game but now it's froze on the part that I'm on. Can still go places but can't complete hooking the hook onto the car. Action does not work. That gets fixed and I could give it 5 stars.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I love historical fiction and this one keeps you mystified.  Very nice characters.  I am recommending it to my girlfriends and my two grown daughters.  My daughters and I LOVED The Forgotten Garden (also by Kate Morton), so this was a nice 2nd read!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! I can't stop playing it. The moves are simple to remember which is why I can't put it down.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Lots of traveling and Western motifs, which was alright. Too much \\"mystery\\" about hidden identities, never really resolved. Too much philosophy overall, almost like it was trying to make you a cynic.<br /><br />Time passed awkwardly, I never knew how long certain actions took. Also the Kindle version has lots of formatting errors with the quotations and a few typos. Kind of annoying, FYI.<br /><br />I've read all of Abercrombie's work, and enjoyed them all, Blade Itself and Best Served Cold the best. They are the action movies of fantasy books, if I may. And let's just say the story isn't over. I imagine a book 7 coming soon, to tie them all together or introduce yet another set of characters, and New locations. Seems to be his style.
B004WR125O|5.0|It took me about 5 minutes to connect this product to my network.  Very easy set-up and I was listening to internet radio within 10 minutes of plugging it in.  I connected to my new Onkyo TX NR-717.  There is a great instructional video that shows you exactly how to set it up on YouTube.  I really do think this should be built into/come with the receiver.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|YOU JUST MUST BUY IT!!ithis is an amazing-collectible soundtrack!the case is really beautifull and looks like old book!<br />inside-outside its a piece of art!!!thank you Howard Shore!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I will just cover the lesson on gun control since others have skillful reviewed the movie already. Citizens have short range shotguns that are only good against the common unarmed street thug. The police, who are corrupt, have single shot pistols that leave the citizen at their mercy. And above that is the mayor's thugs who have machine guns. They are gods due to their superior firepower. Previous and current administrations would love to set up this very situation in real life and I hope this movie makes the results obvious.
0062200909|5.0|its an amazing product that all the hobbit-lord of the rings fans must have!also i think is very collectable!<br />thanks WETA!thanks AMAZON!
0297851527|5.0|This was a great book, kept me reading to the final page, and I thrilled the plot was so well planned out.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|About a few weeks ago I got my self the nook hd tablet for my bday(happy bday to me! ) and I wanted to find a good book to read.. If any one who knows me... knows that Im not a big fan of reading, so it takes me a while before I find a book worth reading... To be honest.. I downloaded this book by accident.. I thought I was downloading another book.. But OMG! Im glad I downloaded this book instead.. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!! From the begining to end of this book I was on the edge of my seat reading.. It felt like I was watching a movie.. I really do feel like this series (The Sorcerer's Ring) is going to be my favorite!!! This was the 1st book I read on my nook.. and I want my 2nd book to be book #2 of The Sorcerer's Ring!!!! I just finished book #1 this morning and I just cant wait to read book #2!!!.. Morgan Rice truely has me as a new fan of his books!!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|Very hopeful book -  after reading it, I passed it along to a family who is dealing with grief.  I felt like it could be a comforting book to think about the idea of their loved one in a better place.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It is fun and addicting!<br /> When I start playing I can't quit until my eyes get too tired! I like it a lot!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If I were to ever have a dog, Enzo would be it!  This was a very good book, loved it.  If you are unfamiliar with car racing, you might even learn a thing or two about the sport.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Definitely better than the original this version has high production values, good acting and lots of action. I especially enjoyed the red herring with the woman passing through security...fun and a nod to the original.  The Director's version was unnecessary, in my opinion, simply statements of the obvious and a not so surprising relationship.  I was extremely glad I purchased the movie sight unseen since I missed it at the theaters because it was gone so quickly.  Better than many of the other movie offerings of 2012!
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|This was an amazing movie,im glad they stuck with storyline instead of messing it up.I love the creativity in the monsters &surroundings.this was so good in theatres.wish it came out sooner
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun to play it is totally worth downloading and there's hardly ever ads that show up:)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Beautiful scenery. The games are a little easy but the story line is very interesting. I would definitely try another game from this company.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|... I didn't bother to check whether the third book was available yet. I mean, to me, when it says \\"first book in The Century trilogy\\" or \\"second book in the Century trilogy,\\" that implies that the trilogy already exists. (What if something horrible happens and he never finishes Book 3?) Silly me. So now I'm about to finish Book 2 of a VERY lengthy, VERY intense, VERY complex three-part series - and when I went looking for Book 3 tonight, I learn it's not going to be published UNTIL 2014! Which means I will have to re-read Books 1 and 2 before I can read it, because who the @#$% will remember all those details for more than a year??? Sheesh. (I had to re-read all the Harry Potter books when the last one finally came out, too - but that didn't seem quite the investment that this project will be.) ANYway... loved both books; just wish I'd paid closer attention and waited for the third to be available.
0143113100|4.0|The book itself was an intriguing read. It got me started in my interests in neuropsychology. Aside from the contents of the book, I was a little bit disappointed in the condition. It wasn't bad by any means, just the cover looked like it had a crease in the corner. Not a big deal, still very readable. The shipping was adequate.
B000IDGDPA|2.0|I didn't like Helen Hunt being cast in this part. She is a good actress but I didn't feel she looked the part of the  character. I would rather have seen someone more attractive - Helen is too bony and plain.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I think it is a really fun take on the Sherlock Holmes/Watson story. It took a couple episodes for the chemistry to develop between the two but now I really enjoy the dynamic.  Good casting too.
B006G2124E|5.0|A fabulous movie that was perfectly cast, acted, and directed. I read the book and saw the movie twice. I recommended it to everyone I knew. The perfect movie for dialogue lovers.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors; his characters are reminiscent of the TV show  &#34;24&#34; in.that the main character<br />is invincible in the face of all odd. Thank goodness he's on &#34;our&#34; side!<br /><br />.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Even though the whole series leads up to this particular ending it was alright. Still think she should have ended up with Gale.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing! Excellent to get a set at the price I paid. If you are intersted in the Hunger Games at alll....you should really get the set....the story just continues to get better and better.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the greatest book ever. I think that's all that needs to be said about it. Read this book!
0425263908|4.0|At first I was skeptical about reading this book since I read 50 shades and didn't really enjoy it, however I liked \\"Bared to you\\" a whole lot more. I say this because to me \\"bared to you\\" seemed MORE realistic than 50.. the characters had more depth and more substance than Christan Grey and his girl.. (can't recall her name!) Day is a well seasoned author and it shows with the writting style that was used in the book. Now don't get me wrong E.L James did well but Day trumped her attemtps and showed her what a seasoned author can do when given the chance to create a well put together book.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I found this story line tedious and very repetitive. I found the storyline extremely boring. I think Rowling should stay with fantasy which she is exceptional at. I would not recommend this to anyone and wish I could get a refund.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Loved the story line and the acting.  Period costumes were delightful, and plot was superb.<br />Would recommend to all my friends.
1402712367|4.0|I ordered this book for a gift, but I didn't realize that it was the shortened version.  That's probably better for the intended receiver, but I was hoping for the full-length book.  Otherwise, I am perfectly satisfied.
B0026772N8|4.0|I purchased this on Amazon as an e-book to read on my iPad mini through the Kindle app. It reads very nicely and if you're the existential, adventurous wonderlust type like me then you'll definitely like having this one in your bag to draw inspiration from the words and the message. It's a timeless novel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a great ending, but it leaves me wanting more. I am sad that it has ended and want to know what happens next.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|The series is of the type that I don't usually like, but for some reason I really love the show. It's really smart even if the story lines are very formulaic, unrealistic and slightly shallow. The show is what it is. It's meant to be fun and easy to watch. It's very suspenseful and addictive and you'll find yourself thinking about how the next show might begin and continue the series. There are lots of twists and turns and it's worth the money when you buy the seasons here on Amazon to watch at a marathon's pace on your Roku.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Grand kids asked if they could order.  They have spent countless hours enjoying it.  Easy to download and update. They will be teaching me soon
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Lame, lame, lame! &quot;Connect anytime to any tv, no wires needed&quot;... yea only if you have wireless internet, and a compatible tv! This app is virtually useless, specially since 90% of smart phones come preinstalled with dlna software.. BOO, uninstall!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed this game!  It was challenging but not so hard that I gave up.  The graphics were awesome!
B00004YB9Y|5.0|I bought it a bit later in the season and it didn't come until after Christmas. I know though I will love it.
B0060D123K|5.0|This movie has become a Christmas tradition at our house ever since it first came out. It can entertain all ages and, make watching a &#34;Timeless Classic&#34;, a real family event. We LOVE this movie! Now that VCR has been replaced by DVD we have upgraded. We will continue to keep around in whatever format comes, next so that through the years we can sit down on Christmas day and remember what Christmas is for.
B001CDLAT4|4.0|good photography and good quility movie. I enjoyed it before, decide to have it in my album archive. I reccomended for general public
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it really kept me wanting to keep reading until the very end. I related a lot to the characters, since I'm sure most of us have felt the way they feel, depressed, at some point in our lives. I admit, I never would have known about the book if it wasn't for the movie coming out, but I'm glad I decided to look further into this wonderful author. I definitely recommend everyone give this book a read, it was emotional and raw and beautiful in its own way.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I may be too old to be reading this book, but I enjoyed it anyway.  Matilda is the kind of child you are always going to root for.  You never doubt her ability to conquer any obstacle that comes her way, and I didn't.  If you want a book to read just for the heck of it, this is a great story with character-building buit in.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Of course it was wonderful! Our family will enjoy these classics for a long time. \\"No time for love, Dr. Jones.\\"
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Very touching... I cried... The fact that it's based on true story made it more memorable. We just wished that somebody took care of the dog, like gave him a bath & shelter every night.
B004QX07G4|3.0|First, I LOVE Ellen, she is a genius and I love her wit and huge heart. Her brilliance always surprises me which is why this book was a disappointment. I guess I expected too much. . I felt like through the entire read that she was just dropping words only to fill the pages, it felt rushed and crammed. All in all the best of the best of the book is on the very last page which I did enjoy, (most of it)<br /><br />Cheers
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I am not a big TV watcher, but from the first episode I saw of Dexter I have been hooked!! I started with Season 7 and am so glad that all of the previous Seasons are available. I will be ordering them one by one to get caught up for sure!! I do not have Showtime, so I am unable to watch it. I did download the very 1st show of Season 1 and now I cannot wait to be able to afford to buy the DVD so that I can get all caught up and take care of my Dexter fix!! :) If you have not seen this show I promise you will be addicted from just watching 1 episode. WATCH IT you will not be disappointed!!!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie, so I couldn't wait to watch the second.  It was excellent, of course!  And I love live streaming onto my laptop or kindle fire!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!  Just gave it a little time and then bam, couldn't put it down!  What a character!  Exciting and scary!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I like it because it's kind of collection album.<br /><br />I would recommend it very much.<br /><br />It came to my home without any problem
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book about the tribulations of parenthood and the heartache that sometimes comes with it.  I would read it again.
B00000JQ0E|4.0|I like it because it's kind of collection album.<br /><br />I would recommend it very much.<br /><br />It came to my home without any problem
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I love that the story of Abraham Lincoln was rewritten to show that he was actually a vampire hunter!  That is great writing, and what Science Fiction is all about!
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|I like it because it's kind of collection album.<br /><br />I would recommend it very much.<br /><br />It came to my home without any problem
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I loved Bruno mars last cd that was all I could hear for about two months and I thought this one would be the same. There is only about 3 songs that I love on here but you be the judge of it all I can say is I wish I would've heard all the songs on YouTube before I got the whole cd.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|this one is a lot of fun my grand kids love it they play it all the time keeps them bussy
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I thought this would be easy, because I thought it was for kids but is's not easy but worth the frustration
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app has just what a student needs tu do well on vocab tests or just for learning new words.  Thanks!
B005YPJ31I|5.0|Not only provided great insight into Lincoln but also the times he lived in.  Information about the Civil War, to include the various Generals, was especially interesting. This is not a light read. It's a very academic review of Lincoln and those who surrounded him from his days as a young child up to the night in Ford's theater. Recommend for those that want to read the 2nd and 3rd layer reasoning for Lincoln as to who he was and why he performed so well as President.
B0053O89U6|5.0|Great series. Best show since Seinfeld. Blah blah blah, I mean Yada yada yada yada to fill up the remaining words needed to submit this survey.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I usually don't play video games, but this one I can't put down! It starts up quick and keeps me occupied for hours.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|short videos and video clips of shows  not really worth the effort. youtube is this same as the tv ap  if you have a tv that gets aps  FC 2 times in 5 minutes so I wasn't really impressed  Hope it works well for others.
0553801473|5.0|I'm so hooked on these books, and this one certainly didn't disappoint.  The only problem is I have no idea when the next book will come out, so this seems like a tease to something that seems so far off!
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|As much as I love Bon Jovi, Richie has the voice. It is sad about his low points of life, but I am so happy he's back! And they play his music on The Pulse XM Radio, so I get to hear him almost every day at work, too!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was alright. The second one was so better this one just drug on. Anne Hathaway is no Michelle Pfeiffer. There was no insanity in this cat woman. I missed that.
B005AERS74|5.0|Maroon 5 got my attention many years ago, and I never tire of Adam Levine. Having said that, this is the best place to download legally, and the prices are great!
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|I purchased the copy of this movie and love it. I could sit and watch that little bear all day long.
B0040GR01M|5.0|When I was introduced to Three Days Grace, I felt it was a band I would follow for years. Thanks!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It explains a lot of where the creepy little aliens came from and left its self wide open for a sequel.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is the best!  Connelly has never failed to provide a great story.  He can't write books fast enough for me.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Wait... there's no Mars? I kept waiting for Mars. If I had never seen the Arnold version this one would have been amazing. The first one ruined this one for me because I kept waiting for Mars.
B00138KFYO|5.0|Classic! Extraordinary blues singer. Would love to see a remastered version of these tracks. But still amazing performances. Carries me away.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Girl on Fire by Alicia Keys is a great CD.  I have been waiting for a new release.  She is so talented.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Best movie of the year. A wonder for the senses. The wonderful changes in the charactors. Fabulous acting. I loved it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was an amazing read.  Great from beginning to end.  I just fell in love with the main characters.  Didn't want it to end.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It's hard to believe that places and people like these exist.  I wish this man the best in life, but I cannot imagine that his upbringing will allow him to live as a &#34;normal&#34; human being.  He has my admiration and prayers.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game!  I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics and story line.  Recommend this to anyone who enjoys storyline hidden object games.
B00ANT9MZW|5.0|\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a gripping movie that presents a fiction-informed-by-fact account of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden that concluded on 1 May 2011 with the successful raid on his safehouse in Abbottabad, Pakistan where justice finally caught up to the al-Qa'ida leader.<br /><br />If someone asked me, \\"But what's the movie like?\\" I'd ask him or her if they'd seen the movie \\"the Big Red One.\\"  That was an excellent movie made a few decades ago that depicted what the American experience in the European Theater of World War II was like by following a fictional squad as they moved from battlefields in North Africa, Italy, France, and finally Germany itself.  After a while, you realize that the squad isn't meant to be seen as a a real one but rather symbolizes all the brave soldiers that fought for America on those battlefields.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I3SYY8 The Big Red One]]<br /><br />It's the same thing for \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" except the battlefields are in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other locales in the War on Terror.  And instead of bright-eyed GIs, the protagonists are the CIA operatives that spearheaded the hunt for Bin Laden and made the SEAL team raid in 2011 possible.  In particular, we see the CIA's hunt unfold through the eyes of \\"Maya\\" (who is modeled somewhat on a real-life CIA analyst who I have no doubt will write her own book one of these days).  As the movie unfolds, we see how the Intelligence Community was able to locate Bin Laden, by searching for a key courier who worked directly for him and then following that man back to the strange looking compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden had been hiding (almost in plain sight of the Pakistan authorities).<br /><br />The movie has drawn criticism from some like John McCain who seems to believe that his experience being tortured in Vietnam makes him an authority on what interrogation measures do and do not work and some \\"reviewers\\" here on amazon (who only get upset about torture when it is allegedly being practiced by the US...as opposed to by the Chinese, Russians, or North Koreans).  I think it is fair to say that the movie oversimplifies the issue and may make people watching it think that enhanced interrogation techniques were the only reason for the success in Abbottabad.  The truth is that there were all kinds of intelligence streams that led to the successful conclusion of the manhunt.  But arguing that the movie is pro-torture is absurd.  \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" simply shows what happened and shows that yes, sometimes people did provide useful information under such duress. I suspect that the anti-torture crowd is so insistent that it DOESN'T WORK AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GETTING BIN LADEN is because they're not comfortable with making the argument simply that it's wrong on moral grounds.<br /><br />I only have minor criticisms of the movie apart from that.  I found myself rather skeptical that CIA operatives would discuss highly classified matters over cell phones.  I also felt that the movie gave pretty short shrift to all the other agencies out there that took part in the manhunt and whose contributions made getting Bin Laden possible.  But by and large, those are minor flaws.  So go see this movie and ignore people who condemn it (sometimes without seeing it) AS BEING PRO-TORTURE.  They're wrong.  It's pro-facts.<br /><br />Here are some documentaries and a book that are well-worth viewing/reading about the issues of interrogation, terrorism, and torture<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X1KAII We Can Make You Talk (History Sunday)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003LYOH7E The History Channel : The Dark Art of Interrogation , Secrets of Body Language : Learn Interrogation Techniques 2 Pack Collection]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004CZAC98 The Battle of Algiers]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000F5FNTS The Interrogators: Inside the Secret War Against al Qaeda]]<br /><br />An article by Bruce Hoffman in the Atlantic called \\"A Nasty Business\\" (I'd provide the link but I don't believe amazon.com would allow that).uld allow that).
B002RKSZKI|5.0|But I am happy that I could find it for the kindle app so that I could just read it off my ipad instead of having to buy a book for my class :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book! i've read it twice and I can't get enough! It's such a sweet<br />romance and I the characters are amazing! 5 stars!!!
B001P06GX4|5.0|We had it as a Christmas gift for our kids, who were 5, 4 and 2+. Introducing game rules of course is the first, after simply example games with we adluts, they all love it soooo much. For kids, they may have their easier and optional rules as a opinion to conduct a game. Maybe educating how to win at the very final is more suitable for older kids. But practice to set up a game is also an important part for kids to learn. It's also a hard game for adults, which can train your brain to think more deeply and completely. We two parents sometimes play with it while kids all go to bed, it's our treasure time!<br />You may question about my 2+ years old kid if she can join the game..?! Of course! But in the very begining she's just grouping with one adult, and gradually she knows how to put her cubes/pieces into game. But you can't ask her to set to win ! Now they three little kids can play by themselvies without adults' accompany.<br /><br />The only one thing I worried about and it happened for sure is...the pieces are easy to lost if kids they didn't put it back to box immediately after they finished the game.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I bought this because I have never seen Zeppelin in concert.  I was not disappointed!<br /><br />Watching this took me back to the happiness of my youth.
B0026ISUUQ|4.0|This movie was well acted with great location footage.<br />Seems like a great portrayal of sad and disturbing subject matter.<br /><br />Recommended viewing!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I bought this item as a Christmas gift.  But later, I bought another one for myself!<br /><br />This is a must have for any Zeppelin fan.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie will have you laughing your butt off! Watch it again, and again, you'll find you missed other funny moments because you were laughing so hard the first time. Funniest movie of 2012!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to pass the time. its really a lot of simple games . you start with ten games and gain more as you progress
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|really enjoy making my own stir kmsn run through his paces. funny when he humps along if I have drawn him oddly. cool he has a companion qwepie ofnmy making. maybe I should try makbg a Frankenstein and bride of version. oknnrunning off to try it now..... so fun!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I chose my rating because in some parts it was boring and it was kinda slow to read out loud<br /><br />I liked the book because it was a long book. had details to.<br /><br />I would recommend  this book to 10-14 YEAR olds
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good mix of animation,  hidden objects and puzzles. not super hard but challenging and varied enough to keep interesting. graphics and storyline are good.
B008JLEUD0|5.0|I first heard her singing on a plane and then tried finding her music online.  Fantastic.  Reading about her and her music is even more interesting.
B0000UJL96|5.0|a must for a star trek fan , it is a collector item , good behind the scenes , a family flim
B003MXIS8S|3.0|Donnie hears that the world ends 28 days in the future.  He lives the 28 days and then realizes this is no good life this way.  Instead, he decided to go back.  Is all of life predetermined or is there really free will?  As Donnie says himself, there is no way to know and it isn't worth arguing.
0765325950|5.0|Don't let the size of the book fool you.  It is NOT a slow read.  It starts out fast and just builds from there on the way to the Last Battle.  Enough death and destruction to make even Thronies happy.  And the ending.... the ending is the most perfect I have ready since &#34;Well, I'm back&#34;.
0866119256|5.0|Hard cover, illustrated, classic story. We love reading it. All the Great Illustrated Classics are fun to read for us and the kids.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Most outtakes now patched on to the end of CDs make it clear why they never made the album. The separate disc that comes with this set has some really good cuts on it. A different take on &#34;Shine A Light&#34; and a cool Keith tune & vocal are amongst them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. yes, they asked me to review it but I would have given this 5 stars anyway.  The graphics are great, the activities are fun. On level 4 so far, but I would recommend. this to anyone who loves horses.
B004Y042N8|4.0|If your looking for a relatively simple game, this is it.  Good time waster.  Easy to play. Simple controls to play.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is better than the other zoo games. You get thousands of gems. The things you buy are not a bargain.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love playing this game.  Sometimes the controls are a little touchy, but overall it's a great game.  There are many bubble shooter games out there, and as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the better ones.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This will keep you playing until you solve every challenge! Hope you are well rested as this one will keep you on the edge  of your seat!
0345803485|5.0|Loved every one of the trilogy, except the third one...once they were married, it lost its flavor....as well as they did.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I hadn't heard of the movie until I saw clips from it on the Golden Globes Awards.  I rented the movie and was pleasantly surprised.  The cast was excellent, and the story was cleverly written, and turned into a very charming film. For me, when I watch a movie two or three times I know it's good.
0679805273|5.0|This book is so great. I read it to my kids, I read it to myself when things aren't quite going the way we expected. Important life lessons from Dr. Seuss.
B005Q1W0ZQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series very much. Quality of disks was very good. will want to see Season 3 when it is available.
B0065AQLR0|5.0|fricking love the group. really great mix of all their stuff. all the good tracks are here. a good buy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love to play.  My whole family has become huge fans. can be very addictive. Love the puzzle parts as well.
0765325950|5.0|I thought the book was fantastic. A great end to a great series. Lightning paced from cover to cover. There was nothing in this book that didn't belong. Great job, and thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Sanderson.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|5 Stars. The historic value and the way Rollins keeps things moving are fantastic. History buffs and those interested in Celtic lore will love it.
B0072V394E|2.0|I'd recently read on the EMPIRE film magazine web site that it rated Django as #2 in the best spaghetti westerns.  I have to disagree with that.  I wouldn't even have it in my top 20.  The dubbing is outright awful, like they didn't even try to get some semblance of lip syncronization.  The dialogue god-awful.  Just listen to when Django is explaining to the prostitute who'd fallen in love with him why it wouldn't work.  I think maybe George Lucas must have been in on the dialogue.<br />There are some good scenes, however.  The beginning where Django is on foot, pulling a coffin behind him was an image I'll long remember.  Also when he guns down five bad guys in the saloon-very slick.  All in all though, it just didn't work for me, and could only recommend it to someone interested in increasing their knowledge of the Italian western genre.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie. I generally like to read the book first and then watch the movie and compare it to the book. I enjoyed the book very much and had a difficult time putting it down. One can actually relate to this woman's fear of her husband and for good reason. She did a good job planning her flight from him given the fact that he was in law enforcement. It also shows how easy it is to be found inspite of one's best efforts. I believe someone in an abusive relationship would relate well to this book. There is something here for everyone to consider-from drinking to how it affects your life and your partner's.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is a great book.  You get to know Jack Reacher in book 1 and this one picks up where the other one left off.  I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot as it was based on historical events and a time in history that was difficult for many people. It truly gave yet another perspective as to how life was for people in slavery and for those who mastered or governed them. A good read though difficult to swallow as to how things really did happen back in those days. If you like historical fiction, this is a good choice. This book gives you a lot to think about.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good story by John Grisham.  I give it four stars. Not his best but a good read anyway.  My all time favorite of Mr Grisham's is The King of Torts.  Could not put it down.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book eventhough it was sad. It surely did not end the way I anticipated but then again if it were totally predictable it would not have been such a good read. I am yet to read a book by Nicholas Sparks that I didn't like and this is no exception. The author did a great job with the characters and you felt that you really knew them. Here is a book that I did not want to put down.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A great book continuing the John Corey series.  John and Kate at their best. A must read book for John Corey fan's.  Don't miss it.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A good first book introducing the character Jack Reacher.  I wasn't crazy about the ending.  I do like the character though and I am looking forward to reading more in the series.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|Many readers consider Stephen Chbosky's coming of age novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower a modern classic. It's easy to see why the focus on identity has helped it become required reading for numerous high school classrooms, in spite of a provocative nature which frequently places it on challenged book lists. The recent film adaptation also continues to spread the story's appeal. Yet, for all its charm, the story contains noticeable flaws.<br /><br />The affecting nature of the novel is achieved via therapeutic letters that Charlie writes to an unnamed friend. He is afraid of starting high school. Plus, he is trying to deal with the recent suicide of his only friend and death of his beloved aunt. The epistolary format feels like a stretch at times, especially when it comes to conveying long passages of dialogue. Even more jarring is Charlie's voice. Journal and letter writing is very casual and intimate. Couple that with a teenager's unpolished writing, and some readers will likely find the prose awkward.<br /><br />Charlie is more than a little lost. His shy, introspective ways stem from various psychological issues which are revealed as the story progresses. By the end of the story, it does indeed seem like Charlie has experienced every element of teenage angst imaginable, such as trying LSD, aiding in an abortion, and feeling unrequited love. Conflicts abound, perhaps more than some deem believable, but the onslaught of issues really is true to many teens' lives.<br /><br />At times it may also feel like the characters are too one-dimensional: the clich&eacute;d gay friend, the well-intentioned English teacher, the racist grandfather. Yet, part of growing up is learning how to deal with the stereotypes all people try to apply to one another. Charlie's therapist encourages him to participate, and he eventually comes to a better understanding of why people need something in their lives worth living for.<br /><br />Despite his imperfection, Charlie's endearing qualities creep into the reader's heart. He always gets his acquaintances the perfect gift, he loves his mom very much, and he tries to be a good friend. Toward the end of the book, his love interest tells him, \\"'You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.'\\"<br /><br />So how is it that a book with such obvious flaws can be touted as being practically perfect? It's one of those rare instances where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Even when coincidence seems to solve too many conflicts in the book, the story leaves the reader feeling like they too have survived everything right along with Charlie. By the end of the book, both reader and narrator will experiences what it means to feel infinite.<br /><br />JeriWB.com 4.25 Stars (\\"Really Liked It\\"s creep into the reader's heart.

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This is not a light movie. Nor is it a movie for children or teens, and many young adults will not get it.  It is food for thought and after 40 years of marriage we recognized this is not where we want to go.  I did think a thirty two year marriage would be a little early for this much disconnect; but I can see as the years go by it would be easy to fall into a parallel life without realizing it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so cool and fun at the same time and it will get a little hard but it is fun or it mite not be hard for you all I,am trying to say is that this game is fun if you u have it good if you don't have it you have to get It now. And for free

B007SGLZP8|4.0|An entertaining read but got a little far fetched at the end. Even so, still very hard to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After one day of reading I couldn't put down the book. Whoever says this book isn't good never read it or doesn't know a good book when they see it.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Enjoyable popcorn movie. A little corny at times (It is based on a board game), but has decent rewatchability. Best watched with a decent home entertainment system.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A great insight on a young boy's life and the situations he runs into. His love for Sam is so touching, would've like to see it go somewhere more. But overall. A great book to read.
B00913P6G0|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from Kendrick since all of his albums are different. I have to say that my favorite was the Kendrick Lamar EP.  But this album is still dope. The way he lays out the story really grabs you.  you need to hear this album from begging to end. And Sounwave?  I need to hear more of this dude. His production is amazing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'd your looking for a book that won't let you put it down... this is it!!! Felt like I was living this.
B007L96VCY|5.0|This is my favorite album from Paul.  I think it has a hint of the Beatles sound with progression and growth.  Songs like Dear Boy and Uncle albert really show off Paul's versatility.  I have to say, my favorite track is Heart of the Country.  So soulful and catchy and has that good ol fashion folk sound that Paul is known for.  Great album.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|\\"Mama\\" (2013 release; 100 min.) introduces us to two girls, ages 3 and 1, who are kidnapped by their crazed dad (who has gone off the cliff due to the financial crisis). After an almost fatal car accident, the girls are abandoned by their dad in a remote cabin in the woods. Fast forward 5 years later: in a miracle, the girls, now 8 and 6, are found alive in the same cabin but they are almost savages now, in particular the youngest one. (Don't ask how they managed to survive on their own for 5 years...) The girls are given into the custody of their dad's brother and his girlfriend Anabelle (played by Chastain), while also still being treated by the psychologist. For Anabelle, a free spirit who plays bass guitar in a local rock band and is heavily tattoed, it is a difficult transition. On top of that, the girls have invented an imaginary (or is it?) guardian, Mama. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, this is the second weekend in a row that I catch Jessica Chastain, and this time her character couldn't be more different from the one in Zero Dark Thirty, also visually (from long red hair to short coal-black hair). Chastain has risen in a matter of just a few years to the very top of Hollywood. I loved her last year in \\"Lawless\\" and in 2011 in \\"The Tree of Life\\" and \\"The Debt\\". Here again her performance outshines everything else, including the special effects. To be honest, it is unlikely that I would've even gone to see this movie if Chastain were not in it. As to the 'horror' aspects of the movie, they were mostly derivative (yet another take on the \\"spider\\" walk outtake from the Exorcist, for example) but it all worked quite nicely. After the movie was over my initial reaction was that this was more about mother-like care for kids not your own than a true horror movie.<br /><br />This movie was executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro who seems to have a knack for these types of movies (Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Splice, etc.). Finally, it's a shame that they weren't able to find a way to get that Genesis song \\"Mama\\" (a hit single from their 1983 self-titled album) somehow into the movie or at least for the closing credits. Oh well. Meanwhile, if you are on the edge about seeing this movie, come for the horror and I will guarantee you'll stay for Jessica Chastain.o who seems to have a knack for these types of movies (Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Splice, etc.).

B0090SI4FG|3.0|\\"Broken City\\" (2013 release; 109 min.) is a political crime drama in which we meet Billy Taggert (played by Mark Wahlberg), an ex-cop who is now a struggling private eue in New York. One day Taggert gets hired by New York's Mayor (played by Russell Crowe) to check out the Mayor's wife (play by Catherine Zeta-Jones), whom the Mayor suspects of having an affair. Taggert gets on it right away and wouldn't you know, he finds the Mayor's wife in the arms of the campaign manager of the Mayor's opponent in the upcoming election. Will this impact the Mayor's re-election prospects? Or will it torpedo instead the Mayor's opponent? Are there other twists and turns? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your vieweing pleasure, you'll just have to see for itself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are expecting an action movie (as I did, having seen the trailer in previous weeks), be forewarned! This is an all-talk, hardly any action, movie. The first (and just about only) action comes 75 min. into the movie when there is a brief car chase. Then there are a couple of fist fights, but that's about it. This is in and if itself not a problem, if the talking leads to a compelling drama, in this case a political crime movie (similar to, say, the all-talk \\"All The President's Men\\". Alas, this movie is no \\"All The President's Men\\".<br /><br />There are several noteworthy performances, first from Russell Crowe, who seems to enjoy his role of the overly zealous Mayor. Catherine Zeta-Jones as his wife steals several scnes with her charm. But the biggest surprise for me was Alona Tal as Kathy, the office assistant of Taggert. I don't think I had seen her before. Can't wait to see where she goes from here. I also liked the soundtrack quite a bit (scored by Atticus Ross). Meanwhile \\"Broken City\\" is not all that bad, but not all that great either and it is not the action movie that the trailer had lead me to expect.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game,don't get me wrong.its like minecraft, only better graphics and you can actually see people without playing multiplayer, and the people look more real.you get quests, and that gives you something to do.but the &quot;things.&quot; baby giggles,spiders,and the thing that looks like a werewolf,only scarier.the music is kinda creepy sometimes.like I said, don't get me wrong,I love this game.I gave it 5 stars even with those little kinks.
0425252868|5.0|A very well written account of an obscure piece of history. Portrays the life of the common German airman during WW2, his morals, courage, and fear. A story not only for history buffs but anyone who enjoys reading. Best of all its true!

B00APUYN0I|4.0|It was slow in the beginning, but picked up after a short time.  Great for people like me who grew up in the 80's with throw backs from that decade
B00A77II0U|5.0|spent hours on this game while stuck in due to poor weather! the day flew by I was so engrossed!  would highly recommend so sad I finished it!
B005LAII3A|4.0|Non-stop action full of plot twists and occasional humor.  Much better than the one with Arnold on Mars.  That one was cheezy.  This one seems like it could be real some day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The number of emotions I experienced in this book is countless.  There were parts I laughed, gasped in horror and cried.  I found myself breaking into a smile right after tears had escaped my eyes.  Colleen is an incredible author that pulls you into the story.  I'm secretly hoping that Sky and Holder's story continues.  After all, they're still in high school and there's a birthday to celebrate!  You'll fall in live with their story. Yes, I said live.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Lots of fun on the Kindle Fire it can get a little repetitive though and I wanna see updates SOON
B007IK44CK|4.0|I got a sense of deja-vu watching Ghost Protocol.  The plot follows the same skeleton as the first Mission Impossible movie.  Only the locations, characters, and technology changed.  But being like the original movie isn't a bad thing as that is one of the better ones.  But I did find myself being a little bored throughout the movie because I always know that Ethan Hunt and team will always survive and get the job done.  Even when the best laid plans fall apart, you can always count on the writers of the movie to just choreograph a fast-paced fight scene where Ethan somehow takes out dozens of armed men to save the day.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for Ghost Protocol as well as the posters with Ethan Hunt in a hoodie, I was really hoping for something a little more gritty.  I wanted to see what Ethan and other IMF agents could do when they don't have a lot of fancy technology, but instead have to rely on their wits.  Well, if they did that then this wouldn't be a Mission Impossible movie would it?  Just like the old Batman TV show, Ethan always seems to have the right technology at his side for any given situation.  And like I said earlier, when technology fails Ethan Hunt is always up for a good 12 on 1 fight.

B00AZLBIAA|1.0|It's an app that scans the area for networks and then makes up a bogus password.  Even for a party trick the first thing anyone will do is challenge you to break THEIR network, and when your 'password' is exposed as a complete fake you'll look like an idiot.  Other than making the 'developers' money for sticking ads on your screen what could this thing possibly be for?<br />Amazon, why do you not filter this crap?

B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is an excellent book.  All these media people who bad mouth the USA have no idea what it is like for things to happen like what happened to this young man.  Feel lucky folks that you went down the right gum ball machine and landed here in the USA.  Poverty and evil will always be with us in the world.  There are no excuses for the behavior of the adults in this book.  Evil is with us.  Do not candy coat it with platitudes about how people don't know any better or cannot act civil to eachother.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Holds true to the comics if anyone has read them. The plot is decenet, nothing amazing but still works for this type of scifi \\"cop\\" movie. The pacing is done well. Lets face it movies these days are all the same told stories but what makes this slightly different is that this re-telling of Judge Dredd sticks closely to the comics, the pacing is done right, story is not convoluted like other scifi cop movies that like to think its smarter then what it is. Over all a good rental for the price.
B009FREK3W|4.0|This is a great collection of their best work from the seventies. I'm not enough of a fan to collect all their albums but wanted just one that would have everything I remember from AOR radio of the seventies and this is it.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Everyone says \\"Lincoln\\" was spectacular or that \\"Silver Lining Playbook\\" is a shoe-in for the Oscar, but I think they are overlooked this charming and cleverly written piece.

In this case to stop Oswald from doing what he did on that November day.<br /><br />There are a few negatives I should mention that's in the story like a number of clich&eacute;s and a lot of rambling. The story itself outweighs those negatives I feel and it's obvious that many of the readers feel the same. Be prepared to set aside a large chunk of time for reading this book.

B0044LK8J4|5.0|Pink Martini brings a great change to standard music.  I love their arrangements, voices, musci, all of it.  It always makes me smile.  It is also my alarm!!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|The story line was kind of interesting but it was way too graphically violent.  Does it concern anybody else that this type of thing is accepted as normal entertainment?  Remember when Bill Cosby challenged Eddie Murphy to be funny without relying on the shock value of cussing so much?  He knew Eddie was a funny guy and challenged him to more.  I wish the peers of people who create such graphically violent movies would challenge them to a higher standard as well.  Sadly, I have contributed to success of this movie by paying to rent it.  Ugh.

Too much large scale battle and not enough character development. Characters I have come to love or hate over the past 15000 pages are completed and finished in one paragraph. The last battle with Rand is almost nonexistent. Entire plot lines with no conclusion!<br /><br />Shame on you Brendan/TOR, James and the WOT deserved better.

B006IYG5HE|5.0|The plot in the this story is wonderfully twisty and turny. Harry Hole is a super sleuth and I would not be surprised if Harry Bosch and Wallender were his brothers. He has a drinking problem. But when he's sober, he is a blood hound. I really enjoy the symbolism Jo Nesbo employs too. It really adds another layer to the writing that is unusual in crime mysteries.<br /><br />I am from Minnesota and I do not like winter. So when I say that between Jo Nesbo and Henning Mankell, I am interested in visiting Scandinavia that is a huge compliment. For those that have a hard time with foreign places and names, stay away. My mother complained about that regularly and would find that aspect too difficult. But for everyone else, Jo Nesbo writes (and Don Bartlett translates) a great read!

B0060YIBLK|2.0|I happen to be one of those people who does these things naturally, so I didn't learn much. I will continue to be who and how I am, and just resign myself to knowing that unless millions read this book and implement it, I will never be listened to myself. The biggest secret really is just shutting up, listening, and making people feel heard. People will indeed tell you everything, but no they will never listen back.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|This item arrived at the post office at least a full 8 days later than the &#34;estimated delivery date&#34;.  I am not happy with amazon using USPS for almost 100% of the shipments to me (many purchases!) this holiday season, and it caused  numerous delays-- in receiving packages, in packages getting returned to seller by USPS without my authorization, lack of refunds for those items returned (and still no word on where the heck a number of those packages are, I may add!), and huge inconveniences for me to find the times to pick up all the packages at the post office.  This item should have come before Christmas, based on nearly every single interaction I've ever had with amazon, but it instead arrived nearly ONE WHOLE MONTH after I ordered it. That is NOT ACCEPTABLE.  I am quite disappointed.<br /><br />The movie is funny...haven't opened it up to watch it yet since I've seen it many times, so I can't comment on the playability of this actual dvd I received.  It was supposed to be gift for someone but I had to buy something different instead due to amazon's shipping choices.  Amazon is quickly losing its popularlity in my house.  It's even contributing to my lack of enthusiasm regarding opening and testing the product.  I'm over it....over amazon, for sure, after my many negative experiences during the 2012 holiday shopping season.  :(

B005LAIHCM|5.0|It's fairly obvious that Jennifer Lawrence has a bright future.  Already nominated for two Best Actress Oscars, including this year's SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, Jennifer may be our next Meryl Streep?<br />So what's she doing in HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET?  Showing her diversity?  Getting a paycheck?<br />Elevating a routine thriller to loftier heights?  All of the above.<br />Despite its critical bashing, I enjoyed the film.  Lawrence is excellent as Elissa, a gifted teen who befriends the town pariah, well played by Max Thierot.  Oscar nominee and CSI regular Elisabeth Shue offers a convincing performance as her over-protective mother.  Shue and Lawrence have good chemistry.  While some elements of the plot seem a bit incredulous, the climactic twists and  turns caught me by surprise, and the movie's avoidance of excessive gore is refreshing.<br />I definitely think Lawrence and Shue's committed acting make this an enjoyable thriller.
1452110581|4.0|I resisted this book for months because I thought it would be unbearably cloying.  I'm glad to report that this is not the case.  Several of my creative, unrepentantly evil felines could have contributed to this anthology, which I quite enjoyed.  Cat people of all stripes (yes, I said that) will probably find more than a few entries here they will identify with.  As for people who hate cats and/or books written by cats--don't waste your time, you won't get it.
B005779X4U|4.0|At first glance this seems really expensive for a place to put your trash and recycling, but I think overall I definitely got what I paid for.  This is a well designed item, made of quality materials and I have no doubt it will last for years.<br /><br />I love that the lid quietly closes, that I can keep all the trash and recycling out of sight and that the dog has yet to figure out how to get into the can.  I'm thrilled to no longer have to try and fit an ugly can under the sink!<br /><br />This size seems great for my household of two adults with a separate composter. A larger household might find themselves taking out the trash frequently.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the lid does pop up quite quickly and can wack against your wall - it's not leaving marks or anything but it is pretty exuberant about it.  Stepping lighter fixes that issue but I often don't even bother with the step - I just reach over and flip the lid up with my hand.  I will say the step seems MUCH better engineered than most. Every other step can I've had before this stopped working shortly after purchase. This one seems solidly built.<br /><br />The one thing I don't really like about this can is the liner situation.  I prefer to buy trash bags with some recycled plastic content and while I haven't done extensive research, it doesn't look like the custom liners SimpleHuman sells offer that. They are sturdy bags, and they DO fit into the can better than the other brands of kitchen bags I like to buy but I wish the SimpleHuman brand was a little 'greener'.  I'll probably just keep buying my preferred brand of bags and taking the extra time to tuck the excess edge of the bag down into the can to keep it stashed out of sight.  It's not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, a solid, attractive place to stow your trash and recycling in one secure place.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|Well to begin with I got the free one and was disappointed that when I closed the app the sounds would stop. So I got this one and I love it. I had the free one for like an hour and upgraded. I love all of the sounds on it and I also download more for free. (Score) The sounds are realistic. I love it I would recommend this app for any one, it is not just for baby's. It is also an alarm clock. It is a wonderful way to wake up.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|After tantalizing you will relatively easy solutions, it gets harder and harder. At some point you have to abandon relying on<br />your logical left brain analysis. This becomes an exercise for the creative right brain where you have to conceptualize the<br />whole and not just the parts. I notice that if I am tired or sleepy the paths are not as clear and I just quit until the brain in<br />in higher gear. One of the better games. I know it has to have a commercial angle, but I wish the ads and pop-ups were<br />kept to a minimum. I suppose I should opt for paying. But not until I finish the free version. Good luck guys.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|i love the feel and the quality of this cover.  If it had a latch or a zipper closure, it would be perfect.  I saw one very similar in a local discount store and it was double the price I paid on Amazon.  I highly recommend this cover.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read this book not for a history lesson. All that aside I still gained some insight and a lot of interest in that era. These strong dynamic characters who survived such hellish existence, survived on the hope to build a world where their children would never know that kind of suffering. The whole world should read this book. Then buy a dictionary and learn the meanings of words such as ( integrity, respect, morality, compassion, honor, and most importantly LOSS). If you can read this and not be moved emotionally, you do not know those words.

0765325950|4.0|Many years ago, when the Wheel of Time had only reached book 6, I was in a public library looking for a new fantasy series to read. A fellow student saw me looking at the series. He pulled out a few of the volumes and spoke of the characters on the front as if they were old friends and real people.<br />If you look at my reviews, you'll see that I read a lot of books. Few fantasy series have won my attention like the Wheel of Time series has.<br />That being said, the Wheel of Time series has been like a relationship, full of ups and downs. I consider the first three books to be the very best, having read them 3-4 times each. Books 4-6 were also pretty good, though the world was becoming almost too familiar by then. Books 7-10 were disappointing in their tangents. Book 11, Jordan's last book, started to show some more promise. Then Jordan died, leaving Brandon Sanderson to finish books 12-14 and doing a fairly good job of it.<br /><br />Here are my impressions of this last volume . . .<br /><br />PLOT:<br />The story slowly builds up steam, initially getting interesting once Caemlyn comes under attack and the following retreat to Cairhien via Braem Wood. The Last Battle--a chapter that is a whopping ~200 pages long!--is generally a fun read, but after a while one battle description sounds a bit like the last one. As for Rand's battle with the Dark One, I found those scenes far too abstract to properly visualize them.<br />Finally, the ending. I'd say it was okay. If I understand correctly, the Dark One was sealed away again instead of being defeated. Then there was something about Rand and Moridin that didn't quite make sense to me. Rand lives, but trots off into the sunset instead of continuing his life where he left off with Aviendha, Min and Elayne--pregnant with his children.<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br />All the major players are here, but some of them were reduced to cameos. In particular, I was disappointed that Thom wasn't given a larger role in the Last Battle. Instead, some new(?) characters named Androl and Pevara are introduced. I understand their contribution to the story, but I felt that a more established pair of characters could have undertaken that same task.<br />Sanderson writes the characters fairly well, from flirtatious Mat to stone-faced Lan.<br />Elayne, however needed some work. As someone whose wife is currently pregnant, there is no way that Elayne could be that normal--with twins no less! Elayne should have been written as a hormonal, b*tchy nightmare.<br />And although it doesn't affect my rating in any way, I found it curious that some of the characters (Bondhere and Emarin) should be described as gay. Considering that gays weren't mentioned in any of the previous 13 books I felt that it made the world inconsistent. I felt like it was Brandon Sanderson trying to be too politically correct.<br /><br />TERROR:<br />I remember how the Eye of the World was compared to the works of Stephen King. Stephen King! I remember how terrifying the world of the Wheel of Time seemed in the first few books. Unfortunately, the terror of Trollocs and Myrrdraal, Darkhounds and Forsaken have all been diluted over the last several thousand pages. I wish that for this last book Sanderson would have instilled some of that same terror and fear that one found in The Eye of the World.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Despite my complaints, I really did enjoy this book overall. Though it is not a great ending, it is also not a terrible ending. Not by a long shot. In fact, I am really hard pressed to think of ANY series that had an ending that couldn't have been improved in some way. Maybe it is just a fact of writing that the first few books will always be better than the last few, as they are the books that introduced you to that world in the first place.

B007T99ENE|4.0|well written. held my interest throughout, good sense of the period it was set in (1960's to 70`s).  Difficult to categorise in a genre, but maybe part thriller, part romance, part spy story.  characters in the story were very well drawn, with well-researched description of how MI5 of that era operated.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was a little more cryptic than 50 shades of grey. The relationship between the girl and the guy is way more freaky and messed up than 50 shades. It makes the book seem much less realistic. Not a huge deal.

B0096PAA6E|2.0|Purchased this album after having heard Gary play on the Crossroads Tour DVD and was mostly dissappointed.  Other reviewers have already described it well, but this album is a strange hodge-podge of different genres.  Whereas some musicians take different types of music and blend them to create something new, this album has several songs in distinctly different genres.  There are auto tuned pop songs, raw blues, r&b, 50's boogie, etc - it's all over the place.  I enjoyed a few of the songs, but was very surprised in a bad way at most of the material.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|if you want to be frustrated down load this app. it will not start most of the time and if it does you get no content from stations.  went to knowledge vault and even the videos there won't play.  down loaded to kindle but would not play.I have deleted app.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I really like playing this game, but I can't find any instructions, so I really don't know what I'm doing.  Could you help me with this?  I would probably give it a higher rating if I could figure out exactly how to play!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Very well writtenj account of two individuals, one German fighter pilot and the other an American bomber pilot.  The story is about the training each of these pilots and ends how one helps the other in a mission that saves the other from crashing and lose<br />their lives.  This book is supposed to be a factual account and I gave it four stars because it was an exciting story that held my<br />allention throughout.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Excellant! Shaved off considerable time from my home shop projects. Would recommend to anyone working with fractions especially the new plywood.
1401924751|5.0|My mother just absolutely loves these cards. She uses them in her business and finds that they provide great guidance and clarity. She's already asking for the next set ;-)<br />Again, perhaps slightly too thin a card for constant professional use. We will probably need to laminate these too. Which is a bit of a shame. All tarot manufacturers should really invest that bit extra in making cards more sturdy and robust.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I gave 2 stars ONLY because the singing was awesome.<br /><br />I love the music!  I was a huge fan of \\"The Sing Off\\" on NBC.  Why NBC canned it I will never understand.  Anyway, I watched this movie last night, and I really loved the singing.  During the non-musical segments you should probably pop some popcorn, read the newspaper, take out the garbage, or any other mundane task you can find because I guarantee that whatever else you choose to do will be less punishing than having to listen to the lines written for this movie.  A huge improvement would have been to cut out the dialogue between the commentators that occurred before, during, and after the performance sequences.  Their dialogues were not at all funny, and I'm not saying that because they were definitely R-rated comments, but because they were so poorly written.<br /><br />My suggestion:  Rent the movie and fast-forward through all the talking, and then totally enjoy the singing.  Or, buy/download the soundtrack from the movie.  It's a shame that such incredible talent was misused in such a poor movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked how it was written in letter form. It was Charlie's point of view and his opinions on the different situations and the unexpected turns in the book made it all the more emotional. I was impressed in the author's ability to express the difficulties of teenagers in high school and the world. It was also nice how this novel showed what a difference it makes to have a support group to tell you that you are worth it and special. Great book definitely recommend this book.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|I'm a big fan of all of the PA movies.  I went to this one with the expectation that it might not be as good as the others since PA3 was awesome, and I wasn't really sure that there was any place to go with PA4.  Yes, there were some good scares.  I saw this movie at a drive-in theater, and I could hear other people scream at the same time I jumped.  It's a fun scare!  I'm betting this will be the last of the series because the ending was such a disappointment, and quite honestly, it was lame.  Aside from the last couple of minutes, the film is worth the watch.  It's not a 5-star movie, but I have a long list of movies that I don't consider 4- or 5-star movies, but I love them, and I've watched them repeatedly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is a fast and great read that will offer some surprises even if you have seen the movie!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Great in all aspects, lighting and cinematography, great dialog, believable characters, and moral messages.<br />Enjoyed it even more at second viewing.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I saw him on &#34;The O'Reilly Factor&#34; one segment and thought him pretty real and genuine.  I retired in 03, after 20 years in the service.  He's a sniper and I'm glad he was on our side.  He tells it like it is, if it's gonna be somebody going down, it's gonna be you and not me or our guys.
1439170916|5.0|Well written, very engaging, reads almost like a novel though<br />packed with interesting and valuable information, scientifically<br />presented in way that the lay person can understand.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|You do not need to log into Facebook,there is a skip option and also if it seems like it froze on the loading page you need to swipe your device to get to the next page! I got this as a free app of the day and its great! Please give this app a chance!
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Ok for mindless fun.  Sort of irritating that your finger or thumb covers up the paddle unless you like chancing it going too low and losing control.  Great for flashback fun but controls need a tweek.
B004QK6TZA|4.0|I am of the fish era and still have a fondness for the old sound.  However, Hogarth has done an excellent job here.  Especially with The Invisible Man, its difficult for me to get beyond this track sometimes...so I skip it sometimes, a real masterpiece, I think.  This track I think is a 5 and the rest of the album does not match up to it, but it is still a very good listen.  I really like marbles, good cover art too...music is very smooth listening...enjoy.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Fallows the books closely. Wonderfully done. Costuming is great. I will acquire the entire series as its available, it's great.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great series,complex story with complex characters. The series fallows the books closely. I will be getting the complete series as it becomes available.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I wasn't sure if it would work with my TV since I don't have a smart TV but when I saw the review about the guy that played his through ps3 I decided to give it a try with my Xbox 360 and it worked fine.  The facebook login would have been a deal breaker for me cause I don't do facebook and never will.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is a great deal! All four movies included are special editions and are of excellent quality, it's also far cheaper than buying each movie individually.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is One of the best books I have ever read. Couldn't put it down. Safe haven is a spell binding story.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I was  recommended to this game from a friend, and it seems  like a moderately good time waster for long car trips, waiting rooms, etcetera. For a children's game, it had very good graphics.<br /><br />One of the two major problems I encountered with this game was the fact that I  seems to be a 'money down a hole' kind of game. I understand  they have to make revenue somewhere, but some of the highest  their pets and homes costed ~$70 or higher. I feel bad  for the poor fools whose children though  it would be fun to have  the most expensive  pet on the menu. Heck, the quests eventually cost real money (or a social life) to accomplish, both thing  I am currently lacking in.<br />The other major issue with at least my copy of the game is the money aspect.<br /><br />Things get expensive-fast. The in game 'kibble' would be easy enough  to get-through the various fun houses and items, and items the lonely you are SUPPOSED to get every time you play with your pets. Through some sort of bug either  on my copy or the game itself, the money gotten from pets is non-existent. Normally one would get anywhere from 40 to 200 kibble from playing with a pet, which is quite a high amount. For my game, I found no increase in my balance  after playing with even my higher  tier pets. Because  of this, I have to scrounge whatever  money I get from the other houses.<br /><br />Needless to say, this game is free. If you've even the slightest interest inches  type  of games, I would recommend  it thoroughly. For me, the poorly though  out questline and the  poor money making system make this nothing more than a colorful, 'once a day' app.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Our whole family loves it. Makes me cry every time I watch the end.  A beautiful story not just for kids.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|it meet my expectation,  product was just as describe, work perfectly, I would highly recommend this product this product. !
0307744434|4.0|\\"They want to believe that magic is nothing but clever deception, because to think it real would keep them up at night, afraid of their own existence.\\"<br /><br />This is one of those books I was ambivalent about before I started it. I had seen both good and bad reviews of it, so I had placed it in the \\"eh, maybe I'll get to it someday\\" section of my TBR list. Turns out, \\"someday\\" was the end of December, as it was chosen for the January read in my book club. And my fears were unfounded. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.<br /><br />At its heart, The Night Circus is a love story. Celia and Marco start out as pawns in a game with roots much older than them. To their instructors, they are not their children, but instruments being used to prove a point. The Circus is no more than a venue for their battle, until it becomes everything.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fast-moving plot, this may not be the book for you. The story meanders a bit, moving back and forth in time. I found that to be a bit confusing early in the story, but later you're flipping between the same month in two different years, and I thought that was easier to follow. In-between parts of the story are short vignettes written in the second person (you), which I believe are meant to place the reader directly in the circus, to see what it would be like as a visitor who has no idea about how everything works. Truthfully, those bits could probably have been cut from the story with little damage, but they do make for a nice break from the story.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the richness of the descriptions. You can visualize everything the author describes, even if it's something you've never seen before in your life. And the circus is full of things like that -- ice gardens, rooms full of clouds, libraries of bottles filled with memories.<br /><br />Is it a perfect book? No. Some of the characterization could have been more robust, and sometimes the explanations of how the magic worked were a bit hard to understand. But I was charmed by the story, much much more than I expected to be. So give it a shot... you may be charmed too.d were a bit hard to understand. But I was charmed by the story, much much more than I expected to be. So give it a shot... you may be charmed too.
B0019N95IK|4.0|I really came to like ENTERPRISE quite a lot after viewing it on DVD. It played much better than I remembered from the original broadcast. The characters really were quite well developed and charmingly portrayed. Sure there were a few klunkers as well as a few continuity issues that you just have to roll with, but for the most part I found the show to be a satisfactory opening chapter in the Trek saga. It was fun!  (Oh my...)<br /><br />After renting the entire run, I purchased the whole show on DVD. Which brings me to the aggravating part:  Since it was originally shot in HD, I bet it looks beautiful.  I would LOVE to have it on Blu-Ray, but now I can't justify the expense.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Got this game for my daughter but I think that I'm enjoying it just as much, worth the price for this game!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is a great quick read, and if you are a dog owner or lover I think you will more than likely enjoy it.  As a person who lives in the Seattle area (where the book takes place) it probably will resonate with you even more because the descriptions are so recognizable.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follow up to the Fall of the Giants. Not quite as good but still very interesting. Gives a perspective (on ww II) you can't quite get from history books.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed all three books in the trilogy, but for whatever reason found this one to be the least entertaining or reasonable of the three.
B007V65R54|5.0|Very thoughtful and thought-provoking examination of forecasting failures and successes.<br />Cites both mathematics and psychology behind success. Very well written.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I loved this movie but what's not to like \\"Clint\\" still going strong at 83!! It addresses the modern workforce idea that one should replace the old with the younger, newer and more shiny but, you know what, it's a poor philosophy because we are robbed of some of life's most experienced and valuable members of society. Why do I hear over and over ... if you are over 50 forget ever finding a decent job again. That is the CRAZIEST thing I have ever heard! Sure, I understand youth and modern ideas having some perks but wake up employers before it's too late!!!  The older, experienced, reliable workforce with \\"older values\\" are still going strong and want and need to be productive!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not finish this book, not what I expected.  Was extremely confusing and did not hold my attention at all.

B008YWY0HK|2.0|Delivery was great but the plot of this movie was not good. Got this for my son for christmas and wish I would have saved my money.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Still fresh and funny after all these years. Sit down and watch Mary Poppins with your child or grandchild. You'll think it's practically perfect, too.
1451695195|5.0|So absolutely believable since it comes from a man whose brain was neither functioning nor capable of experiencing any such thing--a medical, physical impossibility; and yet, it happened--I truly always believed we are more than this...this body--there is something else. I think we are all born knowing it and the world conditions us to forget it-our birth truly is a forgetting-Alexander was one of the few who got to experience the remembering and return to share it---I choose to believe him and be comforted by the thought of death---a new [another] beginning. It doesn't hurt that he has a very pleasant, flowing style of writing. I bought 4 copies for my children-that's how significant and moving this book is...to me ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and would recommend this app to anyone who lives horses. They have great picture and it feels like you really do own a horse. It's great!!!!!!!!
B00542X2DQ|2.0|This book is full of errors in the recipes, the buttercream frosting tastes like eating pure butter and the recipes are deliberately complex. I made a couple recipes, they were all terrible.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story<br />Good for dog lovers. Read it every night after work.  It was am easy read but also thought provoking.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|What a fun, quick read! I love Nans and her friends.  I have already started the second book in the series.

1612930859|1.0|HUGE APOLOGIES TO JANE AUSTEN AND THIS WONDERFUL BOOK.  I ordered Persuasion as a gift for my mother.  What she received instead DID NOT delight her in the least.  It was the COVER shown here, but carefully bound to some nutjob religious rant.  NOT PERSUASION.  NOT AT ALL.  OBVIOUS product tampering.<br /><br />So much for trusting in Amazon as a seller.  No way to contact them.  \\"My job\\" to jump through hoops (WORSE - to ask my MOTHER to jump through hoops) to return this trash and get my money back.  Same as outright theft - selling me garbage I didn't order and making it painful to get the mess corrected.  All relying on the fact that the cost is under $9, and so not worth the customer's hassle.<br /><br />So it's fraud or theft - and I'M FURIOUS.  No way to contact anyone human for any help.  Amazon LLC STINKS!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the character birds. My kids love this game. It adds some interesting challenges. Keeps the angry birds mania going.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Keira Knightley is the PERFECT PERSON for these flicks ,,, If you like this movie try &#34;The Duchess&#34; very good too
B003SI7OQ4|4.0|My 6 year old daughter has loved this movie since she was 3. The movie has a good story line. It is cute, funny and entertaining.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is well-writen book, however, there are too many vulgar words for my liking.  I think she could have done well with the book without these words.  I know she said it was for adults to read.  Aw well, it was quick reading and the plot was somewhat predictable.  Worth reading.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|This one is up there with the Batman movie with George Clooney, Uma Thurman, & Arnold. Just poorly done. Lack of continuity to the scenes, the actual story could have been good but it was pretty ADD
B00AE2J93I|1.0|A sweet little girl who is killed and then becomes a raging witch? Bring on the nightmares!  It was more frightening than funny.
B00377E5SG|5.0|It really was a surprise to me that I loved this movie this much.  I'm a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn, and I thought that there was no way this movie could measure up to the original Sabrina.  The key is viewing it as an entirely new movie - don't compare or you'll drive yourself crazy.  I loved the woman who played Sabrina - truly magical and real.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart; Harrison Ford was a much more relate-able and believable Linus.  I didn't really like the little side plots: (Spoiler alert ahead)  Sabrina's ends up proposing to the housekeeper and revealing he has acquired a couple million dollars.  It really had nothing to do with the story line and wasn't really useful.  Nevertheless, it was a wonderful movie.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|The animation is beautiful!  It was a joy to watch.  My expectation from the previews was that this would have the same level of wit and humor as Shrek, but I did not find myself laughing out loud.  The three kings and their suitor sons are such caricatures that they don't even seem to fit into the otherwise quirky, but normal, cast.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie is just as bad as everyone says it is.  It tries way too hard to be a \\"comic book\\" movie and ends up being very annoying.  Forget the review which says that it was filmed for the short attention span movie goer, this movie was filmed by people who smoked pot and then said let's make a movie!  Tried too hard to cover way too much ground and come up with a way out back story.  This is the HULK we are talking about not some piece of classic literature.  Ang Lee embarassed himself with this one, so did Marvel. Don't even bother with this movie, watch The Incredible Hulk instead.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great. Can listen to my favorite local radio station anywhere even when out of the limited coverage of the small station.
0765325950|2.0|So many things left unanswered (even one that the author said would be answered) and in general chaotically written. The pacing felt off, and some scenes felt like he went back and added stuff in for fan service, which breaks the flow.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I have seen so many version of this in play form or musical but had never read  the original story.  A story that never ages and is for all ages.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It could have been a good book, but so  teenager kissing and petting to the point of repetitiveness, bores one. The Grammar coul be improved. Avoid the \\"off of\\".

B0087YYHZU|5.0|Love it.  Some movies just make you feel good.  This is one of them.  Keeps you smiling.........over and over again
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is a book that MUST BE FINISHED. Horrifying in it's unrelenting reality wakeup call. I could not put it down to the detriment of my sleep level. The following book \\"The Secret Speech\\" is a must, followed \\"Agent 6\\" which is a dubious pleasure still on my shelf. I say dubious because enjoyment is not what these books gave me. They are superbly researched and written. I am also a Martin Cruz Smith fan and so far I have read all his books about Arkady but this is differnt, this is Russia down to the bone with all the warts.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|works with both my first gen fire and my fire hd. You don't need to have a facebook account -just skip that step. It works great withm my Sony streaming video box!
B008476HBM|2.0|I got what I paid for. I paid zero and I got a story written about 200 years ago.  Pride and Prejudice is about a poor girl and a rich english noble.  Not much of a plot, Will the girl become a princess?  I do read love stories but they should have a interesting story plot.<br /><br />lee sullivan
B005R32L66|5.0|Works great just like I was at my computer. Now I can Skype from anywhere. Hardly use my sell at all anymore.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I only installed this app due to the ignorant reviews about the Facebook requirement.  IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT YOU LOG INTO FACEBOOK!  There is a login option during the set up but immediately below it in very legible letters there is an option to skip log in.  I hate when people don't pay attention and then write false reviews for an app that might actually be good.  Also, people don't seem to realize that when an app connects to your FB it will ask you who you want to be able to view it's posts.  I always change it to ONLY ME that way I don't spam my wall and my friends with advertisements even though I can understand that when a dev gives away their app for free that they need to make up that lost money some how.  I didn't pay for this app and I am very understanding that money doesn't grow on trees and that a dev isn't making money by allowing us to get their app as the Free App Of The Day.  I still have complete control of my FB page and if the app is good and doesn't overpost I wouldn't mind allowing it to advertise my FB.  If it's done right, it could be nice to let my friends know I watched something interesting that they might want to watch.<br /><br />After completing the set up there are groups of different types of video like Featured Entertainment (Top Picks, Wibi Movies, Discovery Channel), Featured News (News Highlights, CBS News, Fox News), Featured Technology (Tech Highlights, Cnet HD, Engadget), Tubs (YouTube HD, Vimeo, Dailymation), Personal (My Videos, My Photos, My Music, Facebook, Picasa, Local Network), Movies (Wibi Movies, Movies, Animations), News (Sky News, CNN, Euronews, Time HD, Time SD, The New York Times, DW, France 24, The Guardian, The Weather Channel, The White House Washington), Entertainment (Break, Metacafe, Video Bash, Gamespot, The College Humor Show, The Onion, Cinemax HD, Cinemax SD, Victoria's Secret, Watch Mojo, SHO Sports HD, SHO Sports SD, G4, Philharmonia Orchestra), Science & Technology (CNET, Wired, NASA, TED HD, TED SD, Revision 3 HD, Beet.TV HD, Twit, Tomorrow Today), Autos (TopGear HD, TopGear SD, Audi TV, CNET CarTech HD, Driving Sports HD, Drive It, Motorz TV HD), Business (CNBC, Harvard Business Publishing, CIO HD, CIO SD, PR Newswire MultiVu), and International (Bild.de, Russia Today, AutoBild.TV, DW Deutsch, Spiegel Online, ContentOne, MusicSpaceTV, PortalZine TV).<br /><br />At the top of the screen there is a drop down box that says iMediaShare and drops down with the option to log into Facebook, What's New?, Show App Intro and Tooltips, and About iMediaShare.  This is very useful for those who rushed through the initial set up and didn't get the directions or read it thoroughly enough.<br /><br />As for the movies, I didn't find newer movies or many familiar titles.  There's a lot of older titles even older animations like Felix the Cat so I am interested in some of the nostalgia that will come with watching some of these movies that I haven't seen since I was a child.  There is a lot of videos if you're open to watching these types of movies.  There's tutorials and clips about the newest and latest technology so there is something for everyone.  When YouTube is selected there are 8 categories under it; Feaqtured, Popular, Top Rated, Recent, Discussed, Top Favorites, Most Viewed, and Most Responded so it's broked down nicely for it not being the actual YouTube app and there's just too much on YouTube all together to be able to organize neatly.  There's a search option in each category which is a must for YouTube but I'm not sure how useful it would be in some of the other categories unless you already know it's there and under that specific category. There is not search option for the entire app which is a defintely a downside since some of the categories have a lot of channels and some of the channels have a lot of videos to scroll through.  Obviously most people will have something in mind that they would like to watch but not know exactly which channel it would be in to search that specific one or it could have multiple channel options.  Vimeo also has individual has categories in their channel including; Vimeo Staff Picks, The Vimeo HD Channel, Documentary Films, Everything Animated, FIlm School- Filmaking, Nice Type, Music Videos, Photography School, HD MUSIC VIDEOS, Slowmotion & Timelapse Theater, Shoot for the Edit, Vimeo Best AfterEffects Work, 01SHORTFILM, Purely Motion Graphics, Inspirational, World HD, vimeogirls.tv, Independent Filmakers, Sexiest girls of Vimeo, Short of the Week, Fubiz, EXPM_ CHANNEL, Photomotion, and Under the Influence.  Based on the varience in punctuations and capitalizations of words it seems very thrown together rather nicely created.  I am not famniliar with Vimeo so I cannot give much judegment of these categories.  Dailymation's categories are Most Recent, Most Recent (HD only), Most Viewed, Most Viewed (HD only), Best Rated, and Best Rated (HD only).  Dailymation is another channel I am not familiar with enough to judge the categories.<br /><br />The personal category acesses all your media in your phone and organizes them by the files that you already have which I really like that it didn't pull all my pictures and dump them in one big folder.  You can view your media by your original folders, by date which creates folders by year, or all photos which will take forever to load if you have as many pictures as I do!  Actually, most of my folders seem to take a while to load.  I didn't have the time to wait and gave up.  I don't know when I would actually need to use these since it's all easily available on my phone anyways but I guess if someone was only using this to access on their TVs then it would be convenient to be able to use especially for a good music playlist.  I haven't connected to Facebook yet but I would imagine that it would access whatever media I have uploaded to my Facebook account.<br /><br />I have not tried to connect to any of the TVs in the house yet since I have no need to but might at a later date.  On my Samsung Galaxy S3 the videos seemed to work just fine and that's what I am wanting.<br /><br />Over all, it's a decent set up but I wish there was a better selection even though there is a ton of stuff to watch.  When navigating back to the main screen it starts back at the top rather than at the same place I was which becomes a little inconvenient when searching for something in each category.  As well it doesn't stop your device from sleeping when not watching a video so writing a review while searching the app is a pain but doubt it will matter ever again.  I get a popup saying \\"Unfortunately, iMediaShare has stopped\\" and it closes when I search for something in many of the categories.  At first I thought it was only those categories but sometimes it will let me search but then others it will force close A LOT!  Some categories wont let me search at all.  This is a major inconvenience and during my testing I had a couple force closings.  Since it's so common I would've thought that would be an immediate fix.  I originally was going to give this a 4 star but due to all the force closings I have to drop off another star even though it's not that bad of an app.  If they fix that I will fix my rating.n to search that specific one or it could have multiple channel options.

B00AA7O22U|4.0|Quick. Blood. Violence. Action. What you expect with this group of actors. About the same as the first. Worth my 3 dollar rental.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game to use when at the doctors office or while waiting on the bus keeps me from getting bored.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Had to catch up on all the hype....So, did a marathon watch for Season 1 and 2....Got nothing done for 2 days! But, it was great...highly recommend!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product works great.  Works for my daughter's iPad, my iPhone, my Droid X 4, or my sons Samsung Tablet.  The adapters fit everything.  You can use the original charger for the iPhone 5 to charge as well.  Works great as an emergency battery or to charge your device.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was nothing amazing. It did however have good graphics and scenes. It involved a lot of backtracking, but it was in a way that made sense.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Entire series is great. Gives you a feel for life in the 1910 to 1920 time period.  Would highly ro<br />Recommend
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't think this book is worth all the hype it is recieving.  Yhe plot was interesting and the chapter choice was good.  I didn't the ending appeared to have been thought out at all.  I will be curtous if she writes another story, i might read it.  Clarice Hodges
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is my favorite album currently. The band is just amazing. My favorite song is Little Talks because of the melody and the lyrics.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|always tells me when the battery is low and when it is full. I always know when to unplug my kindle because this neat voice tells men when the battery is full.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran is an amazing artist. He writes his own music and is not auto-tuned. This album has every song from the + album, with another 4 songs. As a guy I get criticized for listening to this music, but in my opinion it doesn't matter what you listen to as long as its good music. I strongly recommend this album.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|good acting; gripping and intense from the beginning; a little slow moving at times. Overall a good movie and I didn't notice the length.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is how I get through living on my phone. I used to use Swype, which I thought was great, but once I found the free version, I just had to buy it. This keyboard learns from your texts, Facebook, and/or Twitter and predicts what you want to type. It also tells you how much time it has saved you in predictions, corrections, etc. Check out the free version and use it for a month to make sure it's for you, but trust me - this is magical.<br /><br />I recommend this to people who have Androids without a physical keyboard. Some of my friends prefer this onscreen keyboard over their physical keyboard, but everyone is different.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Soooo addicting!! Absolutely love ths APP. You can find everything on here. Really easy to get to differetn screens and search for items. Recommend to all my friends!!
0684824906|5.0|&#34;Team of Rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln&#34;  is Excellent history told like a novel through excellent writing. That is through the first half so far.
B0024NSG4S|5.0|Great movie for Kits and Adults alike. Like having all forms of the DVD etc available in one purchase which saves money.
0739459295|5.0|Paulo Coelho is just my favorite writer. And this book is the best. I read from the library so I decided to finally purchase it.<br />Although i am pretty disgusted with the seller. I placed my order almost 2 months ago but I never received it. The seller say my address is undeliverble?? Come on, I've had many things shipped to my same exact address many times.<br />Needless to say that I was less happy with the money they gave me back, I got only 2.99 of 6.99 which I could care less for. But this only shows how unreliable the person selling this is. Never ever buying from them anymore.
B00992CF6W|5.0|no need to pay seven bucks!! Get it free at 4shared.com!! Cool huh?! Get it now!! I am not joking I got it for free!!!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Abyss: Wraiths of Eden was billed as a free app in the Kindle store, but shortly into the story was interrupted to pay for rest of story.  Played it with my sons who enjoyed finding objects for mini games and puzzles.  What I saw was entertaining, but would've liked to have seen more.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|honestly I bought and watched this movie exclusively because of Rob Pattinson and David Cronenberg. Thought I'd enjoy it only because of Rob, but I enjoyed the rhythm of the dialogue and the fact that characters said things you weren't expecting. Cronenberg is, in my opinion, a great director of our time. I'll watch this movie again and again over time, but it won't be for everybody. To &#34;get&#34; it you need to drop any preconceived notions about what it &#34;should&#34; be and just go with the flow of the characters.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think this game is so addictive. It is so better than cut the rope. I will like if u gave play this game. I hope you guys like this game.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I've been reading Science Fiction for over 50 years,and this novel is in the top 20. It's Apollo 13 on steroids and makes McGiver look like a rookie. I like the witty dialog; well most of the wit is the monolog of the the main character writing his log.<br /><br />The science and engineering feel very authentic. I would not be surprised if the author is a NASA engineer.<br /><br />I agree with one of the other reviews, this would make a great movie.<br /><br />Keep writing.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Let me start by saying that I'm on online bingo fanatic. I've tried almost every free bingo app offered for Kindle, but have only kept 3 of them, all of which I play multiple times per day. This app was my favorite, it's the most fun, easier to get bongos, more people and rooms to play, and u can convert chips to coins.Lately, though, it has been having issues (like losing the connection in the middle of a game and saying it'll refund my chips but never does or showing that I have more power ups than I actually do) for the passed week. So I deleted it then reinstalled it 2 diff't times and it worked until 3 days ago when the tournament room stopped loading. Deleting and reinstalling didn't work, diff't internet connections don't help,and restarting my Kindle was pointless. I've even emailed support, but have yet to get a response of any kind. I'm very sad and frustrated
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|You will enjoy this movie if you are into the Alien series....explains how the whole thing started.......I do not want to say too much more..hate to give the plot away.
B0083D9MXM|4.0|I bought this set principally for the Ives and the Tristan synthesis.  Stokowski was responsible for the premiere of the Ives -- which is represented by this recording -- and his Wagner syntheses are legendary -- but not easy to find in modern sound.  Stokowski was one of a kind because he was very focused on the &#34;sound&#34; of an orchestra.  He was tutored in acoustics by Dr. Harvey Fletcher of Bell Labs -- arguably the father of acoustic science and the father of stereophonic sound.  It was their collaboration with test concerts in Carnegie Hall back in the '30's that led to modern stereophony.  I had lunch with Dr. Fletcher one day back in the early 1970's and he related the stories of their combined experiments.  It was because Walt Disney heard about these experiments that Fantasia was made, but the experiments before live audiences of about 200 people predated Fantasia by some years.<br /><br />So for those wanting a cross-section of what Stokowski did with the &#34;sound&#34; of an orchestra -- combining both art and science -- and totally unique in the history of conducting -- this isn't really the set to get.  Get the RCA collection, instead.  The RCA collection is also better recorded than either the EMI or Columbia collections.  The best of the RCA recordings come from the Living Stereo era and represent some of the best sound recordings of any era. Period !!<br /><br />So, in the end, it depends what you're after.  If you're interested in the music, only, there are treasures in all three albums (RCA, EMI, and Columbia).  But for music AND recording quality, for me, the treasures are in the RCA collection.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is a well written and well structured book that is an extract and restructured version of `Good Calories, Bad Calories` (which can be painful for some to read, its long and dense).<br />I wrote another review for Good Calories, Bad Calories and most of it applies to this book as well. Please check there if you want some details how it impacted me. I will keep it brief here...<br /><br />While reading this book (and Garys other one before) I had already reduced sugars, but I was not applying low carb consistently. While reading I switched to a consistent very low carb diet. Its helping me a lot, not only losing weight, but optimizing my health. Its working wonders for me. Since i started the whole carb reduction i lost 23kg and since very low carb everything has been easy (weight loss, maintenance, energy levels etc).<br /><br />You will learn how fat become the villain and how carbohydrate unrightfully became a saint. You will learn about insulin, diabetes, other civilization diseases, how our precursors and isolated civilizations ate and how politics, but not facts and scientific rigor determine what a nation (U.S.) and then the whole world would be eating. Some if it sounds so obscure initially that its hard to imagine that people are just that ignorant, but then you look at it with a view of people defending their belief systems and then you can easily see how misguided opinions & belief become a sad fact in many peoples lives.<br /><br />If you dont need to be convinced that sugar & starches are bad for you and that fat is actually natural and ok and absolutely not the root of our problems and the obesity plague, then you can directly skip to reading `The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living` which is more practical about how to do the diet correctly and how to stay on it as a lifestyle with many positive effects to your health.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good graphics &amp; story.  I really enjoy these games that aren't just hidden objects but have tasks &amp; puzzles too.  Has zoom, hints and allows you to skip puzzles that are too hard, but these were all pretty easy. Has 3 levels of play.  Good length and and a good price.  Not terribly difficult but enough to keep you engaged.

B0000029PC|5.0|This disc from the late 1950's features a 'traditional' orchestra of normal size compared to the smaller 'traditional' orchestras which more frequently share the stage with 'period' orchestras and 'hybrid' orchestras nowadays. The issue to be considered, and all of the above options are involved, concerns the clarity or not of Schumann's orchestrations. To enlarge by what is meant here. Szell uses a full-sized modern orchestra as does Kubelik for example. Gardiner, on the other hand, uses a smaller period orchestra made up of 'period' or reproduction instruments. Zinman takes a middle course with a smaller modern orchestra but using 'natural' brass which will cut through textures without overwhelming them. Parvo Jarvi on his new video recording uses a small traditional orchestra. All of these listed produce rewarding but different results.<br /><br />Szell's set has been remastered to an astonishing extent compared to the earlier LP issues. The recording could easily be 20 years newer and produces well-balanced and clear sound with none of the earlier congestion or shrillness. There should be no serious doubts about the analogue sound therefore. Szell, supported by a very finely tuned orchestra, avoids all sense of 'thickness' or dullness in Schumann's orchestral writing. On the contrary, we are able to hear, without exaggeration, every detail of the written notes. These are delivered with all the drive and precision that Szell was famed for. The concepts are dramatic and powerful yet totally sympathetic and musical. This is not just high-powered note spinning. The second movement of the second symphony, to take one small example, has the strings soaring sweetly and with superbly controlled tone at the exposed climax at about 4 minutes in a way that even the most elevated alternative orchestras can falter with exposed tuning or tonal problems. The big moments in all four works and the overture remain an object lesson that there is really no substitute for fundamental musicianship where the ears are the best guide to orchestral clarity. This is a wonderful set.<br /><br />Gardiner, with his period orchestra, is the main competitor here and who also delivers performances of tremendous musicianship and fire. It is not possible for him to improve on Szell's clarity but the timbres of the instruments is very different and this changes the music quite markedly. The brass cut through, the timpani are more incisively toned, the strings and woodwind have that extra 'rustic' quality. This is the sound that Schumann had in mind and these are the orchestral textures that he wrote for. Gardiner also includes more music, especially the unique and thrilling Konzertstuck for 4 horns and orchestra.<br /><br />In summary therefore, I would suggest that Szell provides an exhilarating, wonderfully played and well recorded view of Schumann on traditional instruments that should be high on any list of desirable recordings. Gardiner occupies the same position as regards 'period' recordings. Collectors will want both perhaps but purchasers looking for an 'only' version should find either a rewarding experience. These two recordings both deserve very serious consideration indeed and make an ideal complementary pair. Two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />...............................<br /><br />Purchasers ought to be aware that this set is now available at a lower price point but that all the above comments still apply. Additionally it has been further remastered and is clearly superior now to the previous version. In fact it is so good as to make the possibility of further improvements hard to imagine.<br />When I ordered a replacement set in May 2013 I received the newer version with the improved remastering (2004?), with a different cover and insert notes by Szell and in a double jewel box. This would now be my primary suggestion for a traditional orchestra version of these works.<br /><br />............................................<br />Somedialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />I just received the newer, 2004 remastering of this set, and it is indeed fantastic. It is also, to my ears, a distinct improvement over the \\"old\\" 1996 remastering (which I had purchased as soon as it was released in 1997).<br />In 1989, some 19 years after the death of Geroge Szell, I had the privilege of hearing the Cleveland Orchestra in Severance Hall, Cleveland, and was thrilled by the best string section I have yet heard, \\"live\\" (i.e., I have yet to hear the Czech Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw \\"live\\"!).<br />I can only imagine what is was like to hear the C.O. \\"live\\" during the Szell Era.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book is an interesting mix of history and fictional romance, highlighting moral and ethical choices.  A little longer than necessary to make it a good book.
B002GLSX8C|5.0|Over 30 years on and I am STILL blown away, each and every time; hearing and feeling something different every time.  In fact, I propose that listeners actually NEED 30 years-plus, spanning generations and eras, to absorb the sounds.  And yet, that's still not enough time to take it all in.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin is NOT a band.  Led Zeppelin is a 4-piece orchestral explosion; birthed, nurtured and conducted by the mind-boggling Jimmy Page.  People this staggeringly brilliant are so often clinically insane; how Page managed to escape the doom of such a fate is a miraculous gift to music.<br /><br />On today's listen, it was John Bonham's train that reached inside, grabbed hold and would not let go; driving through, nonstop, unable to stop, still feeling his beat long after he had stopped and there was silence.  Am half-way through the tape and still haven't once laid eyes on Bonham live during the concert footage, but he permeates every pulse and every breath.  Shamefully, it took me 30 years to truly appreciate what the surviving band members had been saying all along; that Bonham was the beating heart of Led Zeppelin.  Bonham was the master of \\"less is more,\\" giving life to what jazz artist Miles Davis knew was the key to greatness, which is knowing what notes NOT to play.<br /><br />Many will disagree, but for me personally, the attempts at avant-garde cinema in this film were completely unnecessary.  I fast-forwarded to the point the REAL magic began.  The concert itself is more than us mere mortals can bear, both energizing and exhausting; the concert itself needs NO distractions.  The only joy I got from these interruptions was the rare opportunity to stare in awe at the young and in-his-prime Robert Plant's 70s-era seductive androgyny.  That mass of swirling curls around his classically-elegant face has moved millions of women to envy and jealousy of his beauty.<br /><br />This film records a spectacular moment in music and time that can never happen again.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooo fun and it is VERY addicting! It let's you connect to Facebook and  I always want to beat my friends!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Very good story.  I have to say it is written in the first person and it took me a couple chapters to get used to it, but that didn't take away from the book.  In fact, after you get over the first person i thought the writing was excellent.  Kvothe, the main character, is very easy to become connected to.  The author gets you to feel happy when something good happens, upset when something bad happens.  He's very easy to love and I'm anxious to start the next book in the series, \\"A Wise Man's Fear\\".

B001AR0D4A|5.0|I'll admit, when I saw the trailer for this film when it came out in theaters, it just looked like some stupid CGI monster movie and even a Fog ripoff (not knowing it was based on a King book). I was also not a huge fan of Thomas Jane from watching The Punisher. But, in the last few years, I've become a big Darabont fan from watching The Walking Dead and finding out he'd directed some other films I'd come to love. And although I still am not a fan of the heavy CGI creature creation, this movie still impressed me on a few other fronts; the cast, the script, and the plot. I couldn't have been more wrong about Jane's acting ability as it is truly brought out by Darabont's script here. The guy is phenomenal. The whole cast is, really. But for me, Marcia Gay Harden stands out as the crazy and Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody. You just love to hate her because she plays the part so well. I'm a big fan of films with inner workings and deeper meanings, like The Dark Knight Rises, and I instantly saw it all in this film. I actually have a hard time seeing The Mist as a horror film because of it's deeper message. If you're like me and like FILM and not just movies, you enjoy something like this for much more than is on the surface. This is another film that touches the reality of human nature, and I love that. I'm so glad that I gave it a chance and it now ranks among The Dark Knight Rises as an influential film in my life.<br /><br />P.S. the ending really makes the movie the dark force that it truly is. It disturbed even me the first time I watched it.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|Having spent fifteen months of my adult life in Peshawar, Pakistan, and having been to India, I was able to relate to some of the things that took place in this book by my own observations some 40 plus years ago.  My time in Pakistan was an unpleasant experience so that is probably the reason I had a difficult time getting through the book.  As I read Shantaram, I kept having flashbacks.  For the reader who has never &#34;been there, done that&#34; it will probably be entertaining for them.

034580404X|5.0|This is to all ppl that call this book trash and crap. Yes I agree some of the descriptions used in this book are a little cheeky but this is erotica not porn. Anastasia is exploring the world of sex with the man she falls in love with. This is his world and she lives it. Yes there's a lot of sex bout that's what it's suppose to be. Take it for what it is. I'm reading these nooks for the second time now and I for one love them!!!! If you're looking for so etching erotic then look no further, you don't need to use a lot of dirty talk to get your point across. I highly recommend these!!!!

B00005JKNF|1.0|I found the movie impossible to follow for a couple of reasons. The characters come in the beginning in such profusion they are difficult to later identify and many of them tend to look much alike.  I read the Wikipedia summary but even that didn't much help. One that does stick in mind is the pretty boy butler played by Ryan Phillippe, but only because he has a fake Scots accent and as usual isn't very good. Another problem is that most talk \\"sotto voce\\" so that it is almost impossible to understand what they are saying. If there were subtitles that defect could be overcome but there are only Spanish, not English, subtitles. I contrast this fiasco with another movie about a great English house, Remains of the Day, that is a marvelous movie. I'd give GP a 1 and Remains of the Day a 5. No real comparison.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was an absolute breath taker! I could NOT stop reading and I had to hold my breathe for all the little moments! After some time while reading the middle of the book, I started to relate to Abby in multiple different ways. Whenever there was a moment where she doubted herself and her actions, I either wanted to slap her silly for being so much more different than me, or I wanted to jump into the pages of the book and hold her while she broke down into sobs of emotion. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone that prefers a good image in your head, and a message written onto your heart. The first idea of this book that makes me want to read it is that Abby is a depending person, but not on the people around her, only on herself. That's a good quality I bet everyone would like to have! Even though I think it's a little ironic that just when I finally found a book that shows that the girl is actually the super tough badass, I turn out to be wrong... but oh well! I support anyone who wants to change something about themselves, but be like Abby: Don't change for the people around you, change for yourself and what truly makes you feel on top of the world!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|\\"Cubistry\\" is ever so much fun! It's like Mahjong without the hard-to-distinguish characters, set up in a big Rubik's cube.

I prefer historical fiction.<br /><br />I started reading this book with gusto after having read &#34;Pillars of the Earth,&#34; and was very disappointed.

I think some people expect too much from a movie. movies are made to entertain and this one did just that. Was it the best written, or best acted, or did it have the best special FX? no, But it was good enough in all those categories to warrant your attention.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I loved this series and truly missed it when it was finished.  When I retire, I am going to watch it all again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great app i play it on my brothers ipod and on my kindle fire and it works so great good app get it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I enjoy her books but they have gotten very technical. Didn't figure out the killer until the end, which always keeps me up late so I know who did it
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ive been wanting to own this movie for a while so as soon as it was delivered i watched it. I think that this show is good for the whole family because its hilarious and there are no swear words in it. Now there are some mild topics that might be for the older children but other than that its really good.
B009H442DG|5.0|Perfect for a couple of 70 yr olds.  I'd buy it again or something similar.  Go Travolta and Newton.  Keep up thte good work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have a horse in real life an this game is almost so real its great for all ages by the way I am 12
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It continues to amaze me how John Grisham can continue to keep my attention again and again.  Good Job John.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My grandson downloaded this because it was free.  He thinks it is funny and so do I.  It is very cute when it talks.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|It is like a mixture of rpg and avg, and it feel so great with the outstanding English vocal!<br />A must have game for psv owners!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laughed out loud through the whole thing. Sad that it's finished now, onto something new and undoubtedly less interesting I'm sure.
B00785P2QC|4.0|highly addictive, annoying that you have to do all this for your permits though. I'll let you know what I think as I get further along
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was very surprised by this book. The concept is simple enough but the execution is excellent. The detail provided throughout the story made it, for me, incredibly realistic. Also I enjoyed the journal style with its dry humour, and the ingenuity of the main character as he struggles with endless challenges.<br /><br />One negative was the number of typos in the Kindle edition I read. There were quite a few and these tended to break the spell at times.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome read.  Only on second book but I love it.  I like the books because of the way the author brings out the magnetism of Christian and Ana.  Little kinky  but hey ya gotta spice it up sometime ;)
0783225849|5.0|came on time, in perfect condition watched it the first day I received it.<br />thank you very much have enjoyed it<br />denyse
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose this book because so many people were talking about it .  I wanted to see if it was what everyone said, and to my satisfaction it was that and more.  I couldn't put it down.
B008OOYALE|5.0|doesn't. take real money to have fun level up quickly lots of variations you create.  that is all I need to say
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|BEST book I have ever read please tell Jeff Kinney that he writes the best books ever made and published
B005ZUR724|5.0|nonstop fun will have you playing for days just like wow<br />and leave you wanting more. needs Pvp though is only thing bad
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although I am a skeptic, I have always been interested in near-death experiences.  The experiences recounted here are detailed and mind blowing, particularly because the author is a neurosurgeon and has medical data showing  that he was basically brain dead, not imagining things, when he took a tour of heaven..  He was in a deep coma for seven days and his family and doctors were getting ready to take him off life support when he woke up.  As a patient in terrible health, his account was initially not taken seriously.  However, once his peers looked at the all the medical data, they were much more inclined to believe his story.Read this book and decide for yourself.  I can only say that I read it with such a sense of recognition, like he was describing a place I had visited myself.  So for me, it was an affirmation.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I would definately say that this is the best streaming app I ever tried, streams pics and videos from my devices with no problems. A must have app - strongly recommended!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Definitely worth reading.  I saw the movie then decided to start reading the series.  I'm told they don't need to be read in order, but that it helps to read the first book first to get more detail on Jack's background.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This is a fantastic movie no matter what age you are! Its almost a perfect movie! WATCH IT! :D :D
B006INDTAQ|3.0|The story is stupid.  I can't even remember what happens in it.  There's a spaceship and Olivia Wilde and it's in the old west.<br /><br />But of course you have Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig.  I would pay to watch them remove wallpaper.<br /><br />In fact, I might have enjoyed seeing them do that more than I enjoyed this movie.  If they'd like to come over and help me make up my mind, I'm willing.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The movie is very interesting and keep you in the brink of your seat while you watch it. I think is one of the best science fiction movies that I have seen, close to 2001 a Space Odyssey. A good movie from Riddley Scott, I watched Alien and Blade Runner, all af them good movies, good director.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|In the end I just got tired of reading elaborate descriptions of disgusting food and torture. I waded through an awful lot of pigeon testicle pies and nipple amputations, and it just got too much. I read all the books through half of this one and I just love Tyrion and Arya and even Sansa.  Littlefinger is endlessly compelling.  The characters are just so indelible and if you can keep up with the plot you're a better person than I am.  Great stuff, but be prepared.
034580404X|5.0|Best freaking book ever!!! Im only 18 and I love it. Only read it if your mature for it .
0670018651|4.0|As someone interested in perfume and the history of perfume, I was eager to read this.  In it you'll find reviews of hundreds of them by the two authors.<br /><br />However, it's obvious that many of the perfumes were merely sampled briefly, and I'm really not sure that's enough time to give an adequate analysis.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this!  I am definitely adding Sylvia to my list of favorite authors and must reads.  Can't wait for her next book.
B008EQIK90|4.0|I wasn't planning on seeing this, but it got the vote for movie night.  So, I watched it.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I laughed the whole way through. I seriously did not expect this to be so funny, especially since Channing Tatum was in it, but he was a scream.  Yeah, it ain't Downton Abbey, but if you want a good laugh, don't think twice.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this!  I am definitely adding Sylvia to my list of favorite authors and must reads.  Can't wait for her next book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Wasted $7.00 on this app. Does not even open to be able to play it on my device. Took my money, downloaded, now won't even open to play it:(
B004WE01YA|5.0|This was a great purchase for my girlfriend who absolutely loves this movie.  I am happy I was able to get this online and save some money.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Like the first two in this series, Book 3 is another ' I can't wait to see what happens next.'
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would love this app more if it was more like the current android phone app. I don't like not being able to tag in comments and such.
0812984412|5.0|Cloud Atlas is not perfect by any means (I'll get to what I see as its main flaws in a minute) but credit must be given where credit is due: it is the most ambitious, thought-provoking, entertaining, and imaginative work I've read in a good while.  To do a review of it justice, certain \\"spoilers\\" must be revealed below ... so let the reader beware.<br /><br />In my description above, I intentionally used the word \\"ambitious\\" first.  When \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" is chopped off mid-sentence after just a couple dozen pages and we are transported abruptly to 1930s Belgium, the reader knows that he or she is in for a long, roller coaster of a ride.  Each of the six stories begins in medias res, in fact, and in almost every case, the stories use dialect and are in a context foreign enough that it takes real concentration and focus on the part of the reader to follow along.  Mitchell, after all, has something important to say, and in return for revealing his wisdom, he expects the reader to put some effort into reading his work.  Each story, while a different genre, is remarkably rich in detail--one of Mitchell's strengths is the ability to so thoroughly and convincingly create a universe and characters that the reader feels as if he is strolling along the drafty corridors of Chateau Zedelghem with Robert Frobisher or at sea in the cramped \\"coffin\\" (cabin) of Adam Ewing.  In fact, for the first half of the novel, one finds oneself acclimating to one world only to be transported to another just as soon as they have adjusted to the first.  Certain sentences and passages are left untranslated or unexplained.  One either finds his exhilarating or frustrating.  As others have noted, this work is not for everyone--if you are looking for a \\"fun\\" read, or one that has only one level of meaning, look elsewhere.  But for me, I found myself in the \\"exhilarated\\" camp.  Diving into these rich, diverse worlds, trying to understand how they all fit together, gradually piecing together the puzzle of Mitchell's meaning ... Mitchell creates an adventure where the journey is as thrilling as the destination (each story, and the novel as a whole, tends to follow the pattern of a journey or quest).  What is Mitchell's message?  I'll let you read the book to find that out, but it is one that becomes clear as one reads the book ... and is even explicitly spelled out at several points (notably the last few pages of the Sloosha's Crossin' and Adam Ewing stories).  Personally, having the message so explicitly written out was a bit heavy-handed and unnecessary for me--it was as if, having brought the reader along this far, Mitchell was afraid that the reader might leave without fully grasping what he was trying to say.  Which, again, I felt was unnecessary given that the message was clear anyway--an author should not have to say \\"here's what it all means, folks!\\" if he has effectively conveyed the message through the story being told (which he has in this case, if the reader is attentive and committed to understanding the work).<br /><br />The message is indeed profound, and important.  However, another annoyance is how overtly and self-consciously Mitchell trumpets just how profound and important his message is; apotheosis is reached with the Robert Frobisher character's creation of the Cloud Atlas Sextet, which seems to be only a thinly-veiled metaphor for Mitchell's own creation.  There are a number of self-conscious and self-referent moments that feel like a jarring breach of the fourth wall in an otherwise elaborately staged production.  At these times I just wanted Mitchell to let his work speak for itself and its brilliance to be judged by the reader.  Other flaws: although I enjoyed each of the six stories, some worked better for me than others--I felt that while all started brilliantly, only some finished brilliantly.  Despite my grumblings about the Mitchell-Frobisher links, I found the psychological intensity of the Frobisher character tobe remarkable; once I penetrated the dialect, Sloosha's Crossin' was rewarding as the first step in really tying everything together (as the other bookend to the story, I enjoyed Adam Ewing for the same reason).  To this day, the most haunting and memorable story for me was that of Sonmi-451.  The interrogatory style, the brutal satire of democratic capitalism through the portrayal of \\"corpocracy\\" as a near-future vision of the path we are on, the deceptions within deceptions and chilling revelations ... I felt that in terms of the plot, characters, and message it was perhaps the best of the lot as a self-contained story in and of itself.  Other stories I enjoyed, but did not find quite as moving: Luisa Rey was fun as a hardboiled crime/detective novel (and a nice setup for the corpocracy of Sonmi-451) but felt a bit forgettable otherwise; for me, at least, Timothy Cavendish struggled to find the right balance between humor and seriousness.  Of course, others will find other stories more or less gripping than me, that is the nature of this kind of genre-bending work.<br /><br />Despite these complaints, I really did love Cloud Atlas despite its flaws.  This was the first book of Mitchell's that I have read, but it has led me to seek out others.  I greatly admire his ambition, his willingness to place expectations on the reader, his ability to create a rich world and complex characters to inhabit them, and his lack of fear in putting a message in his books and making his reader THINK.  I would probably give this book 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 if I could, but I give no hesitation in my 5 star review: even if Mitchell occasionally falls short of his ambitions, bravo to him for writing real literature in an age where the bestseller lists are topped by the likes of Fifty Shades of Grey.be remarkable; once I penetrated the dialect, Sloosha's Crossin' was rewarding as the first step in really tying everything together (as the other bookend to the story, I enjoyed Adam Ewing for the same reason).

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone needs to watch this documentary. It's important to know what you are eating. It's important to know the risks you take by eating processed food. It's important to know what you can do to change our country!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and will definitely be reading it again. The thought process that took place during the writing off this book amazes me, I have no comprehension of how amazing it would be to be able to accomplish something of this magnitude. Absolutely worthy of a download.
B0086700CM|5.0|It IS a ton of fun. Almost have to use it as a reward after getting other projects done or the game takes over and nothing gets done...lol.
B00755646W|1.0|The movie \\"Truth or Dare\\" portrays Madonna and her entourage during her \\"Blonde Ambition\\" tour. Although I grew up listening to her music on the radio, and like some of it, I DON'T like the spoiled-brat attitude of a woman in her early 30s who should have known better, but had an annoying \\"entitled\\" attitude, laughing at and mocking people and using her position as a celebrity and pop star to get her way. And she can---everyone lets her do whatever she wants, even at their own expense.<br /><br /> The fake attitude of friendship amongst her dancers, which I imagine is loooong over, batting her fake eyelashes and giggling like she's 16. She's a monster -I wasn't fooled. Surrounded herself with people who absolutely adored her and backed her every whim up, it's gut-wrenching to think how she did anything to elevate herself.<br /><br />And she's so mean to Kevin Costner and Warren Beatty, I could hardly watch. It's almost embarrassing.<br /><br />If you have nothing to do and want to watch someone who can put on a good show (and used any \\"controversial\\" prop that she could to point the attention her way) but is a total demon, watch this movie.
0345522478|5.0|I was really sad when I read all that Jim Butcher had to offer and was looking around for a new series. I saw the cover and the title made me curious. I read the first chapter online and was hooked. I read this book in 3 days and can't wait to buy the 2nd. It is action packed and witty a must read for any UF lover. It has druids, werewolves, vampires, demigods and talking dogs, what more could anyone ask for.
B003A9WLCS|3.0|Songstress Sade has a thing for \\"love\\". This is her third album in a row with that word in the title. For her, it's a catch-all for romantic allure, which this time comes with the theme of war. Even the Babyfather ballad, presumably dedicated to her own daughter, has \\"troops and extra backup standing by\\".<br /><br />It's a waste of resources though. Sade needs back-up on the choruses of these songs, which rarely sway from the narrow melodic range we've come to expect from her. It, along with the smooth bassy jazz grooves it's presented upon, represents her comfort zone. But neo-soul music only goes so far.<br /><br />There's some impressive, subtle yet sporadic, instrumentation happening during the last third of the title track, which marches like the drum-beat of a military band. But the best song doesn't come until the end. \\"In my heart, your love has found the safest hiding place,\\" she sings to her soldier.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I Think it was written for younger readers, but I'M 64 and thoroughly enjoy the text and the way it was written in a &#34;showing&#34; rather than a &#34;telling&#34;  style.  It almost took me back to my 20's.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I got bored really easily and I just didn't like it. I felt like the plot was pointless and I didn't like the book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Saw this in the theatres and just loved it. All the stars are favorites of mine so how could it miss?
B005KC3SDY|3.0|The boook was not the best, I only bought it because I had to read it with my entire class.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Amazing exciting super amazing fun book of awesomeness. Best book that exist it is amazing. Note slow going at beginning but stick with it
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I thought the other books were better, I feel Jeff Kinney has hardly anything to write about in the series anymore.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Flipboard is the first thing I tap when I pick up mt Kindle and the app that I use most.  Love the Pocket and social network integration!  It does freeze abit more than Im comfortable with on my Fire HD 8.9. hope that stability improves in future releases.  THEN 5 stars.
B005USZML4|4.0|I read the entire series and I liked all of the books some points lead on a little to much.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|It's okay. Gets old quick but if you need to kill time and let the mind go numb, it works well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is a book I originally read when I was thirteen. Now, 23 I can't help but feel a sense of understanding, and similarity. A wonderful novel fool of raw truth and emotion. Great read that everyone should read.
B0071F3T0K|5.0|A memorable story, written in Hemingway's terse style, 'The Sun Also Rises' is a legendary book that offers readers a long, hard look at Americans in Europe shortly after WWI. And make no mistake - it is a man's tale for men with a simplistic look at the female sex.<br /><br />The story, like many first novels, is autobiographical in nature - Jake is our man Hemingway. But it is so much more than a re-telling of Hemingway's early life: on many levels it explores the novel's main theme of the coldness, hardness,& alienation to be found in the midst of intimacy, love & romance.<br /><br />Well-written, poignant, it is a gritty story well worth your time & money.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app and know theres a second temple run out please come out with it for kindle fire!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|It wasn't an amazing movie, but it still kept me in my sit because of the really good action scenes and VF
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It's a gripping book, full of bittersweet moments and I would recommend it to a friend. Just not as a teen romance light hearted kind of book. And the stunning personal insights that most people only get after years and years of therapy entered the realm of too-good-to-be-true (at that point the book sank into total hollywood for me) but made for closure, with all the loose ends tied up.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I couldn't see this movie in a theater because I loved the first Sherlock Homes, so when I saw this Blu-Ray at a great price it was a must buy
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Use it but I also have a backup because it doesn't ring loud enough. Easy to use. Would recommend it.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This movie is great, it makes you want to see it again. The actors were really good in this movie, a must buy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series has been a joy to read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Once you start the first you can't wait until the last.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|This is a collection of stories from the author's site, which I enjoyed. This would make an entertaining coffee table book, if i had bought it in paperback. There is very little original content in this book. Most of it is from the site, which is hilarious.
1451695195|2.0|This was kind of dry....too wordy.  Didn't bother to finish it and gave it away to someone who expressed interest.
0316069434|5.0|The Black. Box is another great book by Michael Connelly. Lots of twists  &  Turns. A SUPRISE ENDING!!! CAMT WAIT for his next book.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Can't wait for Iron Man 3 this summer.  Ended up buying the Bluray version of the movie, along with Iron Man 2.
0060245867|5.0|I bought this book for my kids when they were 2 and 4 years old.  They are now 6 and 8 years old and this book is still one of their absolute favorites!  It has wonderful illustrations to match a wonderful fast paced story.  In a nutshell, the story is about a very demanding little mouse and a young boy who is constantly trying to meet these demands.  I think in some ways kids may actually relate to what life is like for their parents after reading this story, which is a good thing! I have enjoyed reading this book to my kids over the years and the it never gets old. I would highly recommend it and also suggest that you buy in the hard back edition as this book is sure to get 'many miles' out of it.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I read the book before seeing the movie,  I thought I would take my 8 year old grandson to the movie, After reading the book , no way.  While the descriptions are  harrowing the beauty and sensitivy behind the story are quite beautiful.  I loved the relationship between the main characters.<br />It's a wonderful story about life and death and ways of dealing with the inevetible through love and faith and positive thinking.<br /><br />I thouroughly recomend this book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE TWELVE YEARS OF LIVING AND ALL OF THE BOOKS EVET WRITTEN!
0765325950|3.0|I thought Brandon Sanderson did fabulous at advancing the story and developing the characters over these last 3 books. I was especially greatful for the character development, but it seemed lacking in this book. I felt little of the relationship bonds between the characters - many of which are married.<br /><br />There's lots of action here, but after 700 pages of killing Trollocs and Myrrdraal, my attention started to wander. Again, I felt more pages should have been dedicated to the great sense of love and loss that the characters should have been feeling.<br /><br />Lastly, one of my favorite characters dies at the end - along with some minor characters - and almost nothing is said about them after they die. Even the major character! Then after all the fighting and dying, the book just ends. There is virtually no sense of loss that everyone should have been feeling. There was almost no reflection about how they pick up the pieces and go back to life without so many loved ones.<br /><br />I know Sanderson had a huge burden on his shoulders, but I felt he could have easily cut out 50 pages of killing Trollocs and given us a better sense of lost love and closure.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey are enjoyable, but this is not a good movie. When the plot takes them outside of the strip club, it's pretty dumb.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Bellow average action film.<br />Much like the Bourne book trilogy, the movie trilogy should've been left alone.<br />Somehow the feeling of the original movies is missing from this one. The cast is solid and preforms well. Action is well shot and acted out. Plot is very bland and not very detailed.<br />I recommend watching it once and then moving on to something else.
1449410243|1.0|Three of my family read it and none of us liked it.  It was crude and not funny.  We threw it away.
B000TEUSJK|2.0|Great actors, but this film is pornography - shocking trash!!!!! It could have been a great movie about one of the truly insane rulers of all time. One has to wonder why these great actors chose to be in this picture!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you can get past the explicit sex, there is a very good story here.  I was so happy with the end of the story...and they lived happily ever after....
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|So I bought this book because I have been searching for something to read and this had like 600 reviews and 5 stars. So, yeah, I went into this with some trepidation, it being self published and honestly, 600+ reviews is sort of fishy.<br /><br />Well, forget that, this book deserves 5 stars. It is easily the best fantasy novel I have read in years. Probably since, The Heroes, The Lies of Locke Lamorra and The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />First of all, Mr. Ryan can write and has a fantastic sense of plot detail. He is not overly wordy and when he describes something it is enjoyable to read and doesn't drag a scene down to a screeching halt. He paints a vivid picture but he shows you what you need to see. His world building is pretty top notch. Some people have complained that the world he shows us in the book is not very expansive. First, I beg to differ. Second, it is a pet peeve of mine when authors try to cram an entire world into one book and you end up not getting a real sense of the world at all. Here, the author shows you what you need to see and he does it pretty much just long enough for the world to have heft but not so much that you know what every character is having for dinner in every scene.<br /><br />Secondly, the story is pretty fantastic and throws curve balls at you pretty much at every opportunity. With most authors I can usually guess how everything will turn out. With this book I was pleasantly surprised pretty much at every turn.<br /><br />To me, if you can get those three elements down - good, descriptive yet not overly wordy writing, good, descriptive and useful world building, and a good story that is entertaining then you have a good book.<br /><br />I guess my gripes about this book are the presentation choices of which one really annoyed me and the other I overlooked.<br /><br />The first that really annoyed me was full chapters written in italics. My eyes bled. The second is the frame of the story. Pat Rothfuss has done the same thingin his King Killer Chronicles and made it work, and it works here too but you just have to get used go back in forth in time. Also, the last chapters skip back and forth too without warning. I think the author could have done a bit more to distinguish just when in the story you are at certain points.<br /><br />Either way, 5 stars, easily.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|We know the movies well so I will just comment on the technology parts. The HD picture quality is very good since these movies use popular bright colors in 70's. Vivid colors with crisp images. WOW! Sound is also great for 5.1 surround. It has regular 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 both in the sound selection. Even the regular 5.1 sounds great already!  The extra features are also very generous. This set gets my 2 thumbs up. WORTH COLLECTING.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved reading this book.  Interesting look at society and cultural norms and expectations.  A well written book that I would recommend to a friend.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I do enjoy this but I do get annoyed with the lack of response sometimes to my touch on the Kindle fire meaning my orb dies and I restart but that's ok, it can just get a bit annoying.....it is very addictive like angry birds.......I like it late at night and sometimes I just watch the orb wander around all by itself without my interference......and then when it dies I turn the light out......highly recommend it..... it is not super fast paced, however, on some levels you do have to move quickly to avoid being killed.....
B000JLSLZG|1.0|The DVD is BLANK, There is no movie on the disc!  None, nada, zippo, nothing!  To ship it back would cost more than it is worth.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read a lot of books this year and so far this has been my top favorite. This is the first time I have read a book of this nature. I will say its a dark book but that's what makes it even better. All of the secrets and shocking twists made it where I couldn't put the book down. You'll fall in love with the characters and feel their joy and pain. I experienced so many emotions reading this book from laughing to crying. I just love it and cant wait to read it again!
B0094K1JPC|3.0|I agree with a lot of the one-star reviews. This movie is totally forgettable. I added it to my queue because of the name actors. Harrison Ford was a dud throughout. But I was looking for some mindless entertainment to accompany some Saturday night popcorn and beer, and this movie worked for that. I laughed a lot, sometimes because it was genuinely funny about our human condition, and sometimes because it was so far-fetched and ridiculous. Parts of it showed that Hollywood writers can do well if they try, but other parts showed the disaster they become when they get lazy. The movie is rated PG-13 for sex and language, as well it should be. Should you make the mistake of watching this with a teenager you can use it as an opportunity to point out two things unrecognized in Hollywood. 1.) If you talk like these people do in the workplace you will be avoided, ostracized, and maybe fired. 2.) If you hop into bed with strangers as this girl does you will soon send up with an incurable sexually transmitted disease.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|For starters i would like to say as a stand alone app for the device itself there is plenty of awesome entertainment and full movies even. 4.99 worth it yes but free app of the day even better. I have a ps3 i will try it on and see the functionality of it. Just wanted to say without the allshare features i think this app is well worth installing. I get bored and find it very useful for cowch potatoes.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|Leslie West was at his best. The songs at this point were good Heavy Metal/blues rock classics. West was really cranking...Missippi Queen and Never in my Life are awesome. The band after this album started to get into long drawn out floaters that failed to rock. They should have expanded into more heavy blues rock on par with the Southern bands that adored Leslie West. Buy this album and learn the riffs. Regards...ELLIOT BERSHADER.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Overall this [Adapter] met my needs and is simple to use. Since the adapter is made by Apple it maintains the signature design and feel of an Apple product.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This release cord is easy to apply, it works without fail and is very light and easy to carry around. In simple words: It works<br />as it is designed to do and does it well.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Loved the opening scene. It took a further ninety minutes for me to be fully engaged in Les Miserables. The last hour really is very affecting. Revolution has that effect on me.<br /><br />Never read the book or seen the stage production. Strange thing is after having seen the film I can understand how the show was so successful. It's a great date show. An old fashioned weepy. I mean we're talking deep down sad here!<br /><br />It is an opera not a musical. A lot of recitative and only two show-stopping arias. The Table and Chair lyric hit the spot for me even if musically tame.<br /><br />Comic relief was via the triple barrelled twosome of Sasha Baron Cohen and the ever delicious Helena Bonham Carter who returns to the chesty slut role similar to Fight Club. And the Artful Dodger returns! Complete with over-cooked cockney (London) accent but no walking off into the sunset ending for the little scallywag.<br /><br />What more can I say? When it comes to hit London West End stage musicals the 1960s had Oliver! The 1970s had The Rocky Horror Show, the 1980s had Les Mis. I often wondered why an affluent society would flock to see this tale of oppression and despair. But that rousing ending must have been great on stage. Individuals singing together. But it's a four star movie at best. One gorgeous hit song which should have been reprieved later in the film. A lot of close-ups for the singing but no dancing if my memory serves me right.<br /><br />It was a full-house for my cinema viewing in Liverpool. A few ladies managed a ripple of applause at the end. I recall the massive tingle up my spine when 'I dreamed a dream...' was heard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So addicting!  Great game!  Downloaded it for my phone and was so addicted to it I had to download it to my kindle!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Anyone buying the Kindle Fire should concider purchasing the Belkin case at he same time. The &#34;Fire&#34; fits nicely in the case, is easy to handle and the case protects the unit.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I found the novel entertaining but disconnected and disjointed. The stories are hard to connect and the Hswainnan segment impossible.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Nice app for getting a view on the markets quickly. Easy to use while on vacation. Nice charts also included.
B009G78EE2|5.0|real life issues like equal rights and the wastefulness of our society, beautifully written songs, definitely a great buy for the price.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I bought the book because of a few factors:<br /><br />I lived through the 80s during my teen years, and would be happiest if time had stood still and we still today lived as if it were around 1987 :)  Well, okay.. 1987 with all the computing advances of today..  I am also a gamer, starting with Pong, to Colecovison, to c64 etc...<br /><br />I find it hard to say much in this review w/o giving away plot points or twists,<br />I'm sure you've already read the synopsis and other reviews, so the general plot is known.<br /><br />Global multiplayer virtual reality world, multi-billionaire recluse creator passes away. Leaves the virtual worls and almost everything else he owned to the one who can find the hidden Easter egg he's hidden in the game.<br /><br />Evil global corporation uses its vast resources to &#34;game&#34; the game (so-to-speak) and snag the prize for itself  and start charging for currently free things on the virtual world system as well as other things to make money off it.<br />(I fail to see how a clause wasn't in the Will that excludes corporate entities from winning the prize, but I guess everyone makes mistakes)<br /><br />Gamers (and non gamers) of the world seek to gain the prize before the evil men in black trying to win it for the greedy corp.<br /><br />Much has been made of this conflict.. Many comments about how the author is saying how big business is bad etc...<br />It could have been a giant fraternity for all I care that had the resources and wealth of the alumni behind them tryting to get control of the oasis and the fortune, and the story would have been the same.<br /><br />A group of downtrodden folks that you get to know and watch as they use their wits to overcome major adversity,<br /><br />A movie deal was apparently signed before the book was even released (but really nothing more has been said about that for a year and a half now since the book has been released.<br />Hellllo? I want to see this as a movie!!!!!!! Badly!<br /><br />I was hoping for a sequel to this book, but it appears that the next book from Ernest Cline will be &#34;Armada&#34; which has nothing to do with Ready Player One. (Coincidently, the film rights to Armada has also been picked up)

B0027MJU00|3.0|Definitely the darkest plot of the three Gillian Flynn books that I've read, (\\"Gone Girl,\\" \\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places\\").  But still a good read. Very vivid description of the murders was a little much for me at times...
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so so disappointed with this book I had read such great reviews about it but I just found it not much good at all!! It was very slow from the start, at times the author seemed to totally drift away from the main theme and it was just so easy to figure out from basically the first few chapters what the ending was going to be and I hate that in a book.

B00742GBDM|4.0|I can forgive the spunkier, prettier Fanny, because movie versions of everyone are prettier and spunkier, but the slavery issue was ill placed and distracting.<br /><br />This is not a particularly complicated story. The BBC, with all the time in the world to devote to story accuracy, gave us the uni-brow girl who was way too mousy and now we have a politically correct, social issue version.<br /><br />I still give it four stars because, while it is frustrating to see such deviation from the book; it was still a very fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Also; at 40:58 Crawford loses her place, the scoundrel.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|I play the music on spotify and also from TV recording, was expecting the DVD of Broadway stage show, very disappointed.
1400067820|5.0|Taleb did it again! Antifragile is a smart book which presents many new insights that provokes the reader, challenging our current vision of the world. This time it is not just economics but also healthy care, education, happiness among other hot-topics where Taleb debunk \\"established\\" believes. I read it over 5days and if you have liked the \\"Black Swan\\" this one is not to be missed. As a matter of fact I'd already recommended it to my best friends.

B008X9Z37A|3.0|The product serves its purpose.  It does not protect it it just makes it easier to carry.  It also gets dirty easily.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An obviously well researched tale of the difficult lives of slaves and indentured servants on a southern plantation.  The story is told from the perspective of the characters that endured the triumphs and tragedy.

B00AVIM040|3.0|I have seen this movie exactly 2 times: In the theaters when it came out and this evening, January, 19, 2013.  In many ways the effects hold up even after 21 or so years.  I remember being blown away when the T-1000 came out of the wreckage of the semi truck for the first time and thought \\"wow!\\"  These days it's pretty tame.  The acting by both the terminators was mediocre at best, but the best acting was by Linda Hamilton.  She transformed herself into one kick butt lady!  Especially when one juxtaposes the first with the second.  I am loath to give it 5 stars, because it really is not that good.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars mostly because of what it did for its time.  It was one of the first blockbuster films to use computer graphics in the capacity that it did.  There were others before it, like Tron, but that was just cheesy eye candy, this had a lot more depth and gave the terminator a personality, albeit a minor one, that played off John's character well.  It is a shame that Edward Furlong (John) turned into a complete loser later in life as he had some potential, but like most kids in films, he got into drugs and alcohol and that ended that.<br /><br />I don't blame Linda Hamilton for not reprising her role in the third, as the reviews were bad and I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie after learning that Hamilton wouldn't do it.  That spoke volumes.<br /><br />T2 was a good action film for its day, but it will probably be another 21-22 years before I watch it again.
B005J87SSA|5.0|Solid album from start to finish, a very strong return for this amazing band.  I have yet to be dissapointed with a release from this band, looking forward to the next release \m/\m/

B004L3AQLU|3.0|After seeing Ms. Hathaway in all the other movies... I wanted to see her in a different role... She has a great body, but the movie was about average at best. Nothing against her...
1451695195|5.0|Everyone should read this book, and I mean EVERYONE. You will eventually experience the after-life, but this is your inspiration to make life on earth meaningful.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|Watched the others, so I figured that I would also like this one. wow! This one was the best one of all of them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have noticed that this author is way above standard in how she sets her story line, conversations, etc.  Good read.<br />I am still reading this novel so don't know as yet how the book continues but as stated &#34;so far, so good&#34;.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|It was a great documentary, and it truly makes you wonder what else is out there that we don't know about other countries.. and our own!!
B00AYQNOLW|5.0|The quality of the filming is amazing and hypnotizing. This film has shorter clips than Baraka without being choppy or disjointed. Beautiful sound track.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|Storylines cross time &.continents in  convincing dialogue. Characters are generally predictable but stiil interesting. Nice blend of old English & Australian cultures. Kate Morton is definitely an excellent story teller!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I love Kate Morton's works.  She writes with great insight into people. I was able to relate to her characters and become deeply involved.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Our cousins told us about this drama show.  We started watching it and spent the entire day watching season one.  Excellent show!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Very interesting story especially for Halloween when usually all the movies turn into slasher movies. Not your typical horror movie therefore I loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is such a great series. If you liked the movie, the books are so much better. I have only read the first book so far but got through must it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. For being a young adult novel it touches on themes world themes, it really touches your heart, and it has romance and violence for those who like that. I like that it's not that stupid romance stuff you read in twilight. I read that series and I hated Bella and thought the whole time that it is teaching young girls their lives should revolve around a man and not your family, friends, or even your own life matters. Katniss has real worries and struggles and thinks always of sacrificing herself to keep her family alive and the romance falls into her path unexpectedly.
B000ICZCZS|4.0|This is one of Hugh Grants' better efforts.  I know it is a classic Rom/Com, but it is a love affair with a boy( Don't get me wrong, it isn't Romantic love!&#34; )  That makes the difference.  The boy brings him ( Grant ) out of his shell, even though the motive for hanging with the boy was rather dubious, a way to meet girls.  For those of you who like Hugh Grants dry wit, this is a winner, no doubt.  What more can I say?
0375851569|5.0|This book set was given to my son's in-laws for their grandparent bookshelf. You can't beat Dr. Suess for grandparent-grandchild bonding time. I would buy it again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Started watching this series on recommendation from my sister. I liked it right away as it has good plots<br />running throughout the upstairs, uppercrust and downstairs servants. I love Maggie Smith as an actress and she<br />does not disappoint in this series. I think she makes the show! She can be so combative in a sweet sophistacated<br />way. Always with great style. I have taken several characters to heart from the uppercrust to the downstairs servants<br />and look forward to what new developments happen with each show. :) Keep it coming!
0395389496|5.0|Every child needs to experience pure wonderment in their life. I love this book and would definitely buy it again. &#34;Nuff said.

B0002Y69NQ|5.0|Item was delivered as promised. Very thing was as I expected to be and shown on picture. Worth every penny, to all Matrix fan planning to buy the trilogy I recommended buy the collector edition brings a Neo \\"The One\\" statue with all 3 movies and additional bonus disc and including The AniMatrix.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Trouble with the Curve wasn't as heartwarming as Gran Torino, nor was it as good as some of Eastwood's other movies.  For Clint Eastwood, however, that isn't saying much.  I really enjoyed this one.  It's a great look at the game the way it was before sabermetrics came to rule the day, before the days of 28-year-old GMs and Wins Above Replacement.  Not that that stuff hasn't benefited baseball, but there's something romantic about the ability to look at a player and tell if he's able to hit certain pitches or if he can strike people out.  It's both reactionary and forward-thinking: reactionary because it hearkens back to an earlier age of scouting, forward-thinking because statistics can only use past performance as an indicator of the future.  The ability to change isn't something that can be gleaned from a box score or a pitch count breakdown.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is SO MUCH FUN!  Really pretty easy but challenging enough to make you want to go on and on and on...<br />I was playing it while sitting next to my husband and he asked to see it...then try it...and I never got it back!<br />It's something you can easily pick up and put down when you just want something to do for a few minutes but using your brain too!  LOVE IT!
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Walsh releases new music (mostly) after two decades.  This album (that's what we called them in the day) is well produced thanks to ELO front-man Jeff Lynne....yes he did have life before the Wilburys.  Only one tune has that signature Wilbury sound which makes it a nice compliment rather than overpowering the album.  The music is crisp, clean and reflects how great a guitarist and musician Walsh truly is.  The lead title track &#34;Analog Man&#34; sets the tone of an artist dealing with the ever advancing digital world pitted against the crush of time.  Walsh resolves this delimna masterfully and realistically by finding comfort in friends, family, doing what you love and loving what you do.  His tribute to &#34;family&#34; may be a bit sappy and slow but it is heartfelt and shows an emotional depth that Walsh has always possessed but rarely been known for.  He even manages to work in a nice re-make of tune he did with the eagles &#34;one day at a time&#34;.  However this re-make is more upbeat and memorable than the whiney-ass original with Glenn & Don......and this comes from an Eagle fan.<br />This album will probably not go down as one of his greatest works but let's face it most of rock -n- roll's good notes got taken up in the 70's anyway.  Regardless &#34;Analog Man&#34; is an important album because it brought Walsh back into the studio and making new music again when it is probably more profitable to do Eagle's tours signing old tried and true classics.  So while Walsh's new album may not be a timeless classic, it is original and good enough (better than most on today's charts).  Walsh still has the talent and songwriting ability to peak the interest of someone looking for new music from an old dog!
0375850864|5.0|I have to say, I absolutely love this book. It took a couple of chapters for me to really get into it, but by the end I literally could NOT put it down. I read it in one sitting and when I finished, I went back and re-read the last couple of chapters again. A fantastic blend of mystery, historical fiction, friendship, tearjerker, and sci-fi, with some coming-of-age and a bit of thriller and pre-teen 'romance' thrown in (but just barely). I have to say, I'm glad I knew nothing about it before reading (it was required for one of my MFA classes) because I was guessing all the way through. I have since recommended it to several friends (all in their late 20s, like me) and those who've read it feel the same way. It definitely DESERVED the Newbery, and it deserves to be read by tweens, teens, and adults who enjoy an engaging story with an unexpected twist.

B003B02OOG|5.0|As an admitted John Grisham fan I have to make a point of objectivity when reviewing his work. In this case, I believe I can say objectively that \\"Ford County: Stories\\" is among the best of his work. In fact, for me the short story/novella format lends itself to his prose style and may be his best genre. The pace is perfect, the stories poignant but not melodramatic and the Grisham reality in dialogue is present. As a southerner (from Georgia) and writer, I have probably learned more from him in the art of storytelling and creating drama than any other writer. The stories take me back to Georgia. The people are real. Their pain is real. Their humor is real. Their ability to continue through the tragedies and joys of life is real. Along with \\"Ford County\\", for those who would like to know this author and his work better I recommend another of Grisham's books, \\"A Painted House\\", a 'non-lawyer' novel, and a masterpiece.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Does it really surprise anyone that Stephen King has written another winner? Even folks who aren't fans of history or the Kennedy era will find it hard to put this one down. It's good against evil, but with more twists than Chubby Checker when a mysterious portal makes it possible for a man to re-shape the future by making a few adjustments to the past. He soon realizes that the evil you know may be better than the good you try to create. Well edited (of course) and long enough to really sink your teeth into.

B006ID6NDQ|5.0|This was an interesting story of a Jewish woman survived the Holocaust and lived through the war married to a Nazi officer. I found this book to be informative and the author paints a clear picture of her dreams as well as her fears during that time. She details the life that was &#34;normal&#34; during WWII and how she managed to survive by reinventing her life to hide. The story tells of her life living with her Nazi husband, as well as the birth of their daughter and their survival during the years after the war. I would have liked to hear more about their lives after they left for England but other than that I enjoyed this true tale of survival.

It was very funny and I enjoyed all the appearances by various \\"action heros.\\"  I especially enjoyed seeing how much fun the actors had with each other and the great one-liners from their hit individual movies.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|From the first page, I was in.  I found it hard to put down, reading the whole trilogy in under a week.  It's the first time in ages that anything has caught my attention so thoroughly and even though I have now finished reading it, I am still thinking about it.  Larsson's characters immediately seem realistic and his descriptions of where they are and where they are going, make you feels as though you are observing the story as it unfolds.  Totally enjoyed the trilogy and would highly recommend it!

B005YPJ31I|5.0|The excellence of writing plus the insights into the twists and turns of political history plus the mastery of the amazing personality and charact of Abraham Lincoln virtually spoiled me for any reading in future months.  Besides a complete biography of Lincoln, she gives a rather complete biography of the four rivals; Chase, Seward, Bates and Stanton.  Finally, I benefited from her astute analysis of the civil war from the incompetency of the Union generals before the advent of Grant, Sherman and company as well as the political division within the cabinet and the polarization within both the electorate and Congress over the issue of whether the war was being fought to free the slaves or to preserve the union.  Seldom has a book stimulated my interest as this one has.  Edward Liebman, Newberg, Oregon.

B004ZA9HB4|4.0|The reason I decided to try this app is because people seemed upset that it didn't work, but others posted some how-tos,so obviously some were able to get this to work. A challenge!<br /><br />This is a cool little app that will display a variety of video casts from a select number of sites. You can also use it to view your already downloaded videos and photos. It looks like it also can play your music to your tv (I'm assuming if you have a great surround sound system there would be occasions to pump out your music there instead of on the Kindle.)<br /><br />So here's the scoop. You must have an internet-ready tv or box (like PS3 which I will use in the example below). I'm sure if you have an XBox or other box the method will be similar. Could not get this to work on my Wii which is probably not capable.<br /><br />* To login on the app, you can SKIP past the FaceBook login box. Unless you want to share what you're watching with your friends on FB...then feel free to login to FB. :)<br /><br />* From your PS3 go into Settings/Network Settings/Media Server Connection and Enable it.<br /><br />* Go to your Kindle with this app open and pick any program and hit play. At the top you will see the iMediaShare blue button. Touch it and you should see PlayStation 3 in the selection. Pick it. It should show a Now Playing dialog box.<br /><br />* Again, on your PS3, go to Video/Media Share [Amazon KFTT]/Videos/Now Playing. Either you'll begin to see the video play or you'll see your list of videos that you can play from the Kindle. Enjoy!<br /><br />The only reason I rated this a 4 is because of ease of use (lots of folks seem a little confused about how to get the app working), the Facebook login plastered (thank goodness we can skip it or I'd never use it and would rate it a 1 if we were forced to login to Facebook - we are not!) and that I had some lag and crashes on it.
B00005M989|5.0|I loved this CD because Prince is one of my favorite artist.  I recommend this product for those of you who understand the songs that he sings. He is a very talented artist.
1407130293|5.0|This is a very nice book set for a very good book series!  I really enjoy these books and I have read them several times each and they are still holding up nicely!
1451613512|5.0|We need more people, honest and fearless, like Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick to counteract the pervasive lies, half truths and spin of the Establishment's Mass Media that is keeping the mass of Humanity enslaved driven towards chaos.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I use this light as a fire police officer. Extremely bright plus flashes for safety. Highly recommend. Expensive but well built and worth it.

B00821P3DS|1.0|This is a show that aims to please everyone but instead pleases nobody.<br /><br />Do you like military type action? The lack of accuracy and absurd dialogue will make you cringe.<br /><br />Do you like sci-fi? The deus ex machina and lack of any explanation for the aliens, will make you shake your head.<br /><br />Do you like drama? The obvious and poor attempts at setting up dichotomies that never really boil over will have you pulling your hair out!<br /><br />Do you like romance? the awful attempts at angsty teen relationship drama will make you want run out and castrate yourself with the nearest rusty gardening tool.<br /><br />On top of this there are many many other reasons to hate this shows, obvious product placement in the OPENING EPISODE. Terrible dialogue, token and insulting characters that seem to be filling up a stereotype quota.<br /><br />TL;DR don't watch this show, you'll be worse off for it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Save haven is a wonderful book if u haven't read it you need to!<br />This is the best book I have ever read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The characters in this book are very interesting, I am waiting for the sequel to see how this all plays out.
B0086700CM|3.0|A very good game for road trips, boredom, waiting room droll, and sleepless nights. Unfortunately, it often fails to correctly interpret swipes, or sometimes fail to pick them up altogether. In conclusion, $0.00 well spent.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is exactly what i needed! Way cheaper then buying a sound machine with only a quarter of the noise options! and the best part is that you can download other noises that you personally choose! Great quality sounds. Huge variety that you cannot beat! Love this and highly reccomend it! Worth EVERY penny!!
B004SDEP38|2.0|Very little to offer, difficult to navigate. Although it shows many options and applications, few are actually offered in the free version.
B008Y1YK0I|3.0|I rated this movie a 3 star because it was difficult to follow. Dialect was difficult. Volume levels were radically different. To hear everything well, one would need to keep the volume up WAY TOO HIGH.<br /><br />I really liked the movie in its entirety after going over it several times to GET what was said in certain parts.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie, especially as a remastered film, to tjhe elderly who had seen the movie generations ago, such as myself, at 60 years old.<br /><br />Actually, I expected better. I remembered the movie being much better, way back when, for some reason. But I must admit, it is a much better movie than the movies of today, as far as a story goes. Todays movies are made for the eye, not the mind, and certainly not for the family. I am a fan of old films, especially for the family.<br /><br />I would never, ever present a movie of today to a child under eighteen without watching the movie in it's entirety before showing it to my grandkids. Today's films can embarrass me with the necessity of needing to explain away the cursing and the unnecessary sexual moments and implications. It's just the way I feel.
0123694965|4.0|...to my son who will be starting an internship with a game design firm soon.  He's a gamer and not a reader, but he spent quite a bit of time reading it over the Christmas break.  Based on how often he quoted the book, I'm assuming that it was very interesting and valuable to him.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked the way she developed the characters and their reasons for their reactions to each other. Quite insightful into human realtionships
0743455967|5.0|This book was recommended to me by another writer.  It has been the single most helpful resource for my writing.  Not many authors can make the subject of writing interesting, King is one of the few.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wonderfully written book about a journey that is more than hiking the PCT. While reading I experienced the same emotions and views of Strayed. Wonderfully told story...very relatable emotions...
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!! I can't seem to stop playing this game!! I do believe that I'm hooked on this game.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I've tried to get this to load several times now and it won't load on my Galaxy 3...really wanted to try this! I really hope this gets fixed!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Leaves you wanting more. Very good read. Provocative and entertaining. You'll develop a connection with the characters for sure. Enjoy!
B00AYL7OAY|3.0|I purchased this album with a lot of trepidation. I was a huge Yo La fan from the early days and while I liked some of their more recent stuff, I feel like they haven't done a good album since And Then Nothing... Fade will not fill the void of the last 8-10 years. I would rate it on par with Summer Sun. I've come to understand that the days of them making music like they did in the era of Electro Pura or Painful are over. But looked at another way, this is who they are now. And they're still making good music. It just doesn't have the raw veracity that it had 15 years ago. Few of us can sustain that. But I think this album gets a lot closer to what the new Yo La Tengo have to offer instead of the in-betweenness of Popular Songs and I'm Not Afraid of You.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|I don't think that it's a spoiler to mention that this movie concerns Hitchcock's making of [[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho]].  Apparently, this year's other film about Hitchcock concerned the making of [[ASIN:B000ID37KO The Birds]].  Personally, I think that both films marked major steps down for the genius responsible for [[ASIN:B000MPM182 I Confess]], [[ASIN:B001EBV0R6 The Wrong Man]], [[ASIN:B0093Q8W0C North By Northwest]] and [[ASIN:B000ICXQVK The Man Who Knew Too Much]].<br /><br />Though this film was apparently far gentler on Hitchcock's character than the HBO one, it certainly didn't leave you feeling that Hitch was a grand guy.  I was very intrigued by a Jesuit priest's recent article on his personal encounters with Hitchcock in 1980:<br /><br />* \\"After we chatted for a while, we all crossed from the living room through a breezeway to his study, and there, with his wife, Alma, we celebrated a quiet Mass....the most remarkable sight was that after receiving communion, he silently cried, tears rolling down his huge cheeks....<br /><br />* \\"Weighing one's life with its share of wounds suffered and inflicted..., and seeking reconciliation with an experienced and forgiving God, strikes me as profoundly human. Hitchcock's extraordinary reaction to receiving communion was the face of real humanity and religion, far away from headlines . . . or today's filmmakers and biographers\\" (Alfred Hitchcock's Surprise Ending, Wall Street Journal, 12/6/12)
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The energy imbued in this movie is kinetic, and the actors in the movie do a great job of bringing the zeal, angst, and synergy of real-life relationships to life in this intelligent, acerbic, and often hilarious movie.  If you're a fan of traditional rom-coms this might not be your cup of tea, but the rom-com elements are fully in play though it's not your traditional map of how to get from a to b that's present. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are absolutely terrific, and Robert DeNiro doesn't overact like he does in the \\"Meet the Parents\\" movies.  This is a phenomenal movie, and one that deserves all the critical accolades.
6304806418|4.0|Please read no further, if you are concerned about spoilers....<br /><br />Before royalty and quasi-royalty like Kate Middleton, Princess Diana, and Jackie Onassis, there was mid 20th century \\"superstar\\" Eva Peron.  Though I am NOT a fan of Madonna, this film and Madonna's performance in it have been underrated and underappreciated (Antonio Banderas also does a fine job.).  Be that said, it would have been wonderful if the film could have found a way to incorporate more background information on why the figure of Eva Peron is so controversial.  It could too easily leave people with the impression that controversies are little deeper than mistakes of Eva's early years.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This is the best gift my wife gave me for my birthday. Has used it each time I am in the course.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait for the movie.  This book had me interested.  I didn't want to put it down.  I am to excited to start the last book.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This movie was so cute, and I'm sure anyone who has lost a dog or any pet you would do anything to have one more moment with your loyal companion! I really enjoyed it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is one of the best books I have read you ever says it is bad be aware people out there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I here this is the best game ever then I played it and it totally is. Listen to me please
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story, amazing writing, amazing broken characters...everyone said this was a good, book, but amazing sums it up pretty well!
B009E3EXMU|4.0|This is really and incredible set - wish I could have been at the concert but since I wasn't this is the next best thing.  This band will live on forever!!!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I am enjoying, as I like to hike. Boy she was not prepared! My shoulders and back ached t the thought of carrying that Monster of a back pack!
B003TH14H4|5.0|Great series, wonderful character interplay, good stories, one of the best series I've watched on television. Definitely recommend to others
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love the characters and the plot!  So much fun watching history and the drama of lives unfold.  If you grew up in the 50's, 60's and 70's you will love this show.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I stumbled across this group recently and was blown away! Wonderful variety of style, great energy and a lot of fun. The best part is, my whole family loves it, ages 16, 24, and...  well... up...  Get this CD!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is so good on so many levels.  I look books and reading so a bookstore seemed like the perfect setting.  Then the plot thickens and I am right in the middle at every turn.  This book would be a great movie!  Of course the books are ALWAYS better.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read. Tied in well with Zero Dark Thirty. Not sure what all the initial fuss was about, it tells no more than any other book I've read about Mid East encounters
B005SCSL56|5.0|I read this because my granddaughter was reading it.  She is 8, I am 50 something!  I love reading and fantasy.  This book is fun to read on so many levels.  I enjoyed seeing where my fairy tale characters live when not with me in a book.  Super concept!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Not as well written as some of the other books I've read, though i appreciate Chris Kyle and what he's done
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I grew up in the 60's and 70's.  I enjoyed watching what came before from my parent's viewpoint.  This really is a great study in history of culture.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Works great with my Samsung Smarthub TV. Skipping Facebook is a nuisance but the app works flawless. The best part was setup, the app did all the connection between my phone, the router and the TV.  I didn't have to look for ant model numbers, the app did it all.  A few of my photos are in an unsupported resolution, might be my tv.  This is one app I will use again and again.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Oh my, I am waiting for the next!  There has to be more coming.  I love the characters and the concept.  This will be a super movie; I just hope it will not let the reader down.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|really good movie. one of my favorites. pure awesome.<br />i refer to the quotes and tell me friends about it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun and addictive SIM based game which is fairly easy to master.  The only negative is all the tie ins to Facebook to earn money and points.
B00B09BGQW|5.0|For a 2Cellos fan, I had to wait a long time for this album to be released. It over exceeded my expectations! The 2Cellos have a way with making me like songs I never liked before!
B0027MJU00|4.0|very good for light reading...very intriguing story... suspenseful and had the right amount of chills...mystery that isn't too obvious or predictable
B003RT0NK8|4.0|Pretty good scifi movie.  Of course scifi and horror  movies are held to a lower standard than other movies.  I would consider this movie to be a good 'renter.'
B0092MKFIY|5.0|easy listen very upbeat fun songs that you dont mind having stuck in your head it has become my get-ready-for-the-day music
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was a fun book to read and it had a lot of excitement. I think it could be for ages 6-12 and it  also very funny.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Other reviewers have already said it all.<br /><br />Everything about this disc is absolutely first class, the music, the musicianship and the sound are unsurpassed, possibly until this band makes its next release!<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting Raven That Refused To Sing.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|I really like this movie. It shows the struggle of a girl that isn't loved and somehow makes it through. I think about what my students have been through and perhaps their behavior results from what goes on at home. Precious shows the evils of molestation and abuse. Believe it or not things like this happens.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|Works pretty good, I read the other reviews that completely knock this app, but it's free app of the day so naturally I downloaded it, after updates it just may turn out better.<br /><br />1.I unfortunately do not have a WiFi capable tv so I know off the bat this app won't work for me, but you never know I may get one eventually. You're stupid if you think any type of app will hook up to an old tv.<br /><br />2. I did not have to log in using Facebook, I just pressed the skip button.<br /><br />Upside, I can use it to view crap on my phone. It will currently fall in the videos folder along with Netflix, YouTube, vudu, etc.....<br /><br />Great find to be free for the day
B008L1DNGI|4.0|The touch controls being a swipe was a bit awkward at first. It is okay now, but it took a while to get used to. Altogether great puzzle game even now.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app. I am not tech savvy at all and this app is easy to use. Very happy with it!  :P
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Ok...if you like,or love James Taylor, you have got to have this one in your collection for the holidays!!!  His voice was a welcome addition to our parties, and our Christmas morning ritual of opening gifts.  His voice is so mellow, and rich, and he seems to so enjoy every word he sings.  You can &#34;hear&#34; the smile on his face.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|I agree with Mr. Spike Lee that \\"Django Unchained\\" is disrespectful to our ancestors.  It causes me to want to spark a conversation about slavery; but more specifically, slavery in outer space. I tried to watch the movie; however about twenty-five minutes into it, I had to say enough's enough's enough. I couldn't sit there watching actors make a mockery of slavery. Slavery was and is too evil, too dark, too horrifying, too demonic to make light of it. Lots of people, Black people, mind you, said they loved the movie...LOVED IT. So, I wanted to watch it for two reasons: (1) To see if I would love it, like everybody else; and (2) To ferret out subliminal messages. But hey, I couldn't do it...I couldn't watch the whole of Django; it was too comical. I want to know, \\"What the hell is funny about the KKK?\\" They are the worst of the worst gang of terrorists. They are the androids that BURN THE CROSS, steal, kill, and murder innocent Black men, women, and children; all while calling themselves Christians...Is that Laughable?...Loveable? No, that is cruel-hearted, that is inhumane.<br /><br />The movie was meant to be enjoyed only by the elk of those who want to laugh at the sight of violence and bloodshed, and who believe the Ku Klux Klan were bumbling nincompoops. As for me, I found myself weeping. I found myself remembering a vision I had on Azusa Street back in March 1994...a vision so horrible, that the deciphering of it catapulted me into spiritual bipolar. In the vision, I saw Black people in chains of bondage and God was making war to free us. God wanted us to realize that we are still under bondage and need to do something to help Him free us. We need to strive for freedom/manumission. Over the years, as I continued to decipher that vision, God taught me something more horrifying than the actual act of enslavement; He taught me about the WHO DID IT?...Jehovah/Zeus, Noah, Shem, Japheth, Abraham/Isaac/Jacob!! God showed me in a vision that if the heirs of those spirits make it up to Mars, they will enslave the Black man, again.<br /><br />Did you see the taskmaster reading from the Bible while he brutally lashed Broomhilda? He read: \\"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered (Gen. 9:2).\\"<br /><br />That's the mindset of the heirs of Shem and Japheth-- they believe Jehovah has delivered the Black man (whom they call Ham) into their hands for enslavement.  Those same heirs want us to have so much fear and dread of them that we will not call the Shemitic and Japhetic White man into God's/Aten divine justice chamber where they will have to answer for the sorcery they employ to help them fulfill Noah's prophesy that gives them dominion and rest as long as they keep Ham in bondage. But that's a little deep; let's talk about Broomhilda.<br /><br />\\"What's her name?\\" asked Dr. King.<br /><br />\\"Broomhilda.\\"<br /><br />\\"What?  Broomhilda!\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, Broomhilda von Shaft,\\" Django answered.<br /><br />Why the hullabaloo about Broomhilda?  Her name is a derivative of \\"Brunhilda,\\" which means \\"READY FOR BATTLE.\\"<br />Who's ready for battle?...the writer of Django?...the director and producer of Django?...Dr. King Schultz, the heroic leader?...Django/Shaft and Broomhilda themselves?...the audience who watched Django and just \\"Loved It!?\\"...Or, is it the people who bombed the moon that are \\"READY FOR BATTLE!\\" against the enslaved and against The Aten, the God of the enslaved?<br /><br />No author/script writer/poet writes of his or her own volition, he or she is directed by the \\"Muses!\\"  I submit to you that the whole of the subliminal message in \\"Django Unchained\\" (with its strategic release date on 25 December 2012, on the Day of The Lord), comes from the Muses, the spirits of Shem and Japheth.  They sent us a mind-blowing, bloody visualization depicting their readiness to enslave us again, this time on the planet Mars; and the message to God is that, to accomplish their task, they are \\"READY FOR BATTLE.\\"<br /><br />Now, it's my job to scour the WWW to find Detective Shaft so that I might warn him it is time to gather all the \\"in-plain-sight\\" clues left by the Muses of Mars...either Ham goes back into captivity...or Shem and Japheth go...but captivity is not over (Rev. 13:10).

B003L77G8I|5.0|A must see for Bones lovers. This was a  great season. It shipped on time. We were very satisfied with the purchase.
B0064W639K|5.0|If you have any affinity for Nolan`s trilogy, then this book is for you. You can see how the transformation of Dent changes the protagonists. Some of the themes conceived here run rampant throughout all of Batman's mythos. Spend the money and add this to your collection even if you are not a die hard comic fan.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is a great cd.  It shipped on time and  I listen to it ever day. A must have for anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome I hope they will come up with version 6 very soon. I hope they will make pumpkins so I can get an iron golem. I also hope u can make a portal to the end and nether regions.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I thought this book was very well narrated and I was definitely rooting for the main characters.  I found some of it highly unrealistic, but enjoyed it all the same.
B00633W614|5.0|This is the second book of the Clifton chronicles.  I do not recommend it without first having read book one..  The action is of course expansive history, but who cares....it's a novel, and a very interesting one at that.  All the characters are well-defined whatever be their likability.  The writing is somewhat along the style of Ken Follett, and that should say it all.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was the best I've read in a long time.  I couldn't get enough of Jacob's trial, the twists in the plot, and the narrator's<br />(Jacob's father) take on his son as a dad and a DA.  This is a must read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is amazing, great actors, amazing scenery and wonderful plot and plot twists.  Its like going on vacation every time we watch it!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|My son loved the demo version, so I decided to buy the full version through Amazon.  Would not install on my Samsung Galaxy tablet, so I clicked the customer support link requesting a refund.  That was 3 days ago; have heard nothing.  I was able to download the app successfully with Google Play.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|I got it for my grandson.Our grandson likes the coloring book and spends lots of time doing pictures. he really enjoys it.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|the game is awesome. pretty graphics and fun gameplay, but i'm on 8-8 and there is a glitch near the beginning on the left side of the screen preventing me from wall jumping, which is the only way to progress. please fix!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great compilation not the entire soundtrack but hits all the greatest songs I think I will be seeing the movie again soon loved it
B0077SGMXM|5.0|The most fun, frustrating, addictive game on the market. If you play golf you will understand th his and lows. If not this is as close emotionally to the real thing as it gets.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is so fun ! I love all the challenging the app is so addicting . I definitely recommend this app for anyone who loves a challenge. Well it was a challenge for me because I am not really good at solving any mysteries or challenges !  ~&deg;&deg;~  : )
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I avoided reading this novel for years, because stories about children being forced to murder each other for the entertainment of a dystopian society are really, really not my cup of tea.  I was ultimately persuaded by a friend to give it a try.  Ended up devouring it in less than a day.  I doubt I can add much to what other readers have said.  This first book of three is tightly plotted, and the prose flows effortlessly, drawing you in from the first line.  It's a very good read and I certainly recommend it.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|This is a review for iMediaShare user experience with the PS3. Since I dont own a 'smart' TV I can't directly link the app to my TV, however with this app it is compatible with the PS3. Open up the app on your phone and have your PS3 turned on. On the home screen roll over to the left where it says \\"Video\\", it should display iMediaShare (if you dont see it right away just give it a few seconds it should pop up, so long your app is open on your phone). From there your able to scroll through the available media, there is a lot on there but a major downfall is the time it takes for your to actually see the titles within the  app. To view whats showing on your phone just go to the title 'Now Playing'. Overall I appreciate this app for us PS3 users. The stream is clear and of good quality, sound is a little funny, much like watching crackle but overall its good. I would recommend this app to anybody looking to stream videos or listen to music with their surround sound and big screen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games. Not only is it entertaining for me but my 4 year old son enjoys all the games too!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is a cool fun awesome cute ation fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I love it! i dont have words to explain it! This band is the best! This album have exelent sound and armony! ♥
B0083Z614S|5.0|I am a month shy of my 59th birthday ; I have read this book at least once a year since I was 11. I have different versions of the movie, but I always enjoy the book more. Amazon & Kindle have started my 2013, (& my husband who gifted me the Kindle) started me out with a great book reviewed, again.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Loved it, seen it in the theater and had to have it for my collection of all the Step Up movies.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I truly enjoy playing Bubbles Touch.  Not only is it a great deal of fun it also helps me keep my mind sharp.  As you play the game you learn to bank shots, place the bubbles so you can knock down several bubbles with one shot.  There have been a few times when I have been able to knock down all the bubbles with the first shot.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|this is ok. same as all the others like this, nothing really pops out that makes me say it's better than any other similar app. go ahead and take a look.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|this is the best show ever .  it is a non-stop thrill ride with rollercoaster up and downs  can't wait to buy season 2!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|it's ok, but i found it hard to navigate. not so intuitive to me. i'll check back later to see if any updates make it any better. check it out, you may like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously cannot put this book down!!  I am ready to read the next one.  Best we series ever!!!  Enjoy it!
B00001MXXH|5.0|this movie is just as good as it was before even better. They really dont make movies like this anymore
B000002AGN|5.0|If you like music, this is a must have.  Dave Brubeck takes odd meters (think 5/4, 9/8) and makes it danceable!!!
B00005V9IL|5.0|one of the best underwater movies ever done and still stands the test of time I may add excellant... Must own
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Now THIS is a movie!<br />A non stop action packed virtual adventure of a rare flavor that just gets better & better. Jaw dropping in it's beauty & scope, with stunning visuals as everything is believably represented with fine attention to detail.<br />And the acting is top notch as well so it all ties together seamlessly.<br />WOW, how did i miss this one?....i must have been on another planet or something :)<br />Seriously, i do recall seeing a commercial for it maybe twice, then \\"poof\\" it vanished from the radar screen.<br />This is an EPIC movie that I believe ERB would just love. I cannot think of anything bad to say about it....except that it had to end.<br />This movie is a rare gem....in that it hits a nerve that provokes something hard to put a finger on...a seldom enjoyed sense of wonder, hope & possibility that leaves you wanting more.
1400049628|5.0|was happy over all with performance. This thing forces to write more so I dont want to do the reviews anymore
B000U0O9FM|5.0|After seeing the movie so many years ago I wanted to read the book.  Finally got around to it.  It was more than worth it.  The prose rips you along page after page while the characters repeatedly kick you in the teeth.  I loved it!<br /><br />It was a bit awkward at first.  Chuck writes mostly from the head of the character.  There isn't much dialogue.  His ability to tell the story more than counteracted this.<br /><br />Great read! I would recommend a read or reread to everyone who enjoys a refreshing, atypical writing style.
1481251880|5.0|** spoiler alert ** Stars: 5+ and even that doesn't do this book justice.<br /><br />Overall: Intense. Emotional. Live. This book was incredible. Either i was laughing or crying while reading this book. I don't even know what to say because i'm still trying to take everything in. One of the things i took away with this book is that you can overcome anything. Hopeless will forever have a different meaning to me; always. I live you. Pinky Promise.<br /><br />Characters: Sky (Hope) & Dean Holder<br /><br />Page Turner: I couldn't put the book down, not once. It was AMAZING! so a big YES!<br /><br />Series Cont: I don't think so, but it would be nice to see where life takes them and the people around them. Namely Karen and I would love to hear more about Six & Berkin.<br /><br />Recommend: OMG YES! YES YES!
B008133MDK|5.0|The interplay between Watson and Sherlock is priceless writing.  The new take on old story lines from the novels is a stroke of genius.  And the acting is flawless.  I fell in love with all the characters in the first season and now find myself waiting for the January release of the new season.
0307120007|5.0|I'd recomend this book to anyone with a new baby. My son, (now 28) and my grand-daughter (5 months) both enjoy(ed) the story and the tactile stimulation
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is very simple, but challenging. Its graphics shouldn't discourage adults from giving it a try.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A really wonderful story that was easy to fall in love with. I had already watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon. Be sure to catch the humor!! I also enjoyed the historical clothes and cars.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun to play some things are hard to understand to do in the game but once you get the hang of it its fun
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This a book where you don't know who the evil person til the end. Was hard to put down. Great story line and characters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|More game depth, and much more suspenseful than many of the hidden object/puzzle games I've played.  Also enjoyed the in-game achievements.
B006RXQ800|4.0|Great movie, as expected from such a great director. It does however fall short of the fifth star because of the lack of historical authenticity. The Five Points neighborhood was not as violent as the film portrays, and quite honestly Scorsese is just providing us with an alternate history that's been created by his mafia centric filter. Other than that the movie is awsome and Daniel Day Lewis is superb.
0140177191|2.0|I borrowed \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" on audio book at my local library. Since it was read by one of my favorite narrators, Davina Porter, I thought I would have a grand time. I was looking forward to this version of the Arthurian tale. I was really disappointed, however, and did not finish the second book (nor did I read the next two volumes).<br /><br />My main critic is that all the female characters, without exception, whine constantly about a variety of topics: not beautiful enough, not powerful enough, not loved enough, etc. For a book about supposedly powerful women who shaped the world and took control of their destiny, they sure lament a lot. This litany of lamentations goes on and on to the point of boredom and exasperation. It would have been nice to feel a little empowerment here and there! I took a particular dislike to Gwynivere, Arthur's wife, with her narrow minded, self-centered and frankly bigot attitude.<br /><br />I felt let down by the author and hope this is not a reflection of her view of women in general.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the only thing I don't like is that I can't delete boards. otherwise great app and I spend way too much time on it!
B008WHQZJI|3.0|PSB albums typically have a similar problem:  the songs are good but the collection isn't always cohesive.  This results in the questionable practice of releasing remixed versions of half the album -- questionable because you must buy the album 'twice' to maybe get the tracks you wanted first.<br /><br />ELYSIUM's problems are simple --<br /><br />1.  It's mostly lowkey.  If you're in the mood for a dancy PSB disc you'll likely be disappointed.<br /><br />SOLUTION:  How many dance songs by these guys do you need?  Seriously.  They've composed and released hundreds at this point.  So your first way to make this experience better is to embrace it as a 'chill' album -- and once you do -- you just might love it.  To pull this off, do the next solution.<br /><br />2.  Usually albums mix in half-baked songs within better songs.  This album is a DISASTER that way.  Believe it or not:  the best songs on the disc are the first three, the next five go from ehh to sad, and the last four aren't bad.  Still -- that's seven good, five bad.<br /><br />SOLUTION:  Wouldn't it be nice if you could remove tracks 4-8 and replace them with better songs from the same sessions?  Well, you can.  Sort of.  There's an EP of MEMORY OF THE FUTURE out there.  (The one that has three other songs, not the remix one.)  Buy those four songs.  If you're a Bee Gees fan, find their recent cover of I STARTED A JOKE.  They released a B side collection and I recommend you trying HIT AND MISS off it.  Also -- there was a single not long ago called TOGETHER.  Get that one too.  And I CRIED FOR US off the same EP.<br /><br />Now make a playlist in iTunes (or whatever) and assemble a chill album.  Here's my order --<br /><br />1.  Memory (the version from the EP) 2. Hit And Miss 3. Listening  4. Requiem... 5. Invisible  6.  One Night  7. Winner  8. Everything Means Something  9. Together  10.  Leaving  11.  Inside.  12.  Give It A Go  13.  I Started A Joke  14.  I Cried For us<br /><br />Of course this up toyour personal taste, but here's how this album plays out.  First two songs good, next two pretty okay, next awesome, next okay, next pretty good, next okay, next awesome, next pretty good, next alright, next catchy, next great cover, next good send off.  No misfires.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I'm only writing this because I can't leave without writing a review and I need 5 more words now. Done.
B0055SWM08|5.0|strangely relaxing game/puzzle - calm and soothing soundtrack sets the tone for this app; you guide a raindrops through obstacle sets with changing rules and abilities. intuitive yet challenging.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting read. It was  Fascinating to get an inside glimpse of SEAL operations and the capture of Bin Laden.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book I've ever read. There's nothing bad to say about it. I loved the series I can't wait til the fourth book, \\"House Of Hades\\"
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first book and was hooked so I picked up this book and read it in half the time. It is just as attention grabbing if not more than the first book. It also leaves you wanting to read the last book
B00354YA4U|4.0|i didnt give it 5 stars because the conclusion was one sided it was abeautiful read sadly probably a truereflection of its period demonstrates the difficulty society has getting a balance in this area .have we swung too much the other way .it had touches of a true greek tragedy in that the cause of the tragedy lay IN the characters themselves & not in an external event off course our concept of trgedy has broadened since then to include the kitchen sink characters but maybe we are all in essence truley noble in our own hearts
B005UDD1R6|5.0|a most have if you down - load different for - mats of movies on to the kindle , works great
0385504225|5.0|I bought this for a friend for their birthday and they were thrilled. I can't comment on the book since I didn't read it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|love this s h o w can't wait to own the next s e a s o n, t h ank s!
6304981635|4.0|I bought this for a friend and he loved it. He's a big Bruce Lee fan so I thought I would surprise him and he loved it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Harder than I expected but a great way to kill twenty minutes waiting for an appointment. Fun and entertaining for kids as well.
B00006AFF5|4.0|I gave this movie a four star because it wasn't for me and I have not seen this movie. Not sure if its good or not.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was sure I would love this book because I had heard such great things about it.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.  It had its moments.  It started out very strong and I was pulled in very quickly but then things REALLY slowed down and the ending was extraordinarily disappointing.  The novel was repetitive and draaaawwwwwnnnnn out.  Overall a big disappointment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my first book I read from Colleen Hoover, however it will not be the last. This book had so many twists and turns just when you thought you had it figured out she changed it again. The book was so good my house is now filthy and my laundry is backed up but it was worth it!!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is way too addictive!  I can't stop playing it.  If you like match-3 games, this is the game for you.  You won't be sorry, except when you have to stop playing in order to take care of responsibilities.
B000002HK4|3.0|Can't remember what this was, so finding enough words to fill space is a challenge. If it's music, chances are I liked it enough to buy it.
0887081770|1.0|I love this book, but I expected to receive a regular size book for my grandson.  This book is only 3 inches in length.  I want a regular size copy of 'Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me.'
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wow, Gillian really had me going....She develops her characters well, but WHY couldn't she have given us a better ending???
0007466064|5.0|Husband wanted this for christmas and I was able to easily find it and have it sent before christmas! Thanks!
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Their video says any tv (sounds impossible). Once you install you find<br />out it's only specific tv's.  Not right, plus they want fbook access for no reason.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I love this game...it's addictive. However, there is a flaw in the programming and it continuously shuts the game down....extremely frustrating!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I absolutely love this app! You can easily monitor your battery usage and one you've calibrated it gives you accurate information on how much life your battery has left. It even has graphing capabilities so that you can see if the slope is really negative then your running out of juice quickly and you might want to quit some of the apps that are running. I would definitely recommend this app!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kept me guessing. Lots of twists and turns on this literary ride. Highly recommend this book. I will be reading more from this author.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|I do enjoy the show.  Yes, it's a remix of Monk, in concept.  Male with problem that makes him disfunctional, female aide that helps him keep it together.  He has a great mind for puzzles...  Nothing new.  I hated Monk, it was to me, too silly.  I however have found myself enjoying the less funny-guy versions in both Elementary and Perception.
1601251505|4.0|This is not a review of the content of the Pathfinder RPG core rulebook. Others have covered that well.<br /><br />Instead, I wanted to note a specific weakness I have seen on nearly every Paizo hardback, including the core rulebook.<br /><br />While the majority of the book is well made, a weakness exists in the creasing between the book's front and back cover and its cover spine. Anyone who uses this book over time will tend to see this area weaken and tear. It doesn't take much--or long--for this tearing to start. The worst cases see the cover's spine come loose completely. That this seems to afflict so many Paizo hardcovers calls for some sort of reinforcement, especially for a book that will be as heavily handled as this one will be.<br /><br />Hardcover books don't have to suffer this kind of damage under normal use, so Paizo would do well to see how they can improve this one significant weakness in what is otherwise an excellent production.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my great niece and ever since all I ever hear is how it is her favorite movie and thank you thank you thank you uncle Tracy... lol  I think that review speaks for itself....  Tracy - Kansas
B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a take on a match 3 game.  It took me a minute to realize how the game worked.  The game is very simple, kind of juvenille but not a bad way to occupy some time.
0920668372|5.0|I bought this for our little baby because I remember reading it growing up. It has cute illustrations and an even better story about the love of a mother for her little boy. Love it
B009JNXK88|4.0|I don't usually play this kind of game.  I prefer match 3, puzzle and word games.  But this was a free app of the day, and I don't know what made me actually try it out, but I did.  It took me a bit to understand it, and make the character jump and move but once I got into it I just kept wanting to get through to the next level, get 3 stars, get the case.  I've had to start all over again when I got my new kindle fire hd.  It's a challenge to me to play this kind of game & I still liked it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Probably the most amazing book I have every read. I'm in middle school and I understand how crappy people can act. This book is the perfect example of it. You can never judge a book by its cover, no matter how ugly, annoying, rude, hyper, shallow, unpopular or popular it is. Get this for your kids, tell them to read it, pretend like your like August. That life it rough, but you just gotta keep going. August Pullman is my hero, R. J. Palacio is an amazing writer and I hope to be one as well. I look forward to reading more of his books
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I love this game because its fun awesome and better than regular pacman I thinks its cool that it pops out instead of being flat I love it
0307895475|5.0|It's awesome game to play and plus the guide is the best to buy ..... You can look up all the short cuts fast and the guide got color pages to look at and the village map is awesome too!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great read.  It is very funny which is a great hook for the 4th grade through middle school crowd.  Both my 9 year old and 12 year old really enjoyed it.  My 7 year old (a strong reader) tried but it didn't seem to hold her.  I think it was just a little over her head.  The author changes it up by writing from different characters' perspectives all throughout the book but stays long enough on August (the main character) so that you develop a relationship with him.  Keeps things interesting.  Very enjoyable and an inspiring story.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I had no idea what the game actually could be useful for but pure glow.  Only to begin playing and become instantly absorbed in the challenge of completing each glowing puzzle. My brain was stimulated and happily immersed immediately.  Hours upon hours passed by numbing the pressures of everyday life.  Glow Puzzle has the benefits of a great gym workout without the sweat.
B009VL299E|3.0|Agree with the positive remarks about this DVD and the price was even lower at Walmart ($9.97). It's this compulsion Wayne Isham has with endless editing that he believes somehow conveys energy that's irritating as hell. His U2 Go Home editing is just as bad. He's relentless. Wayne you are filming a concert, not a music video. Please stop Wayne before he edits again. \m/
0307719774|5.0|I love this book and always keep a few on hand as gifts. It's easy and doesn't take a huge commitment
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It took me back to my high school days and reminded me of all the stress related to figuring out who I was and where I fit in.
