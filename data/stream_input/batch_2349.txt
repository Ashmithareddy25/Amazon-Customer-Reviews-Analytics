B00BF11STU|3.0|Very slow to start...  too many factual errors...  OK movie, but disappointed in the factual errors, and skipping around important aspects.  Makes it look like one lady did all the work when thousands of people work 10-years to find UBL.
B00B47NO2O|5.0|This is an amazing and addicting show. I read books of this nature. Not everyone will like it but you have to like thing's like this<br />To be able to get into it.  I work in a court house around the DA's office so I see and hear a lot.. keep up t he good work!! Ready for next season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I promise this will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you wanting more.  If you liked the previous two seasons, give this one a try.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a good book about some off the missions &#34;Mark Owen&#34; conducted with DEVGRU (SEAL Team SIX). It starts with his childhood, then BUD/s, then Green Team, then describes some missions he did in Iraq. The second half is about the planing and execution of the op that killed OBL.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Highly entertaining!!  I just love that series.  I am waiting for season 5 to come out on DVD next.  When will that happen?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have gotten so engrossed in Downton Abbey that it's hard to stop watching.  I enjoying viewing the background information and the actors comments about their characters.  What an OUTSTANDING, low key drama!
B009FZFONO|3.0|This season is nearing the end of a sustainable story... The first two seasons were excellent, but this feels more like they're reaching... Trying to make it last.  Would have been good if they wrapped things up, but I can only give it three stars since they tried to keep it open for another season.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME!!!!!!  This was the most fun and challenging game I have played in a long time. The graphics were great and the storyline was fantastic. Definitely want to play more of these!!!!!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|a more compact, slimmer design would be ideal but we can never have nice things. works as advertised: quick charge
B00A757EFW|2.0|Nothing like the 1980's versions. Removed this for my devise after just a few minutes of play.  Some things you just can't bring back.
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|Just to be clear this does not even come close to 7800 Degrees Fahrenheit or Keep The Faith (let's be honest Bon Jovi is never going to top those two recordings) however What About Now is what I consider the bands most solid release since Crush.  Overall I'd say this falls pretty close to the middle of their catalogue in terms of quality.  Although none of the songs on here are really outstanding, with the exception of Amen and Army of One (both which I can live without) most of them are enjoyable to listen to.  Final Verdict : What About Now - good solid Bon Jovi album that should keep most fans satisfied and maybe even restore a little bit of hope to those like me who weren't very optimistic after their last offering.  However don't go in expecting a new magnum opus on their part.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had just finished the Hunger Games, and couldnt wait to start reading Catching Fire. This book also keeps you interested from the very first page. Couldnt wait to finish so I could start the next book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book over all was amazing. I always had tears in my eyes.. I read it non stop. A good way to end the series. I love putting the audio in while reading because when someone reads while I read the book gets 10 times better !!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book completes the other two and it keeps you interested from the very first page. Hunger Games was a gift sent to me then I had to read Catching Fire, then Mockingjay. Couldnt put any of these books down.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Reads like fiction. You have to remind yourself that you are reading Pulitzer Prize-winning history and not a novel. A well researched, thought provoking work. Goodwin allows Lincoln's humanity to shine through the primary source material without bias or embellishment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun if you get it you will have the time of you life so go get it fast before its gos on the money side
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun but I think they should travel to Asia,Africa, and the Middle East. I also think that Kim in Sydney should be named Zoey and if they went to Japan the girl can be named Kim. But overall it is a good game.
160774273X|5.0|I have seen many quick bread recipes producing -at best- average results. This is serious treatise how to get real, fantastically tasting bread with real crust and texture without traveling to Paris
B007IUBU86|5.0|It's nice to hear a that can be so technically proficient but not sound sterile. This CD has amazing musicians on it but more importantly has not forgotten what a great rock album is about.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This was a very exciting adventure with many thought provoking situations. How do you set a civil society, as well as figure out how to escape from a seemingly impossible maze? I cheered for Thomas through the whole book and believed he would eventually lead the group out of the maze.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I KIND OF LIKED IT BUT I don't like people who uses their. e powerTESTING  over other. I LIKE the goods to win. oo
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved it, it was a creative story that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I can't wait to read more Mitch Albom books
B00BF11STU|5.0|Though the movie was a bit long, to me the story supported the length. It had a few disturbing scenes of torture, mostly at the start, and though I would not call it &#34;action packed,&#34; I enjoyed the story and the movie. It had moments of varying intensity and the ending was done really well.<br /><br />As far as Amazon’s movie service through our DVD I could barely ask for more. The picture was flawless coming over wireless. No buffering, as I get with Netflix. It may have been the time of day but I am real satisfied with the service.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Fun date night with my wife, even without anything blowing up.  I'll have to keep a lookout for Anna Kendrick in other movies.
B000NI9UMS|4.0|I thought the movie was very good, actually. I did not care for his laugh. I am not sure if that was accurate in any way, but it seemed silly, especially after a few times. If he laughed like that when he had a few drinks... Still, I did enjoy the movie and the actors did well around the main character, who also did well. I know it won a bunch of Oscars and it seemed to me a worthy winner.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not put it down.  A friend said she hated it, because inher life there were no people that evil-sick.  I don't know what that says about how much I enjoyed it...
B00B23O96A|5.0|I gave it a 5 star rating because I loved every song on this CD!  Eric Clapton just keeps getting better!!  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes him.  I love the old songs he's doing and I love the way he is singing them!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This was a good movie, full of the usual action & adventure. Daniel Craig is awesome as always. A nice movie for fans to enjoy!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|.... maybe a bit technical for some, but the technical stuff keeps it interesting (ok, I do some engineering) and really enjoyable.  A well written and complete story.. worth buying
B001XUJMZK|5.0|I love Mel Gibson even if he does'nt care for me Braveheart is one of my favorite i love the action in it overall he's a great actor
B0000C8AQM|5.0|The music was cool. I like the way Jack Black sings. I am amazed at the young talent involved with this soundtrack.<br /><br />I would recommend it to everyone!<br /><br />It shipped very fast also!<br /><br />Thanks
B00772M1F6|5.0|Saw JD when I went to see Bob Seger in Milwaukee! Soon as I saw the band, I knew I had to send for the CD........really glad I did.........on the way  to work it wakes me up!
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This is one of my wife and my favorite movies. We love 80's music, and Hugh Grant did a marvelous job bringing back the feel of the 80's. I liked the film so much, I had to buy the soundtrack.<br /><br />I would recommend it to everyone who has a need to feel good!<br /><br />It shipped very fast also!<br /><br />Thanks
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album starts out with that song of desperation, then builds to turn that raw emotion into something positive. I truly love Fun and MUST see them in concert. But they are sold out by me. I'm kinda bummed man!!!
0670026557|5.0|In GIVE AND TAKE, Adam Grant, a Wharton business school professor, has written an interesting study into the world of givers, matchers, and takers.<br /><br />And we all know what he is talking about.  We meet people, in business and in our personal lives, who fit into one of these three categories.  And while the takers may enjoy a brief advantage, in the long run something more powerful than karma awaits them...failure.<br /><br />Whether he is examining the world of academia, politics, investing, sports, Grant gives us tangible examples of the difference between the world views of those who give and those who take.<br /><br />The real power is in powerless communication.  While polished, assertive, strong monologues may seem to carry the day, it is the slightly hesitant, hedged speech that wins out.  Powerless communication can be in the form of questions or disclaimers.  Particularly interesting is the power of \\"intention questions\\" and how they actually move people to action.  Asking for advice \\"has four benefits: learning, perspective taking, commitment, and flattery.\\"<br /><br />The giver must caution against becoming a doormat, or burning out, the latter a common malady among teachers.<br /><br />While we seek common ground in our relationships, we do so while desperately wishing to be \\"uncommonly common.\\"<br /><br />The most practical chapter is the last, \\"Actions for Impact.\\"  The chapter directs the reader to websites to apply lessons learned.  For example, if you want to create a Reciprocity Ring (a powerful tool that brings group dynamics and connections into play to help others achieve goals), Grant directs you to the appropriate resource.<br /><br />The reader will be introduced to a number of interesting websites, concepts, and psychological studies.  I have since joined Freecycle, and have already given away an old, but still functioning, computer to someone  whose own computer was stolen.<br /><br />The 5-minute mentoring, clues on how Enron and Ken Lay were heading to disaster years ahead of the ultimate collapse, the idea of \\"selfish\\" and \\"otherish\\", the surprising taker mentality of Michael Jordan, Jonas Salk, and Frank Lloyd Wright all feature in this highly entertaining and practical book.<br /><br />Adam Grant has perhaps given us the best gift of all...his exhaustive research.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|At first it worked fine, but later on after playing it a couple of times the screen would either freeze or be really slow. I had to continually press the home button and once I even had to shut down my kindle to get it working properly. Really disappointed with this game and I would not recommend downloading it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The movie was nice to watch from home with a HD quality. Fast paced drama. Actors were great. Nice buy
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I own both a Galaxy S3 and an iPhone 4S and my girlfriend also owns an iPhone 4S. This portable battery pack has no problems keeping two devices charged at the same time.<br /><br />Definitely worth it if you have devices without removable batteries, this charger will recharge an iPhone 4S from 0% to 100% on a single charge.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|This is one weird book but as strange as the story got I couldn't put it down.  This is a masterpiece of suspense!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I normally don't read too much sci-fi but I just couldn't put this book down. Didn't get anything done before it was finished. I highly recommend the entire series (have only read the first two so far, because I will need to have lots of free time before I get the rest)
B006RBZV82|5.0|Looks great in HD and with 3D mode on!  Beyond the clarity of the Picture, It's a good educational walk through the undersea circle of life.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Very good book, I highly recommend it. Couldn't put it down once I started, so I will not get the next one in the series before I know I have lots of free time on my hands.
B0065RIJ3W|2.0|I was told this is the Gold standard for  aquaponic (AP) gardening instruction. It does have very good detail that should not be dismissed and so it is a fair buy. This is especially true  for the fish part of this process and seems to give realistic expectations for your fish. However, there are some things that are worrisome in the recommended setup.<br /><br />The book advocates a flood and drain system which is very common in AP gardening.  It also recommends a setup where filtration is done solely by the garden beds.  However, it does not acknowledge that the fish waste used for gardening will come with solids that will not be filtered correctly and will not be devoured by worms in the bed.  Ultimately if you do this method, you will find your media beds clogged with fish waste solids that will not benefit your garden. At the very least, It should be updated to include the use of mechanical pre-filters before using the garden as a biofilter.<br /><br />AP is still relatively new and the methods and approaches to it are evolving. Discoveries about things like management of solids and alternatives to expensive media beds are understood and should be examined and updated in this publication, otherwise there is some potential heartache.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I love this CD, it has all of Madonna's greatest hits from the early 80's to today. I feel in love with Madonna's music when my cousin tuned in to the local radio station in Dayton, Ohio- Z-93. To my surprise I had no idea who the musician was at the time; but he told me I would like it, the song Borderline. He was right and ever since then I have been listening to Madonna's music even to this day. My only problem with this CD is it doesn't have one of her famous songs on there, Don't Cry For Me Argentina. I was so hoping the song would be on there; but I guess I will have to download it from Amazon. I would recommend this CD to devoted Madonna fans and for those like me who just can't get enough of the 80's and the music.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It was ok. I enjoyed it. They just seemed to make really dumb mistakes. Those dumb people I really wanted to see die.
B006C45MRE|5.0|There was this great western genre of outlaws, lawmen, townsfolk and Indians. The two lead charactors had their own stories, plus the interaction of all too contend with the aliens. The preacher (Clancy Brown) was a good part.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|If you like a thriller with atmosphere, try this! The landscape of Lewis is perfectly captured with the language to describe the mists and storms well judged.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I am reading this series of books with my son. We are enjoying them immensely together!!!<br /><br />Dashner is proving himself one great sci-fi writer.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|A couple of really good songs.  Really like coldhearted and be my girl.  Pretty much why I bought it.  DRM based MP3s downloads don't interest me because it is far too easy to lose the license and not be able to play the song.  Of course that is the game.  Make you buy the same product over and over for a renewable revenue stream.  Very workable campaigns against a public so dumbed down and ignorant that they now believe that shopping is freedom and critical thought has been replaced in institutions of higher learning by blind obeisance to failed Marxist doctrine which history proves only leads to the enslavement of the people by all-powerful governments.<br />I can move songs to any device and hear them forever without ever paying another fee because in buying the CD I have eliminated all the MP3 controllers from messing with my listening pleasure.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Great movie and looks great in blu ray. My kids love this, I was worried at first it was too dark, but it was fine for a 4 year old.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a Very fun game !  Can spend hours playing it.  Worth getting it. Very smooth doesn't glitch hardly ever
B008Y79IUE|3.0|The movie depicts the dangers of drugs and how it can affect people of all ages and not just those buying drugs off the street.  It definitely wasn't one of those &#34;feel good&#34; movies.  It left me feeling sad and fearful of getting old.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was very intriguing.  It grabs you from the beginning I have to admit hearing about all the S&M in this book I wasn't sure but......the story grabs you and I was told to make sure I had the 2nd one ready to start when I finished #1 and they were right.  It leaves you hungry for more even after you finish book #3.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1 - 5 is a well written, gripping drama.  It was fun to read, but also asked important questions about our society today and what we want our future to be.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love to immerse myself in a time when people behaved in such a genteel manner.  Maggie Smith is wonderful as the dowager and it is great fun to watch her reaction as she faces the approaching new, modern world.  The contrast between the downstairs staff and the aristocracy is fascinating and eye-opening.  There are characters to love and characters to hate.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Very readable book with interesting WWII story-lines.  The social commentary spoken by the characters in the book seems closer to 2013 rather 1940.
0307476073|5.0|Wild is getting quite a bit of national buzz, my local friends have been pushing me to read it and as a result, I resisted starting this book. Reading Wild was a combination of a fuzzy walk down a specific memory lane of my early to mid-twenties and a current wish fulfillment fantasy. Author Cheryl Strayed is a few years older than me, her memoir is focused on her childhood, her teen years, her college aged time period and then her mid-twenties. Because of this shared timing in our age, the context and atmosphere that Cheryl wrote about seemed to be a shared memory for me ... to a certain extent anyway.<br /><br />In 1995, Cheryl hiked 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. Let's stop and think about that - Cheryl hiked 1100 miles on her own, with her feet - walking. She was 26 years old, she was alone, inexperienced, unprepared and depressed. Reeling and suffering from the unexpected death of her mother, surviving in a marriage that she was too young to make work and fighting a growing addiction to sex and heroin, Ms. Strayed sets out to change her life. She did this without access to money or a support network. At first glance, Wild appears to be in the same genre or category as Eat Love Pray. After all, is this not about a women's journey to become more centered and straighten her life out? But it is not the same story nor is it the same journey. Wild is everything that Eat Love Pray hoped to be, wanted to be and could not be. Wild is a woman struggling economically to overcome her demons and depression.<br /><br />Cheryl grew up raised by a single mother of three children who had escaped a violent relationship. Her mother could be described as counter-culture and before her time. She bought rural land in Minnesota and set up a sort of mini farm and rustic retreat, with very little funds and amenities. Despite the title (From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail), the book does not take place entirely on hiking trail - as I expected that it would. Cheryl gives context to who she is, talking about her childhood, her relationship with her mother, her mother's cancer diagnosis and quick decline, Cheryl's disintegrating relationship with her siblings and step-father after her mother's death, and discussing her youthful marriage.<br /><br />Cheryl spent the majority of her life outside the mainstream, at first not by choice but eventually by her own choosing. After her mother passes away, Cheryl is 22 and alone. She waits tables, does heroin and inexplicably cheats on a loving husband by repeatedly seeking out the attention of men. Cheryl paints an unsympathetic picture of a girl who is lost, sad and lonely despite having the support of a young husband who appears to be her best friend. But ultimately, it becomes obvious that he is too young and experienced to give her the help she needs and she is drifting and depressed. During the telling of this tale, Ms. Strayed is harshly critical in her portrayal of her younger self and lovingly paints an image of her young husband. In a way, the story is a tribute to those that loved Cheryl - to her mother and to her young husband.<br /><br />Aware that her life is going nowhere, Cheryl seizes on the idea of traveling across the country to hike an impossible sounding trail that spans thousands of miles. Unprepared but inspired, she prepares boxes of equipment and food to be sent to her along her hike and she sets out. Her backpack is too heavy, her hiking shoes are too tight and she is alone. Perhaps, it seems impossible that she could succeed; but her past life living without most Americans take for granted, living rustically and suffering give her the basic skills to survive on the trail.<br /><br />This book resonated with me and kept me thinking about the trail, nature and self-discovery for long after I read it. Cheryl endured the seemingly impossible - hunger, losing toenails, bleeding feet, hiking through snow in shorts, and the solitude of the woods for days and weeks on end.But the image of her pushing her body to its absolute limit and discovering herself is absolutely inspiring. Along the trail in 1995, Cheryl meets other hikers and develops relationships; at exit points along the trail, she meets other counter-culture individuals that were so familiar to me, I felt like I could reach out and touch them. She paints life outside of the mainstream during the early to mid-1990s accurately - and achingly nostalgic.<br /><br />Wild is a book for people who wonder - what am I capable of? Or for people who wonder - why do I hurt those that I love? Wild is for people who have lost someone they love and struggle to move past this loss. And Wild is just a great story about a girl who was lost and found a way to transform herself into a woman.
1401941893|5.0|I love this book! I already read lots of books Miranda talks about, and I loved hearing her perspective on it and how it helped her on her journey. The affirmations in the latter half of the book are nice but I think it would have been nicer as a deck of cards instead of bound in a book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|best movie ever  first movie I ever purchased in my 45 years<br />breathtaking, intriguing, and so fabulous to watch and see what happens next
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is finally the way the future will view these films for the rest of time.  Pacino, Coppola and the rest of the cast unknown at the time, but now also legends of their own, will live on!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. One of the few good movies I've seen in a while. I think Ben Affleck did a great job in developing this story for the younger generations.
0439813786|5.0|Hugo Cabret was purchased for a relative, who is the CEO of a clock company.<br />He never heard of the book and was totally overwhelmed and thrilled with it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I chose this trilogy after watching the film and upon the recommendation of our school librarian. i am not disappointed in the choice!<br />I love having the option of the books being on my Kindle as I can highlight passages as well as save them. Often i have 5-10 minutes of time to read and this book is then hard to put down and continue teaching math!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The first episode of Sherlock Holmes is VERY exciting.  The plot is great. There are all kinds of twists and turns along the way,  The logic is great.  Sherlock is perfect as Sherlock.  Highly recommend viewing it.
B0085RZGYU|5.0|This was another exciting book in the Camel Club series.  This one was every good and the previous ones and kept me reading long into the night.  David Baldacci is one of the best mystery writers working today and I look forward to new works from him.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very enjoyable reading...now I need to see the movie!  I will be sure to read more of Nicholas Sparks novels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it beacuase it is lots of fun way better than temple run so much better I mean way better
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read 4 Harry Bosch novels in the last 2 months, all superb.  There is never a clue where the plot will lead--the conclusions are always different from what you would expect. And as fast paced as Connelly' books are, he also has very good character development.  None of his characters are shallow.  I am glad he Is such a prolific writer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book for young and old adults!  I read it having seen the movie and it did not disappoint! Really good story and well written!

B00AFROVQC|4.0|Made me want to continue with the series...It ended in a way that wasn't so frustrating as it was compelling.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This movie was one of my all time favorites....If your wondering if you have any compassion? This movie will certainly give you that answer....I would love to visit the bronze statue in person some day....Two Thumbs up! BRAVO!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Michael Crichton picks up a new theme that is both terrifying and real. It was a little slow in the beginning, but once you get into the story, it is hard to put down. Well-written characters, a believable and frightening scenario, and a real twist as to who the hero's really are.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This is the second time I have viewed this and will probably view it again.  Wonderful acting and story line.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This was an entertaining movie for adults but too much violence for kids. I enjoyed seeing all the past action/adventure heroes together in one movie delivering some of their most famous lines.  There were a few laugh out loud moments from the old dialogues.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|A worthy successor to Stargate SG-1; was glad it was created - enjoyed the series as a whole; a few down moments, but overall very entertaining
1452110581|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my sister who has three cats, one who likes to pee on things!  The poems are cute and sweet and well done. The photos are adorable. Perfect for any cat lover.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|...and couldn't put it down. An absolutely beautiful love story between two young people and their dealings with fate. A book that will be in the mind for days. Ah! Loved it!!!
B004XCUEXY|5.0|I Loved it. It gave me a greater appreciation for a great band. I loved the access and all the behind the scenes stories and emotions.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I frequently just need enough coals to place under and above a 10&#34; Dutch oven. This smaller starter holds all I need and takes less space while traveling than my full sized Weber starter.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|The story was interesting and educational, but a little too short for a film. The views of the jungle was beautiful.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The e-book copy I read was full of typos and grammatical errors, but not so many that I couldn't read it. I would recommend this for the young and the young at heart.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I enjoy a quite game some times.  This is a nice easy going game to while away an afternoon.  Challenging,  but not time-controlled frantic!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I can't get the songs out of my head. Buy the soundtrack for your Ipod. You will not regret it.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|The characters are many and varied with depth and balance. Was similar to setting to Fall of Giants with a war background but historically very interesting. Is an enthralling read..
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the Walking Dead, one of the best episodes. Will be able to watch many more<br />times at my convenience.
B0096BIENY|5.0|If you like music, then you will love this one. Il Divo sings wonderful songs for everyone to enjoy and they harmonize wonderfully.  We love this one and sure you will too!
B00A0R0CG0|3.0|Okay.  Wish I had rented instead of buying it.  Worth watching once<br />but I probably won't watch a second time.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It was a little entertaining, but at the same time depressing and preditable. blah, watch if you're out of entertainment optoins.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Pretty good alarm clock. Hasn't let me down yet. I have used it nightly for over a year. Trying to solve a math problem when you first wake up is a unique challenge.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|Yet another example of how Hollywood destroys a perfectly good book. I agree Mo'Nique earned her Oscar. Gabourey Sidibe definitely needs to be considered as a good actress no matter her size. Of course the subject matter is all too real and painful to watch but that's not what makes this movie horrendous. It's the reality that someone with Oprah's time and money couldn't be bothered make sure production hired a decent screenwriter to bring Push to life properly. Instead they went for the tried and true Hollywood bottom line of sensationalism which, in the end, does the story itself a great disservice.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is a great help. it is nice to know voltage and temperature during charging while using the kindle. the alarms are nice too.  it is always better to spend the battery ALMOST all the way down before charging.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|awesome movie to watch with friend & family.<br />Yes I recommend it 100% strong message<br />love, love, love more<br />enjoy
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode is one of my favorite bands of all time!! And this release reminds me why. Each album is a re-invention of the band as a band and as individuals. Love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  game is awesome. don't listen to the people who give this game one star. GET THIS GAME it is the best game ever.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I didnt know what to expect going into this long awaited new release from one of the most important artist in my time!! He's back with the sound he was famous for on his early days and adds a new twist to it like only David Bowie can.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|I have most of Bob Marley's albums however, this one is now one of my most listened to.  One love.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|Nick Cave has a again proven that he can do whatever he wants and it will sound simply amazing!!! this is more on the softer, emotional side, but definitely a top 10 for last year.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|can't beat it for a free calculator.  easy to use.  I use when I pay my bills and balance my checkbook.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|How much do we in the West know of this man?  I remember watching this as a teenage and liking it, but not completely understanding it.  Now at 62 there is a lot more I understand about this important historical man.  He brought a concept to 3.5 million Indians and was able to cross religious and cultural lines and bring about a peaceful solution to a touchy situation.  Violence was not completely avoided, but it was certainly curtailed and showed the world what one person can do!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song on this album is a winner . Adele deserves all of the awards she has received. I play this CD in my car all day long.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had never watched Doctor Who before I started with this season, but now that I've seen it I can't stop. The ninth Doctor is warm-hearted, intelligent, goofy, and heroic; Rose is fun and caring; every side character is quirky and complex; and together they make a series that is enjoyable to watch, to re-watch and simply to think about.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I saw this at the movies and had to add to my collection. I love sandra bullock. If u have never seen it i suggrest that u do. Great family movie which happens to be a true story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a perverted piece of junk. The writer could not create consistent characters and had no story to tell.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I was expecting more of a comedy. It was a bit jarring at times, however, realistic. It didn't sugarcoat and was definitely relatable! I could watch Paul Rudd in any role (I have loved him since &#34;Clueless&#34;.) So, not all the laughs I needed (more tears), but great script & unexpected cameos that shined.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Usually, when I enjoy a book, I leave the book's movie disappointed.  It was not the case with this movie.  I loved it.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|&#34;Moonrise&#34;:<br />Too childish for adults and too many adult implicatons for children......Found myself wanting the movie to end with a different lesson objective...
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I think the rating in existence is right on money, still 3 stars right? There are plenty of somewhat funny part in movie, but nothing to write home about! It does get nasty at times, so no children under 16 or 17, depending on their maturity level? I had higher expectations, but it was a disappointment! Just another predictable storyline that's been used plenty of times! Rent \\"Something About Mary\\" again, I'll bet you'll laugh more & harder!
B0087YP862|5.0|Maria Joao Pires could be ranked as one of the finest classical pianists in the world and this performance is par for that course. I'm no technical expert but I recognize excellence when I hear it, and this is excellence! What joy and pleasure it is to listen to such a wonderful interpretation of my favorite composer. I would most heartily recommend this CD to all you Mozart enthusiasts!
B009NLC1D6|5.0|One of the telling stories of a sixth of Mankind leader's quest to dislodge an empire where the sun never set... without a single bullet.. from his preachings and or teachings and practices -- a mandatory lesson in history for all humanity
B003IPY4SI|5.0|I've been searching for older  jazz songs to learn. With all the different styles of God Bless the Child on youtube, I took my time to hear MANY versions....But, when I came across this Young Canadian Phenomena, Nikki Yanofsky....I NEW I scored BIG!! Nikki has a natural, God Given talent that just sets her apart from all the rest.<br />If you like a more modern vocal twist to older jazz, She's your girl. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I love this book because it opens a new world of understanding to me. It changed my view toward everything in life.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I Like the color, real HD. 3&amp;5 yr old kid like it. Teaches problem solving, puzzle. Would recommend this game.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|i love this cd - it shows his personality so well!  do yourself a hug favor and go and get it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun animated game may require pa th ience any one can play it  you have to update it whitch is fine with me
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this.  I am looking for multiple copies at a discount rate so I can use this is my classroom.  I love the way each chapter leaves you wanting to read the next.  I love the way the book switches characters and shows the reader different perspectives.  I can't wait to share this with my kids.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|This movie has been around for a while. I have seen it before and did enjoy it each time I watched it.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This is a good game, especially for the quick thinker and someone who likes to move fast!!  Although the Bonus Games were difficult for me because I thinking spatially is not how I usually function!
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Ben Kingsley's best performance. A well crafted portrayel of the life of such an amazing man. One of my all time favorites.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I think it is awsome how they made a dictionary for kindles and this book reminds me of a book called Frindle
B006885LZM|5.0|Tells a story that needed to be told in a highly realistic manner. A tribute to the men who won WWII.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I can't really find any thing that I don't like about it yet. The layouts are pretty nice it would be nice if there were a few more, and the flower tiles do kinda confuse  me but all in all great game.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Good acting, but could get the jest of the movie.  Had to read a Wikipedia review after watching to know what the movie was about. Then still don't know how phoniex's character played into the movie
0525478817|4.0|I only bought this book because i told a boy that i had read it and he started asking me questions about it. i ended up really liking it.. i read it in a day and not just because i was getting questioned. i really enjoyed it.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Nobody warned me that this movie had some really yucky scenes!!! A good protrayal on how one lie leads to another.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mr Flynn's writing style and plot development keeps you riveted to the pages as usual.  And, very timely as always.  More please!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Great app. I find a lot of the music I like here. Just wish prices were a bit more competitive.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old son.  He is a big fan of both Legos and Minecraft.  He was very happy with it and didn't mind that it was a micro build.  He liked that he could move and modify the different cubes.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Yann Martel pens a story based on a fictional interview with an elderly man recalling his youth when the Japanese ship he is travelling from India to Canada aboard founders in the Pacific. Having lost his entire family in the shipwreck he finds himself, a sole survivor, in a lifeboat with a bedraggled collection of escaped zoo animals including a Bengal Tiger. He is able to share the lifeboat with the tiger, named Richard Parker. The 16-year boy from India and Richard Parker are endearing characters relying on each other for grim survival. The reader discovers a lot about zoos which is educational. The hero uses his skills along with provisions discovered in the lifeboat to survive almost 300 days adrift. Despite a lifeboat journey being slow, the story is difficult to put down. I was brave enough to read it during an inter-island sea voyage in New Zealand, my home country. The story is apparently symbolic as partly explained at the end of the story. Maybe? But as an adventure story it stacks up. The 16-year-old principal character is brought up in a zoo giving the story credibility. An early line is that the story ``will make you believe in God.'' Interestingly president Obama agrees. I regret having missed the movie in its 3D glory. (I spotted some brilliant promotional posters hanging in Wellington's wonderful old train station.) The book, beautifully written, is not to be missed.  It demands a second read.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|this and the other alarm clock did not install. take it off my apps list a s a p. ty
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Only about a third of the way into the book but I am amazed how from 1956 he could predict so many things that are near common place today.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|this should not be in your apps choices. Some one needs to validate wheather this things work<br /><br />take off my list
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is the only application I have ever bought.  It has great replayability.  Easy to learn.  Levels will get harder and make you think.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|It is great.  There is just one glitch that I solved with a thin letter opener.  The negative film strips don't easily catch on the outgoing side.  I find I have to help them along by carefully poking the strip with my thin letter opener.
B004UPALT6|5.0|This is the original classic.  If you are at all a fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to see this classic.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Same as the other two, nothing new here, just lots of spinning camera views, running around and blowing things up.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|If you are a science fiction or western fan, this show is a must see.  The first couple of episodes were not quite as good as the rest of the season, but still good.  The real shame is that this show was cancelled right when it was started to get really good.  At least we got a decent movie out of it...
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is the poster child for shows that were canceled prematurely. It's a fantastic show, and be sure to watch the movie Serenity when you're done with it.
B004UPANGM|4.0|If you saw Evil Dead (original) then you know what to expect with Evil Dead II, similar story with a better budget.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Jodi Picolt is always a good read.  The characters are very believable and the story premise puts the reader in the mindset of &#34; what if&#34; this was happening to me.
0618001905|5.0|I picked this book up at a used book store, having no idea what it was about as I had no knowledge whatsoever of who King Leopold was nor of that part of Africa's history.  I could not put the book down.  It is one of the most interesting historical books I have ever read.  Adam Hochschild has written the book in a way that any layman, not well-acquainted with African history or, for that matter, any history, can read through easily and understand it completely. Leopold's need to \\"own\\" the Congo and his ability to be charming and charismatic in order to get what he wanted, and the ignorance of Europe in Leopold's endeavors and then the United States, was abhorrent to me.  Then to realize there were others at that time who visited the Congo and reported back to England what was really happening there; the horrible way the Belgium people, sent by King Leopold, were running the country then,how they were treating the African natives with forced labor and whippings, shootings, imprisonment, starving, etc., and then trying to do something about this horrendous treatment of these Africans.  I learned so much from this book, from the explorer Stanley (Stanley from the famous quote \\"Mr. Livingston, I presume) who was sent to Africa to find Livingston at the time and then later was hired by Leopold to explore the Congo and get ready for his takeover of it. Also, E.D. Morel who, along with Roger Casement, spent the larger parts of their livew trying to prevent the horrible killings, murders, etc. that were taking place and who gave their time and lives trying to right the terrible wrong that had been done to these native Africans. The author of this book,Adam Hochschild, states in an afterword of the book, that he had nine of ten publishers turn down his book for publication, one stating \\"Americans would not care about these events so long ago, in a place few could find on a map.\\"  Thank God, Hochschild found a publisher who would take on the book for publication.  Like I said, I accidentally picked up my copy at a thrift store but, inside the book was a piece of notebook paper with words and names, etc., written on it and appeared to be written by someone not speaking or writing English very well, so it is hard for me to decipher many of the words but these are definitely remarks penciled on this paper that have to do with this book.<br />What a wonderful book for anyone to read.  Rich with history not many of is kn0w about....history from the late 1800s, about a time and place and event not many of us have ever heard about.  However, we have all heard of the holocaust.  This book is written about another type of holocaust, one which is not in history books, one which was hidden for many reasons, reasons which are given at the end of the book. Even the people of the Congo did not have this history of their own people in their school books. What they were teaching was lies about Leopold's takeover, not the truth. What a shame.  But thankfully, someone, Adam Hochschild, has written his book King Leopold's Ghost and it is now out there for all of us to hear about....the slavery, horrific treatment, killings, murders, inhumane treatment of these Africans in the Congo.  This book is so rich in this history, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in history, and especially a history not many of us even knew existed.  Because of this book,even today,some things are being looked into in order to set records straight with accurate history. This is a must read for anyone interested in historical events.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|In the movie Finding Nemo by Walt Disney, Nemo is trying to find his dad and his dad is trying to find him, but on his dad's way he bumps into a girl named Dory. Dory is funny and brave.<br /><br />Dory is funny because she forgets everything except when they find out where Nemo is. In the beginning she says \\"Stop following me!\\" She also said \\"You're Nemo!\\" when she finds Nemo.<br /><br />Not only is she funny she's also brave. I know because she doesn't scream when they go the dark part. She also doesn't scream when they see that big monster. She also doesn't scream when the jellyfish stings her.<br /><br />That's why I think Dory is funny and brave. P.S. She has short term memory loss, don't pick on her.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so much fun! I played this gameme as a kid and it brought me back! It is very addictive
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I enjoyed Game of Thrones. Anyone who likes this genre will agree. I'll put this way I'm gonna start reading the books. That's how good the show is.
B00129H7VS|3.0|I hoped to sit and enjoy the blu-ray product however was disappointing to open my package and find that the product was sent a DVD. complete disappointment
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was an awesome read! Definitely deserves 5 stars!  This book had me hooked from the beginning. The characters are strong, cunning, & well written. One moment you are rooting for them, the next you can't stand them. The book keeps you thinking on the edge of your seat and is very riveting. Wasn't 100% happy with the ending but no big deal as the rest of the book was very good. I highly recommend Gone Girl! Looking forward to reading more of Gillian Flynn!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an awesome game for children to play and it works with every holiday and it shows how much you save to and its JUST SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!
B00574P9EQ|4.0|The whole family  enjoyed watching this movie. It's safe(not too many of those left). My grandson is a fan of the books and movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The cheat is a app called pocketinveditor pocketinveditor so with that app you can change a world from crative to surirval.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Another great read from a master story teller, well thought out and a pleasure to follow the trail.<br />One appreciates the planning that must go into the structure of the series to enable the final stories to be filled out.<br />The inevitable twist at the end to ensure you look forward to the next episode.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun and it updates every once in a while and every time it does you are in a different place like last time it was Rome and now it's Sydney.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Given the rumblings from North Korea at this moment, everyone should read this &#34;fictional&#34; account of the atrocities of life in North Korea. Horrifying and, weirdly, uplifting. And so random. That's the scary part. Well done, Adam.
B0081I08CI|5.0|This being the second book in The Ice & Fire Series, we are reunited with characters from the first book.  Like the first book there is dark clouds hovering above the families fighting for the right of the iron throne.  Now the book does pretty much cover everything that is in the series.  There are little things here and there I thought should have been in the tv series that had been removed.  I saw the t.v. series first so the books were not shocking story wise because.<br /><br />Some things I really wonder why they cut out of the t.v. series.  Like for instance there is a comet in the sky that is suppose to be an omen predicting doom.  I do not think this is even mentioned in the t.v. series and I kinda felt it needed more of the mystical.<br /><br />Only I complain about is they are so damn long to read.  I  just finished the 2nd book in time for 3 season on HBO.  So I have no idea what is coming.  I had hope to read the 3rd book before the show came on again.  That is not really important I guess.  The books may be long but still worth it.<br /><br />Amazing drama, and fantasy.  If you have friends that read the books you will find everyone has their favorite chapters or characters to read about.  The stories do tend to show the darker side of people... but it also shows how people still have hope and struggle to get normalcy back to their chaotic lives.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Book is very informative about Chris Kyle, I bought it for my husband who never reads and now he cannot seam to put it down, funny huh!
0142424277|5.0|Just the very thing I needed for my grand daughter who will be seeing the Broadway production in the coming months.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This was a great movie, I would definitely recommend it. It has an excellent plot that was carried out well by the actors
B007ZXK08C|3.0|We're a group of Champagne sippers and book reviewers! We were divided on our scoring but generally enjoyed the 'page turning' story. I was disappointed with all the hype about the book and watching the continued 'top' ranking - I was expecting more and unlike my fellow reviewers guessed the twists in the tale. Lots of 7/10s, a 5 from me and a sad 2/10 - the flip-flop character chapters were annoying. Sadly no-one liked the ending. The big discussion - who would play Amy & Nick in the Movie?
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I was a little hesitant to watch the movie after some of the reviews I had read.  But, I love the Lord of the Rings story so I had to.<br /><br />I didn't think this was as good as the others but I still enjoyed it.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|A dystopian future is the setting for this film.  2027 London.  The borders are closed, Everything is in chaos, illegal immigrate are caged on the streets of this city.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I recently stumbled across this show and love it. intriguing, great characters, good story line, it keeps me watching. good!
B00BQPXIH0|4.0|I've loved the Lonely Planet series of travel guides for a long time, but find the tiered &#34;table of contents&#34; format in the Kindle version truly obnoxious to navigate when you're looking for specific information. I'd give the guide five stars if the publisher can resolve the issue! (That is, make section headings and sub-heading and sub-sub-headings visible in the Table of Contents section so that you can immediately select the section you'd like to go to.)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever. It has so many quotable lines and is so punny! i recommend this to anyone and everyone - male, female, old, young, it was fabulous!
B009FZFONO|5.0|What can you say? Season 3 is one one the most exciting things ever on TV. Makes up for Season 2 which got bogged down until the end. For those who have never seen it, the zombies are really just the backdrop to an intense character drama about survival and rebuilding lives.
B0041YSBKC|5.0|Brandon Flowers voice is amazing and this album just shows that off. Such a good album. A for sure buy for Brandon Flowers / The Killers fans.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I started watching this because it was available on amazon prime! OMG I can't believe I had watched it sooner! I watched both seasons in 2 days and now am left WAITING for season 3 to start! Love it!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|It could have been so much better is they centaured more on the man and less on crooked government dealings.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just plain good.  Well written, not an ordinary police procedural.  Prolly pretty close to how it is in LA. If you start it, better have time for the whole thing.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love the fact you can play in<br />un-timed mode. Lot's of replayability. Plays great on my Kindle Fire. Good value.
B000002H2H|5.0|I love this album!  I still have the original vinyl picture disk but wanted to add the CD to my collection.  In my very humble opinion this is their best album with Garage Days a close second.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|This is a great pick-up-and-play game, something you can play in short sessions and quickly kill some time.  Gameplay is straight-forward and there aren't really amazing moments or flashy graphics.  But overall, this game is fun and justifies the 99 cents especially if you are a fan of arcade-action or platform-run games.<br /><br />The gameplay is very similar to that of Oven Break, NinJump, Granny Smith, Temple Run and many others.  It has simple 2D but colorful graphics and plays smooth, which is important for a game that's all about timing.  You play as Ninja Joe, who will always be running through each level non-stop from left to right.  The player has to react by swiping up to jump over obstacles, swiping right to dash across gaps, swiping down to slide under obstacles or to fall down faster, and swiping left to kick down barriers.  Simple enough.<br /><br />The 25 story mode levels are all pre-made and static, but the endless mode level is randomly generated.  I really like the fun comic-book style presentation of the story, and the game just feels very well done and highly polished.  The story mode does a very good job at easing players into getting comfortable with the gameplay and controls.  Completing a level may be easy, but collecting the 3 gems in each level will be challenging.  There are 3 boss fights, each a different experience in defeating them (e.g. dodging rocks that they throw or racing them to the finish), each interesting and sorta difficult in their own way.  Story mode seems very short, but getting all the gems and playing endless mode provides the additional replay value.  I was disappointed at the lackluster level design in regards to tying in the prehistoric theme... besides the few herds of raptors and the raptor bosses, there are no other dinosaurs to be seen (okay maybe a pterodactyl in the background, but that doesn't count).  Maybe integrating large dinosaurs as part of the level or requiring players to dodge the jaws of a T-Rex would have made the levels more exciting.<br /><br />There is a bit of confusion regarding rewinds.  Failing the level gives you the option to RESTART from the beginning, or to use a REWIND to go back several seconds before your point of failure to try again.  Rewinds are limited and are only for story mode, but you can earn them for free by playing endless mode or following the developers on Facebook or Twitter.  They are VERY USEFUL in completing levels and saves you a lot of frustration from restarting the entire level again just because you had a brain fart or a random rock falls on you.  I haven't been nagged to purchase rewinds, nor have I seen any ways to do so, which is good.<br /><br />There are many games in the same genre as Ninja Joe, and while this game may not completely stand out from the crowd, it has enough quality and value of its own to justify the asking price.  This game is a keeper.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|This is so underrated and one of the best records ever made.  I remember when it was released  in 1977 and being blown away.  I had a modest audio system at the time but a good set of head phones and when the needle hit the vinyl I was gone.  It was almost like a drug experience.  When the album got to Dogs I swore I was tripping on acid.  I was extremely lucky to be able to see this tour here at Soldier Field in Chicago, an experience that is hazy but unforgettable.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Thought provoking with beautiful images.  Not sure of the ending but made for an interesting evening.  Worth doing as a rental
B000002NZO|5.0|The Genesis of the Seventies was a very different group from the Genesis of the Eighties and the Nineties is an understatement of epic proportions, I am one of those who doesn't listen to anything after And Then There Were Three when they departed from their Prog-Rock format to pop.  That being said Trespass is one of their best albums.  My top 5 list would go something like: Foxtrot, Nursery Crimes,Trespass, The Lamb, Trick of the Tail.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This is one of those apps that wants to connect your photos to everything, kinda like instagram. I don't like sharing every picture, hence the 4 stars. This app is great for photo shopping your pics. It has a plethora of designs and add-ons for your pics. Not a bad app.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I have been a fan of Donnie Darko since it's release.  I absolutely love the hypnotic feel and rabbit trails writer-director Richard Kelly takes us on in this wonderful, thrilling movie.  Don't try to categorize this movie, it can't be.  The all start cast and amazing set design make this a truly engaging movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app running on all my portable devices. This has a large selections of maps and radars. My number one choice for weather apps.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|I owned this album in vinyl when it was released (Man, where did I put that record!) and this CD captures some if not all of the warmth and emotion from the vinyl.  It is a fragmented story at best but the songs weave a wonderful tapestry of sound through the brain when listened to on proper equipment.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I bought the 50 Shades Trilogy as one purchase on my kindle, in order to enjoy reading all three books one after the other. This was to ensure I remember the storyline and so that the story would follow on without disruption. I had no idea what the books were about, except they were on the best seller list in Australia for some time. Everyone was reading them, or so I thought, when they were constantly on the best seller lists. As an avid reader, I decided I must have them and read them.<br /><br />The storyline of this trilogy is romance. However the storyline is weak and the explicit descriptions of the sex scenes, which make up much of the books, are not for the faint hearted. In addition, the sex is very repetitive and if the repetition had been taken away from these books, only one book or as little as half a book would remain. I will not continue to critique further because many other reviewers have done this already. Suffice to say this trilogy only deserves 1 star and I will not read any other books written before or in the future by this author.<br /><br />You may be asking why I read all three books if they were so bad. The reason is I rarely critique a book unless I have read it all. There was an expectation that the storyline would improve and the sex scenes would slowly diminish, which would have improved these books as worthy as a piece of literature.
B002DQFHKM|4.0|Probably not the greatest music ever produced, but has a special place in my memory for the time frame I listened to it over and over! First anime hot/badass chick movie I ever saw. Don't remember the story so well, but South Park did a good enough recap to pique my interest in revisiting the tracks.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It's a very hard thing to adapt a first person, very popular book into a movie that makes anyone happy. These guys did a pretty good job. Of course there are things that book lovers will quibble about, heck, there are some that I'm not entirely happy with. But it's a solid, entertaining movie that brings some of my favorite characters to life. See it, and keep an open mind
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is great, I love the graphics and details. Who doesn't like creepy carnivals every now and then?<br />I like the choices they give you in the hidden object scenes.
B0000X61UU|5.0|It is a video that my daughter ordered and she loves it as she has found it to be very easy to follow.
B005EJNAK4|5.0|This action/thriller is a definite must see. The whole plot idea touches deep into the fact that we as a society have disconnected ourselves from the world around us and how a seemingly wonderful idea can go terribly astray.
B0091REZMW|5.0|so far seems great ; in. inventory won't take name change/<br /> should know more how game is in half hour.<br />nice music
B00683JK9K|5.0|aagain, magic puzzles has provided a great variety of scenes that are detailed and very beautiful. each picture is unique and there are many to choose from. I really enjoy the scenery pictures as opposed to pictures of specific animals or phenomenon
B0087EACJK|5.0|I installed this as the FAOTD, but now that I know  what fun it is, I would pay for any future app sequels. Many levels that really get you thinking.  Help your running man collect coins (also restore points) and the key to unlock the door and to the next level.  You will be shifting puzzle tiles, turning your tablet, returning to previous rooms and scratching your head along the way trying to figure  out just  how to get  to that door. Timer is ticking but just to show you the times to beat, not to limit your play which I'm glad for because  I've taken a lot  of time on some of the  levels.  Although I got this free, I would not have been disappointed to have paid for it because I have  not yet finished the game and and am having hours of fun fun with it.  Using this on my Kindle Fire HD and  have  had  no tech issues.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is a fun and interactive game for my 3 year old.  He loves letters and the alphabet and I love that this game is fun, easy to use and educational.  This is a great app for a child that is learning their letters and is not too advanced or complicated for a 3 year old.  The colors are vibrant and the pictures are very cute and age appropriate.  We downloaded the &#34;free&#34; version first and apparently, my little one liked it so much he downloaded the full version.  I would highly recommend this game!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|What can I say, these are great books!  The story is interesting and you never want to put them down.  Beautiful Darkness picks up right where Beautiful Creatures leaves off.. And while some things in the book will frustrate you (primarily driven by the teenage mentalities that are bound to frustrate most adults), it is still an amazing read!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Even though I felt somewhat prepared going into this movie, My Week with Marilyn was much sadder than I expected.  The story follows a young man, Colin, who is working on the set and has dream of producing.  Lucky for him, his first movie is with Marilyn Monroe.  Marilyn quickly takes a liking to Colin and without delay Colin does to her.  Marilyn was a well hated actress by this point by her peers and was an all together mess.  She is always inebriated and suffers serious mood swings.  Even though Marilyn is married, she and Colin do engage in an affair.  The story line is a bit transparent but the over all movie was enjoyable to watch.  I would say its more of a rent than a buy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Very good I enjoyed it.  Lots of child hood characters brought to life in one story.  If you liked you Disney movies you'll like yhis
B00932DCS8|4.0|This was an interesting movie with a good plot , interesting characters and alot of suprises. A well done foreign movie very similar to Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 2 is better than the first, filled with more obstacles, one huge monkey, and suspence. This i s a wonderful, and highly addictive game!:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great Free App that works well and has some fun graphics when you win. It is as easy to use as the version for PC use and it does not have any glitches that seem so common when games get miniturized. Highly recommend
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|i bought one for me and for my grandsons....we are all thrilled and i saved a lot over store prices.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I like the Russian Clause.  Story is well thought out and entertaining.  charactors are loveable, don't need to see again.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great story lines and very good production value!! My husband and I are addicted! Can not wait for season 4!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Why the Brits pull this off and we cannot, is beyond me . But the story  and writing are superb.<br />Caution, this series deals with real life.  Issues that we happen, but we don't like to talk about.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|AN EXCELLENT FILM THAT WAS SUPERBLY DIRECTED WITH MAJOR LEAGUE ACTING PREFORAMNCES BY ALL INVOLVED.  ONE CAN'T HELP BUT IDENTIFY WITH EACH CHARACTER AND HIS/HER SITUATION.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Classic Sharon Kay Penman. Well written, with a lot of really interesting history packed into a delightful read. Highly recommended.
030746363X|4.0|This is a fantastic book with a little something for everyone in it. But for me, the most invaluable part of the book is the section on fat loss. The methods presented here are truly a treasure mine for anyone looking to shed fat fast. In just one month of implementing, I dropped 11 pounds and my body fat was visibly melting off (through pictures and everyone telling me how much weight I lost). And I was doing this while gaining muscle (I'm an athlete, so that's very important as well). The diet presented is a very satisfying and sustaining way to eat and it works. All the side tricks that are talked about also work very well, when used in combination with the diet. I highly recommend this book, especially to those that are looking for fat loss and a sustainable way to eat for the rest of their lives.
0345803493|5.0|I loved the 1st book, the second book still held my interest but for different reasons, by the last book I had to push through it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I love YA novels, it's true. But as an English teacher I am frequently disappointed with heavy handed stories that portray angst like bad teen poetry.<br /><br />This one, however, stood out. A clever story, exciting characters, an absence of sexual shock effects... This thoughtful and thought provoking work deals with timeless  themes of love, loss, pain, choices, and redemption in ways that are provocative and moving.<br /><br />Formans fascinating narrative approach is remnicent of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and her story feels inspired by \\"August Rush\\", but none-the-less, the originality of the tale shines through.<br /><br />Bravo!
0345803485|5.0|I loved the 1st book,<br />the second book still held my interest but for different reasons, by the last book I had to push through it.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Too long, didn't seem to get anywhere.  Sometimes funny, but most of the time kinda depressing to see the disconnect of the couple, even though that's probaby what you were supposed to see!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book is the &#34;Startup Bible&#34;. It has real action items you should take to be successful in tech and non-tech startups.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A little slow moving but great performances and superb portrait of a truly great president and critical time in the history of our country!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Groban continues to dazzle with his voice, song selection, and arrangements  Like most CDs, however, the first one was the stunning beauty and remains my favorite; however, this one and all the others are superb!
B008476HBM|5.0|can't beat Jane Austen in spite of seeing the movie and reading the book years ago. what's not to like?
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I like the game but it is too wide for kindle use.  I have to shrink it too small to enjoy
B004DNWPY4|3.0|I thought this book was a very good book on personal finances. It did a great job of breaking the stereotype most have of millioniares and showed how people were wealthy because they had habits that put them there. The book also did a good job of showing how character plays a greater role in finances than income.
B007L6VR12|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom was a very enjoyable movie with a great cast.  I found Edward Norton preformance great for the character he was doing, along with Bruce Willis being a human being slash police officer and watching out for the boy so nothing bad would happen to the kid.  As for the movie itself I found myself laughing at mutiple scenes, remebering for me its was a middle school crush but not love.  But I could defently relate to the young love concept for the boy and girl in the movie.  I gave this movie a four star rating out of five because parts of the movie had me going you got to be kidding me, but overall a very amazing movie with a heartfelt message about a person's first love and what you would do to be with that first love.  I watch the movie with an open mind and heart and found myself actually ended up enjoying the movie so I disagree with some reviews because I might be 31 years old, but I still feel like a kid at heart at times in my life and movies like this help me remember my youth.  Plus at times I find myself wondering what happened to that part of my life, this movie and movies like it help me hold onto that part of my life and never forget the kid inside me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Each season it seems that this show just gets better and better.  The writers have done a great job with this story.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I had to change my ID site on my regular laptop.  However, when I went to my Kindle, I no longer was able to access my email.  I tried several times to remove and reapply the app to see if that would resolve the issue but it did not.  Had the same problem with the other email app that combined my AOl email account and the Yahoo.  With that one I can only access the AOL and the Yahoo mail is just there, frozen in time with the last day that I had used it before the change.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|If you're a fan of the FOO FIGTERS, you'll love this CD! A must addition for any alternative music fan!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is an amazing game it is good and FREE! !! you should get this game for sure hope this helps convince you to get the game
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Season 3 is very very good. I highly recommend watching it. I enjoy the themes of constant self improvement in this sci fi dramatic series. Also I enjoy the writing.
B00338QENI|4.0|An interesting blend of explored history of cells--- harvesting them, ownersip and use in science--- and the human side of families involved.
B006DZYM0A|3.0|It's was an ok movie but I thought it would be better.  Especially considering the hype.  Not as good as I expected
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Colin Farrell as great as usual. My open with all the action packed movie. I never saw the first one, so this was a good option to watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Who would have thought that a soap opera about servants in the early 1900's could be so riveting?  Tons of fun.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Not as funny as Knocked Up, but I was laughing throughout the movie. I'm guessing the unrated version was better, so that's why I chose that one over the other.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Entertaining and charming.  The kids were really good.  Bruce Willis and Bill Murray and Frances McDormand were really funny in their roles.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I'm glad I waited for this to come out to DVD. Inspiring but a little slow. Eastwood was good as usual.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This movie was a good sci5 but had some boring parts leading up to the plot.  Other than that, it passed the time.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|with action and humor. It was a last minute selection and not really on my radar. I never heard of it before, but glad I picked it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is lots of fun.  my daughters are 6 and 9. they ride horses all the time and this game is just what they need when we cant to the farm! I enjoy this game just as much as they do!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I was shocked at the abuse someone could put another person through.  I was glad to see justice finally served and how strong Cathy stayed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Even though this is fictional it starts instantly with intrigue and suspense. The prison depiction was perfect; added a lot of interest to the story.
B001CDZZI6|2.0|I had to buy this as a requirement for a job interview. Sent them the results and they were impressed with the combination of traits that the test claimed I posses. Honestly, I haven't researched this field enough to say that I trust these tools.
0425252868|5.0|My husband loves non fiction books and this was a great one.  True history.  He is a pilot so he understands the technical part of the book.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this show and have watched the episodes multiple time. Constantly working on keeping my collection updated. Season 4, check!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have read the books.  I think the production has done very well in maintaining a very intricate story line.  The characters are very well defined and I love Tyrion Lannister!  Season 3 cannot arrive on Amazon too soon for me.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Haven't found any problems with it. It is more or less like using a regular computer. Navigation isn't bad either.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|A wonderful production, lavish costuming.  I am a history buff and find the Renaissance the most fascinating period.  The Bogias have definitely fed my love of period productions.  I anxiously await Season 3!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This is a fun game, but you have to be VERY CAREFUL on tapping cards.  It likes to send the wrong card out on you!!!:(
B002APU580|3.0|Did not compare to the BBC production with Colin Firth.  However, I enjoyed it but not to the extent I did the original Masterpiece Theater.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have watched Castle from the first season and love the series.<br />Mystery is my top thing and this show is so much fun.<br />The characters are super--they make me laugh.<br />It is nice to watch Castle after a not so great day.<br />I like Castle's family and the interaction with all the actors.<br />Keep up the good work!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|It is nice to have an old friend for down time and this story has always been that for me.
B008B7OQHM|5.0|This couldn't have a better choice of songs if I had picked them myself. Plus the second disk contains the 2009 download festival performance. This is a must have if you are any kind of fan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was often told this was simply a \\"smut\\" book... I disagree completely! I love these characters, I love their stories & it's a full attack on every part of my body...head, heart &...
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie was exciting and interesting. When I found out that it was an allegory at the end, it added a new dimension, and I had to see it over.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great book! One of the best books I've read in a long time. We'll be reading more of the series!
B009AMANBA|4.0|I found the movie very interesting. I like history and I liked that they showed how politics and access to the president was done back then. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field were superb.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|I like this film because it has a fast moving, interesting story. Cast is excellent and the scenery is beautiful. The action sequences are thrilling and well filmed. To me, its the kind of movie that I have to hit the pause button to leave the room so I won't miss anything!  Pretty high praise indeed! Solid entertainment!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down. Good first hand account if a Seals life.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was a great read.  Even at my level in the work force which believe me is no where near the high levels she has reached, I could relate to the issues we women face still in the work place.  it helped me understand my frustration.  She also did a fair job of providing insightful suggestions and solutions.  I think she did a good job of exposing the real issues we yet face in 2013.  I agree we have a long way to go to achieve true equality.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|What can you say about Bruno Mars except that his voice is angelic.  I love this CD.  Buy this CD, if you love Bruno.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Mankell is a great author who makes you forget where you are.  You are there in Sweden where Wallander is a senior cop/detective, and you feel everything he feels . . . sees, touches, tastes, and smells.  You will love Wallander, the detective that holds it together long enough to get the job done, but then goes home and cries.  You will worry about him when he doesn't sleep because he is hot on the trail of a serial killer who seems unstoppable and when he's troubled because his father is falling apart.  And last but not least, you will get to know Sweden's people, weather, and their beautiful land.
006097625X|5.0|I've suffered through more Art History classes than I care to recall. They taught me a great deal about what's been done before, but the great questions of why does art exist was largely left to our speculation. Likewise, the practical question of why one would choose one art style over another was always attributed purely to the philosophies of the artists through time, reacting to their environment and the work of the artists before them. This did not imbue me with a great deal of respect for art.<br /><br />I really wish my Art History teacher had assigned this book. Scott McCloud talks more clearly about what art is, what it's good for, and how it functions effectively than the three semesters of lecture I had about what's gone before. It seems like practitioners of Art History talk about art almost exclusively through writing, but writing is a visual, emotional medium, and you lose a lot approaching it exclusively through text. By writing comics about art, McCloud integrates show and tell in a way that seems like this is how art was always meant to be discussed.<br /><br />Anyone learning about art or design should prioritize reading this book. Suddenly, art makes sense!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I don't write reviews so I am not the one to ask. I will answer whether I love or like or hate but I am not going to write a review. I never have and don't want to.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I can't believe this is free! It's great! There are a bunch of options for snooze and dismiss. Great alarm clock! And I haven't had any glitches!
B00992CF6W|4.0|My world won't load but it's still awesome game WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE ALL THE VERSION S THE SAME
B0087EACJK|5.0|This game is great.  I never leave reviews, until now.  This game is so different.  I have completed all but one level, and I don't want to wait for more.  I see so many ways to expand and create more. I hope they do!
B0049J3QAY|4.0|My kids loved this movie! However it did take at least 8 attempts to even start the movie because amazon was saying the server was down yet i was able to play other movies...this happens every time i get a movie from amazon
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great scripts, we got so involved with it that it became a &#34;binge watch,&#34; great acting, intense drama, would watch it all over again
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is an unbelievably charming series.  It is another English Period Drama, set in small town/hamlet life of the mid 19th Century where the insignificant details of these very limited characters is so enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The actress Julia Sawaltha from Absolutely Fabulous (and created such a wonderful character that can't be forgotten) is the lead playing a radically different dramatic role and is EVEN MORE MEMORABLE than her years from ab fab.<br /><br />Of course she does suffer from &#34;ONE WEAKNESS&#34; ... but you will have to watch the whole series to find out what that &#34;one weakness&#34; is.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|This is the one app worth buying.  It does a great job, and although the free version is good, I wanted to fork over the dollar for an app that was actually useful (for once).
B000WC3864|5.0|I am a big fan of horror movies and this movie blows my mind, it's a great flick from the old days!!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not only an amazing movie, but it teaches us a lesson. Its OK to be who you are and to stand up and believe in yourself. I watch this movie when i am feeling down and learn something new each and every time. It is defiantly a movie you should watch multiple times as you will learn something new every time. If Charlie can overcome what happened to him so can we. Standing up and being strong is what this movie is all about.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game... reminds me of DinoPark Tycoon. This game introduces us back to the original dinosaurs and brings in some new ones to keep it interesting. Get it ASAP!!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Albeit some of the acting is over the top, the story line is interesting from a human behavior perspective. Seeing the dynamics of the groups change due to the various challenges is great. This is a great way to view how the possibilties exist if ever here is such a catasrophic event which impactshuman lives in such a horrific way. So many similarities to Jericho displaying the survival of the fitness, group dynamics and the often horrendous effects one bad seed can be.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|LOVE THE GAME<br />BUT there are Too many ads. I will never buy Candy Crush Saga after having it pushed on to me every level. There is also  a small in game ad and two when your in between levels. Honestly its a bit abrasive after a while. When I first added this app last September the ads were very mild. Now that the game has a good rating its littered with ads. Its takes away from the game.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|I enjoyed it and it kept my attention, but the ending was not storybook.  I like storybook endings, I guess.
1616550414|4.0|I think this book is great. It is designed for a fan of the Zelda series with plenty information of the details of the saga. The Skyward Sword manga is not the best part of it but is intended to be a bonus part of the book. I think they could also include some information about the music with tabs and chords as the music plays a important part in the series success. The illustrations of initial drafts of characters give us a nice behind the scenes insight. The videogames industry is now very important for the world economy and Nintendo and other companies should consider have more products related to the Videogames .
0307474259|5.0|If you want to understand the science behind fat, this book will do it in plain language. His advice works!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really, really enjoy subway surfer because of the originality of it- I have to say- this game is much better then temple run! I think I am one of the biggest fans! An amazing game that you should be proud of! Xx
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!  I can't get off it!  It's like my totes fav game evr!!!  It rox!  I luv this game!!!!!!
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was great! Very good! Rick riordin is a great author... I will be reading the next percy jackson book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading A Storm of Swords, though it is really sad in places. His writing style is veryeffective and, with all the incredible number of characters, I've been able to keep them straight--a sign of an excellent writer!<br /><br />Reading it on my Kindle has been a total blessing and decidedly addictive, because it is so easy to use!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I was intrigued with how he continued to develop all the characters. With that many, it was still easy to keep the straight and to care about those that I encountered several times.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had read the graphic novel first and then watched the series on DVD, so when I read the book I really enjoyed it, because I learned a lot more about each of the characters.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I loved this movie. The animation was wonderful and the storyline kept me interested. It was quirky and had sutle humor in it that adults would like.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much....I am a dog lover and often wonder what it would be like to know what my dog is thinking.  I would like to believe he understands what is said to him and knows how much we love him.  Enzo was wise and I think my dog Jack is too.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Very nice diver watch.  I like the yellow on black and the fact that it is solar means not changing batteries for a very long time.  Seiko quartz accuracy to boot.  The strap is not very comfortable due to the ribs on the side digging into my wrist, but I swapped out the strap for a Rubbertech silicone watchband with a stainless steel clasp and it looks great and is much more comfortable than the stock strap.  Strap is easy to change out with a safety pin (external lug hole) or punch tool.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|Not his best work.  One or two really good tunes.  Some others become almost sappy.  Better to download the few songs that are appealing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was resistant to reading this at first because I thought the premises was really depressing.  However, this has turned it to be one of my favorite reads in a long time.  I loved that the main character was not really likable it made her seem more real.  I would recommend it, it is well written and a great read.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Twilight series got me interested in vampires and witches.  This book by a USC history professor is so much fun to read.  Detalied plot development.  Characters you can see in your head.  Historical facts and people in the right time and place although some fictionalization was used of course.  Much better than Twilight.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Time Keeper is another great book from Mitch Albom. The story twists and changes perspectives about time, life purpose and where is humanity focus. The story makes you think.<br /><br />This is the fourth book I read from the author and will be part of my favorites book to  re-read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I would recommend this game if you like hidden object mystery games. I will have to wait and see if this game keeps my interest. So far it is a lot of fun.
0307949508|4.0|It is tough comparing this novel to The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo. The first one in the series had a more interesting mystery however, this book was still an addictive read. Addictive in that you want to know the conclusion of the mystery but when it was revealed I felt more compelled to close the book. The author is talented the character of Lisbeth does grow as a person from the first book, the author does a wonderful job building an intriguing supporting cast. I wanted to know more details about the supporting cast than I did about Lisbeth at times. One technique I enjoyed was the author's ability to remove the main character out of the middle of story yet still make her the center of attention with the supporting cast.  My main complaint with the book is that the mystery of this book did not draw me into the story compared to the previous novel. The connections within the mystery were a little out there for my state and a lot of the events seem more like luck.  This could be something that the author had has an undertone in the book in that luck plays a significant part in our lives, whether it be good luck or bad luck. The supporting cast is what made this book for me especially the cast of characters in the police department, the politics and the tension between these characters was written very well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first one.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the best in the series.  Now I'm just stuck waiting for the next two books to be released.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY THIS APP. GREAT WAY TO HAVE FUN. WORKS GREAT ON MY KINDLE FIRE. I RECOMMEND THIS APP TO YOUNG AND THE ELDERLY.
1936608898|5.0|I've been told to cut gluten, alcohol, sugar, etc to lose weight, but no one ever told me why.  Obviously cutting sugar and carbs is good common sense but it was \\"so hard!\\" and so easy to cheat or disregard especially when the cravings hit.  I've never been able to stick with it. Once I gave myself a little, it's a slippery slope, and before I knew it, I'm right back eating the same amounts as before.  This book actually explains why each of the food groups they suggest cutting out is bad for my body in plain English that I (with no medical/science background) can understand. Once i understood what was going on, i suddenly lost (the majority of) my cravings because i knew exactly why my body was craving, and how my body was not functioning healthily.  It's given me the will power to not cave to those foods because i want my body to work right. It's given me a whole new outlook on my food intake.  the light that it shed will help me make smart choices for the rest of my life, not to mention improve my health.  Thank you!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down! I waited to read it before seeing the movie and so glad I did. It was such a great book from start to finish.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Second copy of this movie bought after my first seems to have disappeared (probably to another family member).<br />It's a &#34;feel good&#34; movie, if I've ever seen one.  I like the relationship between the characters, especially Kate's  character with her older neighbor.  I long to live in that country cottage in England, just to settle down in front of that fireplace and read.<br />I find myself watching this movie, on and off, during the whole year, just when I want a happy, sweet movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it only wish I had endless energy because I am so addicted! love banishing the differt phenomenon from the rooms. cant get enough of mystery manor!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and I approve 100% have a great time and have fun with this game and enjoy
B005FISBTO|5.0|Always love the Dexter shows.  The problem is that it leaves you hanging; can hardly wait 'til Seasons Seven is available at a reasonable price.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|People often tell me that I couldn't possibly be an introvert, yet I have always felt as though I was. Now I have a way to explain why there are two distinct \\"me's\\".<br />This book is helpful to anyone who works with, loves, or interacts with an introvert.

1595826971|4.0|I've wanted this book for years, and the CONTENT is amazing. Its full of wonderful concept art, and wonderful commentary by those who worked on the project.<br /><br />However. I gave it four starts because I ordered this NEW from amazon and when I received it today and opened it, the pages were bent and completely separated from the cover. I ordered two other art books at the same time, so they all arrived packed tightly in the same box. One was even still in a plastic wrapping, yet only Alice was damaged so it can't have been the result of rough shipping.<br /><br />So I warn you to be very wary purchasing this from Amazon -- its not the first I've heard of this particular book being damaged on arrival. Barnes and Noble sells it for roughly the same price.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|So sad cuz I love bingo games.  Unless I'm missing something obvious - which is possible as I'm no techie at all - am really disappointed that when you run through your &#34;free&#34; rewards to play this game you have to purchase, with real money, more rewards to keep playing this game if you are not lucky enough to win rewards.  In 15 minutes I found out I had to make a purchase.  Not happy.  Kinda takes away from the &#34;free&#34; download appeal.  Did not appreciate that this info was not part of the game description - so, once again, have a game that I can't use and can't get rid of.  Am finding out that the so-called &#34;free&#34; games are deceptive in what it requires to use the game long-term and lack simple -and I mean simple - instruction on how to use the app.  Wish to see better descriptions of how a game works before go thru download process and then can't play.  Would like to see any or better Help at start of game to describe game strategy.  Thought &#34;Bingo blitz&#34; would be straight forward but there was a lot going on on the screen and tough to figure out before it's over.  Wouldn't recommend , expecialy for anyone just starting to mess with this new technology.  P.S. Designers need to keep in mind that not everyone in the Universe came out of the womb with electronic &#34;stuff&#34; in their DNA.  Some of us have to learn along the way - with a little help from our friends...

B000XUHVY0|4.0|Good songs, the melodies tend to roll together. Strong sound, good lyrics & vocals, just needs a little more care to round out their style. I like the direction in which they are heading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wish that I had known how gripping this story would be, for I would have began reading it when I had the time to do so!  I couldn't put it down - I read until my eyes shut on their own.  Great story, excellent characters, and emotions you can feel.
B001KQGEL2|3.0|Not all that great, yet remains a pretty strong rock album. Most songs are forgettable with the exception of the title track.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books are excellent love stories, however, the sensationalism of the sex scenes is overrated.  By the third book, skimming over the sex scenes became habit.  They were repetative and almost boring towards the end.  This is truly a Cinderella story - very touching.  The character development of Christian was superb.  Well done.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|Not what I expected from this band, many of the songs are strong & loud. Every sound on the album captures an epic vista of adventure and exploration. A very filling sound, with quite memorable songs.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|This is a great movie for reminiscing with kids.  But they should be PG-13 kids or older, and you should review where to hit FF.  Follow it up with  &#34;an old fart's guided tour of YouTube...&#34;
0634022296|4.0|This is great just for the lyrics alone!  This book has all the Beatles songs with lyrics.  Chord boxes at the top of each song make it really easy to follow.  As a new guitar player, I really appreciate those. The chord boxes also make it easy to gauge the song difficulty.<br /><br />Being new to guitar, some of the easier songs for me to play have been: Eleanor Rigby, Norwegian Wood, Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da, Paperback Writer, and Here Comes the Sun.  Being able to strum songs that I know makes practice far more interesting.<br /><br />I hope the publisher considers releasing a version of this book in a spiral bound format so it will lay flat.  At nearly 400 pages this book is too thick to put on a stand.  I've considered scanning the pages, or tearing them from the binding and hole-punching them.  All I'm able to do now is put this book on a flat surface and set another book or object on it to keep it from shutting.<br /><br />Apart from that, the song layout is great.  The print is easy to read.  And the content is outstanding.

B000JMKTLO|2.0|I did not like this book at all. It just did not gel right. There were just too many deeply flawed characters. I love dark and flawed characters but you gotta throw in a couple regular ones too. People said this book was too dark and disturbing, I disagree. This book is no more disturbing or dark than real modern life, that's what I love about Flynn's works...the darkness is true to life, the stuff that goes on could have been pulled from the evening news. I loved Dark Places best, everyone should read that....and Gone Girl was pretty awesome... Sharp Objects just missed it's mark. Too much going on, too many issues piled on every character..overkill, too much of a good thing. Read her other two novels, way more awesome.

9626344059|4.0|Lovely book, but the translation is in stilted British English, not like the Japanese original (which is in hip, modern Japanese). Why would we say \\"torch\\" for \\"flashlight.\\" \\"\\"carriage,\\" for train-car, etc.?  Is this meant to make the writing sound more sophisticated?  I see that the translator is a native American, so I can only assume that he uses these weird translations for some special effect.  Is this supposed to be the Masterpiece Theatre version of Murakami?  The language gives this book an old-fashioned flavor, as though it had been written in the thirties or forties, maybe by Somerset Maugham or E. M. Forster, totally inconsistent with the content.
0060763280|2.0|Be very careful with this book.  You can lose ALOT of money.  This book recommends, taking risk, playing big, acting in spite of fear, taking action, making bets, etc.  If you don't have a way to recoup potential losses, you can go from having money to being BROKE in no time.  Follow this book AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I lost alotta money by following the advice in this book.  I threw the book in the TRASH CAN.  Never again will I read another self help book.  I was doing just fine by myself.  Yeah I acted in spite of discomfort, yeah I acted in spite of fear.  Yeah I took action, yeah I played to win.  And I lost my *SS!  Update:  His Youtube stuff is free and probably better than this book.  I'd say skip the book and just focus on the NUMEROUS secrets of the millionaire mind youtube videos posted up regarding him.  I did very bad with the book 3 years ago, but 3 years later I am coming back to his youtube stuff and will be applying what he teaches to something NEW.  I've done deeper research and read other books and honestly T. Harv Eker is right with what he teaches, so I have to try again I guess.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I use UPnPlay on my two android phones, so when I saw aVia on Amazon I thought I would give it a try. (UPnPlay is not available on my Fire.)

B00A1C17EK|4.0|\\"The Hollow Crown\\" contains Shakespeare's plays \\"Richard II\\" and all the plays relating to Henry V (\\"Henry IV\\" parts I and II, and \\"Henry V\\").  The BBC has done two other notable versions of these plays, \\"An Age of Kings\\" (1960) and the Shakespeare Plays series version in 1979.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />The earlier versions had drawbacks, despite fine casts.  The 1960 series was hampered by the crudities of British television of that time, and looks like it went out live.  The 1979 Henriad cycle was done on videotape in long takes (like most BBC television at the time). The 1979 Falstaff, Anthony Quayle, is considered one of the best Falstaffs of his generation, but his performance was obviously honed on the stage and was simply too large and boisterous for the small screen.  And 1979's Henry V, David Gwillim, was a fine actor but not persuasive as Henry.  And this version was done on a sound stage and feels stage-bound.<br /><br />\\"The Hollow Crown\\" (2012) has all the advantages of up-to-date television.  It perhaps compensates for the old way of shooting, with a steady camera, by too much camera movement.  It expands out, to give wide views of battlefields.  It tries to bring the early 1400s to life (though it may concentrate too much on the more unsightly elements).<br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent.  Who could be a better Shakespearean actor than Jeremy Irons, to lead the cast as Henry IV?  Simon Russell Beale, whom I know from his numerous appearances on BBC radio, is a remarkably lifelike Falstaff.  He does not overplay a role that tempts the actor into big voices and gestures.  He's also the first television Falstaff I've ever chuckled at.  Soliloquies are performed as voice-overs, and Beale is able to get serious near the battle with his speech on honor.<br /><br />Richard II, not one of Shakespeare's strongest plays, is a decent \\"exposition\\" play.  Henry IV parts I and II are masterfully done.<br /><br />The question is, how does HenryV stack up, since it is supposed to cap this tetralogy?  It's worthiness is especially important since this Henry V will inevitably (and unfairly) be compared to Branagh's masterful motion picture version.<br /><br />Cleverly, and audaciously for a first-time film director with few motion picture acting credits, Kenneth Branagh populated his \\"Henry V\\" with a veritable who's-who of great British actors, who enunciated four hundred year old lines to sound impromptu.<br /><br />Perhaps intentionally, \\"The Hollow Crown\\" runs counter to Branagh's \\"Henry V.\\"  For instance, Branagh's Exeter was Brian Blessed, a mountain of a man (and an Everest climber) whose delivery is extremely forceful. In \\"The Hollow Crown\\" Exeter is Anton Lesser, who at sixty looks frail, and who had a quiet delivery even in his confrontation with the Dauphin.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest question is, how does Henry V himself, Tom Hiddleston, stack up?  He's good.  And he has an advantage lost to Branagh, who had to establish his Henry immediately.  Hiddleston was able to grow into Henry from Prince Hal through two earlier plays.  Hiddleston's Crispin's Day speech was disappointing.  While David Gwillim simply stood there reciting the words and Branagh used the speech as a magniloquent showcase, Hiddleston delivers the Crispin's Day speech quietly, to a few people (one in particular).<br /><br />As (for the most part) with Beale's Falstaff, there seemed to be a conscious decision to forgo bombast in the small-screen approach to Henry's Crispin's Day speech.  This is totally a matter of taste(especially following Henry's heart-felt prayer for God to overlook the fault of his own father in overthrowing Richard II, which can lead to a Henry filled with zeal, as was Branagh; or to a sober and contrite Henry who understands what he's asking his followers to do).<br /><br />But since, in this case, the speech introduces the climax of a four-play marathon, I would have preferred to see a few (metaphorical -- and rhetorical) rabbits pulled from hats.  Hiddleston's Henry was trying to persuade a few of his men rationally and matter-of-factly;  while I want a Henry, whether on the stage, the big screen, or the small screen, who persuades the audience.  It's the viewer who needs to believe Henry would fight the battle all alone if everyone else deserted him in the face of a much larger French army.<br /><br />So, only a few quibbles, and those are subjective.  Otherwise, \\"The Hollow Crown\\" is the best Henriad out there and worth getting your mitts on (I got mine from the UK for a region-free player, and both were wise investments).<br /><br />I only hope someone gets the big idea to do the next (or, for sticklers, the first) tetralogy, which climaxes with Richard III  This would be a boon to civilization, as the Henry VI plays have been treated shabbily in previous versions.  In \\"An Age of Kings\\" (1960) they are done as well as the technology of the time allowed, but they are heavily truncated);  and the Shakespeare Plays version of the first tetralogy (1983) was done in a childish way, with actors wearing mock-horses around their midriffs.  Shameful. Hey, now they can make \\"Richard III\\" with new historical data, since they've uncovered his bones and have a more accurate idea about to his deformities.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy this game when I have a few minutes to myself. It is so fast paced and exciting! I strongly recommend it.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Although the main reason I saw this movies was because of my 5 year old son. I came to the realization that the story was much more than I expected and much deeper as well. My 5 year old son loves this movie, I think in part, because of all the talking animals and the aloofness of the main character. It speaks to me on another level. A social outcry to power-hungry politicians  that want to control the people. It's a stark look at the society of today as well as the society of yester-year commonly seen in movies from the past dealing with the 'wild-west' themes. A very well done film.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|This app works fairly well with the exception you can't play any of the games on Facebook because they use flash.I have yet to find a way to get flash player. Frustrating!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is really fun. if you cant have a real pet horse but want one I recommend this game for you.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I enjoy this album, most of the songs are quite different from there old albums but thats to be expected when you loose band members. Over all a good cd i love the song now and the video to it. For $8 dollars on amazon and you get the mp3 download that a great deal but i dont understand how it could cost more for just the mp3 version, do not waste your money on the mp3 only version. This has auto rip and right after i purchased the songs were in my cloud and could listen right away. Also to mention amazon your doing a great job, I ordered a roku with two day prime shipping was here the next day, same thing with the paramore cd delivered in less then 24hrs is really good for no extra charge.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|I won't comment too much on the movie itself (which I liked), as this is more of a review of the product's technical merits.  Warner Bros. has done a great job with this release in the A/V department, from the first-rate transfer to the IMAX aspect ratio transitions like &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; used.  The extras could be a little better, though: this isn't a fully-stacked release and it definitely feels like a more substantial edition will be released in the future.  If you liked the movie, this is still a solid product overall.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Small amp, powers my AKG Q 701 Reference Headphones like a champ. It seems to come with a usb cord that is only useful for powering things, no data through which it obviously doesn't need, but when I grab it by mistake it doesn't work for any other purpose. The preset equalizers are a nice touch and I find that with my headphones a little bass boost goes a long way, and the high setting is far too much bass. Would recommend for a very portable amp.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I ordered this DVD and Argo shortly after they became available.  This film falls short.  We all know the basics of this plot, so how these events are presented and tied together becomes vitally important to maintaining viewer interest.  This film simply presents a series of disjointed events.  I was left asking, &#34;So what?&#34;  There was no development of the story that leads to the conclusion.  There is also very minimal character development.  Was the real Maya this shallow?  I can't believe that Jessica Chastain was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I never experienced a suspension of disbelief in this portrayal, whether Maya is stridently admonishing a tortured terrorist suspect to &#34;be truthful&#34; or stridently admonishing her boss about how many days he is taking to evaluate a situation or tearfully (glycerin tears) recognizing that this phase of her life has ended and the future is unclear.  And please, my wife spent 4 years in Iraq and 2 years in Afghanistan; women do not wear Yves Saint Laurent business suits, nor even Ann Taylor, on FOBs. I had high hopes for this film and was left not really caring.
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|At least I did, ha. But then, I first turned on to Yes via Tales from Topographic Oceans...<br /><br />Anyway, to me there is no controversy: This is the most \\"amazing\\" of the Floyd's albums, because it's not supposed to be. And no matter what the band says or some fans say, it's a masterpiece, INCLUDING DISC 2, and it's always been the album that most deserves to be brought out of the closet, unforgotten in the light of what came later, with wide-awake attention. I play the thing and still say to myself, \\"How the hell did they get those sounds in 1969 when Keith Emerson didn't even own a synthesizer? When The Nice, ELP, Crimson, Moodies -- no one was sounding at all like this in rock? Did they get ahold of a first Moog? (The Monkees had one on their fourth album). Was the young Richard Wright a humble genius?\\"<br /><br />Yet this double-set in the early catalogue also rewards most after the most listens. I've now experienced enough of this oddity since 1981 that it seems there isn't a note on it that isn't purely musical. Maybe that's just the way my brain tweaked it, who knows. What attracted me at first was someone positioning my head near a speaker to hear -- with lights out, no drugs -- \\"Several Species--.\\" Yes, \\"The Narrow Way\\" is the grounding force and best overall, kinda regular song here, with its fascinating & repeated plunging, in each of the three movements, into the deeper, darker melancholic turns of melody; but this immediately prior piece by Waters, chirping seamlessly from the pastoral of \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" into the petrifying -- why call this song \\"erratic\\"? Is that just to mime the critics and appear cool? Maybe it's actually a marvel of controlled chaos. In any case, WEIRD is what it is. And *if one likes weird,* that's what will give you the patience to come back to the harsher segments of UMMAGUMMA time and time again. You sense something special and worth your time. The live disc is truly great, but the studio disc only needs those who like some avant-garde to give it its due respect.<br /><br />There's my rant. The remaster's on its way.ke some avant-garde to give it its due respect.<br /><br />There's my rant. The remaster's on its way.

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|SPOILERS! No I hated this book. If I could give this book 0 stars I would.  I'm sorry, I tried really hard to like it. But reading about her as a 5 year old being raped by her own father was too much for me. Not to mention absolutely disgusting. No matter how cute Holder was I can't get past that. I feel like my mind was raped!! I will be reading a different book and as soon as rape is mentioned I remember this book and feel like vomiting. I'm all for trying out a different story line and not having a cookie cutter book but this was just abhorrent to me. I like cute love stories and a little darkness but not this dark. Anyone that is prickly toward young age-rape or forcable incest don't purchase this one. I literally had to delete this book from my account so I could try and forget this one.

As a sales coach and trainer I have read all there is to read on the subject of Sales.  Daniel comes from a fresh new perspective with solid ideas that are easy to understand.

Russell Allen is one of the best metal/rock vocalist around and he just slays these tunes. Gave it 4 stars due to short track listing, but the quality and musical talent is 5 stars.

B008602KQI|1.0|This movie is horrible. I'd recommend Leonard Part 6 or Howard the Duck over this, and those are truly dreadful films. To call this a teenage Running Man remake is giving it too much credit. Turn off your TV and go for a walk with a friend. Thank me later.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Have all three of these books.  Book one was awesome...couldn't get enough and could not wait for book two.....almost as good as book one, but getting a little old.. Still good and I'm sure still every woman's secret guilty indulgence.  If you read book one you must read book two and you haven't read book one read it before book two
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This was in excellent condition. Opened and watched it right away. The disc was in great condition. It's a great movie we will get a lot of use out of.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This books storyline was kind of irritating.  Gideon (main character) is off the charts with his emotions and moods and Eva is always the &#34;therapist&#34; trying to analyze the situation and keeps making excuses to save the relationship.  Overall it is steamy but not like Fifty.  Editing was pretty good though.  It seems like it rides on the coat tails of E.L. James and was written in quick succession in order to be profitable post Fifty publication, in fact it is almost blatently riding on the same theme as E.L James' books.  It just proves you will never re-do a good sex story.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy this game when I am sitting down to relax.  I love trying to get a higher score each time I play.  It is addictive..........
B0011WMHRK|5.0|I asked my vinyl junkie father if he has any Can albums. His response, \\"Who is Can?\\" Serious? How did this band stay muted for this long?<br />Complaint first: Behemoth tracks Aumgn & Peking O could easily have been made into a single song that stays under the 10 minute mark. If they want to run for that long, is it too much to ask that they keep the great percussion that the rest of the album follows? That's almost 30 minutes of experimental noise.<br />Even with that annoyance, Tago Mago is awesome. Halleluwah does what the two tracks mentioned above should have done: Extended jamming of how the rest of the album sounds.<br />Highlights: Paperhouse and Oh Yeah. I can't decide which one is my favorite. They both fill out 7-plus minutes with great sounds and vibes.
B008393Q2O|4.0|! So can only compare the two.I have been using another app called COLORNOTE forseveral months<br />On colornote, I have many sharing options from email, facebook, text, a several others, but skinny note only opened email to share. I will stay with colornote.<br />Colornote only does txt and checklists.<br />Colornote's screen looks more basic, which doesnt matter to me because I do a lot of writting with it. I have also used colornote with dropbox to import and export txt
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|OMG! Just when you think he doesn`t get any better . He tops himself . Clint eastwood , Was absolutly funny . in an unfunny sort of way . Great movie . the 4 times that i have watched so far . I always find something new ...
B005LAII4E|2.0|The first movie was corny but entertaining. It all fit together and I somewhat cared about the characters but the second movie missed the mark. I wanted continuity and that is why I went to the movies to see it. But there was no explanation of what happened to the original team. How did they die or did they die? How about a dream sequence with Duke explaining what happened? What happened to his girlfriend? Did she recover from the brainwashing? Is she alive? Is she dead? Did they reconcile? How did Duke get promoted? Then Duke dies (disappears) in the first few minutes in a less than spectacular fashion. In addition, the one character that should be dead, Stormshadow, is alive with no explanation of how he survived after falling in the ice in the first movie? The battle on the side of the mountain with the Ninjas was worth one star but, for me, adding the Rock and Bruce Willis to beef up ratings and credibility seemed like a marketing stunt.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I love this African-American movie of such a romantic fairy tale. The songs are fun, and you may find yourself singing along. I just fell in love with this movie when it first came out, and had to have it in my collection.
B00AEFXZ1C|5.0|A film classic.  I first saw it when I was on leave from an assignment in Nigeria, West Africa.  Was able to rack up six viewings before I got back on the plane, but was able to get a CD of the soundtrack which become the unofficial theme song of the expat community.  It is still as great a movie as ever.
1449410243|5.0|all this time i thought my cats loved me, but now i know they r just plotting. this was a fun book and i think anyone with a sense of humor would enjoy it too. especially cat lovers.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Our three grandchildren absolutely loved Wreck-It Ralph.  It was a surprise gift and one of the best surprise gifts we have given recently.  Highly recommended.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Really enjoyed this thriller, particularly the different twists and turns the story kept taking. The characters really come to life.  I thought the ending was disappointing.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|What can you say?  Schindler's List is a movie for the ages and never fails to move the viewer every time it is watched.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this movie..Very good quality..not interruptions.This is not for kids only..I will say for all members of the family....  :)
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|No matter if you have had to &#34;grow up,&#34; Peter Pan is a joy to watch.  Even more fun to watch it with grandchildren who are not familiar with the story and are growing up with computer games.
B004GYY714|5.0|I enjoy the versatility in music genres and access to global stations.  My only dislike is the &#34;shake&#34; feature on my Android phone which I haven't figured out how to disable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love Ken Follet's books and is a great book to read I was very happy to find it available for my kindle!<br /><br />Thank you
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the weather app to use. I love the updates. It works perfect on my kindle fire. A must have if u want to know an accurate weather forecast
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|I liked this film quite a bit. Everything except the ending I guess. It's not all about the blood and guts - it's the storyline and like how like another reviewer pointed out - it creeps up on you. I will admit though - the main actress wasn't THAT great of an actress, but she played her role fairly well. I'd recommend this film overall. A good one to watch in the dark.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|The bumper is well made, and comes in his original package, if you can't buy from the official store this is a good option.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book with the just amount of great philosophy. Loved the continuation of story. Are there more of his books coming?
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is a great battery backup unit. as soon as I opened the box I needed it for my note 2 phone. I had been reading and taking pictures and the battery wasdown to about 25%. Right out of the box I plugged in the Anker backup unit and within about one half hour my phone was 100% and ready to go again. I've now had it about 3 weeks and it continues to perform very well.
1598878735|5.0|Lots of musicians in our house - always looking for more effective ways to approach practicing.  This book (on tape) lit us on fire!!  Teaches and reinforces the importance and necessity of good teachers in all fields - especially with our treasured young.  EXCELLENT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so great it has great reviews and I play this game all of the Time and it is a game that you can just keep playing because you can't finish it.
0439023521|5.0|This book may be characterized as young adult or teen, but being long past that age, I found this to be a fantastic book. The plotting is great and characterization is not short-changed a bit. The central characters are all young, but that does not preclude adults from enjoying it as well. I definitely will complete the series.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Best ending in the world I loved it is a lot of romance great plot left me speechless<br />.loved it!!!!!!!-
B008RA3X5E|1.0|My current time is 11:41pm PST and this app reads 8:08.  Since it's military time I assume that is a.m.  So,my clock is 9 hours behind and I cannot correct it yet.  I'm on WiFi so that's not it.  Setting an alarm on a clock 9 hours behind, is near impossible and I need to be able to trust my alarm.  I can't return it... there's no option given in my account on Amazon.  Glad it was only a dollar, but they<br /> add up and if it happens too frequently, I'll have to consider my options.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It's the Dark Knight rises trilogy.... It doesn't matter what I say, you're still going to buy it no matter what.
B005LAII44|2.0|I gave it two stars. One star because the action was fun and I did laugh through the movie. The second star was because the seat I was sitting in was comfortable. SPOILER ALERT... serioulsy, why did Duke have to die? It has been many years since I saw the cartoon but Duke bites it by taking a Serpintor snake through his chest or something. Here Duke dies by hovering helicopters and oh by the way, with every other Joe except for a handful. Come on!!! Why did RZA play blind master? Why did Cobra Commander leave Destro in the chamber? At the end of part one he was saying Destro would serve him. When did Cobra Commander and Destro have time to talk and change things? Another issue I have with this movie and the first one is, why does each Joe have to wear the same uniform? It's freaking rediculous and basically took away from the chracters in the movie. I was in the Army and saw alot of special forces guys and though they may be wearing the same uniform, they looked different because some may wear hats, scarfs, glasses, or what have you. They tried to deliver a unique version of Joe and in my opinion they moved so far away from canon they should not make a sequal, wait five years and reboot this whole thing. And please, do not hire a director that has only made dance movies. Common sense would have lifted this movie up.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Even in this movie the black guy is always the first to die. But I love it so much. Fatty woo!!!
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|Reading user reviews I purchased this for my Surface Pro for business purposes.  I am not getting anywhere NEAR 1000Mbps speeds, I am averaging at 100Mbps, it has gone over and says it's connected at 1GB in Network Adapter Status.  Going through a 16 port Cisco switch at home I was able to get around 250Mbps but that was all, it never even reached USB 2.0 speeds (480Mbps). I have tested this on another Surface with the same results.  Followed the advice in the Reviews and installed the latest driver before plugging in the adapter.  It saw the driver's right away and installed.  Works much faster than wireless but I have to say I am disappointed that I am not getting speeds others are reporting (tested on multiple devices) so either the adapter is messed up or it thinks it's connected to a USB 2.0 port.  I am going to give it another week but then it's probably going to go back to Amazon.  Bought this for personal use, going to get the company I work for to order another 3.0 LAN adapter to compare.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this book.  I think it's amazing.  It puts everything in perspective. I would recommend that everyone read it.
B00B7G23KQ|1.0|I dont know why I do this to my self. the first 3 were awful, yet I wanted to give this one a shot. Same tired story that goes on and on and on. This franchise doesnt look to entertain, just to profit.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard, I got it when it was free on the appstore after dealing with a chappy stock one on old phone
B005NFVZTM|3.0|Not much a comic book person, but the effects were quite good. The acting was okay and the story was interesting.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Awesome book - loved the background information that I didn't know about. Totally respect Dominique she is an amazing lady.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I really love this series and it's great to own one of my guilty pleasures. Now I can it watch whenever I want.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome!!! I can't put it down. Just wanting to know what is going to happen!! Although I don't really like that it's about killing people it is a great read.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Like all of Grisham's books it keeps you entertained the entire time. It's such a sweet swee. t stiii. ory loved it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait for 7.0 :O I hear u have to buy online servers :-\ and u can't change ur skin without making everyone look like u but this game overall is the Boom
B004SIP6WW|4.0|A &#34;plump&#34; Sylvester!  Pretty good movie for the gernre, well acted by the players, it had one or two weak plot/scenes that didn't quite live up to the rest of the flim but not to critical, I just thought it could've been done better.  Still a good story and well done film.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|An interesting book, but no new grounds covered and way too many expected coincidences.  One more plot twist in favour of either on the narrators and I would have given this one star.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This movie is absolutely exceptional.  It brings everything Eastwood to the screen in superb fashion.  Hilarious moments, tear-jerkers, and plenty of occasions where you truly feel like you know the characters and their motivations.  I loved it - most movies I watch once and that's enough.  This is something I turn to whenever I don't know what else to watch - each time is equally satisfying.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I never played the first one but I am completely addicted to this game. Graphic s are great, difficulty is perfect, variety in characters, and free. Can it get better?
B006PKGO40|2.0|Another low budget, low quality film built around a sexually attractive woman who couldn't act her way out of a high school play.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game because sharks can eat people. no other game has sharks eating people. this is the best game I ever had.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|A fine movie that skillfully addressed some very sensitive subject matter. Helen Hunt was superb to begin as well as her co-star. Actually, all the cast were very good. If you do not have an open mind, skip this movie. It deals with subject matter that is not just peripheral to societies concerns.
B0084IPVOU|5.0|When I reviewed A Clash of Kings I said I'd try to wait about eight months before I read the next book in Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. My goal is to pace myself so that I finish the last book written shortly before the next book is published. I hate to wait on books in a series, and Martin is no \\"a book every year\\" author. I actually made it 10 months this time, so I'm pleased with my strength and internal fortitude.<br /><br />That being said, the book was fantastic! The series gets better with each successive installment, which is saying a lot. I won't bother with a summary, since the book is just part of a much bigger story. Rather, I'll give a couple quick reasons why I'm so impressed with Martin and the books.<br /><br />First, people die. I'm not talking side characters either. There are hundreds of characters in this series (enough to fill several pages of \\"who's who\\" at the end of each book) and dozens of them are central to the story. But none of them are safe. I should have learned that lesson while reading the first book, but I still find it startling and surprisingly rewarding every time it happens.<br /><br />Second, stuff happens. These are not 800-page Tom Clancy books that you have to wade through the first 400 pages of before something significant to the plot happens. Martin successfully manages to keep several plates spinning at once with all of his characters and subplots and he maintains a relentless pace for each one.<br /><br />I can't recommend these books enough, but I do so with the warning that they're not for the frail or easily offended.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|Ms. Knightley did a very good job. Although I liked the movie, I think I expected it to be more than it was.<br />Forget the hype about it, but see it anyway.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The book is written from a dogs point of view which makes a very different and fun book to read.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|this is essential with you camera and works wonderfully! Doesn't show and blocks the sun and other things great. Buy it
B009M4KTEM|5.0|You don't get much better than this and the recording is as crispy as can be .... LOVE JERRY BAND
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Brilliant!<br />So easy to read and hard to put down.<br />Highly recommended!<br />Looking forward to the next book.<br />Thank you Jojo Moyes
B00A757EFW|5.0|This brings back many fond memories of playing this on the &#34;Atari&#34; with my siblings as children! We used to sit for hours and play it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|wow que aplicacion Mas asombrosa, wow this allocation is awesome,  I do not understand why the people do not like this.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I use this on my kindle and have so much fun figuring out the puzzle. It helps me relax sometimes!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great.  It was intense, kept me wanting to more and more.  And it had a good ending!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like to play this when I am trying to relax...it is fun trying to figure out the puzzles! This helps me calm down!
0375869026|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in a while. I give this book a 5 star rating, because not only can adults relate to it but young kids can as well. This book is one that I will pass along to as many people as I can. They way the book gives everyones point of veiw is amazing. I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like it,  but the way R.J. Palacio has written this book it all just flows so nicely. I loved how the book gave real life references throughout the entire book. This book is one that I will have on my shelf in my future classroom. -J
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to go on there and find new recipes for many things and craft projects! It is so fun to look at all the pictures and see what everyone else is making!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book.  I could have read it in a weekend, but instead chose to pace myself slowly through it, much like Cheryl's pace in the trail.  I'm glad I did, it gave me time to absorb her writing and discoveries.  It made me want to go out and do something adventurous!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like to use this on both my Kindle and home computer...it is fun to catch up with long lost friends and family!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the most beautiful book I've ever read, to be completely honest. And at the end of it, I feel as if a piece of me is gone, only to be returned the next time I fall in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. My heart hurts in a good way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love being able to play this on my Kindle. It helps me relax when I need to or just need something to keep my hands busy!
B008XOXGCO|4.0|My best buddy from senior high school told me about this band recently.  I picked up the set after he raved about \\"Hall of Fame.\\"  It's a very strong set.  My favorite track on the set is \\"Glowing\\" with its pumping beat and a lyric that sounds like a plot outline from a Julia Roberts movie, \\"I woke up this morning to a kiss just like a whisper, an empty suitcase, and I knew that you were gone.\\"  \\"No Words\\" also has me reach for the repeat button with its airy background vocals, great keyboard wall of sound, and the lyric that traces the search for romance in a less-than-romantic world, \\"I could talk all day long about dreams, sewing up your heart so you never see a seam.\\"  The CD concludes with another great track, \\"Millionaires,\\" that is catchy and sticks in your ear.  While #3 is my intro to this band, it certainly warrants further exploration of this excellent band.  Enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing this book continue to rack up amazing reviews, and seeing the relatively low cost, I took a chance and picked it up for my Fire.  Within the first few pages I was hooked and powered through the entire collection in the next two days.  Mr. Howey made such an impression on me that I bought the &#34;Shift Omnibus&#34; the day I finished this one and read it in a couple of sittings.  He does an excellent job with creating intense situations, character building, and weaving an intricate storyline.  I'm definitely looking forward to more entries in this series!
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|Eric Burdon's new CD is a welcome return.  The set opens with its strongest track, \\"Water,\\" with its churning guitars; and the gravel in Burdon's voice seamlessly suiting the material, \\"I will not give up, and one day soon, the truth will spill into your sitting room.\\"  I also love the slow song \\"Wait\\" with its samba-inflected beat and Burdon's voice churning in an exquisite sadness, \\"In your arms, I will always find heaven.\\"  Many of the other tracks show a strong journeyman's hand with Burdon's voice still expressive and turbulent.  \\"Memorial Day,\\" \\"In the Ground\\" & \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" are powerful.  Burdon's voice is a classic, always interesting.  Enjoy!
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I use an original Kindle Fire for this game and it does not work. It's slow and choppy, eventually forcing the kindle to close the app. What little of it did work looked great and I wish I had a better device to play this game with.
1449410243|5.0|Very funny cartoon book. A must for any cat lover. Well drawn and very humorous. Am now a regular visitor to the author's web site!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's perfect length to run behind a computer desk to keep the cable out of your way while charging your kindle
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The best book for a teen to read. It makes you laugh, smile, and it makes you want to find the one you love.
0812993845|4.0|Kinsella's books always make for fun, light reads. I can't think of a single one of her books that I haven't enjoyed slipping into! This romantic comedy alternates narration between two sisters - Fliss and Lottie. In the aftermath of an unexpected break-up, Lottie embarks on her latest Unfortunate Choice and older sister, Fliss, is not pulling any punches in trying to prevent Lottie from her hasty decision. There are several laugh-out-loud scenes that make this a bit of a danger to read in a public. It's fast-paced and just a lot of fun as each scene comes to vivid life. Yes, it is a bit silly, but in all of its silliness it adds to the cinematic quality to its hilarity. Kinsella has a gift for balancing humour, good intentions and romance into a fresh, fun and original novel. I am already looking forward to next spring's release!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this game is fun. It is particularly annoying if someone in your house is better at it than you are
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|Game is well done but the store almost never connects and provides credits. In several attempts it has not connected and delivered credits, which is frustrating if you need a specific item. Game controls can also be slow to respond.
0679805273|5.0|This book is so perfect for anyone graduating or moving to something new. It is also a great children's book in general.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This would be great for someone new to hidden object games.  Need to be able to zoom in easier to search rooms.
0618918248|2.0|When reading any Christian/religious book, you often expect a relatively clear pro-religion slant.  Perhaps I was naive in thinking that Dawkins would present a well-reasoned and nonbiased approach regarding the issue of belief in the supernatural.<br /><br />What I found was a handful of relevant arguments scattered in a myriad of inflammatory, condescending statements that, quite frankly, paint about as arrogant of a picture of the atheist community as the over-the-top religious books do of the religious crowd.<br /><br />It was a decent read, but again, the guy seems to be incensed against the religious community and I found that this took away from the supposed objective approach he claimed to hold.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|felt like it really happened....I liked the way it was laid out, rather than a story method the journal method added a boarder dynamic.
1400069807|5.0|I wish this book was promoted more and eventually made mandatory reading for everybody!<br />The book is very well documented and easy to read...difficult to put down!<br />Yes, it's scary to find out what we eat daily and how little choices we have in choosing to stay healthy...but better know and try to take action.<br />Conclusion: try to eat home cooked meals as much as possible and give up processed food completely...Even so, there is still a lot of salt, sugar and fat to be found in anything on the shelves.<br /><br />if you decide to read it, please pass it along to friends and family...They'll thank you for that!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I love this man and all his writings .. This is a wonderful book a must read.. Give it a chance he is a wonderful mind to learn from
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I'm hooked on this series and getting the dvds is one way of being able to recap last seasons Thank You
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|without a doubt, top album of the year. i can't stop listening to this one - its a gem. Can't wait to catch them live.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first saw my little sister playing and became cusious. So I got the app...and lets just say I'm hooked on it!  It fun to play to pass time, but one thing I don't get is how that fat guard can keep up with me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am moderately addicted to this game on all of my devices.  This app on the Kindle is much easier to move the cards accurately than the one I play on my Nokia 920 (Windows 8 phone).
B009IUH1N2|3.0|This is just like any other platform scroll-er sort of game. The menu presentation is good. The graphics are average and the challenges are easy to play but it becomes too repetitive and I found myself bored after playing few levels. The objective of this game is to collect gem pieces that are strategically placed on the path and those are supposed to enable the dying master to get well again??! - Whatever!<br /><br />There are tons of obstacles on the way across about 25 grueling levels. You must use your fingers with UP swiping action to jump the Ninja Joe and avoid crashing into walls and holes in the path. Sometimes the gems are perched right in the middle of the gaps of the path but our Ninja manages to pick them up if you use your fingers with a right swipe action. You do all of this while simultaneously running forward and the screen along with some animation of birds and other flying objects keeps scrolling in the background resembling a typical scroller type of game.<br /><br />The comic book type narrative might be interesting for some and gives you an introduction to why you must run, jump and collect the needed gems. The English needs little spell check here and there but that is just a minor quibble and easily fixed by future updates to the game.<br /><br />Overall it is okay and I rate it with 3 stars to be fair as I was offered this free. But if you want to pay 99c for it you must really really like platform scroller type games to justify that price tag and does not disappoint you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't care for very many Facebook apps and prefer to check my Facebook on an actually computer.  As far as Facebook apps go this one is pretty decent.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I am glad to get to listen to Bob Seger on mp3 finally. It was a long time coming. These are all great songs. The only thing I would have liked different was the studio version of Turn the page. But I will listen to these over and over anyway.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Got this CD for the iTunes library I have on a shared network in the home. The wife wanted them so I got em! Came much faster than advertised and well packaged.<br /><br />LKS
B007XF0X6G|4.0|The story line here is only ok, but the 3D affects may be the best in the business currently. I actually ducked at several times. I liked it better than the first. And of course, the owl from the old 80s version is in the movie, sort of. You will have to watch and see.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I would recommend getting a lot of god quality sand paper. I could use some practice using this tool, but it works great!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have always loved this movie. The remakes are often ok, but none measures up to this version. Maureen O'Hare is classic and Santa speaking Dutch to the little girl still brings a tear. Don't leave it in the closet till Christmas. Watch it any time.
0767836324|5.0|A great movie to watch with the family. We watched it years ago when my boys were little and now we have the opportunity to enjoy it with our grandson.
B00475BUVM|3.0|This is a good movie, not great, but good. The 3D affects were not very good. I doubt I will watch it again in 3D unles someone requests it. The sequel has much better 3D affects. Overall, a fun movie.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Shocking and heartbreaking, this bio is a page turner and guilty pleasure.  So hard to believe, it must be true.  I'll never again feel the same about Shirley MacLaine.
B003L16FAE|4.0|This is a very fun movie, with good action and fun action actors. I have seen it many times on vhs and I am glad to own it on blu-ray since we no longer have a vhs player. It will be viewed many times.
B008B68IEA|5.0|My daughter loved it for her Monster High doll house.  It was well made and I received it very quickly.
1780721676|4.0|The Fast Diet is a good investment in improving one's health.  The book is well-written and the Fast Diet is simple and fairly easy to follow.  I only wish there was an edition featuring American weights and measures ... however, that's what conversion charts are for.  I recommend it highly for both men and women.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|This app allows you to tag certain people not just \\"share on your wall\\" .which isn't possible with my Amazon Kindle web browser. It's as close to the facebook to use on a computer as I have ever seen and works very well.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Volbeat does it again! These guys have put out great albums since their debut album and this one goes on the list as well. A must buy for anyone into Metal/Hard rock
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Always was fasinated by Mars and find it hard to turn a book down about it. Wasn't expecting the humor in this book. Kept me chuckling all the way trough it. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommended!
B000L9IUPM|5.0|Very well done n entertaining.  Rare for a group to stay together that long, and still doing well.  Audience contact thru out was great.
B003TQKVGU|1.0|Too many  words to say nothing<br />Very old methods that doesn' work<br />Faith .... visualize.... gives examples of people<br />that have solve problems by praying ... etc<br />but this  are only examples , how this works for you?<br />But no specific techniques  at all<br />Very  disappointing, poor book<br />Not recommended at all
B00BAB6CNC|3.0|I love Stone Sour but this could be their most boring album yet. I normally don't write many reviews but seeing all the stars I felt I had to put my 2 cents in. Overall boring and disappointing album :/
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved this series and recommend it to people all the time. I am looking forward to the next season!
B0095P29EG|5.0|I dig super hero almost anything - but I don't read comics. This was predictable, yet amusing and visually impressive. FUN and ENTERTAINING, those biceps!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Ms. Morgenstern has created that sublimely rare gem of great narrative, compelling characters, and a superb setting using finely crafted writing; all of this accomplished in her debut novel. As I have noted elsewhere, there are a number of authors who are successful; they provide a good read and keep us connected to their novels that do one or two of these things well. They might provide good narrative and a compelling world of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series. Her characters are fine but the writing is just adequate. She doesn't carefully craft her sentences. Many people look down their nose at Ms. Meyers, but there are many, possibly most writers who are good at some of these aspects of storytelling that are still worthwhile to read. I've read the entire Twilight series as well as The Host. I'm glad I did. She is successful for a reason, but she doesn't execute on every one of these elements of writing.<br /><br />Morgenstern is one of those very rare authors who do it all. Each sentence, description and phrase is a marvel. She almost takes the care of a poet, but over many pages. We become fully immersed in her characters, her world and her story. We do so in the \\"air\\" of her exquisite writing. She is a delight to read. I will pre-order anything she cares to write. As she's noted in her blog, she won't be cranking out a book ever year; I'm absolutely good with that. Her writing is worth the wait (said now in the early cycle of waiting for her next piece).<br /><br />The Night Circus contains a number of threaded stories that weave together into a beautiful, whole cloth. The book would have been great just getting to the circus or just with the character studies of the principles and the unfolding of their relationships. It would be a great novel simply living within the magical elements or immersed in the parties at la maison L&egrave;fevre. Not only does it have all of these elements but weaves them together in a beautiful dance that provides a coherent overall show. Of course, don't take my stilted words for it but let's see a marvelous example:<br /><br />\\"The Cloud Maze<br /> An Excursion in Dimension<br /> A Climb Though the Firmament<br /> There Is No Beginning There Is No End<br /> Enter Where You Please<br /> Leave When You Wish<br /> Have No Fear of Falling<br /><br />Inside, the tent is dark-walled with an immense, iridescent white structure in the center. Bailey can think of nothing else to call it. It takes up the entirety of the tent save for a raised path along the perimeter, a winding loop that begins at the tent entrance and circles around. The floor beyond the path is covered with white spheres, thousands of them piled like soap bubbles. The tower itself is a series of platforms swooping in odd, diaphanous shapes, quite similar to clouds. They are layered, like a cake. From what Bailey can see, the space between layers varies from room enough to walk straight through to barely enough to crawl. Here and there parts of it almost float away from the central tower, drifting off into space.\\"[i]<br /><br />I will not go into the storyline (see Amazon's synopsis here) in fear of given away the plot. I simply will conclude with unfettered praise for Ms. Morgenstern's writing; she is absolutely fabulous.<br /><br />A couple of side notes: I jumped between the Kindle edition of this and the audible (despite the fact that Whispersync for Voice isn't enable on the Windows Phone 8 app - I'm looking @ you Audible development team). Jim Dale (of Harry Potter fame) does a wonderful job reading The Night Circus. If you like listening to audiobooks, I highly recommend his work.<br /><br />The second note I wanted to make is that reading this work gives me hope for a more civil, connected public discourse in an increasingly divisive America. I suspect that Ms. Morgenstern and I have starkly different views of social, political and theological issues. I don't know this, but a New Englander that graduated from Smith would notshare the same worldview with a conservative Christian living in the South. Despite this, Ms. Morgenstern draws me completely into her world; I absolutely connect with her in the portion of her thought life she makes available in her work. This encourage me. If we can connect, surely we Americans can connect with one another better, have a more civil discourse in those areas where we diverge and listen to one another more often. I don't anticipate that we would change each other's views; I do believe we can respect each other without doing so. There seems to be this thought the tolerance for one another depends or either not believing there is an objective truth (\\"what you believe is true for you but not me\\") or we should not be strong in our convictions (if you are, you're a fundamentalist). I would rather have us acknowledge our stark differences and firmly, but humbly, hold our beliefs and yet be civil to one another. The connection engendered by Ms. Morgenstern and her work gives me hope that this is possible.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[i] The Night Circus, Erin Morgenstern, Kindle Edition, Location 3151the same worldview with a conservative Christian living in the South.

B0050XFY4O|1.0|Definitely not my kind of movie.  I wished I hadn't rented it.  I have to be more careful when I select a movie.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Groban has the most peaceful voice on the earth. Listening to him is like putting a balm on your soul.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very different NDA than I have ever read.  Dr. Alexander does an excellent job of explaining his journey in lay terms  while backing up much of it with scientific facts.  Should provide a tree at of hope to all.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of this series.  This was one of the best yet.  The storyline is so interesting and current that you won't want to put the book down.  I highly recommend if you enjoy a &#34;24&#34; like experience on paper.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the historical aspect, love the Abbey, incredible cast, went through episodes all night,  Maggie Smith's quotes are favorites at work
B004124VG2|5.0|The sound quality on this album is quite wonderful, but that's something I've come to expect from Sufjan Stevens. This is well packaged and will still be great to listen to years down the line. It's worth buying on vinyl.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Long. Sometimes hard to understand in the old english. But wonderful<br />Everyone should read it.<br /> It was delightfully wonderfully vampirish
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I just started this game today and I am already addicted. I love the fast pace and hand eye coordination.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|The soud is great on this cd who needs records. Wayne shorter has been around a long time. It is nice to see that he is still performing so well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game deserves five stars. it is really fun. and I  like to spare time with it. soooo.... cool biz!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack joyride is a one button game, you continually touch the screen to fly up, and you let go to drop down, dodging obstacles to try and fly as far as possible while collecting coins to purchase upgrades. It ends up having a lot more than that of course, but those are the basics. The music is catchy, although it is repetitive. The graphics are the absolute best I have seen on a mobile phone game, and it works great on my old LG Nitro HD.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, and the tenth anniversary edition is very nicely done.<br />I won't give a synopsis, but will say that there is no one to whom I would say &#34;don't read this. It is not for you.&#34; And that is very rare.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|A faithful quality updated version of the classic movie. This was my mom's favorite movie while I was growing up (she died in 1995 while I was still a kid) and I worried that it would not stand the test of time/memory. But it did. Julie Andrews sings beautifully, which comes through much better in Blu-Ray digital audio than it did on VHS. The imagery of the hills, lakes, and trees come through so vivid and alive it is infectious in its life. The story is uplifting, the acting is above par, and my memory's grow fonder. A great movie, though it does seem a bit long for very young viewers. My wife had never seen it and was entranced (she is 28 if it makes a difference). Definitely a drama/humorous video, NOT an action movie or true comedy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoy good writing more than a good story, and I enjoyed this immensely. I don't like crime stories, usually, because I get impatient and peek ahead to the end when I'm about 1/4 way through. I don't want to get attached to the bad guy,but  in this book I really just wanted to read the story and get to know the characters. Flynn is a master of turning a phrase. And I did not feel cheated by the ending, maybe because it wasn't really important to me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Easy to find objects at levels 1-10, but as the levels go higher the objects are more cleverly placed and more difficult to find. Keeps your interest. As the levels increase, more rooms are available to explore.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Superbe interprétation d'une artiste devenue incontournable. Je suis un inconditionnel de cette interprète qui a décidé de faire connaître la &#34;grande&#34; musique suivant des voies inhabituelle pour les conventionnels du classique

B009X01D9U|5.0|Easy to install your Fire HD 8.9  Great, user friendly product which I hope will endure the test of time & usage.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie.  Great movie for the entire family.  Best Quote &#34;What is the first rule of Hero's Duty?&#34;  Ralph says &#34;NO CUTS, NO BUTTS, NO COCONUTS&#34;  Priceless.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Needed some editing but great series! Definitely read in spare time to avoid blushing in public!! Not with mom lol
B00846REIS|1.0|After the disappointment of \\"50 Shades of Gray\\", I was expecting something better on this one. And I couldn't even finish it! Really boring story, with characters that are obviously unreal with no interest at all. These two books made me feel completely uninterested in erotic novels, something that I regret. Hopefully, something consistent with some quality on this genre will fall to my hands at a some point.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie on Amazon Instant has been a life saver with our son in the car several times. Worth the money.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This is an all around solid album with a variety of styles. There were a few songs I could do without but the majority were great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not Grisham's best but still a good, quick read. The plot kept me guessing for a while although I wish a few more details had been given at the end.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really liked the variety of styles on this album. I especially loved the second half of the album but the entire thing is great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Seriously the greatest story of every possible emotion ever written!!!  I read this in two days & haven't picked up a book in over 4 years!!!
B007L96SI6|5.0|Love her unique, bluesy pop style! This was worth waiting for. I highly recommend this album! It will appeal to multiple tastes.
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|It is just a good spin on adult life. I thought it was very entertaining and funny.  Bought it on blu ray with digital copy after having rented it and enjoying the film.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I bought some stellar headphones recently and wanted to upgrade all my favorite albums. I bought this one, sat down and listened to the entirety of it, and just had a blast. For hundreds of listens, ten bucks is very worth it. If you like Dark Side of The Moon, buy it. Essentially, if you enjoy being happy, then buy this album.
B004SKJTY6|3.0|I'm sure there are many reviews here that will give a synopsis of the plot, so I'll just say I liked the movie. It had no car chases and gunfights so that's a plus right there. Good acting, believable dialog, and of course, success in the end. A pleasant movie, enjoyable.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|As much as I love and respect Howard Jones, Jesse's return is the best thing that ever happened to Killswitch Engage.<br />I discovered the band in 2002 with Alive or Just Breathing, which to this day is still one of my favorite metal album.<br />After Jesse's departure, I still listened to every album, but missed the Alive or Just Breathing sound.<br />I gave Disarm the Descent about 20 spins and I must admit I'm really impressed.<br />This is an amazing album, different but still Killswitch Engage, with an Alive or Just Breathing connection.<br />Every song is great, there is no filler here.<br />Welcome back Jesse Leach.
1475143389|5.0|I purchased this book because I was tired of being overwhelmed with various information regarding weight lifting and cardio, I also was extremely unorganized with my knowledge as I would read or hear one thing and than read another else where.  This book lays it all out not only telling you about 90% of everything you need to know and do in order to see the best results but it also backs up a majority of its claims by citing research findings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is completely new to weight lifting and cardio, but also would recommend this to anyone who wants some of the quickest and most efficient healthy results with weight lifting and cardio.<br /><br />While reading this book I found myself being overwhelmed with information and recommend taking notes to better organize your new approach to working out.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with this book and much thanks to Mike Mathews for putting together such a great read.<br /><br />Oh and best of all, as you may have noticed with the amazon ratings, Mike responds to everything, which means if you have any questions, comments or complaints while reading the book you can go ahead and straight up ask the author.  I went ahead and E-mailed him a question when I first started to read his book and he responded to me within a day.<br /><br />Thanks again Mike and I'm looking forward to my family and I taking on your 1-year challenge!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I absolutely love game of thrones!!  Season 2 is great.  You will not be disappointed if you buy the entire series.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|OK.. so it was a nice quick read..I enjoyed the story and the characters great, the expectations in between the<br />love, hate sessions kept me interested.  I can recommend the book to those looking for a sweet love story with a bit of spice.
B00005N6KG|1.0|DON&#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Will break on you fairly quickly, were not very comfortable. Sound was good, but I emphasize WAS.
1400052181|5.0|I read this for my Physics class a year or so ago for extra credit to keep me afloat in the class. What an incredible read! The author does an excellent job of telling the story the way a journalist would- with the facts- but I love that it reads like a novel. I couldn't put it down!
B001NLL93W|4.0|Love the infernal devices so I decided to read the mortal instruments and found them very amusing  can't wait for the last book !
B00BYH6MZK|1.0|Wow these actors (all great ones at that) must have really needed the money.  There was nothing unique, ground breaking or special about this movie in any way.  The same acting, script and style that has been done in every crime, action and cop movie ever done, minus the subpar script.<br /><br />This movie is worth watching it on cable TV when it will not cost you anything to see it.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|enjoyed the night. a little rambling in the beginning, but then it turned into a very funny and loving story worth watching and easily identifiable.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really liked the perspective but the only disappointment is you can't discover more about what happens when he blacks out or what he's going through in that time. I know the perspective of Charlie limits you to what he's feeling, I'm just disappointed I couldn't know more of those sections of Charlie's life.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I ordered this black controller because black goes with my entertainment center and everything else<br /><br />To bad they dont make these out of a stronger plastic or material

B002N5N4M6|5.0|My husband and I got hooked on this series when my daughter came home from college Nd introduced it to us. We needed to see it from its beginnings.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is fun for the family to play depending on the season. Always gets a laugh and it is very helpful in passing some random time.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I've seldom been captivated so completely by an author like this one.  Her books are just too short.  Different things cause people to just not want to put a book down and this woman has found my thing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you love a challange and puzzles, then this is the game for you. I have stared at these until my head hurt and tears rolled out of my eyes. Caution! if you do not have determination then this game is not for you.
0385349947|5.0|I am a self-proclaimed skeptic. Therefore, when the buzz about priviledge and unrealistic advice about how to advance your career for the \\"everyday women\\" began to circulate in opposition to this book - I was ready to jump on board. The problem is, its not a \\"how to\\" book - therefore, its illogical to correlate her stories with suggestions on how YOU should become successful. I think we are missing the point here. Sheryl discusses her OWN personal conflicts about being a modern, succesful women with a family working a fast-paced high profile job. She discusses both the external and internal road-blocks women face who are interested in having both a career and family. She also discusses the ever-present difficulties women face working in a male dominated work-environment. She's a voice to the \\"bossy\\" girl, the one that's too direct. The one who is given critical and gendered feedback about wearing her heart on her sleeve(someting I was told I needed to adjust while interning in college). I am 20-something woman of color from a lower-middle class family. I am recently married, looking to start a family and my career trajectory is trending faster than I can keep up. I desparately needed advice on juggling these life events and my career. I needed this book. Many women need this book. Please read and pass on to your mothers, daughters, sisters and friends. But most importantly, pass it on to your sons, fathers, brothers and husbands.

1439156816|5.0|I really enjoyed this book  by Stephen King. He knows he has avid readers but also writers who admire his style and a success. He does a great job of describing his early career and struggles and even his own life struggles throughout his career.<br /><br />Writers will appreciate the second half of the book where King gives helpful writing advise. It's like taking a Master Class and you're sure to learn something.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I recently bought this app, thinking it was a temple run remake, but it wasn't. It was much more user friendly, and a fun game to play. I really enjoy this app. IT IS A GREAT BUY!!!!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five stars? How do you rate a book that picks up on a series that you've loved for years?<br />I'm one of those people who smells the binding of a book-(oops-this is a kindle-) and loves it. I love new books. love them, and Mark of Athena did not disappoint. But I won't spoil it for you. Just know the ending....... not many people can pull of a good cliff hanger. Ridley Pearson, maybe.<br />enjoy the book!!!<br />;-)
B009IUH1N2|1.0|Very very very stupid, annoying, slow and glitchy I have never seen a game as bad as this game. DON'T GET THIS GAME I AM WARNING U.
1926778103|1.0|Really unfortunate to have such a beautiful and magnificent art book disintegrate after a couple of days.  I'm a fan of Darksiders and God of War and purchased both art books. Imagine my disappointment when the pages from teh art book started to come off the binding.  I hope they have addressed the issue with the second printing.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Wanted something simple and easy, this one had more features and was more difficulet to setup than I had wanted.
B003WEA4UM|3.0|i will admit that a book like this requires all your attention to follow the story.  i had to reread some passages to get back on line with the plot.  still i enjoyed it ... can't wait to see the movie
B008JFLWLE|5.0|An amazing calculator good for quick answers. It has a good amount of different thing s one can do and also is really fun. You can't go wrong with this!
B001VIMCW4|1.0|I've seen every bond movie including this one and this is by far the worst of them all.  The plot is the most TERRIBLE plot you could imagine.  criminals holding one of the poorest countries in the world hostage by controlling their water supply.... Just don't watch this movie...
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Ok start off I like playing the game. I don't like Gamehouse customer Service. I purchased an acorn pack, which I normally wouldn't do, and I won't again. I had no problem with that. What I had a problem with is I thought I was purchasing a premium item and ended up with a expansion using all my acorns. I contacted customer service with the issue, got promised in writing that they would make up for it and a week later they still have issues sending the gift I was promised. It takes days to hear back from them. The screen items are so sensitive that if you touch just off the picture something else comes up. And the premium items are so outrageously priced you can't get them unless you purchase an acorn pack. Even the regular items paid with coins are priced really high. You can't keep any coins you earn for long because you have to buy something really expensive to fulfill a quest. And the babies cost just as much as the parents. My neighbors keep disappearing too. I shouldn't even give the stars I'm giving. If I keep having issues I will un-install the game.
B0093QFM6Y|5.0|I love this movie and I can watch it when ever I want to but wish I did not need the internet to watch it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book - very interesting and keeps your attention.  Many complain about the ending, but it didnt bother me.  I highly recommend.
0345529057|3.0|So I will start off saying that these books are great!<br />BUT<br />The quality of these books... Not so much.<br />There are many flaws in almost every book. (Paper that was printed extra, rips, scratches)<br />But many of these flaws I think are from the paper quality.<br />The paper seems as though it was printed on bible paper.<br />It's very thin and a lot of the times you might even skip pages and not know it.<br />If you're planning on re-reading these books or lend them to friends, I wouldn't count on them coming back looking the same.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|As of now I am very unhappy because I have been waiting 3 hours for it to download. I hope waiting this long is worth it.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I starting watching this show because I found myself caught in the walking dead sensation.<br />Somehow season 3 is not the same anymore. It lost the key ingredient to attract more viewers.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was an easy read -- only 252 or 272 pages --and I read it in two days. It was very dark, very depressing. I found myself just so saddened by the characters, especially the main character.<br /><br />I did have to skip a couple parts -- although I do know why they were there -- (the slaughterhouse scenes) but I don't think it hurt my perception of the story any.<br /><br />What I find sad about this novel (and to me that makes it a good novel -- when I feel for characters) is other than the core group, the outlying characters are very true-to-life. There were the teen \\"mean girls\\" and the nonconformists as well as the bored housewives who never grew up. This could be said for any town in America.<br /><br />Would I recommend it to someone? Only if they have a good stomach.<br /><br />Is it as good as Gone Girl? No way, but it's not fair to compare the two.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it because I don't have to read it.  it can read to me . plus everyone knows the Bible. :)
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I got this for the kindle fire and I don't see a point in the app existing. I got it because I read somewhere that I could change my kindle background using it (I googled it for a while and found this on a forum somewhere) but you can't...it changes the PROGRAM'S background, so when you open the app...behind all the folders you can kind of see the picture you chose. I snooped through all the folders and I can't find anything special about this app. Every folder and file I found can be found on the pre-loaded apps (like pictures, etc.) or by plugging it in to the computer.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|The story encompassed an amazing journey, no doubt about it. However, as a mountain savvy hiking girl myself, I found it a bit self indulgent. As a whole the book was a good story, but not something I would recommend as a must read.
0345803485|3.0|With all the fuss about this book, I expected a lot more. It's OK to kill time in the train, it's easy going, and easy to read. It's a liitle too stretched out for my taste.
6304233639|5.0|If you like War of the Worlds(any version), this is basically a remake of that very movie but much better. This movie has excellent effects, graphics, etc. with an all-star cast to make a high-grossing box office monster that is in the record books. Highly recommended!
B005K17RU0|1.0|loved the previous version. this new version is so bad and unusable that I am removing it from my kindle. z
6300263673|5.0|Dirty Dancing is another sexually charged dancing movie much like Flashdance. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey star in one of the most popular 80's movies made. Coming of age for a young girl meets Patrick Swayze in dance classes and on the floor. You get the idea.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a lot of fun but it needs more options and much bigger maps. I think it needs buckets and villagers.
B000T433CO|5.0|Love the cast. Love the 2 storylines. Favorite Holiday movie. Watch it every year. If you haven't seen it, I recommened giving it a try.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|A fine adaptation of this classic. I think this is a fine film for everyone and would like to see adaptations of the rest of the books.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|great hidden finds and a spooky story line. loved it and cant wait for the next one to come out.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|It's a challenging, but low stress game. I like that there is no timer. Most games I play are timed. This one is calmer.
0198534469|5.0|That's the word.  to have intuition put to some of the sterile formulae.<br />Parts of this book were over my head, or required more effort than I was willing to give, but I got a lot out of this book.  I never took complex calculus in college; only real calculus.  I've taught the subject to myself, piecemeal over the years, for the fun of it, and this book made much of it click.  and now I'm excited.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|I got this for my Grandson who is a Logo fanatic. He absolutely loves his new camera. One of the first things he did was to incorporate the camera into a castle as the security system.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|My only gripe is that this is not part of the camera. Kinda hard to video, take a pic. etc... without a way to se what you are shooting. I have had no problems at all with the thouch screen options.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|We hated it so bad we quit watching, wish we could get our money back, or comp a different movie
B000VSYDRM|4.0|This movie was very good, but completely different than I expected.The young man that is the main character is so good it is all very beleivable that he sees nothing wrong with what he is doing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the first William Landay I've read and I throughly enjoyed it . This book kept me guessing to the very end. Loved it
B002KSPKRS|2.0|This was an EXCELLENT headset except for a couple of MAJOR FLAWS, which were such a big deal that I had to return it.<br /><br />First, I agree will all the positives others have made.  Incredible sound, comfortable, etc....<br /><br />Now, the bad.  At first everything was fine.  But then the interference was so bad - at times almost continuous popping, static, etc...  And I was 5 feet from the transmitter.  And I moved it around.  Still horrible.<br /><br />Also, while this is wireless, the chat is not.  You have to connect an cord to the controller.  This should have been obvious to me when I ordered it, but I missed that detail.  To get the wireless chat feature you need to the few models up, in the $160+ price range.<br /><br />Considering that 2.4ghz wireless is used for everything and has been for 10+ years, why would the manufacturer even bother?  And how can you sell a headset and this price and not include wireless chat?<br /><br />If those two issues were fixed, it would have been perfect.

1400052173|5.0|everyone should read this book it is what has been left out of the school history and the biology books.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Learning more about Wolverine is always cool. I wish we could see more about his background, his family and his father. I was left wondering if his father really died and if his brother was supposed to be Sabretooth. OH and of course Hugh Jackman shirtless is drool worthy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really loved the book with all the twists and<br />turns.  However, i hated the ending!!!<br />At least five other office staff felt the same way.<br />In fact I don't think I will buy her other books<br />because they may end the same way...awful<br />Lynne
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and very fun also i think that you should be able to choose what path you want to take
B003INBNXO|5.0|This was one of the best martial arts movies I have seen. No hokey flying through the air, walking on water etc. In a couple of the fights, the punches were thrown so I fast by Yip or maybe I should say Donnie, I was not sure if they were in real time or the film maker sped them up just for the effect. As near as I can figure out, the punches were shown in real time. Regardless, I really liked the movie. I also bought part 2 but have not watched it yet, but  I am looking forward to it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game I have it on my iPhone & kindle fire I let my baby girl play it on the kindle & she loves it more than her Nintendo dsi...lol
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I didn't care for this item, I don't know what it should be doing but it did nothing for me. A waste of time and energy!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like the flow of the story, and the characters. Also, the author keeps me interested. The way he describes the area is great.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I didn't like it, it was a waste of time. I am really not sure what it should be doing.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to get my messages instantaneously & to be able to move our delete them when I want to.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|This is a news feed but not something I was looking for, I didn't like and deleted it the same day.
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|The set is all right, but what makes this set great is the awesome minifigures, although sadly the hobbits' short dwarf legs are unable to bend, so they can't sit down.  It must be exhausting for them...  If they could be designed to be able to sit, the minifigures in this set would be almost perfect.  As it is, they are very, very well designed.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This shows great, this is on of my favorite new shows. I had no problem watching this on my kindle or saving it to my kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is awesome cause you get to change charecter. Its awesome. Also that it changes the person who runs after you. That part is awesome to!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is very addictive, I LOVE this game. BE aware it will drain your battery because you will be playing it so long, you won't even realize it. :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale includes 5 types of dragons.  Basic Hybrid Epic Gemstone and Legendary.  And if you delete it; I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN.
B0036OS3EC|5.0|I received a ton of compliments on these boots.They are very comfortable to wear and great in the snow and in the rain :)
B009M4KTEM|5.0|I had tickets to both shows that night at the East Coast office of the Grateful Dead.  Its fun all these years later to re live that night.  Jerry's band was smokin
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a \\"create and wait\\" game similar to that of Farmville. Once you start you're then on a fun adventure, creating all kinds of dragons. Enjoy!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like to be able to look on my kindle and find out what the weather is like in our area
B005GFPZYK|4.0|a true look into the mind of a trained killer and defender of our troops. never knew how many american lives are saved by our snipers.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very suspenseful and very addictive.  We missed one episode while we were out to dinner and decided we needed to get it on Amazon to find out what happened.
B006Z2WE0G|5.0|excellent read!  thanked a friend for recommending it.  Well written!  it will keep you reading long past your bed time!  good
B008X8QCTO|3.0|The game was ok. There was a lot to do and the length was pretty good for 99Cents. It gets kinda boring after awhile. You had to go to to the same item search spots waaayyyyy to many times. Other then that it wasn't terrible.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I thought this would be hard to watch, but it was a pleasant surprise. The scenery was very cool too.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Good writing as usual for Martin but it would be much better to know from the beginning that this book would be split into two books. I got a little bored with too much detail and not enough story
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Amistad is by far one of my favorite historical fiction movies of all time.  And it won't take long for you to fall in love with Cinque.
B00BBQXQFI|2.0|Seemed like they were trying too hard. I get the point and the kids liked it ok, but it was just so-so. I wouldn't choose it again.
B004SEUJK0|4.0|I had this movie on VCR tape and wanted to replace it.  Thought it was funny when I first saw it, and I still do.  I like it enough to watch again at times, and so wanted to keep in my permanent collection.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I LOVE this book, Victor Hugo paints such vivid pictures. His character are obviously well-developed (after almost 1000 pages, they better be!), and his writing is beautiful. This book is worth the time investment.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|I really like this new album. Has a great laid back feel with a song for probably every mood. There's a song on here for almost every occasion experienced or felt in life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm a fifth grade teacher, and I read this book because not only my colleagues recommended it but because my KIDS recommended it! It's a wonderful story, and I think every kid needs to hear the message of acceptance that it offers. Great read for kids and adults alike!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|If you love historical fiction and a little time travel, then this is the series for you!  Jamie Fraser is the ultimate, sexy, Scottish hero. This is a bosom-heaving love story set in 18th century Scotland.
B005L38QK2|3.0|I have had a Steelseries Merc Stealth Keyboard sicne they came out which i love very much.I seen the Diablo 3 mouse and thought it would be perfect for me considering i mostly play D3 and WoW.<br />I had a problem with the software not working that comes with the mouse because it conflicts with the Zengine that runs the merc keyboard it causes a usb device spam in the device manager likes it loading a new usb over and over caused by a conflict with Steelseries engine & the Zengine which Steelseries is well aware of.<br /><br />this is from a ticket responce from them<br />  Hey Chad,<br /><br />  The problem is the Zengine software and the SteelSeries Engine. The two conflict with each other. The reason this is, is because we purchased the Zengine software from Ideazon after we had already created the SteelSeries Engine. This is a serious issue and we are rectifying it by rolling the Zengine devices into SSE. For the time being, you will only be able to use 1 or the other. We can of course assist you with a return on the Merc keyboard for, for example, a 6gv2, which does not use Zengine and will allow you to fully operate your other devices with SSE.<br /><br />  Regards,<br />  Randall B<br />  SteelSeries<br /><br />But my reason for doing this review is because they have the worst support of any company i have ever seen it took since last year till now for me to finally get to even having a RMA offered and now that i sent the mouse to them for an exchange for the Sensei mouse which is programmable so it will work without the Steelseries engine because its a programmable mouse.<br />It has been 2 weeks and they don`t even respond to say whats going on and what gets me is they know what the problem is as it was stated above by them about what the issue is so apon them rec. the mouse i sent them they should have just shipped out a new one and nothing to investigate because they know what the issue is right?<br />Well i guess that isn`t the case cause I am still waiting not only for the mouse but a responce on status of it ..... Also they don`t have a phone contact number and i think it is obvious as to why they don`t cause it would be flooded with some unhappy customers and they choose to only respond to those unhappy customers at there own convenience.....<br />All i can say is yes some of the products are ok as long as u dont buy 2 of them that conflict with eachother... Cause the support they offer is the worst i have ever seen in my whole life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is just what I ordered. I am very happy with this item. Very fast delivery. A+++ seller. Good quality product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a great game and is better than temple run.subway sufers is the best game.subway augers should have more coin and jet packs.
B00BWGL6BS|5.0|People are always trying to figure out if Dido is \\"back\\" or not. Truth of it is that she has never left. Every 4 to 5 years she releases another beautifully perfect album, and \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" is no exception. In fact this album in particular has several refreshingly upbeat slightly-more-electronic songs (i.e. Blackbird, Go Dreaming). As always her voice is amazing and every lyric is sung flawlessly. The production quality is phenomenal with the exception of track 1, which kind of feels like a basement lullaby. Did they purposely mix in that crackling? Anyhow, if you like Dido's other albums you will definitely like this one.
0440246024|4.0|I was on vacation and did not want anything<br />too heavy.  I was reading at sporadic intervals.<br />The book had to be easy to put down,,,,and,,,,,<br />easy to remember where you left off.  This book<br />did all of that and it was interesting, to boot!!!!<br />Perfect book for a trip.
B000T2EXXO|5.0|Really awesome jazz.  Not the greatest recording as other commenters had said but the music itself is amazing.  Everyone in my office loves this album.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and the laughs were to be had throughout<br />the entire movie.<br /><br />Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant are wonderful actors with great chemistry.<br />The writing was superb as well as the acting.  It relieves the stress and tension<br />in you.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I do not know how to describe it but this is a great album.  There is variety to the songs and fun lyrics to go with great music.
B00407PNWO|5.0|This was another in a long list of great classics.  Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland were great together as usual.<br />Timeless message that good will overcome evil.<br /><br />The typecasting was excellent and the outcome was what you go to the movies for.<br />Errol Flynn was an excellent swashbuckler.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Normally, I would hesitate to recommend a historical romance novel on the basis of pride/snobbery/shame (circle one). I will now make an exception to this rule! I just finished The Duchess War by Courtney Milan, and I loved it!  This was a rare book experience for me, in that I did not feel as though I needed to take editing notes as I read. (I know, I'm an editor, therefore a geek!)<br /><br />Ms. Milan writes a captivating story with accurate historical detail (Victorian, in case you were wondering) and a refreshing amount of humor. There is absolutely no formulaic claptrap here! You know how all novels about dukes and duchesses seem to follow the same story line? Not in this case, thank goodness!  I chuckled my way through a thoroughly enjoyable read. If you like your history and romance a little saucy, get this book! I promise you won't regret it!
0316224588|5.0|This is the return of Rebus, and well worth the wait. Nice to see that not all people due to retire, actually do, and that they still have something to contribute
B00448SE4S|5.0|Funny movie great product!  Recommend for everyone to watch that needs a laugh in their laugh, related movies are Kick-ass.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|the whole cd is great..........but the dolly parton duet blew me away. her vocals are amazing on this song!!!! well worth the money!!! well done paul anka!!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Funny movie great product!  Recommend for everyone to watch that needs a laugh in their laugh, related movies are Scott Pilgrim!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album is everything it's hyped up to be. Now I know I'm daring when I say this but this is a classic modern pop album and is consistently enjoyable all throughout. I can't begin to name all of the awful or lackluster artists that have been dominating pop radio lately, but it doesn't matter anymore. Justin and Timbaland are bringing it back and I'm not talking about sexy; I'm talking about quality pop music to the radio. If any album that gets released this year deserves to be heard, it's this one folks.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great movie great product!  Recommend for everyone to watch that needs a action packed movie!  Best vampire movie since blade!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Not a gripping, you absolutely must watch series but still good to see that this has been released.  It covers that pre-war era very nicely in terms of behaviours and ignorance.  I can't get away from Edward Fox as Edward in Edward and Mrs Simpson in my mind so there was some personal conflict in watching the Mrs Simpson bit but overall not bad at all - certainly worth a watch
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Many of the scenes from the book that I'd been upset weren't included in the theatrical version are now included in this one. A great buy, so worth it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like some of the rain sounds and other nature sounds.  Not much for city and appliance sounds, but that's a personal preference.  This may sound silly to some people, but I wish it had toads on it.  It's a very soothing sound, much more mellow than frogs.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I really was surprised at the quality of the arrangements.  Different from many of his albums.  Good choice. It calms me when I am having an anxiety filled day.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My daughter loves these train puzzles. She thinks they are from Team Umizoomi. She actually likes this app better than the expensive team umizoomi app!
0696204800|3.0|Not worth it, you can find free pattern on internet. Its ok. I would not recommend buying the book. There are free ones
1878424319|5.0|Was a great book. Short read that's was ready for on the go reading. Inspiring to everyday reality situations that we deal with on a daily basis.
1571200851|2.0|I brought this and its pretty hard to do, once you make the flowers on the covers its really hard to attach them to anything. And then they fall apart. if you want to wash the flowers then forget it.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|Not bad, for first episode, just have to wait and see if this series is up to snuff with original.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most cool game ever and it is free get it I'm sure every one else loves this game because it is awesome ha if u are a hater get out!@!!!!!!!@7@the@ the only thing you want to get is now SUBWAYSURFERS
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was a great continuation of Season 1.<br />I'm anxious to continue to Season 3.<br />I understand why the series received an Emmy
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|AWSOME GET IT RIGHT RIGHT NOW AND  THIS WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK  .......JUST GET IT
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the awsomest game in my life.I built a 45story mantion.you should see it on you tube.I want you to get this app
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Not as Good as others But pretty good!!!! Love Gregory and Rowley and all the characters! I'd read it again!!
B00024YVJU|5.0|Awesome progressive masterpiece. This should be in every prog collection. Eloy is an interesting German prog band. If you haven't heard their music, listen before this type of music disappears like Atlantis.
B00338QENI|4.0|The book was a great read. The topic a very interesting and dynamic one, both for the sake of racial history, and for scientific research.<br />Its a shame blacks were treated so pathetically in recent history and the means that were used to advance science and research.  Kudos to the author for her determination and fair recount of the Lacks family saga.<br />It was tender, thoughtful, enraging, sad, and disappointing that not one multi-billion dollar company has gone out of their way to thank the heirs to HenriettaLacks for her donation with any financial compensation.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked the book, and it is significantly better than most in this genre, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, this is a book that is building up to another book, but has no climax of it's own. Nothing is resolved and basically, you feel that the plot of the entire novel has been left to drift down a river like Twyin. This feels a lot like books 7-11 of the Wheel of Time series, meaning that you just want something, anything to get resolved for a damn change.
0452295548|5.0|Don't let my avatar name confuse you. I seldom bother to write about the good stuff, but, this book is really something special. As the wife and caregiver of a 57 year old who suffered a \\"dreaded\\" stroke in his pons, a very small, but vital part of the brain stem with many critical functions, this book taught me things that were invaluable to my becoming the best caregiver possible. For those of us lucky enough not have had a stroke, we can all expect in some time in our lives to know, be related to, or be the caregiver to someone who has had to go through it. And this goes for any and all brain injuries, not just strokes. It includes the thousands of soldiers, sailors and marines who have come home with traumatic brain injuries, diagnosed and not.  It includes victims of senseless gun violence, like Gabby Giffords, and unfortunately, many more like her. Being able to understand just a little bit better what they are going through, can really help us with cultivating the overwhelming patience necessary to be the best friends and caregivers available. If you feel frustrated, just try to imagine how frustrated they are. Don't finish that sentence for them. Bite your tongue off first. Give them the time and encouragement to regain and relearn, and don't be afraid of that different person that they may become.<br />We did start therapy to help his recovery, long before the medical profession. For the first 3 days, he was confined to his bed, but, I constantly rubbed and massaged his right side to send messages to his brain from those stricken muscles, so the brain would be reminded that they were still there.  We started occupational therapy by me drawing spirals and other shapes that he attempted to trace.  We are almost to a point where I might frame one and hang it on the wall. Not too painful to look at anymore. I am also a poetry freak. I love it and memorize many very long poems. So, I picked out Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Raven\\". I would recite a line and he would recite it back to me. Several days later, when he was transferred to an in-hospital rehab unit, I printed several copies, in large print, and several of the speech therapists used it with several other patience. It's a good poem for that as it's language is fairly modern, and it seems to have most of the different sounds made in the English language. We were very lucky, and it helps that my husband has always been a driven personality type.  The first day home, even though he still had severe balance problems and needed his walker, he started \\"running\\", well shuffling really, down our narrow hallway. he could steady himself with hands on the walls, but, he kept at it. Several days later, he was doing the same shuffling, sort of run, with the walker, up to and around the cul-de-sac, across from our house. The neighbors thought he was crazy, but, he was just retraining his partially paralyzed right side, that it could still run.<br />It's now seven years since his stroke and he constantly floors the medical profession, that he survived and made so much of a recovery (I estimate 98%). One thing to absolutely remember about any brain injury, when the brain needs to rest, you should not, you can not fight it. Sleep and rest are as essential as air and water.<br />Thank you, Jill Bolte Taylor. I hope your newer right/left brain collaboration continues to bring you much new joy and experience, and I will forever be grateful for your amazing sharing of your most inner self and the story you had to tell.
1401229921|5.0|My hobby is art and this deliveries.... study of a great artist. You could see the exact details of how he made them
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I read a few of the John Carter novels many years ago.  They were cheesy, but fun.  In fact, that's what workmates would say they saw what I was reading in the cafeteria; \\"Barsoom novels?  Those are a hoot.\\"<br /><br />Superman was really based on John Carter.  Originally, he couldn't fly, and there was no kryptonite; he was just a dude from another planet who could jump really high, and had greater strength due to the Earths gravity relative to Krypton's. John Carter has super strength and high-jumping abilities when on Mars because of it's relative gravity compared to Earth's.  To the people of Mars, John Carter was an alien from another planet with strength beyond what was normal.  Both heroes fought for justice.  Put John Carter back on Earth and he's just a normal guy.  Put Superman back on Krypton, (if it hadn't blown up), and he'd be just another guy.  There really was no difference between John Carter and Superman.  I really think Superman would be a more relate-able character if he had stayed true to his comic book origins.  It was the Superman radio show that bestowed the gift of flight on him, as well as his pesky kryptonite allergy.  I have no doubt that Superman's creators must have been fans on the John Carter novels.  Think about it; the first Superman comic came out in 1938.  John Carter had already been out for more than a quarter of a century.  There is no way the exact similarities between these two characters was an accident.<br /><br />People often say that \\"Star Wars\\" was inspired by the \\"Flash Gordon\\" and \\"Buck Rogers\\" serials of the 30's and 40's.  This may be true, but Flash and Buck were inspired by John Carter.<br /><br />Disney has owned the rights to the Tarzan and John Cater books for a long time, and I remember listening to \\"our 25\\" on KPFK in Los Angeles in the 1980's when a guest was talking about how Disney planned on updating these stories for the big screen, for instance, there is really not much explanation in the books on how John Carter transports from the dessert cave to Mars, so some scientific explanation would be created for the movies.<br /><br />I waited and waited for the films to be made, but nothing in the 80's, nothing in the 90's, nothing in the 2000's.<br /><br />Then I heard that \\"A Princess of Mars\\" would come out in 2012 on the one-hundredth anniversary of the book's first publishing. The title would be changed to \\"John Carter of Mars\\".  I told my wife we would see that film for sure.<br /><br />Then I heard that Andrew Stanton was directing it and that it would be in 3D.  I again told my wife that we would see it for sure.<br /><br />Then we saw a trailer for it while watching another film.  At this point, I think they were still calling it, \\"John Carter of Mars\\".  I don't know what it was, I can't really explain why, but it just looked, stupid.  I turned to my wife and asked, \\"Does that look good to you?\\"  She just shrugged.  Something about it looked completely underwhelming.<br /><br />Then I saw television ads.  By this time, I think the title had been shortened to just \\"John Cater\\".  Again, nothing about the ad made me want to shell out hard-earned cash to see it.  I remember wondering to myself why would they change the title to just \\"John Carter\\".  That really says nothing about the film, and doesn't pull you in.  I'm not a marketing student, but I can tell you, this title sucks.<br /><br />So here I am, a guy who read and enjoyed the books, had been waiting for the movies for literally decades, and now, had no desire to see them.  Imagine how a non-fan felt about it.  I should have been the easiest person in the world to sell this movie to.  Instead. we spent our movie-going money on other films.<br /><br />One day, \\"John Carter\\" came on television.  I recorded it on my DVR but did not immediately watch it.  One day, my family was getting ready run some errands.  I turned this movie on to watch a few minutes.  I was transfixed.  I didn't want to turn it off.  My daughter, in the middle of getting ready, walks through the living room to go to her room.  She stops for a second to glance at the TV.  She too became transfixed.<br /><br />\\"What is this?\\"<br /><br />\\"John Carter of Mars.  It's by the same guy who wrote the Tarzan books.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's really good.\\"<br /><br />At this point, we had to leave, so I turned it off.  I turned the movie back on as soon as we got back home.  My daughter walks in and asks that I start it over so she could see what she missed.  Now we both sit there and kept saying, \\"wow, this is really good.  Why didn't we see this in the theater?\\"<br /><br />My wife walks in looks a little bit of it and asks, \\"What's that?\\"<br /><br />\\"John Cater of Mars.\\", my daughter answers.<br /><br />\\"It looks cool. Please don't delete it.  I want to watch it later.\\"<br /><br />I get home from work one day, and my wife is watching it.  She's near the end.  She looks up at me and says, \\"This is really good.  Isn't this the film that Disney wrote off?\\"<br /><br />I'm sorry that I'm taking a long time to get to my point.  All it takes to really like this movie is just to see it.  All it takes to really hate it is to watch the advertising.<br /><br />Oh, and at the very end of the film, you see the letters \\"JCOM\\", and then the real title of the film, \\"John Carter of Mars\\".  I'll never understand why the title was changed at the last minute, but the fact that this older title is still in the credits does show that nobody on the creative side of this film got the memo that it was no longer called \\"John Carter of Mars\\".<br /><br />So, while I skipped it in the theaters, I will gladly shell out money to buy the BD of this film.<br /><br />J. J. Abrams has been hired by Disney to direct the next Star Wars film.  I think he did a pretty good job on the latest Star Trek film, but it wasn't the best film in that franchise.  Watching \\"John Carter\\" shows how well Andrew Stanton understands and really loves the source material from the Barsoom novels.  I have to think that he would be much better suited to direct the new \\"Star Wars\\" films than Abrams.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The first book was fantastic and this is its equal. Keep it up Terry Goodkind I am a new fan.
0375826742|3.0|Pressure is mounting. The Varden can only advance so far into enemy territory before war is declared. They can only hope that as each day passes Murtagh and Thorn will not attack. Eragon and Saphira are sufficient defense when they are around, but they cannot me everywhere at once and they are needed elsewhere.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way. This series should have been over in three books. There is plenty of superfluous story line that could be edited out of this book. I will concede that Paolini did a decent job keeping most of the boring parts from becoming the last part I read before giving up. I will even suggest what to cut out...Roran. To this point, Eragon's cousin hasn't brought any value to these books. He is a wild card and a cowboy and he is contrary to all of the values Paolini has tried to instill in Eragon.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I am still entertained with the path that Eragon walks. I am intrigued. I want to know what happens. I am more than willing to read another book to see how this plays out. But I'm glad there is only one more book because I am ready for closure.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|I love Tegan & Sara's new sound. Closer, I Was a Fool, and I Couldn't Be Your Friend are my personal favorites.
B00B999E12|1.0|Now, before you Patton fans jump on me for not \\"understanding Mike Patton\\", I hate to tell you this...I DO.  Been a fan of his for a very long time now, from Faith No More to Tomahawk and everything in between.  So now that THAT's out of the way, let me give you a quick review here.<br /><br />In short, boring.  And rather uneventful.  The Patton tracks are merely instrumentals from the film...not very exciting, nothing much to even tap your foot too.  I doubt any of you hardcore Patton fans will be humming these tunes or placing them in heavy rotation.  It's just DRY and unremarkable.<br /><br />I do not recommend this at all.  EVEN for the Patton fans.<br /><br />Sorry to ruin this for anyone.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|All good!<br />This case is my current favorite. It fits well, buttons are very nice to press, and it leaves a gap as to not interfere with any screen protectors.<br />Thank\\"s!
B005FISBTO|5.0|We're hooked on this show, and on this way of watching it.  Rather than having to wait every week for the next episode, we wait the entire season, and then buy the DVD set, and watch it, marathon style, in a day or two!  It's like watching a movie.<br /><br />This is a creepy story about a serial killer, so if you are not interested in violence or crime shows, this is not the show for you.  I think the acting is very solid, and although I can't take the bloody scenes, I enjoy this series very much.<br /><br />We had a problem with the first set sent to us not playing properly, but the replacement that Amazon sent works fine.  I think they may be using cheaper disks these days, because we've been having problems with several other DVDs lately, too.
B00338QENI|5.0|GREAT BOOK. Very informative and entertaining as well. I will tell everyone I know to read  this book. I am glad  to know  the  history involved and the whole story.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like having my kindle books available on my phone.  I wish the pages would sync better with each other though.
B00B1MHA18|4.0|Ben Harper's vocals and guitar playing go well with Charlie's harmonica.  &#34;I Don't Believe a Word You Say&#34; is the stand-out track.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put the story down!  I read it on my IPhone. So, I would sneak in a page or two whenever I could.  The protagonist was upbeat and resourceful.  He was someone to aspire to in adversity.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Good but not to great it could be better in a lot of ways. I personal think it needs some work, especially the prices for the characters,you might want to rethink that 95,000 is overkill thanks for understanding what I'm saying and hope that you can make some changes. Thank You!
0061537969|5.0|*This review may contain spoilers.*<br /><br />This story is written entirely from the perspective of an endearing, loyal, sweet and funny dog called Enzo on the eve of his death. It is beautiful, insightful and the tear-jerker to end all tear-jerkers. The dog lover in me had me sobbing through the entire book (in fact I'm getting misty-eyed just recalling it), but it is worth every tear. There are at least 10 quotes I could pick out from this book and turn into my new mantra. If the story was written from the perspective of the dog's owner, Denny, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much because he's not terribly likable. Despite being a race car driver, the only noteworthy thing that happens to him over the course of the novel is that he's accused of sexually abusing a minor. Denny's story is a bit anticlimactic to me, but the story is really more about Enzo's never-ending love for his human--and a lovely (and even believable) one at that.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Great movie.  Great movie for kids always.  Was worth the price and the movie was received on time and in good packaging.

B0086449YA|5.0|I listen to this album every day.  I have most of his albums and quite a few of Dire Straights.  And his guitar just seems to be an extension of his voice; or his voice just seems to be an extension of his guitar.  Either way it makes for some great music.
B000050WZY|5.0|I finally bought a record player this year, as I have been wanting to do that for some time. The beatles (my favorite) 1 album is the best album with the best songs. You can't go wrong with this album!
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|Stallone has found his stride again - hope he continues to thrill and entertain - the second installment went a bit overboard<br />- a bit of Hollywood crap - Arnold and his 'I'm Back' crap! - bullets that fly and don't seem to hit anyone!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I didn't care for this book and will probably not read any more by this author.  Just not my style.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This a awesome game I just wish you didn't always have to be with internet.... the best part is that they are spook cute and some are just like wow
1609611543|5.0|This book changed my thinking about wheat. I have been gluten free for 6 weeks now and have noticed big changes in total pain throughout my body. I have also begun to lose weight, which was almost impossible for me to do in the past.<br />Alaskan 66 year old lady
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Saw thes guys on PBS and thought they were interesting. I bought the CD from Amazon and the CD is Great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Glad to have a calculator that is easy to use, and has a percentage button. I use this app daily.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|Captain Beefheart had a famous record called \\"Safe as Milk\\". That should be the title of this totally bland, never changing album by one of my favorite artists, Donald Fagen. This record plods along, every mix of every song sounds exactly like the mix of every other song, the same instruments sitting in the same spot in the mix, and Fagen not taking a single chance, as Steely Dan did frequently and brilliantly.<br /><br />This CD is going on the shelf, probably never to be listened to again. If I want the songs on this record, I'll listen to \\"Morph the Cat\\" where these same songs were done with dynamics and a sense of fun. \\"Sunken Condos\\" has a very clean sound. So clean as to be totally sterile. No germ of an idea could survive in that setting, and none do.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Saw part of this performance on my local PBS station during \\"Pledge Week\\" and was astounded by this band and artist whom I had never heard of. This recording is outstanding. I sampled some of Joe's other albums on Amazon and didn't care for it. This however is a work of musical art and would highly recommend buying it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG!!!!! It's so good!!!!! I swear I felt the same thrill I felt when I was reading Harry potter!!!!! It's that good! If you're reading this comment then, buy the God damned book!!!! If u loved the other books then u will die over this one!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked the game but for what I paid I wind it had been a little lounger. Overall though I really liked it!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I downloaded this free app for my husband because he had some extra time on his hands and he really likes the Jurassic Park movies. Since he has played Farmville in the past and enjoyed the challenges of accompishing things during certain times I figured he might enjoy this game. He has really enjoyed it! I am sure it is not a surprise to anyone though when I say the only way to get some of the &#34;better&#34; things requires you to either wait a very long time to earn the &#34;money&#34; or to break down and buy &#34;money&#34;. I don't really enjoy that it is connected to my Facebook but it is nice that I could select not to share every little post with my friends and keep them from getting bugged to join Jurassic Park Builder.
B00138J234|3.0|Some reviewers have said that this is the most overrated album of all time.  I have to agree with that.<br /><br />It marks the beginning of the commercialization of the Clash's sound. When the Clash signed to CBS it wasnt the end of the world.  They continued to write powerful anti-authoritarian songs that struck a chord with the kids of the day.<br /><br />However, some of the better songs on the London Calling album have an uncharacteristic mellowness to them that speaks of complacency.  Songs such Spanish Bombs and Lost in the Supermarket don't have the angst that previously defined the Clash.  The music is undeniably catchy, but they seem to make Joe Strummer's tough guy vocals obsolete (Lost was sung by Mick Jones).<br /><br />I could respect the change in direction if it didnt come with baggage.  Songs such as Lover's Rock and Brand New Cadillac mark a definite decline.  What is more disturbing to me is the failure of some of the reggae songs.  Wrong Em Boyo and Revolution Rock just sound like commercial reggae with an uncommercial lead singer.<br /><br />This album would be a disappointment if it wasnt for the title track.  If 3 or 4 more songs were up to the quality of London Calling this album would be a masterpiece.  The song is the perfect blend of punk attitude and roots reggae.  The band surely knew this was a logical perfection of their sound.<br /><br />Sound system is a great concept, but you have to make music that works with your strengths.  The Clash soon lost sight of that.  They followed up this effort with Sandinista!, an object of self-indulgence that was the Eighties equivalent to the Seventies Prog-Rock follies...
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I just finished this book last night and stayed up way too late on a work night to do so. When I got towards the end there was no putting the book down until I finished it! I am so glad I had purchased this as one of the daily deals.
B005EL6SUG|5.0|My family has built red passenger(visually top heavy, but light and fast), yellow cargo(a little reluctant to start moving, but looks good), and emerald night(looks great, but delicate to handle). Red cargo looks good, is sturdy to handle(especially with the little kids), and starts moving immediately with no problems going fast. We are in process of building maersk, and would like to get horizon express soon. No urgency to get constitution train because it looks like emerald night already.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This games a blast. Only problem is after a point you need gold coins to lvl up your skills and troops.  They do drop but it's few and far between.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are not difficult but it is fun to play on occasion.<br />I play when the mood strikes me.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|You'll love this album. Peter Buck is all over it, but Colin Meloy is one of the best song writers around and the band and session players are tight and focused. The close harmonies with Gillian Welch, especially on &#34;Down By the Water&#34; gives one goosebumps.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|so much fun to play! you can do a lot of things if you have a great imagination.  I think. everyone. should get it
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard T. is one of the very best and here he's at the absolute top of his form. Brilliant songs, and unique, raging guitar work.
1878424319|3.0|Too simplistic for me...I read a lot and this was good but not in depth . I don't know why it was so highly rated actually.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I'm a big fan of Queen, I love the collection!<br />The case is not fancy, but it's okay!<br />I am satisfied!
1616550414|5.0|That's really about it. It's a great look into pre-production and concept art. I'm in my 30s and having friends come over and see it always gets their attention. No excuse, buy it.
B000JML90Y|1.0|Darwin has the integrity to admit upfront that he had no proof validating evolutionism, but was just guessing how the hypothetical process might have proceeded if it really did work.
B00C32R64G|3.0|So, I was SO anxious to get the new Volbeat album and stayed up until midnight to download it once it became available.  I love the intro, typical nod to the old west / Johnny Cash type sound.  Then the first track kicked in...and I just didn't like the way the words were phrased into the music behind it.  I kept listening anxiously for that absolute blow me away track, and I felt like I found it at track 7 with \\"Hangman's Body Count\\".  Great hook, heavy groove, straight forward kick ass rock and roll, and Poulson's vocal line is well orchestrated to let his voice do what it does best....grab you and hold on until the song ends.<br /><br />I love the song \\"My Body\\"...it's just a fun song to listen to, and has that I want to smile the whole time this song plays kind of sound to it.  So does older, bouncier Green Day stuff, but Volbeat got me hooked on this one (I feel the same way about their song \\"Magic Zone\\").<br /><br />The track where King Diamond sings with Michael Poulsen???  I skip it now after hearing it about 5 times, and the reason is because Poulsen's vocal line is great, and the guitar riff at that point is just bad ass....but I can't stand King Diamond's intro vocal howl, for lack of a better term.  This song is like taking a phenomenal singer, and letting some dude off the street come in and do every other line.  I'm sure there are plenty of people that are King Diamond / Mercyful Fate fans who will disagree, but the King just ain't what he used to be.  If someone told you that King Diamond was doing guest vocals on a song on the new Volbeat album, and you tried to picture what it would sound like in your mind, this would be it....way too predictable, almost boring.<br /><br />Cape Of Our Hero.....I like the song, and it's an inspiring type of song...but I don't feel uplifted when I hear Caggiano's guitar work on this one.  It just kind of stays in the groove, but I don't listen to it and feel that wow factor that I'm listening for.  I totally understand doing a melody type of guitar line, but make it take me somewhere in the song....<br /><br />Other than that, I just don't hear that standout song for me.  Please keep in mind I LOVE VOLBEAT and will be going to see them in the next few weeks, and I really can't wait.  Hopefully the more I listen to this, I will change my mind, but in writing a fair review, I thought one thing.<br /><br />Forget that this album is done by Volbeat, and just listen to it as a rock album, and be honest with myself.  This is the review I'm giving based on that
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've now seen all the first season and 2 episodes of the second. Subtle clues make characters' motivations easy to understand. Anxious to see the rest of the series.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|With an echo of the latest Feist album &#34;Metals&#34; and a touch of Lana Del Rey resonance, this amazing original album features deep drums, moving symphony melodies, and the laid back yet compelling voice of Woodkid. The whole album made me feel like I was about to go into battle haha. It was epic yet relatable. I have found a new favorite artist with a brilliantly original style. Loved this album and can't wait to hear more from him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game Nice graphic details are superb but it could really have something else added like different levels but I love the game its very additive
B004SBBDB2|2.0|I purchased this to use while on-the-road traveling to replace an iPod-to-TV connection kit. It never worked from the minute I received. I'd sporadically get sound, but never video. Maybe I'm doing something incorrectly. But I figure it shouldn't be difficult. Make all necessary connections and bingo, right? Not for me ...
1451696191|3.0|I was expecting earth shattering brilliance from this book.  It's not brilliant but it's okay.  Maybe I expected too much due to all the hype surrounding it.  There were parts that were amusing, parts that were sad and parts that rambled and made it hard to understand.  None of the characters grabbed me.  I wanted to feel connected to them or feel like I had something in common.  I didn't.  The end of the book just left me feeling unsatisfied.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Classic lines, a fantastic ensemble cast, one of the last chances to see legendary actor Jack Lemmon, and some very memorable lines. What could be better than a Mamet written screenplay, with Lemmon, Pacino, Arkin, Baldwin, Pryce, Harris, and Spacey. Worth seeing over and over again...a true classic!
0802473156|5.0|We often think that the Golden Rule means to treat others the way that we want to be treated.  Actually, a better rule is to find out how others want to be treated, and treat them that way.  The whole point of this book is for each of us to listen to how the other likes to be treated, how the other experiences actions as loving, so that we can increase that for our partners, or kids, or friends for that matter.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I love this series.  It is gripping, heart wrenching, dirty, nasty and I feel emotions when I watch this show...how much I hate Geoffry and how the heros in the story struggle so much.  It's actually very much like real life now.  Just different degrees based on the era of time we happen to be in now.  I know I would have not wanted to have lived during the middle ages.  I like my shower!
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the Stargate series and was sorry when it ended.  The Stargate Atlantis provides a good continuation to the series. Some of the stories are similar (chasing the same bad guys over and over). A few of the characters fall short on the chain-of-command concept and no whinning policy should have been adopted.  However, overall I like the sci-fy save the world storyline and the characters do stay true to their form.  There are many more positive aspects of the show that make it good and earning the 5 stars from me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the few times I've wanted to give a five star rating to a book. I shied away from it because I don't normally identify with stories about younger characters, but this turned out to be one of the most intelligent, meaningful, breathtaking books I've ever read. Grab some Kleenex and prepare for an emotional ride
0374214913|4.0|I listened to the audio and totally enjoyed it.  It has a knitting museum!  Ha, Ha - How could I not love that!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book.  I was completely engrossed.  The first 100 pages are a little slow, not bad, just not action-packed.  Stick with it.  I promise you will be pleased.  This is a great read!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|If you love Nicholas Sparks books this one won't disappoint. An easy heartfelt read. Of course I wished it had ended a bit differently.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This is a superb fit for my Paperwhite.The pink is bright and maybe on the orange side but it is easy to locate when I can't remember where I set it down. I spilled coffee with cream on it the second day I had it and it washed off completely with soap and water; no stain was left and it dried quickly.<br /><br />Update:  Took this with me on two camping trips which exposed it to lots of grime.  This thing has been handwashed four times so far and comes out looking new every time.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Despite losing key songwriters the band was able to put together a great set of interesting and fun songs.  It's not all classic pop-punk, but departures are often the best songs like the funkier &#34;Ain't It Fun&#34;.  &#34;Daydreaming&#34; has an undercurrent of Blondie's &#34;Dreaming&#34; to it and the run between it and &#34;Part II&#34; is my favorite section of the album.  But right after that you get two classic Paramore style songs in &#34;Last Hope&#34; and &#34;Still Into You&#34;.<br /><br />It's less &#34;consistent&#34; than Brand New Eyes but it might be more entertaining in the long run.  Either way, it fits the catalog very well and makes me glad they stuck with it.
B0013DCC72|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite albums. It reminds me of my little brother that died ten years ago and makes me feel like he is right here again!
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I don't know why... it is a good movie, but something about this one gets her.  The special features are pretty good with some animated shorts featuring the Minions.  Looking forward to the sequel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game all the time and love it!  I also enjoy playing Pyramid Solitaire - do you have an App for that?
B009PK9SB8|5.0|It can be seen immediately on the spot images are very useful.<br />I think that you can share with everyone, not just me is good.<br />I love it
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly is my favorite mystery writer and the Black Box is another great Harry Bosch story. I love the way he ages Harry, the relationship between him and his daughter, how he's setting the stage for more stories with his daughter, and how he manages to catch exactly what's going on in Southern California and LA in particular. He artfully weaves in real events with fiction to make stories that are entirely believable. While this might not be the best Harry Bosch novel, it will keep you turning the pages right up until the end.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Decent read. Great action. Some of can get a little winded and too lengthy at moments.  Really enjoying the Teacher series though. Preferred book 1  to this one.
B00008GKEG|4.0|First things first: it is an amazing documentary that was detailed and held interest despite its epic length.<br /><br />I enjoyed the DVD and liked the interviews, although bringing in other members of the Beatles circle beside Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall would have been useful. Engineers like Norman Smith, fellow Merseybeat group members who hanged out with the group (part of Brian Epstein's stable of stars), original Cavern audience members, family members of the group (especially Lennon's family, as he had several nieces and nephews who could have led some insight into a man who obviously could not be interviewed for this series), and even their spouses at the time would have added insight into the group.<br /><br />Second, I wished they did not have the Beatles \\"talking over\\" during the videos and performances, notably \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Rain\\" and \\"Day Tripper.\\" In fact, the Hey Jude film takes off the David Frost introduction and further cuts the ending by a few minutes.<br /><br />I also thought the DVD extras would include things like unavailable televised specials like \\"The Music of Lennon and McCartney,\\" \\"Around the Beatles,\\" and other specials for collectors and fans. Or, the complete televised concerts like the ones in Japan, Germany, and Australia, or the Shea Stadium concert, where the music can do the talking. I would have preferred their \\"Ready Steady Go\\" appearances in place of the Threetles discussing their career. Having the surviving Beatles commiserate and discuss their career was revelatory (I am sorry but Harrison seemed very uncomfortable around McCartney and they even seemed testy at points) but that could have been one of the many extras.<br /><br />Lastly, a small section on their solo careers should have taken some of the last section.<br /><br />I found it jarring how George Harrison's hair was long in one interview, mustache in one, long hair and beard in another, clean shaven, then mustache. Did he get bored with his hair or something?<br /><br />Overall though, it IS the Beatles. This is the best documentary on a rock group ever. I pray the Rolling Stones for 50 years could someday get an \\"Anthology style\\" treatment as good as the 8 year recording career of the Beatles.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|the final dvd for my collection hope to get them all as a set in blu-ray .  It was sad to see the story end .  what a fantastic adventure for all to see through the years .  A true legacy to hand down from generation to generation Harry Potter will truly live on.
B0000AFQS0|4.0|The film itself is extrordinary, so this review is about the special features in this special edition. My gripes are what was not included, and should have been included. It is know that Jeff Stein cut out songs and guests from the original running documentary but did not bother to remove them from the final credits. If you look closely at these closing credits, there were several edits that eliminated songs like Call Me Lightning and some guest stars in the film, notably the  Band's Rick Danko. Why not make the contributions of the edited appearances a bonus feature, or include them in an \\"ultimate\\" Kids are All Rights. It would have been good to also have included as a bonus the 15 minute film Jeff Stein used to lure the Who into participating in this documentary in the first place. The film is superb...no doubt about it. I was just annoyed this special edition did not included the truncated songs listed in the closing credits, as well as the guests trimmed from the final edit.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|love this season,  every episode very intense the ending was GREAT can't wait for season three.  already have it on pre-order !!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|It was entertaining! Jamie Foxx did a great job and it was over before I knew it. There was a lot of violence but I'm too cynical for Disney so that's okay.
030758836X|1.0|I just finished \\"gone girl\\" and I am trying my damnedest to be reasonable with this review, but this is an incredible disappointment. Characters who are caricatures, laughable dialogue (I was giving this the benefit of the doubt...thinking that the author would somehow explain away the fact that her characters spoke in non-stop cliche, like an \\"it was all a story in some bored housewife's mind\\" scenario, but sadly, no), an utter lack of tension after the first half (what editor would accept that the \\"big reveal\\" occurs at the halfway point?), despicable people, logical ineptitude (Nick JUST got grilled over the \\"murder scene\\" with the detectives, yet he walks into another crime scene and starts PICKING UP items? I know this has no relevance in the novel's twisted sense of logic, but come ON), utterly incomprehensible structure (why give the reader so much insight into Amy's mind (from both Nick's perspective and her own) from the beginning? Because of this, I figured she was complicit from a quarter of the way in (the \\"clues\\" were so snide, there could be no other explanation) and it just got more boring from there...we, as the readers, know she's \\"pregnant\\" and then 30 pages later it's supposed to be a *shock* when the rest of the world learns that she's \\"pregnant\\"; we know that he's having an affair and then 30 pages later it's *shocking* that he's having an affair, etc., etc.)...there's a great story here but I'll be damned if Flynn knew how to bring it together. I applaud the author for gaining such readership; that this \\"novel\\" could be recommended to lovers of \\"The Secret History\\" or compared to Patricia Highsmith's work (Janet Maslin, your opinions are not to be trusted), however, is offensive. After 100 pages, I was actually telling friends how fabulous this book is. By the halfway point I was questioning my initial opinion. Now, having finished it, I'm wondering how I'd wronged those friends who'd recommended it to me.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Believe it or not this was the first taste of Stevie back in 2001 when this first came out! Im 26 so when t5his came out I was abt 14 and seen the Everyday video on VH1, bought thiis and kinda forgot abt it, untill 2011 when she was comin to Toledo for her In Your Dreams tour so I bought that album and her Crystal Visiions and caught up on all of the amazing songs in her catalog, man i had been missing out. So i immediatly went thru my things searchin for this cd and found it.I listened front to back a couple times and still listen to it everyday, my favorites are TISL, Sorcerer, Its Only Love, Planets, Too Far From Texas, Fall From Grace, I Miss You and Love Is ( some of the most incredible lyrics of all her solo records) Its kinda has a Lilith Fair kinda feel and sound to it w all the guest vocals and production! Stevies voice sounds incredible on this record and the cover art is beautiful! Bottom Line: still one of my favs of all 7 albums of Stevies career and always will be!! Love u Stevie, Andrew H
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|A very well put together movie with wonderful acting. The songs feel fresh and stick with you for days. A must watch in my book.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I'm very impressed with the quality of this cover. I love that swivel feature although it's a bit tight but you can loosen the screws just a tad and it fixes that up just fine. The Kindle fits in the casing perfectly making it seem like the cover is built in to the outer housing. I would recommend this cover to anyone.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son combed the internet and stores looking for a &#34;real&#34; T-Rex.  He finally settled on this one after seeing it in the store.  It was less expensive to order it on Amazon.  It arrived today and he is POSITIVELY THRILLED.  He is very detail oriented and he really enjoys the tremendous detail in this model (don't dare call it a toy!).  Thank you!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really good weather app. I use this regularly to keep an eye on the local weather.  I need to reach the min o. words.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this DVD as a gift. They enjoyed it a lot. Highly recommend it for the whole family.  Can't wait for the next one.
0345529057|5.0|I won't use this review to say much about the plots of the books.  With over 10,000 reviews I think enough exist already for someone to make an educated guess as to if they'd like the series or not.  I will say that this is by far the BEST deal if you're not sure about purchasing the books.  At $20 for 4 BOOKS...make that 4 OUTSTANDING BOOKS, even if you don't like it, the set will make a great re-gift to someone (trust me, I've met \\"Games\\" fans in the weirdest places...odds are, you know one also).<br /><br />Go head, take a chance.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|very good collection and it may not have every bonus scene some fans want but it has  every episode that was shot plus some bonus footage that you are sure to enjoy ... I still can't get over the fact that they cancelled this amazing show
0307711773|5.0|This book is a great addition to my series of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, I recommend it to everyone. I just love how it picks up where Percy is missing and Anna Beth is searching for him at the same time going on a new adventure with Jason Grace and his friends. A must read and have.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books! Great story and very entertaining, you won't be able to put it down (nor will you want to)! Definitely very edgy, not for the ultra-conservative or faint-of-heart!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You know you have an awesome show on your hands when you are constantly re enacting scenes because the characters are that good.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got this free on special.  It was a fun game.  There are 80 levels of the same game, but they got more difficult as I went up.
0765325950|5.0|All of these books which I ordered for my grandson were received as stated and have been greatly enjoyed  R.A Salvatore, Raymond  E.

B000QGAU4E|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. I enjoy anything that has something new to offer. While this movie was typical in some of it's over-dramatizing, it definitely held my attention throughout.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|It is pretty good but their is never really anything new I got this app about 3 months ago I played it the first two weeks but nothing sence

B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a great quality film that gives you a lot to think about when considering your family's eating habits.
B0013DCC72|5.0|It's hard to call something so fresh a classic, but when you have such memories that seem so far away, it is hard not to label it as such.  Incubus is one of those bands that makes me want to find a view overlooking the ocean or the lake during the evening while sipping on a glass of wine and thinking of how to improve on everything in life.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Marsalis, Clapton, Taj Mahal and the other wonderful musicians on this album transform Clapton's &#34;Layla&#34;into a Dixieland dirge and perform similar miracles on other old standards.
B003498SDA|5.0|I am not a fan of Tom Cruise but he does pretty well in this movie. Its gripping and keeps your attention the entire time.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|The more I read, the more enthralling it became. The book was harder to put down the nearer it got to the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book I couldn't stop reading I finished it in two days. Is so detailed you can almost feel like you are there.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|I gave Season 6 only 4 stars because they replace Daniel with Jonas.  And I didn't like Jonas.  Thats why.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I enjoyed the first part. It seemed intriguing. Then it felt like Twilight all over. She lost all her independence over this guy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book was a little slow at certain points but had me at the end. Was on the edge of my seat in every book. The book had a perfect ending and am completely satisfied!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Despite its popularity, I enjoy these books. I have reread them recently and find them just as engaging as the first time.
1449433251|5.0|I got this as gift for a Calvin and Hobbes lover, and they loved it. It looks great, and is the entire collection. It is a great read and a great gift! Slightly heavy though so be aware of that, roughly 12-15 pounds.
B00386F0DA|5.0|Its wonderful to be able to have 3 movies together that are all great.  You just want to wait for a rainy day, curl up with a blanket and watch them one after the other.
1451629184|5.0|I bought this book for my wife. She read it cover to cover in less than two days. She has heart for children of abuse.The book has helped her in understanding some of those she works with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game!  I usually do not waste my time with games, but Temple Run 2 is challenging, stimulating, and fun!  The only problem I have with the game is I lose all track of time when I am playing it!  It is just that good!  Try it!  You will not be disappointed, but be aware it can be addictive!
1400052181|4.0|This book is great for a book club, as there is so much to discuss.  It is both controversial and informative.
0446580848|3.0|I really do love Nelson Demille books, just not his recent books.<br />I love the John Corey character, and am pleased that DeMille has written more than a few books around him. BUT, the recent writing by DeMille is certainly not up to his standards of books written during his prime.<br />If you want tension, action and suspense, read The Charm School..... The Talbot Odyssey..... Word of Honor....., among others. I read them while I was working a full time job, and would end up reading until 2:00 AM (with the alarm going off at 6:00 AM), because I literally could not put the books down. THAT is tension, and action and suspense. I had to force myself to read The Panther.... it truly was tedious, and I gave the review 3 stars only because I love John Corey.  I hope DeMille gets his MoJo from the past back, or I am done with his books.
B008OOYALE|5.0|so fun to wait and see what new dragons you can create. easy, fun,  creative and easy to play. love it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|only downside is you run out of coins to quickly. it takes overnight before you have enough to play again.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well,I loved the first temple run and there is absolutely no doubt that I<br />Love this one too. The best part is that it is absolutely free.
1455523550|4.0|I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books, but do not think this is one of his best.  Enjoyable Read though.

B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Do these instant view buys include the extra features? that is the only* thing preventing me from going digital.  It would be nice to cut down on space, since my house is small.

B00BBA6FMU|3.0|Great dirt novel for the writer.  Found it sad and a little too predictable.  But a good story.  Good job.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|My 8 year old loves Roger and has all paperback.  Since he has the Kindle he can reread the book and laugh over and over again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was such a beautiful story about the human spirit and the ability to survive. It is a wonderful story of love and forbearance. I truly enjoyed reading it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good, enjoyed ever so much.  Will be looking forward to reading more of Suzanne Collins unique brand of writing.
159668139X|5.0|This has been the next best thing to a master weaver at your side. I can't get the local weaving guild or arts council to help me out with contacting the one weaver who gives lessons in our area so this will do till I get back to Vermont where I have a Master Weaver to teach me.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|The movie, Schindler's List, outlines the struggles experienced by both Jews and non-Jews during the time of the Holocaust. Schindler begins with the excitement of how much money he is going to make off of the sufferings of the Jews. Virtually free labor means extreme profits for him. He becomes so successful, due in large part, to his hired Jewish bookkeeper. Throughout the movie, it is clear he realizes the value his bookkeeper has to his success. He treats him well, considering the treatment of the Jews during that time. As times grew worse for the Jews and they were treated more and more barbaric, Schindler mourns the temporary loss of profits. More than that, there is a sense that he is mourning for the people, knowing that what was happening was wrong. When the Jews were shipped out in train cars, he is shown spraying water into the cars in an attempt to somewhat relieve their thirst and suffering. Schindler was a businessman by all accounts, but not evil, as some of the others in power exhibited in relation to the barbaric treatment of the Jews. When it became evident that the Jews were going to be shipped off and killed, Schindler made a list of those he wanted to purchase in an attempt to save their lives. As he is getting into his car to flee the area as he was guilty of war-related crimes, his emotions overcame him. He realizes he could have purchased more people with the money he had invested in his car and any other valuables he had. The Holocaust affected the Jews tremendously, but it also affected non-Jews in emotional ways, as evident by the portrayal of Oskar Schindler.<br /> Schindler's List portrays religious persecution that has happened in the world for many centuries. It has an important part in the study of World Religions because it documents the extreme suffering of people simply because of their beliefs. On our day and time, we just don't see this type of persecution based on one's religion or race. Sure, there are people ridiculed and judged for their beliefs and practices, but nothing to the extent of the Holocaust. It is extremely important for these types of horrific tragedies to stay in the studies of religion as a reminder of the freedoms we experience today. It can also serve as an encouragement to step in, when possible, to help others in our society. Religion is very different today than it was during the time of the Holocaust. Without the studies of these types of incidents, society cannot truly grasp what it means to have freedom from religious persecution.
B00B6ELPIU|4.0|The Knife are back, and they're going to get in your face about it.  The cover is as indicative of the album's contents as the \\"manifesto\\" the group circulated prior to the album's release - clashing colors deliberately designed to offend the eye, great washes of empty space, but curious pictures that invite examination and response.  This album is as much statement as it is art.  It's only aiming to invite you in close enough to claw at your face.<br /><br />That said, this is not as great a departure from either The Knife's earlier work or from other artists as the early hype might lead you to believe.  The beat-oriented tracks still retain a lot of the elements that fans of Silent Shout will be familiar with - crazily pitch-shifted vocals, metallic synths hammering out polyrhythms, a general sense of chaos about to break loose.  What's changed is the mood and execution.  While Silent Shout was deliberate, by turns fearful, playful or anxious, Shaking The Habitual is primarily aggressive and unhinged.  Synths are splattered and detuned, entire compositions verge to the atonal even as the rhythms grow more complex and the lyrics pointed.  Even the ambient pieces are marked clearly as a challenge - dare you to listen for 20 minutes to some dark drone and construction noises!  It's less music to be enjoyed than survived.<br /><br />But there are clear antecedents to this method - Suicide, Pan Sonic (whose 240-minute opus [[ASIN:B003NL1F16 Kesto]] is a good next step for those who enjoy this), Einstürzende Neubauten.  Shaking The Habitual is a dance group plunging their house music into the acid bath of industrial and seeing what the liquified remains produce.<br /><br />But the album is a victim of its own excess.  While the 98-minute running time gives the album a certain weight and gravitas, it also drags down some tracks that could have been made more concise, and pads out its length with drone tracks that simply test the listener's patience.<br /><br />The firsttwo tracks take the drill-hammer to The Knife's old sound in thrilling fashion, adding a prickling metallic counter-rhythm to \\"A Tooth For An Eye\\" and a buzzsaw edge of distortion to first single \\"Full of Fire\\".  \\"A Cherry on Top\\" is far more experimental than the first two tracks, creating atmosphere out of heavy reverb and the sound of a tuning plucked instrument while Karin's nigh-operatic downshifted vocals touch on the quotidian - food and drugs.  \\"Without You My Life Would Be Boring\\" is third-world drum and bass, replete with acrobatic synth runs and steam-whistle backing vocals.  \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" has Coil-like metallic percussion together with a menacing zither progression - it's like Trent Reznor took a combination of cough syrup and acid then hallucinated about India.  This stretch of the album shows the rewards of The Knife's new method - tracks 3-5 really do sound like little else, ever.  Lest the listener be taking too much pleasure in the innovation, Track 6, \\"Crake\\" is a blast of painful FM synthesis veering into static - and along with its sister track \\"Oryx\\" shows how a little bit of sadistic noise can go a long way.<br /><br />Then there's 19 minutes of drone to finish disc one.  19 minutes.  With little to no development but simply atmosphere.  It's a deliberate check to expectations, and clearly a gutsy move, but it would have been better if the track itself had some purpose beyond simply hanging there.  There are far more interesting dark ambient soundscapes in existence.  The crawling tension that's present means it doesn't even serve as proper relief from the sheer intensity of the album's first half.<br /><br />Side two almost mirrors Side One's development.  \\"Raging Lung\\" is a hybrid of vintage Knife and African drumming much like \\"Without You My Life Would Be Boring\\", \\"Networking\\" is one of Kraftwerk's machine-men having a bad nightmare, and \\"Stay Out Here\\" blends distorted beats with barely-tuned synthscapes to terrifying effect,almost like a mash-up of \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" and \\"Full of Fire\\".  But before letting go, there's one more painful ambient piece: \\"Fracking Fluid Injection\\" is purely irritating, a slowly oscillating drill-like hum alternated with wailing sounds, beatless and droning, for ten straight minutes.  Closer \\"Ready to Lose\\" is almost soothing by comparison, perhaps to hammer home the lyric's message: \\"We are ready to lose our privilege.\\"  It's the precise opposite of a spoonful of sugar making the political message go down - if everything else is scabrous and seething, the politics look innocuous by comparison.<br /><br />The thing is, the album is at its best - its most scary, thrilling and provocative - when it retains its forward momentum.  The sequencing here might be deliberately anti-conventional, but it's also anathema to a cohesive listen.  Whatever the stated targets - patriarchy, genetic engineering and extreme wealth all get mentions - The Knife's real enemy is self-indulgence.<br /><br />One last comparison - apologies for making so many.  The most recent album this is reminiscent of is actually Sufjan Stevens' [[ASIN:B0043X7WLA The Age of Adz]].  That was a similar case of a hipster-elite artist seeming to willfully challenge his fanbase with sonic experimentation and egregiously extended track lengths.  Both that album and this one are mind-expanding when listened to attentively, but have mileages that may vary for everyday listening or casual users.  Caveat emptor - you probably won't like everything you hear on this record, at least not in any conventional way.  But you might feel braver for it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book I have watched the movie and I thought that was good. Now having read the book I think the book has more adventure in it and more suspense in to.
B000PHNHMQ|4.0|Happy overall, only downfall is the depth adjustment. Had to remove the no-mar tip to get enough depth for it to set the nails below the surface.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My book club read this book and we couldn't stop talking about it.  Not only was the book a beautiful story and written very well but the discussion about how we deal with the disabled was very relevant.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game.  It is a great tool for my memory and concentration.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The layout is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Along with myself my six year old loves this game. it keeps us both busy. I would definatly suggest this game to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Hi I think that they have a button so than we can do fractions and it would make it easyer for Mr and a lot of other people
B00881VLCE|2.0|Been playing for a few months and even paying for more puzzles and really enjoyed it.  Lately I keep getting redirected to internet ads and it's a pain.  I would pay for app to get ads removed and don't want to turn WiFi off every time.

1608871517|5.0|If you love the King of Pop, then I highly recommend this book for you. The entire book is filled with stunning photographs of Michael's costumes, along with the back stories of why and how they were created. It's absolutely stunning. Definitely a must have for anyone who loves Michael Jackson. Long live the King.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book is a great read and I have read it numerous times in my 53 years. The story and characters never disappoint and I would definitely recommend it not only as a great horror novel but as a good book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the app and play it on my kindle and I phone.  I would give it a 5 but adds pop up at the worse timed and sometimes stick.  I know the adds pay for free service, but it is frustrating.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever seen, the acting, the story lines, everything is first rate. I can't wait for season 4!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I think Sheryl has gotten a lot of criticism for it but her points are valid.  Additionally, she notes that for change to happen we also need changes made in many other ways but her book specifically how women and men in leadership roles can do their part.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a really great game. I would've given it five stars if I could play the entire game for free. I'm on disability and can't afford to spend money on games. It would be even better if you could find the picture of the next level hidden somewhere in the level before it.
B000002LBH|5.0|Great addition to any music library.  Contain some of the Smiths greatest works.  It will not disappoint.  Must have for any music fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you need a calculator this is a good one. it's free and it gets the job done  so i'm happy with it.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Love the story line. Graphics were great. Worst part of game is that it had to end<br />Game range smooth.
B004Y5AV4M|4.0|I love this GH book. It is second only to her book Grand<br /> Sophy.  A lovely strong willed smart heroine deals navigates through well meaning relatives, servants and friends to be with her true love. It is a turn worthy of Jane Austen.
B00124OEBY|5.0|This is amazing, timeless music from the Bee Gees. Those who only know the 70s disco Bee Gees may not realize how truly talented they were in the early days. This is a must-have.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Hated that my wife always had her cell phone plastered to her ear when driving.  With my recent purchase of a new truck, and the built in Bluetooth, I quickly came to value having the hands free option my wife was missing.  So, after a bit of research, I purchased this unit.  Call quality is great.  She can hear me, I can hear her.  Got a kick out of the \\"complaint\\" that the Bluetooth signal was so strong it wouldn't disconnect even when a user was inside.  The unit turns off very quickly so I don't see that as a problem.  My wife's phone pairs almost instantly when the united is turned back on. Saves battery life so its a win win for me.<br /><br />Update:  My wife has been raving about this since day one.  For a while she was calling me just to tell me how much she liked the product.  Had to tell her to stop.  Great product. Upped my rating to 5 starts
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Very intelligent score, it covers all the different moods and tones of the stories stitched together with an underneath central theme. Styles and music varies with the story. Great!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King has always been my favorite author, and Mile 81 is a must have! Another great book by Stephen King!
B009O07NDY|5.0|The score revisits the Lord of the Ring trilogy score.  It starts with the bewitching theme of the Ring, then it introduces  the pastoral theme of the Shire and, as the journey develops, a much darker and dynamic score is unrolled.  Well mixed and balanced, it serves to accentuate the story and it stand s alone as a very good score.
159514188X|5.0|Jay Asher is a great author! Thirteen Reasons Why is one of those books once you start to read it, you can't put it down!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Expensive... but worth every penny.<br />A very deep and extensive game. Absolutely blows away all other &#34;RPG&#34; titles out there.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I've had my MicroShell for about two weeks, at first I really liked it. But, this morning I noticed that the rubber coating on the back of the case has started to peel off at the corners. For what I paid, I expected it to stay nice longer.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented it twice.  My daughter watched it 6 times during that period and asked me to purchase it for her.  Turned out to be a fun family movie for us.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Explains a lot of unanswered questions.Completes the ending of this story  and series.If you see the first movie you will not stop til you end with this one.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a good game. It is challenging and fun game. I play this for hours. This is a must have game.
0345803485|5.0|I really love this book. I have read it several times over and over again. I have read many books like 50 Shades and each get the same response. It is a must read.
0062011847|3.0|Many bash this novel as not living up their expectations as another book in the Discworld series, even though it is still an enjoyable read. Sure it doesn't hit all those notes we've come to love and expect from the series, but that doesn't mean you have to throw it under the train.<br /><br />I gave it a 3/5, because although it wasn't the qualities I hoped for, I don't regret reading it. It's certainly not anywhere near my top 5, or top 10 for that matter. However, I'm always glad when the series sheds light on areas far removed from the rest of the books, even if it turns out much somber than usual.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was really amazing.. it was witty & charming.. This book makes you believe true love exists.. It kept me intrigued until the end..
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good story from beginning to end. Main action is predictable but the details make it interesting. It was entertaining. I recommend.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A pleasure to read.  Complicated but believable.  Most interesting characters woven into historical situations.  Ready for the next installment of this trilogy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed something on my Kindle Fire HD that would allow me to do numbers... my calculators were getting useless -- just a sometimes item that I really didn't want to carry all the time.  Whereas my Kindle is generally in the same place that I am when I need to run numbers.<br /><br />This has the advantage of showing what you entered -- the whole multiple entry sequence -- as you do it ... so you can do what calculators don't let you do ... see if you made an entry error when the answer just doesn't seem what you expected.  It also means not running the numbers twice to ensure you entered what you thought.<br /><br />AND ITS FREE ... now that is a price you gotta love.
B002UPQ246|5.0|I bought this one as a &#34;birthday gift&#34; for an elderly friend.  She LOVES it.  She hums it.  It is good in itself but especially good for those who &#34;remember way back when&#34; this music was first presented.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought it was good because the ending will surprise you. I hate reviews because people tend to write too much.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|i am enjoying this cd so much i grew up on steely dan so it was a lovely surprise when new material came out
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Cute game.  Very addictive.  Had a little trouble adding friends, but it worked itself out.  Good game overall for all ages.

B009HOU672|4.0|Resulta complejo escuchar las cuatro estaciones de Vivaldi &#34;recompuestas&#34; porque se la oye con mucha frecuencia en todos los medios. Sin embargo, creo que Richter logra una versión con una fuerza inusitada.

B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Catchy tunes and good harmonies.  Have been a Kenny  Loggins fan since his best days with Jimmy Messina.  If you like good country rock with good singing and harmonies this is the CD for you.The way to listen to this is to slap on a good pair of headphones and enjoy.  Whoever did the mastering on this CD did a great job. Listening to the harmonies on headphones is a treat. The more you listen to this the better it gets. Really not a weak track on the whole CD.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Impressed with the build quality, the feel of the knobs and their operation (smooth spanning), and the sound that this outputs.  It produces a very clean sound that actually strengthened my system.  My old mixer usually meant I had to turn my amps up to 3/4 power..my last gig with this new mixer I never took them over 1/4 power and they were blowing the room out!  Very impressed and highly recommended as an awesomely portable pro audio solution!!
B007PKDW44|5.0|I enjoy this CD so much. It is across between rock and hard rock. Some songs are slow some are not. It is really good. Check it out.

B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is the bomb. Easy to use, stylish, and compact. Protects my kindle too. My only wish is that it integrates with a tabletop charging unit.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thought I was reading a book about a girl who had cancer and was fighting it. I was not expecting a story like the one I just finished reading. It wasn't a cancer book it was a book about romance and these teens getting comfortable with their bodies and find who they are in this world of ours.
0062238868|5.0|I think this book was an amazing view right into all the action going on in Iraq, Afghan, and other places Chris Kyle was sent.  I want to be USMC Force Recon and this book really gives you the nitty gritty of it all, and for six bucks?  Come on!  not to mention he is a great american hero defending his country.  Anyone who loves america and those who defend it (and a little taliban slaughtering) then for sure buy it!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Trekkies will love! It's old and corny, but great fun!  Kirk and Spock are the best. Rest of cast lovable.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I got this game to play on my kindle when I am away from home.  But, when I try to launch it when I am away with no WIFI I get an error saying I require an internet connection to play.  I bought this game, I should NOT have to be tethered to the internet to play it.

B00B23O96A|3.0|Eric's voice still strong.  As far as the songs, I only really liked &#34;Born to Lose&#34; and &#34;The Folks Who Live On The Hill&#34;.  I'll consider ordering one of his older CDs.

B000FC10MU|4.0|I read this book by Neil Gaiman the first time in an incredibly busy part of my life when I was either in or just finished college, publishing my own work, and voraciously reading a tremendous amount of text without any time to slow down, process, and explore the work that I was reading a little more deeply.  There were some texts that I promised myself I would go back and read again - I can remember these well.  The work of Jonathan Safran Foer, the work of Dave Eggers, and the work of Neil Gaiman among others.<br /><br />American Gods was one of these books, and it was a fantastic, illuminating, and fun read about so many accessible and easy-to-target archetypes that are part of our everyday culture at war with the gods of our forefathers.  It is interesting that Gaiman as a transplant has been able to capture the spirit of America as a figurehead of consumption, and that its people worship and idolize that which is not on a spiritual plane, but rather a material and consumer plane.  Interestingly in this new edition there is even a special features scene at the back of the book with American Jesus that suggests it is even religion itself that is consumed and bought in America as similarly as material goods.<br /><br />This book is a masterful example of speculative fantasy with a story that is tight and uses the setting as a major character in itself.  The main character is an ex convict, the places that the story takes place are the worshiped, run down, low income clearinghouses of our culture, and we learn of the inherent contradictions of the culture to the beliefs and wonder of humanity.  It is a masterpiece of pop fiction and a great deal of fun to read.<br /><br />One thing that I wonder after having read it this time through is the execution and format of the text itself.  It is sprawling, and as big as Texas - but it is in the execution of the writing this time around that I am almost a little bit disappointed with.  Since having read this, I have read a tremendous amount more in my adult life.  Much of it has been classics, criticism, scholarly work, etc.  I wonder how much different the book would have been if it was narrated in the third person and took on a mock-epic sort of writing format in some of the chapters, and that could have been contrasted with the very pedantic narration of Shadow.  Of course, I can't speculate on it because it is what it is - but it is clear in this book that Gaiman has a tremendous amount of knowledge that he was holding back here.  I wonder many things - was it to appease a larger audience?  Was it just to keep the voice of the narrator a regular guy?  I don't know...  But it would have been really cool if it was written in the style of an epic, or in the style of Austen a-la Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.  I know, the meaning is in the text and the text is what it is, but Gaiman is just amazing and it is fun to speculate like this, knowing he could do it.<br /><br />Gaiman is an incredibly talented author, and I respect him a great deal.  His storytelling is tight, and there is hardly a word wasted.  I love American Gods, and I look forward to reading his upcoming Ocean at the End of the Lane.  As a children's book author, he is magical.  As an adult author, he is also magical...  But I would really like to see him unfold his wings a little more, as I know he could, and soar higher in the stylistic and linguistic plane, as I know he could.<br /><br />So much has happened in ten years, though.  Reading a book a second time like this really makes one reflect on where one has been, where they are, and where they are going.  I wonder if I will read this again in ten more years and remember where I was this time, and the time before.  Gaiman helps us to grow, and recognize ourselves in the mirror in American Gods  - To know that he has become an American in this time period and continues to write is just simply amazing.  Sure he is away from home, but something about this text suggests home is here as well, and that he knows this home better than many of us who have lived here our whole lives.<br /><br />In the notes, he ponders on the \\"how dare you?\\" question.<br /><br />Exactly.  How dare he - it is almost too perfect.sts home is here as well, and that he knows this home better than many of us who have lived here our whole lives.<br /><br />In the notes, he ponders on the \\"how dare you?\\" question.<br /><br />Exactly.  How dare he - it is almost too perfect.
B007TK77QE|1.0|Not one single positive or uplifting character.... Still not sure what the book was even about - there was no actual plot or climax!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Preface: I loaned out the original DVD, Avatar, and fortunately it was not returned.  Yes, fortunately, because that's why I ordered this BluRay 3-disk Extended Collector's Edition, and that has made all the difference.<br /><br />It's hard to explain how tremendous the difference is, how much more, how complete the Avatar saga is in this edition.  The theatrical release really is the crib notes version.  Avatar makes so much more sense, is so much more joyous and triumphant a tale in this version.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to get this, give yourself an evening to enjoy this show.  Don't think it through, don't think it out... just do it!
B008602KQI|1.0|Trying Amazon Prime videos for the first time. The captions were out of sync with the audio track and ruined the whole experience for me big time.
1568987846|4.0|With penny pinching the only thing that is chic these days, it is easy to forget the basic things in life that make it worth living.<br /><br />Case in point: this book.<br /><br />After reading countless reviews about how great this book is, I caved and finally got myself a copy. Normally, I lean towards books that are at least 80% text, but this is exactly the opposite. Here is a perfect summary of the book (thanks to its publisher, of course):<br /><br />A Year of Mornings collects 236 images--always taken before 10 am without discussion between the two women--from this uniquely 21st century artistic collaboration. The intimacy of these photographs--discarded clothing, a view of a snowy day from the window, a tablecloth--combined with their striking similarities in color and composition defies the reality of their long-distance collaboration. While clearly kindred spirits, the two women have met in person only once. Their friendship is maintained solely online, sustained by a shared love for moments of serenity, solitude, and peacefulness. The annotated photographs in A Year of Mornings radiate an aura of sweetness and light--the promise of a new day.<br /><br />In just the first few pages, I fell in love with photography and mornings all over again. During my high school days, you couldn't get me out of bed before 9 or 10am (thanks to having first period open, ha). In the past 4 years, I've trained myself to be a morning person, mostly because my fiance is anything but. It is so easy to rush through our morning routines without taking the time to acknowledge and embrace the beauty each new day offers. For me, that is what this book is all about
0061992860|5.0|This book has lots and lots of good advice, and fits in your pocket or bag.  Its not printed on waterproof paper though, so put it in a ziploc bag or something to waterproof it for the field.
0765325950|3.0|I agree with a lot of these comments, both the positive and the negatives. As the conclusion of a 14 novel series, I found \\"A Memory of Light\\" (AMoL) to be sincerely lacking.<br /><br />I could go into a long list pinpointing why, but in the interest of keeping this spoiler-free, I won't. Suffice it to say that there was a plethora of things that should have happened that didn't -- and many of those moments should have been included just for reader satisfaction. And it's a real shame, because I loved the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me, AMoL is a great book. I had a blast reading it until the final words. I mean, a really good time. The problem was that there were so many moments that I kept hoping would happen up until the final page that either a) didn't happen or b) were extremely lackluster when they did occur -- and I do mean, extremely.<br /><br />From the start, I always told people that how WoT would stand the test of longevity would be based, not on the number of books, but on how it ended. I'm sad to say now that I do not believe it will be remembered much in the annals of time despite bestseller status.<br /><br />If you've already read the former novels, you've got to read this one, and you'll more than likely have a good time in the process. But -- because the series is so long, and the end is as lackluster as it is, I can't in good conscience recommend anyone read it if they haven't already started. If it was seven books....maybe...but not 14.<br /><br />As a single book, I give AMoL 5 of 5 for being a fun read.<br /><br />As the conclusion to a 14 novel event, a 1.5 of 5 bringing my overall score to 3 out of 5 stars.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great game!!!!  Gets harder as you go.  Even my 6 yr old enjoys this game.  I really like to play right before I go to sleep at night.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Is this were I review the album?  Or the seller?  Oh, well.  Another awesome album from an awesome band.  Fair price and delivered right to my front door.  What an age we live in.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this whole series. Yes, there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but the story is about a war of seven kingdoms, so I think that the amount of characters keeps it realistic. Martin does a good job of reminding us who these characters are (if we tend to forget) thorough conversations with other characters. I was also very happy to see that my favorite characters were back- tyrion, jon, arya! Can't wait to see what happens on book six!
B0058U0EEO|4.0|The album stands up as a complete set - this is not a series of singles. That being said, the &#34;singles&#34; from the album far outshine the &#34;b-sides.&#34;
0345529057|5.0|The story is even more exciting than Lord of the Rings, but with better writing. My only complaint about the whole series is that books four and five should have stayed chronological like the other three books. Martin didn't want to end book four in the chronological middle, and instead of doing so, only followed half the characters for book four and then went back and wrote about the same time frame with the other characters in book five. Not only did this make it confusing when I got to book five, but all of my favorite characters were absent for an entire book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it!! I've recommended it to several others. Flynn kept me on my toes and wanting more. A great read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This a very interesting , the human feelings exposed in a way i have never seen before, it makes me think about what i would do in the same situation, what is really important in this life.
B009R659L8|1.0|The formatting on this book is awful.  The font changes sizes from page to page.  Sentences, paragraphs and pages are missing.  I have turned my font size down to the smallest size, and I am still missing parts of this book.  Please reformat and send an update to those who have purchased this book for the kindle.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I first saw a friend reading the second book  Shadow of Night and was interested, so decided to purchase A Discovery of Witches in order to start the story from the beginning.  Once started I couldn't put it down, and very quickly moved to the second book, which I also found enthralling.  Can't wait for number three.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Read it. You will be glad you did. It would be the greatest honor of my life to meet Marcus Luttrell.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|The writing is superb, and the story is exceptional fiction.  However, the graphic descriptions regarding the demise of some of the animals, the French chef and Ma Pi are a bit over the top.  I originally wanted to see the film...until I read the book.  Now I'm hoping that Hollywood did not do the book justice.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I love this movie the only part I really had to see was when the plan goes upside down...it wasn't long enough...lol
0802473156|4.0|My sister and her husband raved about this book, though they have a great marriage, so I bought it for the daughter and husband!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie - Ben is a wonderful actor, director and producer. The movie brought back memories I remember when it happened
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had seen the movie in the theatre and enjoyed it very much. The music is great<br />and the background is superb. It is definitely a keeper.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|This book was disappointing for stuffing every possible ill of suffocating antebellum plantation life into the story, with characters angelically good or despicably evil, and turning on secrets that wouldn't have been kept secret. The only reason for the use of two narrators seemed to be a convenient way to get parts of the story told. The hand of the author was constantly evident in arranging situations to move the plot forward. The entire story was predictable and shallow.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book, but for me it was hard to read and to understand if you had no medical understanding. I do believe Mr. Alexander and his story and this book also  answered many questions about meeting your loved ones in heaven and I know God only showed him what He wanted him to see, but I have lots more questions!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I saw the movie back in 2009 and I rented it now from Amazon in streaming video to prepare, yeah prepare, for the next installment of Star Trek. Since the rental was for 48 hours, I took the opportunity to watch it twice, yeah twice Laddie. It is that good!. Not perfect mind you, but then what is. Chris Pine does justice to Captain Kirk and the rest of the cast are all right. The key here  though is that producer J.J. Abrams figured out exactly what to do to make this work. He should run for President or something. Or maybe Ambassador to Vulcan. Oops, that's taken.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Great book! Just wish it would be filled in a little more and kept the details straight. The eye colors changed and some other little things.
B00BF11STU|3.0|After this and the Hurt Locker, I'm not a fan of Bigelow's/Boal's narrative style on war. It's slow-paced and most of the characters come off as two-dimensional. There's potential in her films as we get embedded with the protagonist/hero, but nothing really beyond that. The context surrounding Maya - Agency politics, White House reaction, geo-political context are all lost like a blurred background. It lessens the impact of the final achievement. Our heroes deserve more.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|It might be a little slow starting,but a  fast finish!  An old fashion love story.  You'll find it hard to put down.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|super cool game super fun to play ive play every game like this and beet then really fun for kindel.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is so original and well written.  I loved every word and was disappointed when I finished it. I loved the references to flowers. I sure hope the author writes another book soon. .
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This is a fun type movie that we enjoyed watching. It was worth the cost of it, and we'll keep it in our film collection.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs has built a reputation on strong story telling skills as well as excellent writing. My reviews are not professional or even scholastically correct, but I offer my opinion.<br /><br />Dr. Reich's characters are always well written, researched, and fleshed-out. She leaves you wanting to know more about each character, which is a sign of a good author. These are characters who do not indulge in self-pity nor self-aggrandizement. They are normal people with normal problems, weaknesses and successes.  They are people you'd like to have dinner with. They are very real.<br /><br />Dr. Reich's stories are also very well-researched and fun to read. The stories go fast, and end too quickly. Her material is always fresh and educational. I love learning, even if it is just fiction.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|Well, I had 30 days to rip thru these movies, but didn't, and subsequently found that only the first disc was playable.  They froze up, jumped and number 4 jammed at 1 hour and 18 minutes.  At that point I gave up.  The third party seller happily hid behind \\"it's past 30 days\\", (feeds his children on my stolen money he does):  mama Amazon sympathetically says 5 days late on A-Z Guarantee-no can help.  I will approach Warner Video and see if they have human beings there instead of \\"policies\\" that protect crap business attitudes.  I purchased my bad copy from WHY-NOT-SAVE.  I will update this review upon hearing from Warner.  UPDATE 4/19 - Warner Video was dreadfully sympathetic BUT \\"we can't be responsible for Amazon Third Party sellers\\".  Bummer for me., out money AND movies.  Ripped off.  BEWARE OF BUYING FROM THIRD PARTY SELLERS.  SCRUTINIZE PURCHASES CAREFULLY AND MAKE SURE ALL DISCS ARE PLAYABLE .  And don't be old and slow about it!  THERE IS BAD PRODUCT OUT THERE, AND SOME FOLKS ARE HAPPY TO SELL IT.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|it made playing monopoly fun and the characters are too cute!  really fun if you are a south park fan.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Bought this for my daughters who said that it was a blast and that they would recommend it highly for the ladies.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Sweet book in an Irish setting but could have been told in any country. Love hope and survival for those who suffered loss at an ear
0007466064|5.0|The series is Outstanding and this book, (book 5 ) of the series is riveting!!! Bring on the next book, I can't wait!!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have loved Taylor Swift since her very first album. This Cd is great too, though it is less country than her older stuff. I still like her clever lyrics and beautiful voice on the RED album.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Not an easy read, but worth all the effort necessary to understand the connections of characters and themes. The language is amazing and every story grabs you in a different way.
B008J34466|5.0|I always liked Pink and own all of her CDs. She always comes out with great music, and this album is proof of that. it is a nice mix of songs which are fun to sing and dance to.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey!  Season 2 is wonderful, taking place during World War I.  Watching Downton is like entering another world.  I knew I had crossed some sort of a line when everyone at Downton gathered on the lawn for Armistice Day, and Lord Grantham's little speech mentioned that 30 men from their village had perished in the War.  I was actually shedding tears for the men who were lost, and had to remind myself that these people and this village are not real!  Yes, I definitely crossed a line!  Needless to say, I highly recommend Downton Abbey!  It's television drama at its best, and I sincerely wish there were other programs of this quality on the air.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The Lorax movie was really cute. I watched it with some friends and we enjoyed it. I should mention that I love Dr. Seuss. If you ALS like Dr. Seuss, you will like this movie.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|Very interesting slang used. Worth a read for the linguistic value. Plot is pretty flat & predictable (esp if you read the author´s intro).
B003954I9C|5.0|At first I was really surprised when I listened to this album because it is not what I expected t hear from AJ McLean. I am a long time BackStreet Boys fan and especially like AJ. I thought his music would be more 'rough around the edges' and in the rock genre, but actually his songs are upbeat, poppy, and fun. Some are more serious but overall this is a good CD to listen to while you're driving.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the characters and the story line.  The only thing that I did not like was that for me the story was not long enough.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The movie was a great story. You just need to make sure there are no distractions and listen to the movie that shares this interesting good story. We enjoyed it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I got very far into the game but then there was a glitches that occurred which made my attempts twice as fast.  Who knows how to fix it here??!!??!!
B000QRIGJY|5.0|love Harry Bosch stories- easy to read and I enjoy  solving the crime with him. He reminds me of Jerry Orbach
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I purchased this free app while playing a different game; allowed for time to download and even patiently waited for it to 'check for updates'. It came back with, 'no wireless connection'. I patiently double checked for a connection and then retired starting the came - nothing. It still comes up as 'no wireless connection' and will not go beyond this screen. Not only does the game not work but what is the point of loading it to my kindle if I am not able to play it without a wireless connection.
B000W93CHC|5.0|What an incredible journey.  This is a great historical novel and real page turner!  It is one of my all time favorites.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie is a very interesting concept of what the future might hold. For who ?.........Who knows..... Jennifer Laurance plays the lead role extremely well, of a young self-taught survivor with the presence of mind to know that she doesn't know it all.  Refreshing. The storyline was interesting with a few unexpected twists. The violence was there but with a minamal amount of blood and gore. The special effects were good also. I don't normally watch this kind of movie but it caught and held my attention, and from the way it ended, I'm looking for, and forward to a possible sequel.
B008393Q2O|3.0|I'm new to the world of tablets and aps. This ap is pretty easy to use. the only issue is I haven't figured out how to save. i have to close the cover then turn the tablet back on in order to save.

B005DN5BE4|5.0|Amazon is an easy and cheap way to rent/purchase films online.  This film in particular was rented for a scholarly paper and it worked out beautifully!!  No problems at all.
B000023VR6|4.0|I love this CD, along with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem. This one is just a great classic!  :-)
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Great for my laptop and pens, markers, papers, flash drives, keys with lots of pockets and mesh pockets so I can see what is in the pocket. it is rugged, however lightweight. The shoulder straps are well padded. A co-worker has the exact same backpack and recommended it so I purchased one for work.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Since the tour was sold out, I wanted to cry thinking I'd never get a chance to see them.  But this dvd is perfect for the fans who didn't get their tickets within the 3 minutes before they sold out.  The quality of the footage is great, there are extras (music video, interview), and it's fun to watch all the crazy fans screaming and crying all over themselves.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works excellent in android.  It shows you the percentage of battery use giving you the opportunity to finish the work you are doing without inconveniences.  I am very happy with it.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The only problem was that the DVD was shipped two days after the DVD was released in the stores.... But it is a good story.
B008476HBM|5.0|Don't know why I decided to read this but I really enjoyed it.  Had to read  a little slower to understand the way it was written. Plan to read more Jane Austen.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Gross, stupid and bad plot. It looked like they made this for a group of people that don't expect much from a movie. I quit watching after the first 45 minutes. I kept thinking it would get better, but it just got worse and worse. Would not recommend this movie to anyone!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love the videos. Good quality and good artists...seriously don't like that I have to write a book as my review. It's a good app....that's it.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|'Mean Girls' meets '16 Candles' meets 2013.  Thoroughly enjoyed the smart writing and hilarious, laugh-out-loud situations. Guidance Counselor Val steals every scene and has you laughing all the way!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I love this stuff, use it every time. I've always wanted a larger container of it though. Priced like gold darrn'it ... :-)
B00136JS12|5.0|This brought back so many memories.  What an incredible album!  I would rate this album as one of the best of all times.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I think this album is great. Original and meaningful but get the clean if you have kids that are going to listen though.
034580404X|5.0|The books are great already read all three & started to read them all over again. It's best to buy all three at the same time as it will leave you wanting to continue reading. They definitely open your imagination & keeps you entertained. Never bored that's a FACT!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I lost weight a long time ago with weight watchers, which I thought was great. But maintaining it is a bit of a pain because I have to constantly be aware of what i am eating. This method is fabulous, two days a week I can only have 500 cals, not as hard as I thought, and the rest of the time I dont have to think about what i am eating at al, I can eat what I want. I am noticing that on the days I can eat whatever, I don't seem to need as much.  Would highly recomend it.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I got this as a gift and was excited to receive it.  It's smaller than the 205 and 305 models I had previously. The thing I did not like off the bat is the touch sensitive bevel. It's ok once you get used to it, but still my jacket rubs against it and changes the display (different training displays).<br />All that is fine and good,but after a couple years I had problems. I never used it a lot, only during marathon training which after an injury I was forced to stop training for years (total miles used: 250). I could get used to it, but then came the gremlins.  The watch started beeping repeatedly for no reason and turned on and off by itself. When updating it says it transferred data, but it doesn't show on garmin connect.  On my most recent marathon, the time froze and it went dead 30 minutes before the race.  I managed to restart it, the time corrected and it lasted for the marathon.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had problems again.  Today it turned off on it's own and I plugged it in to wake it up. It said 98% charged.  I unplugged it and it said \\"low battery\\". Really? What?<br />I contacted Garmin and they said my battery may be running low and to do a reboot. I did that only a month ago.<br />So,I'm back again looking for a new watch. I'm not sure after 3 Garmin watches I can buy another one from them. What I am sure of, is that I would not recommend this watch for purchase.[[ASIN:B0025UHKNS Garmin Forerunner 405CX GPS Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor (Blue)]]
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I love movies.  If I like them I might watch them twice, maybe 3 times if it's absolutely fantastic.  I've watched Silver Linings 6 times!  I could probably watch it every week for a long time and love it every time I watch it.  It's so perfect in showing us flawed characters, with big hearts.
B008ROGZUU|5.0|I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106\\" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6\\" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.<br /><br />Picture is fine. Colorful costumes and good lighting.<br /><br />Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. Beautifully recorded detailed orchestra extents to the surrounds and gives you a sound stage of 160 degrees. Voices are well balanced with the orchestra and clear due to body mics, but they come mostly through the center. My only complaint. Applause from the sides, which also gives you the impression of sitting in a front row. I listen to this at a loudness setting of -11 db. It will get a bit over 80 db at the loudest passages, but most of the time it is more like a very detailed piece of  chamber music. Andy Rose came to mind, but the Music Producer is David Groves, Music Mix is Jonathan Allen. An excellent job.<br /><br />This is my favorite cast and I can recommend it highly. 5 stars all around.<br /><br />I also have the Verona Special Edition from 2006 with Fiorenza Cedolins as Tosca and Marcelo Alvarez as Cavaradossi. Sound is also DTS-HD MA 5.1 and well worth the price of $9.00. As an outdoor performance, it sports a large stage and a more impressive setting than the ROH. Sound stage is also 160 degrees, but the orchestra is not as detailed and overpowers the voices sometimes. The voices, however, move across the stage with the principals, which gives it more the feeling of a live performance.<br />I play this at a -7 db, at which the cannons at the end of  act one will hit 90 db. Not for the faint of heart, but at that level it really comes to live.<br />I rate the cast a bit below Gheorghiu/Kaufmann/Terfel, but it  is still very enjoyable in it's more forceful way and would get also 5 stars for surround audio.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|This book is amazing. I recommend this to people who love story's from the horses view. It was just amazing.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|at first i was annoyed at the jumping back & forth from year to year but then i got very engrossed in both parts of the story. it was great. ready to buy another of her books.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I thought the movie was more interesting because the book was written for a younger audience.but it is an amazing story
B00846F1YW|3.0|If you even touch the screen to move the room around it sees it as a click. One to many clicks and it gives you less time.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Had to get this movie after seeing it in 3D at the movies with my son & mother (we all loved the movie). The combo was perfect and I pre-ordered it at a great price! Thanks Amazon!
B0051O8Z66|5.0|Great music. Great harmonies. Get this CD and you end up with both Progress and 8 additional tunes.  A wonderful addition to anyone who loves great vocals. Too bad we have to order this as an import. You won't be disappointed! Quick note, individually Gary Barlow and Robbie Williams are tremendous. And the mature men together are superior! The more I listen to this CD the more I love it. Check out \\"When We Were Young\\" and \\"Wonderful World\\"!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|My friend was raving about The Hobbit, and after seeing it, cannot understand why. The best part of the movie was the very beginning, and then it went downhill from there. There was no real storyline to follow, but just a bunch of disjointed action scenes. A big let-down from the Lord of the Rings series, which was fantastic.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|You won't be sitting still for this one. It's a very busy game.  It's not a easy one to start.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I fell in love with Boz Scaggs music with Silk Degrees - and went on to other music - but after seeing Bos in concert a couple of years ago was blown away and went hunting for any of Boz's music - and what a discovery - I now have all his albums and could not wait for Memphis. Its fantastic he is as smooth as ever and so good I am travelling to New York from Australia to see Boz in concert in July.<br />Just love his song 'Can I change my mind'
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I had fun playing.  very simple to play. glad it was free. I would not pay for it. my young kids liked to play it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|We downloaded it for our 8 year old daughter. The Animation is really good....but we are not 100% sure as you need in the end to get gems to buy food, horses, more space etc....and gems cost real money. We will see how interresting the game remains for our daughter without spending extra money. So for now only a 3..
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|8 yr had to read the book before I bought him the movie although he had seen it once before.He knows all the scenes.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Went back to see this movie again after seeing GI Joe - Retaliation.  Thoroughly enjoyed the first movie again!<br />:-)<br /><br />Go Joe!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|8yr loves it and I'm not quite sure why. All it consist of is stick figures that you draw then move around on a quest. Although there is a spot where you draw a fire to set off dynamite and blow things up, that seems to make him laugh every time.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|If you are a fan of music, this is a MUST HAVE!!!  The Delta Blues are the backbone of a lot of music.  Led Zeppeling, The Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers Band, and many more based a lot of their music on the Delta Blues.  If you listen closely, some are basically covers of the Delta Blues.<br /><br />We traveled to Clarksdale, Mississippi which is considered to be the birthplace of the Delta Blues.  The museum there has a wonderful exhibit on Muddy Waters including references to the Rolling Stones.  This CD/DVD combo brought it full circle.  This was a once in a lifetime event.  The back story on how this even happened is worth the price of the set.  Then the music...WOW.  Buy It...  Do not let this one get away!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I go to TripAdvisor everyday. I travel a lot and just can't stop reading reviews about places I want to stay and things I want to do. I have posted my own reviews and hope they have helped someone else.  Love, Love , Love it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's great, I actually study meds, so I use it in my rotations in peds, Totally great, kids love it, and Whovians too
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy playing the different free Angry Birds games when I have a free moment. They are so fun, and don't cost anything.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is an excellent movie for horse lovers all around. I fell in love with the movie and the horse at once!
B00BWI3RTA|5.0|I've always loved her and I'm glad she's bringing us more music. This is a great album to get lost in, drive too, cook too, and love.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant is great. I am sad that this is his last season as the Doctor. I hope that Matt Smith's episodes are as good.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed the music and cinematography of this musical. Very emotional . Anne Hathaway is brilliant in it. Well done.
B0009353IW|5.0|I think there was a slight blemish on the CD but this is used, and it did not affect playing.<br />Arrived right away.  Box was perfect.  NIce CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is by far one of my favorites. Recommend it to everyone.It is pretty cool how you can dodge trains and jump from train to train. Have fin playing.. but don't get caught. That kind of bums the moment. Especially after you are running really fast. B-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a awesome game!!! i love it ; is so funny and the pictures are so good :) the game have a lot of levels and so much competition and games
B0095VPBFY|4.0|I wasn't expecting much to be honest, i bought this mostly for Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, email and playing League of Legends, this APU works great so far handles everything flawless i bought 8GB ddr3 1866 to pair with this APU and was doing great, i took a 6570 that i had in storage and made a big jump in dual graphics, this isn't a power house cpu but can do most of the tasks that the bigger cpus, my machine cost around 350dlls and i'm very pleased.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|How do you make a judgement on an artist who was above and beyond his own time?  He will never be forgotten as long as people listen to music, you will be pleased with the many greats on this album.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love listening to this CD as background music to my work. I believe \\"Beethoven's 5 Secrets\\" is my favorite, but I love them all. Pre-ordering the new CD today.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Love Clapton, thought this would be cool, it was, I'm happy!  I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy all over.  This word count thing is silly.
B0019LZV4E|3.0|maybe Im not a musical type but I usually can take boring and this was just egh<br />the gore was good, and there were a few funny parts I repeated over and over again, especially the ending.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie is about my age and I have loved his music from the beginning.  It always seems to fit the times of my life,  whether I'm crying, laughing or wanting to hear a good story about the lives of other folks.
0449808696|5.0|To anyone who doubts the power of advertising. I JUST started reading this book and my 10 year old identified most of the cereal boxes that the letters on the cover came from.......
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app is worthless. My emails are constantly sent to the Outbox and it frequently force closes. I can't even use italics because it goes crazy. Do not bother fixing. I'm done with this.
B00004W221|5.0|There has been so much good said about Rudy. Speaking about going against all odds, Rudy and his determination takes him to accomplish his major lifetime goal of playing on the Notre Dame Football. Great and true story. Highly recommend this movie!
B002ZG98C8|1.0|I'm glad I didn't waste $$$$$$ on this stinker.I caught it on TV and will never get that time back in my life.The acting was bad,the plot was bad, this is one bad joke on the movie going public.
0670026557|5.0|I started reading this book at Barnes and Noble, then ordered at Amazon because of the great price. Long overdue, but here to stay is the concept of \\"takers, givers and matchers.\\" As I say in my new educational dog book, Awareness Centered Training - ACT, things have to change so bravo to Professor Adam Grant. I would count myself in between the givers and matchers. Whenever I've ventured to the \\"taker path for too long\\", unless it's something I have earned, really deserve, and can afford without hurting any other creatures, than my mantra is \\"balance.\\" Perhaps Adam, in Book II, write about \\"balancers\\" as I did in ACT. Maureen Ross, MA, Author of Awareness Centered Training - ACT.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Can read your Bible or a reading plan on the go, at home, while you are waiting, anywhere.<br />Love it!
B000683VI4|5.0|What a movie, it never gets old watching it. A story about enduring love. Based on a well-written book that has many fans.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I haven't completed the book yet; but can't wait to see how it ends.  Grisham is always worth the read.
B008476HBM|5.0|Not one complaint, I read this in two days it was such a beautiful story! Really keeps you wondering what happens next.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Ok, I admit (1) I have never seen or rather heard this as a play, on stage, (2) never read the play and (3) I have a love/hate relationship with musicals (some I love, others not). Now having set the stage, I found it hard to hear the lyrics of all the songs in this play. Of course I could follow the plot and I knew what was going on all the time but still, would have been better if I could have heard each and every word. It is a puzzle to me why Jackman and Crowe were cast in this movie. I mean singing was more important than acting or so I think. Do not get me wrong, both do ok singing but I think perhaps, actual, trained, singers would have been better and perhaps I would have actually heard every word. In the end, not sure I all that impressed with play or this movie.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|User friendly, syncs seamlessly, keeps me on track.  Love, Love, Love it.  Well worth the price. I give this app a 6+ Gold star
B004UIOUHC|3.0|had many othe bugs due to my other programs on cm tenderloin9 ,hp touch pad. to much scrambled/garbled graphics, etc otherwise fineand had to uninstall
B007N6NGYG|3.0|It looked interesting so I downloaded it to try it.  It wasn't as entertaining as I hoped.  I ended up removing it from my device after a few days.
B009GED3HS|5.0|The different dynamics and situations are always funny and entertaining. This is a perfect show to watch to relax at home after work. Watch the silly New Yorkers be urban, hip and funny. Characatures, for sure, but so  spot on. Love Lilly!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games. I seen an ad for this game on Facebook. I really like this game because it's Fun, Understandable, and Easy.
B004LROUW2|5.0|1Q84 is a masterpiece of literature not just a popular novel. It has it all as a great detective novel, a love story, an allegory, and fantasy.  It was a compelling read. The reader is very quickly engaged into the lives of the characters.  The fantasy is somehow believable.  It is an amazing story of hope, introspection and redemption.
B005LAII1C|1.0|To say I was disappointed is a complete understatement.<br />This movie really sucked. After buying it and watching it,<br />I gave it away faster than I bought it.<br />Nevertheless, still a big fan of Marky Mark.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Me and my fiance both play this game religiously, and it keeps us both entertained.  Not too challenging, but yet somehow I never get bored playing.  I have since purchased more games from Playrix<br /><br />Great game, thank you
B00AZM7IQC|2.0|I love Cirque Du Soleil but this DVD did'nt quite cut it for me.<br />I just bought it on a whim and must say, very disappointed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Been stuck on this one for a while now, and always return for more.  Wish there was a better way to build coins up, because I don't use in app purchases.  All in all, very fun.<br /><br />Nothing better than eating jet skiers and para sailers!
B007REV4YI|5.0|More than just another Bond movie, this one absolutely boggled my mind<br />with the incredible attention to detail like actually building Bond's childhood<br />home from scratch as well as other such feats. Loved this one and<br />highly recommend it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Very fun, very high quality game.<br /><br />Was tough to play on 4&#34; Droid X screen, but now much easier on my Note 2.<br /><br />So much fun, that I never mind restarting once I finish.  I will buy more games from G5!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I will have to recommend all of the Jesse Stone series for it's calm<br />and peaceful way of portraying an alcoholic small town sheriff. The<br />series is quite enjoyable and only hope they continue past series 8.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I chose this book on a whim before vacation, wanting an easy and mindless read... While it was definitely easy to breeze through, it wasn't mindless-- the twists and turns kept me glued to the pages until the very end.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie has to go down as a classic for its portrail of the originality.<br />I felt like I was there at the very same time the incident occurred.<br />Quite a beautiful piece of movie making and justified in it Academy Awards.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Perfect condition! This was my favorite one growing up and it was the hardest for me to find.  I normally don't like to have to resort to online to buy my movies but...I'm very happy with this purchase.
1603427244|5.0|Superb book with lots of clear photographs showing techniques very clear.  Great book or ego nets ad advanced knitters as well
B0091REZMW|5.0|ive been looking for a game like this that I didn't have to pay for and I found it :)
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Terrible movie, but my wife would give it 5 stars. :-) best wishes on a terrible purchase. Get it from Redbox.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The scenery was breathtaking and the movie was very informative. Some of the iconic pictures of Bob Marley shown against the backdrop of his life and the political realities of his world make an interesting juxtaposition that we tend to forget about in America. We hear the words and remember the smile but forget the tyranny and bloodshed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is pretty awesome for restless teens and youngsters. Insanely addictive.Works best on kindle fire.smart fit,easy to play and perfectly designed.Quite a few drawbacks are there which I want to highlight is that sometimes the game screen freezes.Secondly the game goes slow sometimes.But in all it will be a great addiction!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good EASY TO USE i LIKE IT THATS ALL i HAVE TO SAY<br />hAPPY WEATHER TO YOU THATS ALL FOLKE
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I had high hopes for this album and was not disappointed. Great variety of heavy to ballads! Lzzy Hale ROCKs!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Yes it is MUCH like THE RAID....our heroes are up against a villain entombed in a giant skyscraper, and yet both THE RAID and DREDD are much different....both EXCELLENT, and both very much fun for those that like their action film to be unrelenting and unapologetic in the direct, visceral violence thrown at the screen....DREDD reminded me of the kind of film John Carpenter would have made had he come along in 2012 instead of the seventies....for some reason I cannot shake the ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK vibe....and yet, this seems entirely new.....kind of like the best rock and roll - borrows from familiar tropes and yet offers a whole 'new' sound....DREDD is worth your time and worth seeing in HD or Blu Ray....excellent excellent action film - one of the best of the last five years for certain.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This second book in the trilogy did not carry the same level of writing throughout as the did the first. There were far too many words wasted on 'titillating' details and contrived circumstances to put the characters 'coincidentally' close to a major event.  It seemed that once WWII started, there was no good way to develop a flow through the time and we suddenly jumped years at a step to get to the ending point in the Cold War era.  All in all, I was left wondering why I bothered (and, I had enjoyed the historical review in the &#34;Fall&#34; book) and probably will not finish the trilogy.
B008J34466|5.0|I got this in the mail fast and in great shape glad I got it I love Pink and all her music been playing it every day since
B000KFB4PK|5.0|This is a really nice little watah for your young Lego fan. Nice little beginer watch as well.<br />looks great in person.
044042335X|4.0|Enjoyed the storyline of Jack Reacher not working alone - pulling member of his old unit together allowed for additional character development and for future possibilities
B003O86FMW|4.0|After de first one I was so excited to start to read this book, and I wasn't disapointed, it is a very good sequence, I can't wait to read the third one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the big display and look forward to learning to use it more.  I have just tried it out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book so fast I couldn't believe, I watched te movie first so I was curious to read and, as always, boks are always better then the movies.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is really  cool it updates to a lot of different countries and states like right now it's updated to Sydney.
0765325950|5.0|The book is well written, and a fitting conclusion to the series.  The ending was not what I expected, and I wasn't sure if I liked it at first.  But it has grown on me over time.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I read the book before the movie because in my opinion the books are always better. After reading this book, I'm not interested in seeing the movie. I was bored with the story, the writing, the characters. I read the entire book hoping something more interesting was going to happen on the next page or chapter. It never happened. Bored.
B006MMX1GU|5.0|This is by far the best of Eric & Animals; loved it when it came out in '68, played it forever back then, could not find a replacement when my 33 rpm album collection (987 records) was stolen/robberied in mid-70's.  Thanks Amazon!  I can now find and replace so many of my favorites from my youth!  I am a 61 yr old widow but I love my favorite music loud, still!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I tried several times to print stuff and it just said printing plesse wait . I got very frustrated with it
B0012GMY64|5.0|He also did a second album of movie themes; my mother played them, I grew up with him and his TV show; I was feeling nostalgic<br />(however you spell it!) and am not sorry I purchased it.  What a voice!
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|As usual, I have a hard time trying to figure out the story behind most of Cirque Du Soleil's pieces.  Wasn't too bad until it came to the &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34;  Beatles part.  I get a little tired of that.  It was alright.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app for me! I have small children and getting them to always cooperate isn't easy. This app makes even the can't sit still days even easier to snap those memory making pictures. Thanks for the easy use and multiple features to make my picture taking and sharing easier.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have never played this type of game before &quot;Coin Dozer &quot;. It is way more fun and intense than I expected it to be.
B004N7977I|5.0|Seen this before but it had been some time.<br />I loved it the first time and loved watching it again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|lots of variety great story line excellent game highly recommended.  I don't mind paying 4.99 for a game as good as this and really prefer the fact that it started out as a free trial so I could see if it was worth it which it definitely was.
0767812166|5.0|Some thought this was rather goofy, but its actually well acted.. all things considered. Good Movie.. Good story line. A+
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Three disc edition. 2 DVD and one BD. The unlucky thing as in most Spielberg movies is that there's no audio commentary. But the extras are very few but really good ones.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Awesome puzzle game with lots of charm and challenge.  I play it more often than I care to admit. Yeah.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I loved it up until the end. It was do short and it left me feeling rather incomplete. All in all it was worth the read but sparks has done better.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|The customer was awesome! I will be back!!<br />The disk set was a work of art and sounds awesome.<br />The customer communication was great!
B005HSL626|5.0|It is so fun and addicting my mom had to take my kindle fire away from me till today when I got out of school.
B007N85POS|5.0|Hi, My boyfriend is the person who got me interested in playing.I became hooked very quickly unroll I finally had to purchase my own kindle Fire.I really enjoy my time on my Kindle. I enjoy playing all the angry birds games.I am still learning so I truly do not as of yet have a favorite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really great characters...beautiful love story amidst heartbreak and devastation..couldn't put it down..had to stay up until I finished reading and knew how it was going to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the action In this book. I loved always wondering what will happen next. I also loved the love story part in it
0307346617|5.0|I remember being in high school and discovering Studs Terkel's book THE GOOD WAR. I didn't really know what an oral history was but thoroughly enjoyed the style - Terkel's interviews with soldiers and civilians of all walks of life, reflecting their experience in the war, was an incredible way to read and learn history. Max Brooks has taken that same approach (admittedly) in his masterfully clever novel WORLD WAR Z, which, like THE PASSAGE, transcends its genre into something much more moving and substantial. In the end is it a Zombie book, no different from the Romero films and THE WALKING DEAD? Maybe, maybe not, but the mammoth scope of the book and the creativity is astounding. The book is an oral history, taken from all walks of life, about the last war. The book, set maybe in the present, if not too far in the future, is about the ten year war on earth against the Zombies, a creature well known in popular culture. Brooks' interviewees span the world and then some (one interviewee was in a manned space station watching the turmoil from the skies). China, Australia, Russia, Paris, Cuba...all the countries are involved, and all succeed or fail in different ways. Some entries or sociological, some or more Tom Clancy-like technical and several are stand-alone rip roarin' adventure yarns. The view of the world from the words of the survivors is realistic, poignant and mesmerizing. A blind Japanese man, survivor of Hiroshima, lives in the woods and senses the Zombies with all but his eyes. A military pilot parachutes into the swamps of Louisiana and is guided to a safe spot with a strange voice of her intercom. A Japanese geek has to repel 19 floors down, avoiding Zombies at each balcony. A mercenary guards the Long Island home of a wealthy man and his celebrity friends when the gates are overrun with those not fortunate enough to get in. A group of survivors hole up in the Sears tower, another in the catacombs of Paris. Brooks, the son of Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks, has crafted a one-of-a-kind book that leaves the reader chilled, thrilled and moved., has crafted a one-of-a-kind book that leaves the reader chilled, thrilled and moved.
0152164154|5.0|Got it fast. Well packaged. So satisfied :) there were no negativities all very good. I got it early too :) I recommend! !
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The good:<br /><br />1.  Daniel Day Lewis really looks like Lincoln, and from what I've read, acts somewhat like Lincoln.  His performance is outstanding.<br /><br />2.  The production value is impressive - sets, costumes, etc.<br /><br />3.  I believe it gives an accurate portrayal of the legislative process. All of the negotiations and backroom dealings are fascinating.<br /><br />The not so good.<br /><br />1.  It is not really about Lincoln, but about the push for the 13th amendment.  In this movie, Lincoln is more of a character in the story of this legislation.<br /><br />2.  It is difficult to follow.  There are many characters (mostly congressman) that appear nameless.  The dialog seems accurate for the period, but there is a lot of it.  At times, it seems to erode into random conversations.<br /><br />3.  It is boring.  Sure, Lewis looks a lot like Lincoln, and the set is nice, but there are long periods between any significant scenes.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I wanted to see this after watching the previews on the Les Miserables Dvd. It was suppose to be the greatest love story. This was anything but love story...talk about maybe the most crazy lust story with very very very bad ending. With that said I think it was more like bad beginning bad middle and HORRIBLE ending...if I hadn't bought it before reading reviews I wouldn't have bought it. Im happy to answer any questions you might have.

B0063GORYU|5.0|The graphics are great.  Cards are dealt in a realistic way with a realistic sound.  Choices are made for you but with optimal performance.  The pop up ads are annoying but are easily ignored.  All in all I really enjoy this game.

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|My daughter put the kindle down with the app left open and after a few minutes it went to a website with pornographic pictures. I deleted immediately. I checked my web history to make sure that site will never pop up and it wasn't there so it must have come from the app. Watch out!
