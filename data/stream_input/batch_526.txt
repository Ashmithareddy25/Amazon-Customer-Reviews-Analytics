B000AL730O|1.0|Supposedly forged through a difficult give and take between Paul and a young modern producer, this is still all Paul. And it's tired. <br /> <br />With the exception of one or two tracks which would have only scored as nice album cuts on a 70's McCartney album and most likely wouldn't have even made a Beatles album, the CD is a dinner plate at and old folks home, pre-cut, pre-chewed, pablum. <br />For the most part all the songs are interchangeable without much difference unless you listen over and over. Paul rarely makes good use of his famous voice, playing completely safe from start to finish. While it is interesting to hear obviously Paul musicianship (playing a majority of the instruments on the CD), he never seems to break out of the single \\"sound\\" he was going for. <br /> <br />Yes die-hard Paul fans will make excuses and most of them might even enjoy it.  Not this fan.  We deserve ground breaking and relevance out of one of modern music's geniuses and pioneers. He tried? Not hard enough, especially for album titled \\"Chaos and Creation\\".
B000AA305M|5.0|On first listen on David Gray's \\"Life in Slow Motion\\", it feels as if you are reunited with an old friend.  The personal songwriting, the wonderful harmonies, and the distinct voice of Gray has been missing for a couple of years, and it is wonderful to have it back. <br /> <br />Plain and simple, \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" is a fantastic album, as good as \\"White Ladder\\" and \\"A New Day at Midnight\\" (an underrated gem, IMO).  Much of the electronic work from the previous albums are gone, and that's quite alright.  My particular favorite on the album is \\"From Here I Can Almost See the Sea\\", which has the flavor of songs from my favorite Gray album, the \\"Lost Songs\\" compilation. <br /> <br />Just like \\"White Ladder\\", the songs on this album are extremely catchy, making repeat listens easy and frequent.  As mentioned by previous reviewers, this album is definitely one of the best of 2005.
0966638328|5.0|The colors certainly match perfectly - if you calibrate your screen!  Gives you exact combinations in pantone, CMYK or RGB. If you have problems with these colors, then it is a technical problem on your part.    <br /> <br />Color combinations are new and fresh.  There is a reason this book has been holding its value so well - it is a GREAT BOOK and draws from top designers.  What is NOT to love?
B000AL730O|5.0|Ya know, I'm always amazed at the sort of negativity some folks write about this guy.  They say it sounds too much like Paul ... well?  They complain that he plays most of the instruments ... so?  They complain about those who say that it ages well after repeated listenings ... now here's the most interesting.  My wife and I agree that if we like an album on first listen, it's probably not going to wear well.  But if there are a lot of challenging and juicy layers in both musicality and lyrics, you just might have to revisit from time to time.  Isn't that why we buy albums for in the first place?   <br /> <br />I find Van Morrison's best albums require multiple listenings as do those from Elvis Costello.  This album is in that tradition.  Very different in many ways, and very comfortable in others.  I find the layers of chosen instruments striking and the lyrical messages deeper than other recent offerings. <br /> <br />Yes, I would have enjoyed a few more rockers ... if you've ever seen him live, you'll realize he can still do that with the best of them.  This piece is just more grown up and introspective.  As a lifelong fan, I'm glad he's talking to folks like me rather than trying to relive his youth.  Just be glad he's still experimenting with new sounds and production choices and that he hasn't gone the route of Rod Stewart!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Lyrical and tasteful. In the album Poses, Rufus Wainwright maximizes his talent for composing memorable pieces. He achieves a wonderful balance between the baroque and simplistic in songs such as \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,\\" while going for unabashed self-reflection in the folksy \\"One Man Guy\\" (a cover of his father, Loudon Wainwright's, song). Wainwright also typifies the hopeless romantic, exceling in \\"Greek Song,\\" \\"Tower of Learning,\\" and \\"Grey Gardens\\" with the right touch of unrequitedness. A definite achievement.
B0006B2A42|3.0|I enjoy this movie and watch it once or twice a year. Great cast, great plot a nice easy movie to enjoy. The special effects aren't up to todays standards but are quite good for the period. On a cold winters day with the wind blowing I just sit back and relax and enjoy watching someone else brave the cold.
B000003TAB|4.0|The CD could have gotton here sooner.  But,....Like Always....Nirvana Will ALWAYS Rule!
B000AL730Y|5.0|Now this is how I like my McCartney! Fresh, surprising, tunefull, up close and personal. Paul really delivers with this outstanding collection of songs.     The special edition is a nice package as it comes with a slipcover and most importantly a DVD featuring a documentary on the making of Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. Paul and producer Nigel discuss the songs and the processes involved in creating the album. Really enjoyed the DVD and it was a highlight to see McCartney in the studio playing various instruments. Very interesting to see all the differing kinds of intruments and equipment he uses.     Since I picked up this album I have been listening to it. This is the album I've been waiting years for! Kudos to Paul! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00001OH7P|5.0|Lately I've been listening to David Bowie's albums from the 70's, and I've loved every single one. This man is talented, and this album displays just how gifted he really is. 1972 was Bowie's year. He released two (of his many) masterpieces that year: Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust. Quite amazingly, they are the complete opposites of each other. Hunky Dory has more of a folk feel with leanings to the morose. Ziggy Stardust is glam rock to its core. Though polar opposites, they both comprise Bowie's character. The superficiality and glam of Ziggy Stardust and the depth and introspection of Hunky Dory are both seen throughout Bowie's career. So take it from me, a 16 year old Bowie fan: This album, along with Hunky Dory, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Low, and Scary Monsters ranks up there with The Beatles' White Album and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon as one of the defining rock albums. They definitely don't make music like this anymore, sadly. MTV sucks!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|if the record companies want to try to hault technology, don't support them.  there is no reason why this should not be able to be imported onto an ipod.  ipod and other mp3 players are the future (and present) of music, and if the foo's new cd can't keep up with it leave it behind.
B00006690G|5.0|The first time I heard The Eminem Show i was amazed.Probably not since Tupac has an artist ever been watched so closely and the media hanging on his every word.That's what makes this album so incredible.The pressure was on him to deliver and he exceeded the expectations.This is in my mind the greatest hip-hop/rock album in the history of music.The title fits the album perfectly as well.It showcases an artist at the top of his game and is a reflection of his life.On tracks such as \\"Business\\" and \\"Square Dance\\" I found myself in aww at the lyrics and untouchable flow.It's as if he is ryhming as if his life depended on it.This is truly The Eminem Show.
B00025ETIW|1.0|What in the world was this? The song was only one minute! And it wasnt even like it was a good minute. The song just kind of dragged on with the singer only singing three songs. Sure its suppose to be peaceful, but its not. This song was a waste of my money. I will never get that minute back. Every time i heard it start, I would have to quickly push the \\"next\\" button. Its not like i completely blocked the song out of my head. The song is a parasite that once you hear it once, it will get stuck in your head whenever you even hear it begin. I was sitting, waiting patiently hoping that something good would happen in the song. But the good part never came. The best part that happened in that one minute was when i heard it change songs to one of my favorite songs. If i could have paid an extra $10 to just have the song not in my album, that would have been awesome. It would have been well worth the money.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I cannot believe how skinny Christian Bale is in this movie!  But that is beside the point...it is a great psychological thriller that keeps you thinking from beginning to end.  If you enjoyed \\"The Jacket\\" or \\"The Butterfly Effect,\\" you'll enjoy this movie just as much.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is some of Paul's best work. Many of the songs sound like the old Beatles days (especially Jenny Wren and English Tea). The amazing part is that he plays almost all of the instrumentals on the CD. Any Beatles or McCartney fan should make this CD a must! <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Iceland's Sigur Ros return with \\"Takk...\\" and what a return it is.  Epic, beautiful, anthemic...this album, like most of Sigur Ros' output, is all of those things, but \\"Takk...\\" adds two elements that have not always been present in their music (and something that was greatly missing on 2002's ( ), their last release); hope and immediacy.  Ripping out of the gate with the heavenly 'Takk' and 'Glosoli', \\"Takk...\\" grabs your hand and takes you on a journey you need to go on.    This is easily Sigur Ros' most accessible record but the faithful will be pleased to hear that that accessibility has not been gained with the forfeit of any of the band's creativity or care for their craft.  Elements still snake in and out of songs perfectly and everything seems to have been touched by a higher power.  If there's one thing that \\"Takk...\\" does, it's make you feel.  Lullabys and car-crashes, it's all here.    Simply put, \\"Takk...\\" is stunning.  This is music.
0767812166|5.0|This movie is made by the exceptional chemistry between the 2 leads; Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges. Tell me you did not get teary eyed at the end when he had to leave her to return to his own planet. <br /> <br />This was meant to be a Romantic thriller, with the special effects kept to a mininum and used to advanced the story line.How interesting it is to find a modern Sci Fi movie where the acting makes the movie. <br /> <br />This is adult movie, which deals with Love, loss, and relationships. The Kiddies might not like it. <br />
B00005JM0B|5.0|Excellent action sequences, story line, acting, detail, and overall idea! This well exceeds it's predecessors, but don't get me wrong 1, and 2 were great too but this one was great in a different way. Felt the R rating was stretching it a little as this would make an ideal movie for the age 12-15 group, but I guess if nothing else language would make that part mandatory. Nick Stahl gives very realistic and convincing performance as does Claire Danes. As always Arnold puts out his best yet in the third addition to this trilogy demonstrates a very entertaining sense of humor unlike before. I'd definitely reccomend this one to all Si-Fi, Action-Adventure seekers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This shows has everything you could ask for in a good sci-fi genre drama.  Great characters, great storylines, plot development, and pinches of humor throughout.<br /><br />What more could you ask for.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Found this at The Rogovoy Report (He is a cultural critic for WAMC Northeast Public Radio)    I've seen the complete No Direction Home Martin Scorsese documentary, upcoming on American Masters on PBS in a couple of weeks (9/26-27), and it's really great. I didn't realize that it includes extensive new interview footage with Bob Dylan himself, appearing in his most straightforward, seemingly normal role EVER -- even more than on the 60 Minutes interview with Ed Bradley -- normal enough almost to take him at his word on his extensive comments on particular songs, his background, incidents in his career, etc.    The film includes terrific interviews with dozens of key figures from Dylan's life and career, including Izzy Young, Harold Leventhal, Joan Baez, Paul Nelson, Bob Neuwirth, Al Kooper, Bruce Langhorne, Pete Seeger, Mark Spoelstra, Suze Rotolo , and fortunately, Allen Ginsberg and Dave Van Ronk when both of them were still around.    The film also includes a tremendous amount of vintage film clips, concert footage, and still photography, a lot of which I've never seen before -- and I think I have had access to most if not all of the unofficial stuff circulating from that era. It even includes footage from postwar Hibbing, as well as early recordings (some of which of course are reflected in the companion CD \\"soundtrack\\"). It includes a lot of Newport Folk festivals and \\"Eat the Document\\" era concert and incidental footage in the best quality I've ever seen or heard any of it, and a lot that I don't think was included in the original ETD.    The home DVD version also includes extensive full-song versions of concert songs that will not be screened on TV.    More important than all these parts, the sum total is a fascinating \\"interpretation\\" of how Robert Allen Zimmerman became Bob Dylan up through and including summer 1966, weaved subtly by master filmmaker Scorsese simply through vintage clips, interviews, and really smart editing. The way Scorsese handles the combination of interviews and songs reminds me of The Last Waltz, but he does an even better, more subtle (and more complex) job here.    I think it's as valuable a document that has ever been made about Bob Dylan -- as valuable as any book or biography, including Chronicles itself.    Now, if only Scorsese spent equal time and effort on 1966-2006, but I imagine that's not likely to happen.....    I've gotten some feedback already that Scorsese didn't originate this project and had nothing to do with the original footage, but of course that doesn't matter -- the point is he and/or his team organized it in a way that makes it a coherent narrative, and one with a particular point of view that has the imprimatur of Bob Dylan himself. For those who take issue with that, I suggest, as Dylan himself said all those years ago, eat the document.
0380789035|4.0|I'm a new Giaman fan, so what I heard she had written novels I did cartwheels! Though I do love his work I agree that the sending kind of fizzled, though it get great a great \\"What the?!\\" as it progressed. A great book for students of mythology or any who who wonders about the nature of divinity.

B00009EIQE|5.0|This is a killer CD, a must-get for anyone who digs the blues. Much of the material is way downhome and gut-wrenching. CRAWLIN' KING SNAKE is a monster side and can stand easily beside John Lee Hooker's original. BLACK CAT BLUES is another Hooker tune and it too is marvelous. Guy's voice is deep and booming and the back-up session players (usually just bass, drums, and guitar) are restrained and add immensely to the proceedings. ANNA LEE and LONESOME HOME BLUES are also excellent takes on classic songs out of the blues tradition. This CD is what the blues is all about. Got an iPod? Save room 'cause you'll want to put this whole CD on it for repeated listening.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney is the most successful songwriter in history, with more number one songs and albums (including the Beatles, obviously) than anyone else.* There's a very good reason for this -- he writes great music and melodies. <br /> <br />Unlike some, I have enjoyed almost everything McCartney has had to offer. They've ranged from not-too-good (\\"Wild Life,\\" \\"Wings at the Speed of Sound\\") to good (\\"Off the Ground,\\" \\"McCartney,\\" \\"Back to the Egg\\") to great (\\"Tug of War,\\" \\"Flowers in the Dirt,\\" \\"Driving Rain\\") to classic (\\"Band on the Run,\\" \\"Ram,\\" \\"Flaming Pie\\"). This album ranks among the latter.  <br /> <br />It's hard to say just how great this album is, but as I listened, I realized I was listening to an outstanding piece of art. It's a non-Wings, pure McCartney Beatles album, plain and simple. Many songs here could be on the \\"White Album\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" -- most notably \\"English Tea\\" (sure, it's drivel, but sweet fluff that only McCartney can pen effortlessly), \\"Jenny Wren,\\" (yeah, yeah, \\"Blackbird,\\" blah blah) \\"Promise to You Girl,\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before\\" (an excellent track reminiscent of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" without copying it). Sure, \\"Friends to Go\\" sounds like a George Harrison song, much the way \\"Riding to Jaipur,\\" off 2001's \\"Driving Rain,\\" did. (Perhaps he's chanelling George). But the standout track on this unequivocal masterpiece is \\"Riding to Vanity Fair;\\" its slow, methodic melody, complimented by a plaintive toy glockenspiel, is a trance-inducing pleasure.  <br /> <br />A great asset of this album is that its 13 tunes clock in at just over 40 minutes, which is rare in this day (with the \\"hidden\\" track(s) it's still only about 46 minutes). THANK YOU!!! Albums have gotten way too long these days. And the songs are an average 3 minutes apiece -- another nice touch, since songs have also gotten too bloated lately (most of the Beatles' songs were between 2 1/2 and 3 minutes long). <br /> <br />The only complaints I have is that the opening of \\"Anyway\\" sounds like either \\"People Get Ready\\" or the opening of \\"Under the Bridge,\\" depending on how you hear it. McCartney usually never sounds like anybody but himself or Beatles. But the song transforms and redeems itself, becoming one of the most heart-wrenching and moving songs on the album.  <br /> <br />Some people ask why an artist McCartney's age would even bother; others say that artists his age, such as the Rolling Stones, should just retire. That's like telling a painter at age 65 that he or she is no longer allowed to paint! McCartney made it clear in a recent interview that he enjoys recording -- it's his hobby. He doesn't need the money, but he pours his heart into it, which should let you know that it's authentic.  <br /> <br />We should be incredibly thankful that in these troubled times this wonderful, beautiful man has blessed us with brand new, soul-soothing music to make us smile as he always has. Pray he will continue to do so.  <br /> <br />Thank you, Sir Paul McCartney. <br /> <br /> <br />*Guinness Book of World Records, Billboard
B0000019PA|5.0|listen to Holland, 1945 and you'll see why this album is pure genius
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Now this is a very rare rating for me.  9 times out of 10, there's something I like about any movie.  Not this one.  I've not seen a movie this bad since The Man With the Rubber Face. <br /> <br />I was wise and caught on about 45 minutes into the movie. Spend your time and your money on something else. <br /> <br />This movie was slow, boring, depressing - all at the same time.   <br /> <br />I've read some reviews that say 'You really start to feel sorry for these guys and root for them'.  No you don't.  There's a reason people like Napolean are picked on in school.
B00004TH83|3.0|Since the very first time I heard Lara's voice I was really amazed... And I'm glad to see she hasn't been content just to sing but also write some of the lyrics. Unfortunately Lara's emotional voice and beautiful lyrics aren't enough in some of the tracks which are just simply boring for exemple \\"You're not from here\\" and \\"Love by Grace\\". Despite of few disappointments there are some excellent tracks and definetely worth listening anyway...  <br /> <br />ADAGIO, very sad, beautiful, emotional in both languages..Great beginning, great end. Lara's voice just takes your breath away. The only thing what bothers me in the next song PART OF ME is the the choir in end. The song would have worked just fine without it. Third song, GIVIN' UP ON YOU sounds great because Lara doesn't scream so much in it. Nice tune. One of my favorites on this album is I AM WHO I AM. Catchy up-tempo song with great lyrics and music. TO LOVE YOU AGAIN is a bit mystery to me because I don't really know what attracts me in it. Anyway very emotional and powerful ballad. I'd like to hear the original version in French. And of course there is I WILL LOVE AGAIN, Lara's big hit. I've never been really a dance type of person but I have to admit that it works. I'd say 'fresh' among all these pop ballads.   <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|There was not a good thing to hear on this cd.  No talent, lackluster vocals and lyrics.  And, since when can a cd have a ton of obscene words and not have an explicit content warning?  Parents, be warned that this is not the Mariah Carey of the 80's.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|When \\"Back Home\\" was released, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine sarcastically remarked that \\"the album is just about being home (which, if the center photo of Clapton at home with his three young daughters and wife is to be believed, looks alarmingly similar to the set of Thomas the Tank Engine, complete with a painted rainbow shining through the window)\\". <br /> <br />That just about says it all. Eric Clapton is a highly professional musician backed by a competent band. You can put this album on and not one of your guests will be offended...chances are they won't really notice it at all. This is slick, nondescript and utterly harmless pop music, and if that's your thing, go get it right away. Just don't confuse this man with the Eric Clapton of the 60s and early 70s, the Eric Clapton who played the blues and lamented the fact that his voice wasn't loud, gruff and whiskey-hoarsened like Howlin' Wolf's\\" <br /> <br />Stop quoting Stephen as if his opinion holds alot of weight. Any <br />one that gives 4 and 5 stars to the likes of Ashlee Simpson is <br />an idiot. And that's what Erlewine did. He is a moronic reviewer.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The attention to detail in these movies is spectacular.  Acknowledgment of the broader themes in Tolkien's works is evident and adds to the richness and depth of these movies.  You will find you want to watch all three back to back in a marathon session.

B00007KWHN|5.0|This is great music.  If you are already a Yes or progressive rock fan, you own this album already.  If you're not, you should have this CD.  If you already own this in the original CD release or, like me, owned it on vinyl, the remastered CD is worth it for the better sound clarity. <br /> <br />Yes hit their stride with this record.  Adding Steve Howe gave them the quintessential Yes guitar sound and Jon Anderson found the confidence to give up trying to write \\"songs\\" but instead create music by using his voice and words as another instrument.  \\"Caesar's Palace, Morning Glory, Silly Human Race...\\"  No clue what it means, but emblematic of Anderson evoking with voice and words.  Every song on this album is good.  \\"Starship Trooper\\" is a masterpiece, \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" is both a homage to John Lennon and a great song period.  The bookends of this album, \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" and \\"Perpetual Change,\\" are perfect Yes songs.  This album has most of what is great about Yes and few of the excesses that blemished later offerings.

Amazing how we never questioned the \\"special effects\\" of the 1960's yet both my children noted how they seem to always orbit one of three planets.  If you plan to watch it with your children, this series is best suited for around nine and up depending on your child's interest in sci fi.  Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Gritty, humorous, stretching the imagination... Firefly is the best new SciFi series to be canceled since the original Star Trek, back in the 1960s. These episodes are fun to watch, and with the release of the movie SERENITY at the end of this month of September 2005, I can only hope another few seasons of Firefly and its wonderful characters will again commence in  Spring '06 or Fall '06 series.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|When I was introduced to Clapton through From the Cradle, my jaw dropped! That was the kind of blues that my soul melted under.  <br />Unfortunately \\"Back Home\\" is not even 1% of what From the Cradle was. I was so disappointed when I listened to a steady stream of happy go lucky bouncy tracks, that it reminded me when someone somehow slipped me one of his early Cream creations and me thinking that I was about to listen to an early blues band..  <br /> <br />I hope the next record he releases will have some b**ls. <br />
B000A7S4B0|5.0|While BRMC's first two albums have been described as \\"shoegazer rock\\" and influenced significantly by The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, \\"Howl\\" takes the band in a strongly different direction.  While not fully abandoning the sound nearly perfected on their sophomore \\"Take Them On,\\" the focus of the trio is now more acoustic, and echoes deeply of both Southern Rock and the Blues. <br /> <br />In an interview in \\"Under the Radar\\" Magazine, Peter Hayes (guitar, vocals) mentioned his desire, after the production of \\"Take Them On,\\" to create an album with a \\"deeper\\" and even more \\"live\\" feel than the band's previous efforts.  In this light, \\"Howl\\" is a startling success.  The acoustic guitars and piano keys are simultaneously avant guarde and nostalgic; stretching the abilities of a rock band to its limits, while still remaining conscious of its roots. <br /> <br />Making a conscious break from the obvious, expected, routine, and formulaic, BRMC has received (at best) mixed reviews upon the release of \\"Howl.\\"  However, fear not, for genius is often misunderstood.  Fans of the first efforts of the band will find enough lingering to remain interested, whether or not you enjoy or appreciate blues and gospel.  Listen to the album as a whole, just as you would any other BRMC work.  It ebbs and flows in a pace and style all its own. <br /> <br />But this is not a reinvention of a genre, or any clear attempt at revolution.  BRMC, as far as this humble listener can tell, isn't interested in their image, nor are they particularly concerned with classification.  So don't expect them to do anything but make some of the best damn music that can possibly be made on this (or any) album released by the creative collaberation of three talented and intelligent musicians.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Hey, look. Death Cab's on a major label now. So if that bugs you at all, well, you can always re-purchase your old copies of \\"Transatlanticism\\" or \\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes\\". If you actually just dig the band, well, here we go. <br />\\"Plans\\" isn't as strong as 2002's \\"Transatlanticism\\", but it's still a strong record. The production is a LITTLE more expressive, the songs a LITTLE softer, but for the most part \\"Plans\\" sounds a lot like a Death Cab record. Well written, melodic indie pop songs. <br />Though \\"Plans\\" lacks a little from \\"Trans\\" in songwritting, and wierdly enough, production(this record feels more simple then epic), everything you liked about the previous Death Cab records is here. Ben Gibbard's plaintive voice just continues to get better and better with each record, Chris Walla's guitar and keyboard work is as tight and melodic as ever, and Nicolas Hammer and Jason McGerr continue their crusade to be the most underrated rythum section in music. It maybe Gibbard's lyrics and voice and Walla's production that get the most ink, but it's Hammer and McGerr who really drive the songs feelings and melodies home. <br />\\"Marching Bands of Manhatten\\" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the record: clean guitars slowly build to their breaking point, but never actually reach said point. \\"Soul Meets Body\\" replays the \\"ba-ba\\" chorus from \\"Sound of Settling\\" to perfect effect. \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\" borrows a lead guitar riff from early U2 to marvelous effect, where \\"I Want To Follow You into the Dark\\" seems destined for mixtapes across our fair country. \\"What Sara Said\\" is this records \\"Transatlanticism\\", a slow building piano driven(albeit faster and, for lack of a better word, funkier)) that forces you to stop everything else you're doing and just listen. <br />With the exception of \\"Different Names for Same Things\\", which doesn't really gel as it should, there isn't a clunker on the whole record. Just eleven well written, well constructed songs that are destined to guide your way through the impending cold winter. Another strong entry in the Death Cab catalog.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I could be my bias for Nine Inch Nails, but I must say that 'With Teeth' is one of the best albums I have heard this year, and of the best Nine Inch Nails albums (only third to 'The Fragile' and 'Broken').

B000AL730Y|4.0|If McCartney's post Beatles work, and more exactly his recent work, has been less than inspiring to you check this one out. Its fresh energetic and with the help of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich this album sounds suprisingly modern while capturing some of the original Beatles spirit.  <br /> <br />McCartney's songwriting style on Chaos and Creation seems to take up where the White Album left off with a more natural folkish tone. While his voice isnt what it used to be it has aquired an airy and lilting tone that is mature yet still has energy and is quite listenable. \\"Follow me\\" and and \\"Jenny Wren\\" are among the albums finest tunes and the guitar playing fits quite well with McCartneys naming them as \\"the daughter of Blackbird\\".  Ending With \\"Follow Me\\", which is delightful and intricate, this album begs to be replayed. <br /> <br />With the bonus DVD and a great lineup of solid tracks \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is among the best of McCartney's solo works and is going to be a great album. If you are a fan of the beatles or are looking for some great mellow music that wont put you to sleep this is an album to get.

B000AL730O|1.0|I am a huge McCartney fan. Since the late sixties his music is my inspiration, my energy and relaxation. Even his less popular records, have a high quality and originality that makes me listen to them over and over again. Maybe McCartney is happy with the result, calling it his best work in years, but to my opinion not one song on this record has the feel, groove, energy or originality of his earlier work. This cd is the result of recording sessions during a 4 year time-frame. Even Driving Rain and Run Devil Run, both recorded in a matter of weeks, have more impact then \\"Chaos\\". Fine Line, Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain and Promise to You Girl are exceptions. But 9 B-sides on one CD? The most surprising track is the instrumental, a hidden track after Anyway. McCartney is a great songwriter, singer and bass-player but it is a mystery why he did not use the impressive talents of his fantastic bandmembers. The songs are stripped-down with McCartney performing and recording every instrument himself. <br />Because of this you can not only hear he is a very limited drummer and piano player but even that he is insecure and struggling. His bandmembers could have added the power, energy and musical craftsmanship this record definitely needs.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Over Labor Day, George and I finally got the chance to see Wicked. We'd been wanting to see this since it had gotten so much buzz on Broadway, but we didn't plan far enough ahead when we went to New York, and I wasn't fast enough on the ball to get tickets here in Los Angeles before the entire 6-week run quickly sold out. So we made a trip to San Francisco to see it there. We are so glad we did. The show is absolutely phenomenal: great music, great story, great performances, great staging. It completely deserved to win Best Musical Tony and then some. Some shows are enjoyable for an evening, but every once in a while, you experience a show that you know you'll remember for years if not a lifetime. <br /> <br />So what makes Wicked so incredible? Any classic show has a great story for its foundation. Wicked begins with a creative concept: the \\"back story\\" of the Wizard of Oz, expaining what really went on before and during the story we know so well. Imbue the story with great characters and great themes. In this upside-down Oz story, we only catch a fleeting glimpse of Dorothy's shadow, while the focus is on Elphaba (later known as the Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda (the \\"good witch\\"). Subverting everything we thought we knew about Oz, we learn that Elphaba may not actually have been so wicked after all, but perhaps just misunderstood because she is green. There is great character development in the interaction between Elphaba and Glinda (who is, in a word, blonde) as fate makes them roommates at school. One of the great themes dealt with in this story is judging people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin. (While the green-skinned Elphaba primarily makes this point, it has also been subtly reinforced with some of race-blind casting. On Broadway, Ben Vereen played the Wizard of Oz, while in San Francisco, we had a white Wizard and the handsome black actor Derrick Williams took over the romantic lead which was created on Broadwayby white Norbert Leo Butz.) Another great theme is the conflict between being true to your own values versus doing what is popular and politically expedient. The Wizard is a man of the expedient school, and while he is not very admirable, he does make a wise point when he explains (in song) to Elphaba that history is written by the winners, and the only difference between a dictator and a liberator is in who is telling the tale. As the story sounds notes on these lofty themes, the characters evolve in interesting ways, primarily Elphaba and Glinda, but also Fiyero (the romantic interest), the Wizard, and Elphaba's sister Nessarose (a.k.a. the Wicked Witch of the East). The story is neither simple nor sugar-coated, but from its darkish Dickensian tone, notes of hope and heroism come through, though alloyed by realism and cynicism. <br /> <br />This intriguing story is elevated and made to soar with music that is still in my head weeks later (and not because I bought the CD -- I didn't -- though I put it on my Amazon wish list). From laugh-out-loud numbers like \\"What is this Feeling?\\" (when Elphaba and Galinda first meet) and \\"Popular\\" (Galinda doing an \\"extreme makeover\\" on Elphaba), to show-stopping inspirational numbers like \\"The Wizard and I\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\", to the beautiful, tear-drawing \\"Changed For Good\\", Stephen Schwarz' music and lyrics are classic. Add to this a marvelous set that enhances the production at every turn, with some impressive stagecraft, but no gimmickry for gimmickry's sake (a lesson that the LA Center Theatre Group's new artistic director appears to be learning the hard way, but that's another story). <br /> <br />I don't know why they're doing such short runs in major cities like LA and SF. This could have easily run for months if not years in Los Angeles, as the Phantom did. But if you have to hop on a plane to New York, Chicago, or somewhere else, go see this musical! <br />

B00080ZG10|4.0|Mostly what I knew about Howard Hughes was the impression planted in my 14-year-old mind when he died: that he was an incredibly wealthy old man, and a highly eccentric recluse who hadn't trimmed his beard or fingernails in years. The Scorsese film does a great job of bringing this remarkable character to vivid life, in all his brilliance and all his eccentricity. DiCaprio's portrayal is outstanding, and Cate Blanchett as Kathryn Hepburn is all that. Scorsese does a good job of putting you inside Hughes' head in moments of paranoia, allowing the audience to see a \\"menacing\\" employee or a \\"threatening\\" piece of food as Hughes does. And overall, I think the film avoids the temptation to dwell on the eccentricities, instead striking a good balance between showing his moments of greatness and moments of deterioration, and presenting a complex character in all his complexity. My only initial complaint was that the movie just stopped rather than ended, although in thinking about it, it probably could not have carried the story any further while maintaining the balance. We get to see the trajectory of Hughes' life take flight and exceed expectations, and we get to see the engine start to fail. We already knew the ultimate trajectory ends in a crash, and we didn't really need to see the wreckage. So the film stops in just the right place after all.
1400032717|1.0|I purchased this book because of the high reviews.  What a mistake.  One of the most boring books I have ever read.  I know I am in the minority on this one, I must have missed something....
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Though the ancient Greek poet Homer is given a co-writer credit, we had heard from advance buzz about the film that screenwriter David Benioff would be taking some liberties in adapting the Iliad to the big screen. In particular, we'd heard that Patroklos (who was Achilles' beloved in the original) would be his \\"cousin\\" in the movie, while a romantic line was added between Achilles and Briseus (who in the original was one of two captured trophy maidens, more a conquest than a love interest). Some changes were inevitable in the adaptation, for instance, in the Iliad, the Trojan War lasts nearly a decade, while in the movie it seems to last maybe a few weeks. And there were quite a number of changes made for the sake of the story (the IMDB page has a pretty good list). All of that notwithstanding, I think that the film turned out to be a great story and thematically quite faithful to the original, even while liberally rearranging the specifics. One of Homer's great themes is the contrast between the glory and horror of the war (two sides of the same coin) versus home and family life. The film sets this theme up in the beginning, with a beautiful invented scene between Achilles and his mother the sea nymph Thetis, in which she foretells two possible futures for him -- one going to Troy, dying young and achieving eternal fame, the other staying home and enjoying children and grandchildren over a long life. (Julie Christie is marvelous as Thetis.) Later in the film, there are some family scenes with the Trojan hero Hector with his wife and young baby, torn between wanting to stay with his family versus his duty to go and fight the war in which he's likely to get killed. (Eric Bana gives just the right balance of noble warrior and tender husband and father.) The sentiment is very true to Homer. One scene that was particularly true to Homer, both in theme and detail, was when King Priam sneaks into Achilles' tent to beg for the return of his slain son's body. (Peter O'Toole is brilliant as Priam, and particularly shines in this scene.) <br /> <br />Director Wolfgang Peterson has done a good job of crafting this film as an epic. The scenes of the walled city of Troy, the masses of Greek ships at sea, and the battles were well worthy of big-screen viewing. And the adaptation does well in capturing the sense of great heroes waging the battle amidst the thousands of troops, and the classic sense of honor among them. Amidst the epic, he skilfully develops a number of characters. The romantic tension between Achilles and Briseis is a nice invention, with each coming to love and admire the other's strength of character. Achilles is rightly portrayed as both noble (as we see not only with his treatment of his captive Briseis, but also his concern for his \\"cousin\\" and for his men) and also egoistic, a bit of a pouty prima donna. Agamemnon is painted as political and power-craving, and the dynamic between the two is nicely done. Brad Pitt does an outstanding job portraying the moody hero, and the film does not disappoint those who would go just to get a good look at this gorgeous actor in action. (He has seriously worked out for this role, and it shows.) Orlando Bloom plays a naturally impetuous Paris who struggles to become responsible in the end. All in all, some great performances, a visual feast, a good solid story with engaging characters, and a memorable adaptation of a classic work.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I am someone with an open mind, I listen to all types of rock...mainly hard rock and different sorts of metal. System of A Down always fell into the \\"Nu-Metal\\" genre...it was always one of my favorite bands...one of the few sellout bands I like...Damn you MTV...I hate MTV, and almost all thier pop/rap stuff they think is \\"cool\\". Anyway on with the review... <br /> <br />I like this just as much as Toxicity If not more and just as much as thier first CD(System of A Down)...So I have no clue why other people don't. <br /> <br />Heres the songs... <br /> <br />1.Soldier Side(Into) - 3.5/5. Yeah can't really rate it more, because it's like a minute long and only an intro, but it's a good way to start the CD off. <br /> <br />2.B.Y.O.B. - 1/5. This song was a great song...but those MTV S.O.A.B.'s had to overplay this...God I hate MTV and the radio any way I just find myself skipping past this one as I listen to this CD. <br /> <br />3.Revenga. - 3/5. Not great, but not horrible either, this is where the CD starts to pick up and get good. <br /> <br />4.Cigaro. - 4/5. My c**k is much bigger than yours,With the feeling so pure...Funny lyrics and a heavy instrument make this song an overall good track. <br /> <br />5.Radio/Video - 5/5. Not the heaviest...but still one of the best on the CD in my oppinion...Although I hate the radio, but for some reason just the melody of this song I like. <br /> <br />6.This cocain makes me feel like I'm on this song. - 3/5. Really weird...It confuses me, not a great track...but not a bad one either. <br /> <br />7.Violent Pornography. - 5/5. This is one of my favorite's also...It's funny and has a meaning to it if you have an open mind...One of the best. <br /> <br />8.Question! - 5/5. After Violent Pornography...We get a kinda light S.O.A.D. song that has a good...actually kinda sad feeling to it, One of my favorites. <br /> <br />9.Sad Statue. - 3.5/5. Good meaning, but I never really got much into this one, No clue why. <br /> <br />10.Old School Hollywood. - 4/5. Some of the dumbest verses possible...but still a fun song all the way through. <br /> <br />11.Lost in Hollywood. - 5/5. Great ending to the CD...another song with a sorta sad feeling, And usually Darrin bothers me...and I want Serj to sing more...but Darrin's actually pretty good in this song. <br /> <br />Overall...A great CD. <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|4.0|On Saturday night, we had a quiet evening in and watched The Notebook on DVD. We really enjoyed this poignant romance, and I'm glad we watched it at home because I was crying at the end. (Point of calibration: I'm a total softie. I get teary-eyed watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.) Young actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were excellent as two teenagers from very different backgrounds who experience a summer love  that profoundly affects their lives. Their charm and chemistry was enchanting. Director Nick Cassavetes did a great job coaching their performances (as could be seen on some of the DVD extras), skillfully infusing their romance with the added magic of beautiful South Carolina landscape, a Norman Rockwell small town, and general Southern charm. The story of the young lovers is actually a story within a story: in the \\"outer story\\", an elderly man is reading the story to an elderly woman in a nursing home. As the inner story unfolds with occasional cuts back to the outer story, we get to see how the inner story affects the elderly man and woman (played beautifully by James Garner and Gena Rowlands). At the very beginning, the outer story seemed like an unnecessary device, but as we learn more about the elderly man and woman, and how they got to where they are in their lives, their story is as moving as the inner story. Other good performances included Joan Allen (as the young girl's mother), Sam Shephard (the young boy's father), and James Marsden (a rival love interest). In its passion and its charm, I found The Notebook to be the equal of Titanic. It's too bad it didn't get the same acclaim.

B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney's new album, Chaos & Creation In The Backyard is an oddly titled album that is not what you would expect from Sir Paul.  Instead of the filling the world with silly love songs, the new effort is probably the most introspective and reflective album of his illustrious career.  The approach to recording the album is much like his first two solo works (McCartney & Ram) with Mr. McCartney playing virtually all the instruments, but he employs Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame as the producer.  The songs find a quieter vein and are less hook-filled than his usual fare, but they aren't without melody.  \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Promise To You Girl\\" contain the kind of melodies that Mr. McCartney tosses around in his sleep and most musicians would kill to write.  It is the reflective lyrics in songs like \\"How Kind Of You\\" (which is about meeting his new wife Heather Mills) and \\"Jenny Wren\\" that make for an interesting listen.  Other standout tracks include the string laden \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\", the sprightly \\"English Tea\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before\\".  Mr. McCartney said he was thinking about John Lennon quite a bit during the recording sessions and introspective was one of his trademarks.  Chaos & Creation In The Backyard isn't the best album of Mr. McCartney's career, but it is certainly his most challenging.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Enter Iceland's Sigur Ros singing in a language only they can understand and writing music that could have never come from anybody else. On this their fourth LP, (their third available worldwide, their debut 'Von' is only available in Iceland) they venture into terrorities even Jason Pearce would fear to tread... <br /> <br />After the minute long title track that serves as an intro 'Glosoli' starts gently, Jonsi's crystal falsetto whispers sweetly over sweet guitar phrases until four minutes in when the bubble finally bursts. The clash of sheer resounding beauty and delicate aggression really is unfathomable. It shouldn't work but it does and no sooner have you got your breath back when `Hoppipolla's epic piano melody rolls into the open space and forces you to cry with a smile on your face.  <br /> <br />By the time it reaches its cinematic climax the listener has been taken way above the heavens and back again and all in time for Top Of The Pops. This isn't to say `Hoppipolla' is anything that's even remotely radio friendly but this is easily the most accessible track on here. Its not that `Takk' is a difficult listen but it's hard to believe many Offspring or Green Day fans will be rushing out to buy this despite the immeasurable hype Sigur Ros evoke in the US rock press. You have to ask yourself though, is that really a bad thing? <br /> <br />The albums eleven tracks sparkle and shine throughout encompassing many styles, grand orchestral themes mix with what sounds like German beer hall slap dance music to dazzle and amaze. Further on in the record and `Soeqliopur' glistens and chinks over the speakers, `Lndvari' informs us of the kind of records Radiohead should really be making and finale `Heysatan' is plain gorgeous.  <br /> <br />Surpassing their last three records by light years Sigur Ros have delivered a record that feels completely unique and comforting like the soundtrack to a million sad movies that all have happy endings. The scale of it may be a little too grand for some but much, much, more importantly than that you forgive them as they are Brad Pitt's favourite band.  <br /> <br />You can't ask for any more than that now can you? <br />

B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I found this movie interesting, in part because of the characterization of blue-collar Bostonians. The view of the Mystic River with the bridge in the background is one that I have seen quite often growing up in this area.    My only real problem with the overall premise of the film is the way that the scrutiny seemed to turn so easily to Tim Robbins' character. Though something horrible had obviously happened, there was no evidence tying the girl to his car (she was found in a ditch close to her own car). There were two blood types found on his car, one of which may have been hers, but there was no reason to think that her body had been driven anywhere. He did not have a gun (she was found shot). He had a gash across his stomach (she was out partying with her friends, not hanging out on a street corner wielding a knife). He had somehow damaged his hand and yet her body had not been mauled. Simply pulling a trigger would have done none of this to him.    In addition, Sean Penn didn't simply fly off the handle, overwhelmed with the fact that his daughter had been killed, thereby killing Robbins. He had plenty of time to consider the inconsistencies noted above. If Robbins had been known for killing/raping/attacking anyone previously, particularly young women, these conclusions would have been more believable. Yet Robbins had none of those traits.

I was browsing the teen section at B&N (where I find a great deal of fantastic reading, despite my advanced age of 33), read the back cover, and thought it sounded good. It ended up being one of the best stories I've ever read. I have just finished Ender's Shadow and Speaker for the Dead. I am going to read all the rest slowly so the whole experience doesn't end too soon. If they're really going to make a movie form the book I hope they do a really, really good job.
B00005QFE5|4.0|Note: Chinese with English subtitles.<br /><br />How long could you sit and watch a film about a young eighteen year old Chinese girl standing by the side of the road waiting for a certain male school teacher to passby, then only smiling when he finally appears? Well, if the girl is the lovely and expressive Zhang Ziyi the correct answer is quite a long time.<br /><br />Set in a quiet, rural village in a remote area of China director Yimou Zhang has translated a tender love story between Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao) a newly arrived school teacher and Zhao Yuelin (Zhang Ziyi), one of the local villagers, into a visual poem of young love in its purest, most innocent form.<br /><br />Focusing on Zhao as she goes about her daily tasks and routines we seem to experience first-hand her feelings and affection for the new teacher intensifying with each passing day. Every thought, every deed seems orchestrated in such a way as to bring her ever closer to her one true love.<br /><br />Zhang Ziyi is amazing! With an absolute minimal amount of dialogue she succeeds in conveying all her emotional yearnings and desires visually; through her eyes, delicate facial expressions and subtle body movements and gestures. She is truly a remarkable and gifted actress.<br /><br />The film starts out slowly, but stay with it. It gets alot better once Zhang Ziyi appears on-screen.

Not to mention, when Britney & Kevin finally get married it's really a great and emotional moment!  <br /> <br />The DVD set sounds great too because we finally get the videos for Someday and Do Somethin!  Not to mention the making the videos and the additional CD with three great songs!
B00000K0T8|5.0|If you had to categorize Ghostface's abstract style of rap it would have to be impressionistic. Ghost's in your face style rarely comes forth in a conventional manner, instead he splashes the canvas with an array of vivid colors and images creating an aural kaleidescope of soul, funk, dry-wit, and braggadocio unmatched by any other. Sadly far too many men have had to come up in America's ever-sprawling projects and ghettoes but few have ever told their story as well as Ghost. This is a masterpiece.
B000059TFO|5.0|Excellent Film!  Based on a true story about racism in the south during the 60's.  It is sad to believe that people actually acted that way in the past. The film portrays the extremely difficult challenges blacks had living in parts of the south in the 60's. Excellent acting, great sound on the home theater. I had seen this on TV. Then after reading an article in US News and Workd Report, I decided I wanted this film in my collection.

0399152717|2.0|I am a big fan of Cussler's books and have read (and re-read) all of his work.  This last book, \\"Polar Shift\\", is by far his worst work to date and it is painfully obvious that Cussler did very little of the actual writing of this book.  The plot, on the surface, is a typical Cussler work, but the action scenes are poorly constructed and quite boring.  I do not think Austin even gets scratched in this book.  Compare that to Cussler's earlier works where Pitt gets beaten half to death in every book.  For that matter, I am not sure Austin even breaks a sweat.  There are a couple of interesting moments in the book, but they all lead nowhere.  This book reads like a quickly put together idea that just never arrived at a cohesive book.  If you are like me, and are a big Cussler fan, you will buy it and read it.  There is some enjoyment here, but I certainly hope Cussler pays a little more attention to what his co-writers are doing and re-establishes control of his characters before they fade into the obscure depths of poor story-telling.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Calling Takk \\"pop\\" is a relative term - it doesn't for a nanosecond suggest Sigur Rs are about to employ synchronised dancers. Rather, Takk will make reassuringly familiar sounds to fans who've loved Agaetis Byrjun, for it is the sound of the band leaving aside darker, scarier worlds to return to more innocent places. With Takk (Icelandic for \\"thanks\\"), Sigur Rs sound happy, but they're no less dramatic. <br /> <br />Prior to 2002's doomladen but in places stunning (), this band made beautiful songs suggestive of childhood games, awe at surroundings and emotional connection. Even if the lyrics were sung in a nonsense, made-up language, it was a hard heart indeed that would not be moved by their astonishing music. It is to this other dimension, a realm of escape, that Jnsi, Kjartan, Orri and Georg head with this record. <br /> <br />Takk's songs are still epics of over seven minutes that generally take at least half of that to get going, and they evoke euphoria, delight and wonder. Cliches about storms and glaciers can be left politely at the door of the immediately memorable Glsli, with its insistent conclusion anchored by a trio of bass drums crunching a speaker-busting thud that's rousing enough to march an army into battle. It's like a light, happy counterpoint to the ironically named Popplagid (\\"The Pop Song\\") from (). <br /> <br />But whereas on () there were unfocused experimental doodlings between the standouts, here Glsli segues seamlessly into another highlight - second single, Hopppolla. <br /> <br />Conveying a near-ecstatic celebration of contentment, Orri's drums again root the sound as piano and Jnsi's vocals build the song into the closest Sigur Rs has come to producing a singalong track. Then classical maestro Kjartan unleashes sweeping strings and brass to send the whole thing - surely? - into the singles chart with one of those immense conclusions that Sigur Rs have consistently done so well. <br /> <br />Recognisable song structures onthese tracks and S Lest, Sglpur - the best for fans of Jnsi's ebow and another rousingly dramatic moment - and Gong make Takk Sigur Rs's most accessible album to date, and the glorious string arrangements are by far the most realised the band have so far accomplished. But they've been careful not to throw out the inventive spark that makes them so special. <br /> <br />In amongst all the parping bombast, soaring falsetto vocals and dramatic orchestration, they still find space for quieter, reflective moments of real beauty. It's possible to imagine the xylophone and piano led Me Blnasir being played to a restless baby as it heads off to slumber. The equally lovely Mlan - another gracefully slow builder - could soundtrack waking up alongside a loved one to a crisp, cloudless sky, a coastal view and idyllic solitude, and just revelling in the sheer joy at being alive to witness the moment. <br /> <br />Better still, Takk does what Agaetis Byrjun did by burrowing into the consciousness and snuggling down to bed there, purring. Each listen brings out another mood, another thought. It's gorgeous. <br /> <br />Where it all goes from here even the band claim not to know. But following a record like Takk, Sigur Rs could bow out at the top of their game and pass into the annals of music legend. The delight for fans is in the expectation that there are yet further hidden wonders to be revealed by this most gifted and unconventional of bands. Takk, guys. <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has always been one of my favorite bands, and after their last two absolutely amazing albums, my expectations were unreasonably high for X&Y. Though it has its faults, it is as perfect as an album ever could be, in my opinion. The album is divided between \\"X\\" (the first 6 songs) and \\"Y\\" (the last 6 songs). I'd have to say I like the \\"X\\" songs better but \\"Y\\" is almost just as good. The overall album focuses on a general theme of finding meaning in life, in love, and discovering yourself; other than their remarkable talent, one of the main reasons I think Coldplay appeals to such a broad audience is because of the universal themes that their lyrics focus on. <br /> <br /> <br />A more in-depth, individual song analysis:  <br /> <br />X:  <br />#1 ~ \\"Square One\\" ~ 9/10 [[An excellent way to kick off the album. It defintely fits as the first track and introduces the theme of the album right off the bat. The guitar, drums,etc - everything is absolutely perfect and awe-inspiring as you dive into the album - \\"You wonder if your chance will ever come/or if you're stuck in square one\\"]] <br /> <br />#2 ~ \\"What If\\" ~ 10/10 [[ A peaceful, beautiful song. A nice breath of relaxing air between the two upbeat songs (1 & 3) Another song with life-pondering and thoughtful lyrics. Martin's vocals are truly moving and the band's accompanying instrumentals are outstanding.  - \\"Every step that you take / could be your biggest mistake / it could bend or it could break / but that's the risk that you take\\" ]] <br /> <br />#3 ~ \\"White Shadows\\" ~ 10/10  [[This song opens with one of the catchiest guitar riffs I've ever heard, and even upon first listen, the song blew me away. Despite it's upbeat melody, the song continues with the pensive theme of the album - \\" Maybe you'll get what you wanted / maybe you'll stumble upon it / everything you ever wanted / in a permanent state\\" ]] <br /> <br />#4 ~ \\"Fix You\\" ~ 11/10 =) [[This song is honestly one of my favorite songs of all time. I don't know how else to describe it but breath-taking. To really understand, you need to listen to it yourself. - \\"When you try your best but you don't succeed / when you get what you want but not what you need / when you feel so tired but you can't sleep / stuck in reverse..lights will guide you home\\" ]] <br /> <br />#5 ~ \\"Talk\\" ~ 10/10 [[An incredible follow-up to an outstanding 4th track. A song that shows off the talents of every member of the band - \\"I'm so scared about the future / and I want to talk to you / You can take a picture of something you see / in the future, where will I be?\\" ]] <br /> <br />#6 ~ \\"X&Y\\" ~ 8/10 [[The title track of the CD. If I had written this review on the day the album came out, and upon first listen, my score for this song would probably be a 5/10. I remember being bored with this song the first time I listened to it, but it has grown on me and probably will continue to do so - \\"I know something is broken / And I'm trying to fix it / Trying to repair it / Anyway I can\\" ]] <br /> <br /> <br />Y: <br />#7 ~ \\"Speed of Sound\\" ~ 8/10 [[This was the lead single off the CD, and I instantly fell in love with it when I first heard it. It's truly a great song, and I still love it, but when put in context with the rest of the absolutely outstanding songs on the CD, it looks dull in comparison - \\"Where to / where do I go? / if you never try / then you'll never know\\" ]] <br /> <br />#8 ~ \\"A Message\\" ~ 7/10 [[This song's descrption would be very similar to #6. The first time I heard it, I was a bit bored. But after listening to the album many times, it has grown on me, and I find it to be genuinely romantic and sweet - \\"On a platform I'm gonna stand and say / that I'm nothing on my own / and I love you, please come home / my song is love, is love unknown / and I've got to get that message home\\" ]] <br /> <br />#9 ~ \\"Low\\" ~ 8/10 [[ The 80% grade I gave this song accurately describes my feelings towwards it. It's an above-average song. It's not upthere with their best songs, but it's by no means a bad song. \\"You see the world in black and white / no color or light / you think you'll never get it right/ but you're wrong, you might\\" ]] <br /> <br />#10 ~ \\"The Hardest Part\\" ~ 10/10 [[ This song honestly isn't anything original or special, but somehow, Coldplay really makes it work. (Well I suppose that's called talent!) I fell in love this song upon first listen and still adore it. Chris Martin, the band's lead singer and pianist, has called it the band's 'tribute to REM' and I think that would be a good description. It's definitely a very catchy song. \\"And the hardest part / was letting go, not taking part / you really broke my heart\\"]] <br /> <br />#11 ~ \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" ~ 9/10 [[Some people I know who own this album absolutely detest this song, while I love it. The rhymes are simple, and the song itself is relatively uncomplicated compared to the rest of the songs on this album. But I suppose it's a matter of taste - I think the song works (works pretty well, in fact!) \\"You put me on a shelf / and kept me for yourself / I can only blame myself / you can only blame me\\" ]] <br /> <br />#12 ~ \\"Twisted Logic\\" ~ 7/10 [[If I had one critique for X&Y, it would be the way the album ended. I really like \\"Twisted Logic\\" as a song, but I personally would not have chosen it as the final song. For such a strong album, I think Coldplay needed a stronger finish. \\"Don't fight for the wrong side / Say what you feel like\\" ]]
B0000524CY|5.0|It is really hard to believe that this film is over 30 years old. The special effects still hold chilling value, the acting is still top notch, and the atmosphere still packs a mighty punch. What else can you say about a perfect horror film? Forget Freddy and Jason, because when it comes to truly terrifying horror villians, none can top Satan himself.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I Can see so far from recent reviews that people are angry over the double dip boxset...but Why?? Don't get me wrong I do despise double dips but only when the movie studio does absolutely nothing to improve the quality or bonus features from the previous release, for example, Carlitos Way Ultimate edition, The transporter special delivery edition, Edwards scissor hands 15th anniversary edition. Meet the parents bonus edition, you get the idea. I mean when the first original Batman dvd box set came out in the late 90's i knew it was bound to be released because the quality wasn't that good, sound was medicore for an action flick, and there was no bonus features. I don't understand..How can you batman fans be surprised. Don't get me wrong i hate it when movie studios re-release a dvd to promote the new movie hence, Batman Begins, but this is a very legitimate release. Some Worthy double dips being released this year include Evil dead 2 limited edition book of the dead, The man who fell to Earth Criterion Collection, Mallrats extended anniversary edition....Here were getting 2-disc special editions for each movie not to mention enhanced picture and sound! To me that is a worthy double dip. If Warner Bros. re-released each Batman movie with only a deleted scene or a commentary then I can see the criticism. Double dips are annyoing and are very greedy, but theres nothing you can do about it just be smart about it and do more analyzing. And one more important note, I highly doubt Warner Bros. will be re-releasing another Box set of Batman containng Batman Begins. Batman Begins looks pretty stocked with special features not too mention a bare bones release at the sametime. Oh yeah one last final note....For people who are hesitate on re-buying the same dvd over and over again..go to a website [...] and go the category \\"DOUBLE DIP DIGEST\\" here you dvd fans will given a more detailed insight on whether or not to purchase a more recent edition of your favorite film. Trust methis site has helped me with my double dip temptations..>.!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|it helps to be  a sucker for johnny cash cause this album is sometimes sad
B00005OWIU|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK, YOU CAN PICTURE THE MOVIE IN YOU HEAD WHILE LISTENING TO THIS SOUNDTRACK.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS ANYTIME.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|More in the footsteps of \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" than (), Sigur Ros'(pronounced Sigur Rose) new record \\"Takk...\\" takes me back to the winter of 2001, the ice covered streets, your breath in front of your face, gray skies, and you're in your own little world that a piece of you wants to share with all around but a piece of you wants to keep all for yourself. Sigur Ros and their music are at one with these bleak winter days, winter nights great for driving and catching the tingle of that little firefly who dances a waltz up and down your spine, the feeling in the music that dives directly into your heart and exhumes itself through the goosebumps that multiply down the length of your arm. Get ready to cry. I did. Get ready to feel. \\"Takk...\\" will bring you back the beginning when you first discovered the band and the sound only paralleled by the entity of its beauty.
B000001E7V|5.0|This is a great CD, I didn't realize it was an old release until after I had purchased, I guess I wasn't paying attention, but it is great.  The beats and music just take my breath away, the vocals are wonderful.  This is a slow, grinding, heart pounding CD.  You have to listen and just allow the music to take you away.
B000002HRE|5.0|It seems now a days, no one is actually reviewing a metallica album.  But i say that no one will take the time and even hear the new material from Metallica without fulling hearing the songs. What a shame that talent like James, Kirk, Lars, and Jason go unappreciated. This album is a good album and note that its a change from the first four albums. Is this Metallica's best album, nope. Does that make this a bad album, hell no. This album, along with load, have songs that will go down in history that made Metallica what it is now. I give you the load era.  <br /> <br />The songs that really stand out in this album are... <br /> <br />Fuel <br />The Memory Remains <br />Devils Dance <br />Unforgiven II <br />Better than you <br />Bad Seed <br />Where the Wild things are <br />Low Mans Lyric <br />Fixxxer <br /> <br />Fuel- Everyone knows this song. This is a real catchy song with a great chorus. I assure you, you will be walking somewere and this song will come up to your mind and you will not help but say \\"Give me Fuel, Give me fire, Give that which i Desire.\\" <br /> <br />The memory Remains- Good song. And yet again another catchy chorus. This song is a pretty nice song that is quite different from anything metallica's done <br /> <br />Devils Dance- I love the lyrics, Riff, and the SOLO. This is an awesome song. One of the best on the album. <br /> <br />Unforgiven II- The title stands out on its own. If Metallica decides to make a sequel to a song they have done before what can you expect, nothing but greatness. I dont know which one is better this one or The Unforgiven. I find myself debating about it, but that answer may never come. If i say this song is just as good as the The Unforgiven, thats saying something. <br /> <br />Better than you- good song. Great lyrics along with a real catchy opening. The song seems kind of eerie but its all good. <br /> <br />Bad Seed- BAD! This song won a grammy. Although i wouldnt say its grammy material, i would say its a decent song with awesome drumming by lars and James wierd singing. This one is something you wont forget <br /> <br />Where the wild things are- This song is just too great. It has a great riff with a mezmerizing chorus that you will find kind of freaky. The lyrics are really cool <br /> <br />Low mans lyrics- One of my fav songs of all time. This is a great sad song. I use to think this was a cover song by Metallica song because it sounds so epic. This song is really really awesome. This is James Hetfield at his lyric best. That is what makes this song so great, the lyrics. Pay attention and you will experience a great song. <br /> <br />Fixxxer- I am hooked to this song. I use to think that the last great song on Reload was Low Mans Lyric but this song is just as great and just rich. Fixxxer is so great because anyone can relate to this song. You have an epic song here and its such a shame that more than likely Enter Sandman will be considered one of their best and this one wont be. This is Metallica at its best <br /> <br /> <br />Along with load, Reload is highly underrated. If you are a long time fan you will enjoy this. New fans will only like the first 4 songs but i assure this album is more than meets the eye.
B0007GAERG|4.0|THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is probably one of the better cds that Mariah Carey made. She really came back, after being idle for so long in the pop culture world. She shows a lot of passion in her work, she has a lot of great upbeat songs, but also has a lot of emotional issues in her songs. She teamed up with some big rappers like Snoop Dog, Nelly and Twista. This has given her a new step in the music world, and I think it's going to bring her up on the charts again. \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\" are some of the bigger songs on the CD.
B00068NVI4|4.0|I saw this tour twice in Germany, waited longer than necessary for the DVD and now I've watched the DVD a couple of times. <br />This is a very, very good show.  The music selection on this tour was outstanding, the sound was outstanding and the lads seemed to really enjoy themselves.  One could hope that they'll continue to do so, but one never knows, do they? <br />The only things I'd have like to had done better is to have the camera operators know who was going to play what at what time.  They sometimes had the camera on one bandmember while another was really jamming on his instrument.  There were some times when I'd have liked to see Rick Wakeman's fingers flying across the keyboards during one of his spotlights rather than watching another bandmember keeping the beat.  Get in there close and tight and see Howe or Squire bending the strings.  That's the only thing I'd say that's keeping me from giving this a five.  And it doesn't miss by a whole star. <br />If you like Yes, go out and get this DVD.  Don't cry about \\"I think they should have played this song or left out that song.\\"  They've been playing for 35 years and unless they're going to play for a couple of days solid, someone's going to be disappointed.  I've personally seen them about a dozen times from Chicago to Brussels to Frankfurt and beyond and would love to see a couple of favorite songs.  But I wasn't disappointed in this tour one bit.  Pick up the DVD and I give you the guarantee, you'll really enjoy it.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Few bands these days can claim to the consistant quality that Sigur Ros maintains. I was rather worried about this album at first, since Baba/Tiki/Dido, although having its moments, seemed a bit scattershot. To me, it didn't seem like Sigur Ros could build upon what they did on that EP. Luckily I was wrong. Sigur Ros has taken many of the elements on Baba and instead of building ON them, they built AROUND them. The result is a beautiful album that pleased me, and certainly will please any Sigur Ros fan. <br /> <br />The album opens with a great burst of noise (the title track). This is a good build-up to the opening song, the epic \\"Glosoli\\". Following is a string of beautiful songs (including the excellent \\"Hoppipolla\\", and the sleepy \\"Se Lest\\") that continue up until the album closer (\\"Heysatan\\"). It's a really great album as a whole. Unlike others, I don't believe that this is their more accessible album (I feel that Agaetis Bryjun is more likely to win over new fans), but there's certainly alot of great music on here that, when approached with an open mind, can please any music fan.
B000063UR2|4.0|Too bad the powers that be did not allow this director's cut to come to the screen originally. In my opinion the movie would have been much more successful at the box office. I really didn't care for this movie at all when I saw it in the 80s, and mostly it was because it just felt like so much was missing (the Tangerine Dream soundtrack didn't help either). Turns out I was right. The Ultimate Edition is excellent, and everything this movie SHOULD have been the first time around.
B0006L16N8|2.0|mostly because coldplay has some good work in their past. This is a band that is continually going to get worse until they are like U2.  This band pretty much rips off U2 and radiohead and are BORING. Early U2 and radiohead are great, this band just survives by watering down what those bands did.  \\"speed of sound\\"? Seriously it's like coldplay covering coldplay, poorly.  One of the most overblown albums that I can remember, right up there with american idiot...the only difference is that american idiot is a good album (it just gets way to much radio play).  <br /> <br />There are bands out there that destroy coldplay in every way....go searching for them.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is more of a nitpick than anything. I've seen a number of people saying that this movie was set in the 80s. It wasn't, so therefore I find nothing credible about the reviews written by these people (who obviously weren't paying attention). For one thing, the internet as we know it now did not exist in the 80s... for another Uncle Rico would have been in his early 20s rather than mid to late 30s...<br /><br />Ah well, I guess the people who have this misperception hated it so much that they failed to pay attention. The setting for the movie is in fact a contemporary one set in small town America... and folks from larger cities may indeed feel that they've stepped back into the 80s visiting some of these towns.<br /><br />Enough about that... I liked the movie. No, it's not the \\"best movie ever\\" or even my favorite comedy, but it wasn't as bad as some are saying either.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This review is for the 2004 Paramount Special Collector's Edition DVD. <br />  <br />The movie opens with a young, struggling screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is deep in debt; so much so the bank creditors are trying to repossess his car.  While making the rounds around Hollywood for job opportunities, the repo men see him in his car and chase him down Sunset Boulevard.  As odd luck would have it, Joe's car blows a tire and he makes a quick turn into a large Hollywood estate and eludes the men chasing him.  He notices that this mansion has seen better days and goes to the door and is met by a strange old butler (Erich von Stroheim).  Soon after he meets a reclusive older woman named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), and recognizes her as a once famous film star from the silent era.   Norma and Joe discuss their careers, and Norma suggests that Joe read a very large script that she's been working on for quite awhile.  This then sets up the remainder of the movie where Joe becomes a live-in script editor for Norma and their relationship even goes beyond a professional partnership to a twisted and possessive romance between a woman at least 20 years older than her handsome live-in boyfriend.  <br />  <br />Sunset Boulevard is a classic for the ages.  Even many years later, the story holds up great and so do so many vivid images - especially the final scene.  The film is an eerie, yet seemingly realistic commentary about surviving in the Hollywood movie industry.  It's not an easy place to build a long-term career, and as a result, people will do just about anything to survive in that competitive market.  I think another important point made is how ordinary people tolerate rich or famous people who are at the very least socially obnoxious, but more likely psychologically unstable.  The film is clearly macabre for it's era and probably that's why it was shunned at the Academy Awards.   One of the most interesting features of the film is the use of real life characters such as Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, H.B. Warner, among others, who portray themselves in their actual career roles in this fictional movie.  The acting is superb, and perhaps a little over the top for Gloria Swanson, but her bizarre character is what makes the film so memorable.   <br />  <br />The DVD quality is an impeccable black and white transfer.  The picture quality is free of any noticeable graininess or film deterioration.  The sound is very good.  There are many extra features on the DVD including \\"The Making of Sunset Boulevard\\", a Hollywood location map of where many of the famous scenes were shot, commentary by Ed Sikov and several other short bonuses.  This DVD is a \\"must have\\" for any serious movie fan. <br />  <br />  <br />Movie: A+ <br />  <br />DVD Quality: A
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This latest effort from 30 Seconds to Mars blew my mind when I heard it. The intensity, balance, and integrity of this CD is incredible. The lyrics are powerful and the combination of both slow and hard rock is perfectly mixed, leaving no doubt that the four gentlemen of 30 STM are not only talented, but dedicated, driven, and extremely creative. Jared Leto's voice  has the power to carry every kind of emotion, while drummer Shannon's rhythms are both original and intuituve. Guitarist Tomo really knows how to rock out and bassist Matt provides a brilliant stability and pulse to the music.  <br />All in all, an amazing CD.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is one of the best Sci-Fi novels available.  This novel delves into the world and surface of the planet Arrakis..a desert planet that contains the most precious spice in the known universe..'Melange'.  This spice allows for visions, longer life and space travel.  The Spacing Guild navigators uses this spice to fold space and travel to any part of the universe without moving.  Control of this planet is vital and whomever holds this place..rules.  The Fremen live on this desolate planet and have  a prophecy that a man would come..a messiah..to lead them on to freedom.<br /><br />Frank Herbert created a masterpiece of science fiction.  This is the world of Paul Atreides, heir apparent to the House of Atreides.  Filled with court intrigue, politics, mystical religious overtones, and technology, this novel flows in many different directions. The main focus is that the House of Atreides has been chosen to rule Arrakis and there they are pitted against the House of Harkonnen for control of the planet..with the Fremen caught in the middle.  Hidden in the back of this..and carrying alot of power and control..is the secretive female order called the Bene Gesserit.<br /><br />For those interested in Sci-Fi, this is a highly recommended read.  The part where Paul's younger sister Alia faces down Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Leader of the House of Harkonnen) with her..poison needle 'Gom Jabber' was particularly satisfying.<br /><br />His other Dune series books are good, but they don't measure up to this first book.  Well worth getting.
B000AL730Y|3.0|How could Paul miss an opportunity like this?  With all the hype and the buzz and the super-bowl and the Live 8 and the touring and all the ass-kissing he has gotten in the past 2 - 3 years.  Everyone is watching him; he could have won a Grammy or had a number one album.  Instead he puts out the least thrilling thing since Off the Ground.  Too bad Paul, but I still love ya!
B00005JKG9|4.0|Glenn Gary Glenn Ross has strong characters who have great dialougue with each other. This is a good dvd to own because of strong individual scenes by great actors.
B000AL730O|3.0|I am a 24-year-old die hard solo Beatles fan.  I have loved all Paul, George, & Ringo material since the Beatles.  Paul and Ringo have been excellent with their last few albums.  I love Paul's new band and I am going to see him October 8th and I've seen him twice before.   <br />This album has good moments and not so great moments.  The highlights here are Fine Line, Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain and A Certain Softness.  Paul was going for a Lennon-type-of-groove with his lyrics this time around and it doesn't really fit his style.  It almost works out, but you can tell the lyrics seem more forced than usual.   <br />The music is not bad at all on here, it is much of what recent McCartney listeners have come to enjoy; I was expecting more of a Flaming Pie / Driving Rain type of energy on here though.  He played a bunch of instruments on Flaming Pie and other previous albums of note, but we do not feel the same emotions on this record.   <br />I think this is probably due to the new producer?  Maybe?  Hopefully?   <br />.   <br />If I had to rank the last few albums, #1 being the best... <br />1) Driving Rain <br />2) Flaming Pie <br />3) Chaos & Creation In The Backyard <br />4) Run Devil Run <br />5) Off the Ground <br /> <br />Driving Rain had the mature lyrics and the good Beatles-type music, but with an added edge (probably due to the good band accompanying/influencing him).  Flaming Pie had the same as above but without the edge, although, I hesitate putting Driving Rain above Flaming Pie for that reason.  On Chaos we find Paul striving for both of these qualities, but he doesn't quite hit the mark on either of them.  At some points on the album he comes close.  Run Devil Run is only ranked lower than Chaos due to lack of original material, I like the album very much.  Off the Ground has its musical and lyrical moments, but we find Paul still stuck in the 80's a bit on this album.   <br /> <br />Based on the evidence presented above...a 3/5 for Paul.  I look forward to the concert. <br />              <br />End Transmission   <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|[...] There is no need to be a genius to realize what a great record this is, from the ass-kicking \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to the amazing \\"Polly\\", you can notice how Kurt Cobain masters the art of making music. There are songs which you will keep on hearing, such as \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Lithium\\". So you should really buy this album. It's no waste of money.
B000286S8S|2.0|Its not enough that the band came back together, but they obviously wanted to cash in once again on music created in the past. Let's review: Live Right here Right Now, Greatest Hits volume 1 and now theres a Best of volume 2 with the some of the same songs as on volume 1. There are 3 new songs, but 2 of the 3 new songs don't hold interest very well as they sound very patched together and contrived, and painfully absent of undeniable and memorable guitar and vocal hooks. This should be especially alarming as Eddie Van Halen claimed in a interview, he had 10 years worth of music while disbanded ready for release and yet these 2 new songs hardly reflect the catchy and inventive music this band has shown they are very capable of creating. One wonders if they had a better chance of staying together had they produced a whole new set of songs with Sammy. The fact that their fans renewed their interest in Van Halen's old catalog again when the band reunited and bought from it was not enough to stall the idea of volume 2 from being released, thus taking advantage of fans hope in the bands sincere return, by manipulating them to again rebuy old material. When does this become insulting to an individual where they are not feeling ripped off from a high priced concert ticket and the rehash of old music? Its still amazing to me and should be to more of their fans, that Eddie was so upset again that Sammy left and yet he unwittingly set him up to leave from the beginning of their reunion. Afterall there was hardly any newly created material to stand by and commit to from the beginning. Not nearly enough time to sacrifice and create all new material for the sake of something new and lasting. Its transparently apparent they saw dollar signs in one anothers eyes and took the easy road of quick album and tour=get rich=forget about the long term of the band performing and creating together. In a past interview, Edward went against the idea of touring without a new material back when Dave suggested they cash in on a tour. If there is a next time maybe Edward will have a little more backbone.   If you want to hear them live at their best not their greediest, I recommend, \\"Live Without a Net\\" as it is representive of the ethusiasm these guys had for making exciting music captured live. Especially if you want to hear one of the best awe inspiring guitar solos/arrangements by Eddie. This Best of release is meant to line the pockets of the band with money, they are/will not use to create/release new and inspiring music together anytime soon.   [...]
B00005JNEI|5.0|It saddens me deeply that the CFR-controlled electronic and print mass media in our world today have ridiculed this brilliant production, and thereby kept so many good Americans from learning the truth about 9/11.  This production is one that ALL real Americans NEED to view a whole lot more than they need to worry about managing their 401K's (which will never pay off) or watching Saturday's or Sunday's or Monday night's big game or any of the other ridiculous distractions that the CFR and the Order of Skull & Bones et al have instituted to further line their already overstuffed pockets and simultaneously keep Americans from thinking for themselves; studying what's right and wrong in our nation, asking important questions, demanding answers, and taking appropriate action. <br /> <br />Michael Moore is a genius!  If you truly love the America that our founding fathers created for us, this is one work you should definitely view.  Otherwise, I hope you love the idea of living in a nation controlled by fascists because that's what we have today and it's going to get worse; a lot worse unless we all wake up and take corrective action. <br /> <br />Ignore the critics for once, and see \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". <br />
B000089RVX|1.0|This band really is not very good. The only slightly good thing is Amy Lee's voice, but if you want an actually talented female vocalist in a metal band, check out The Gathering, Leaves Eyes or Ayreon's \\"The Human Equation\\"(there's 3 on that album). If all this was was Amy Lee though it would probably get 3 stars, the rest of the band are pitiful. The drums are boring and untalented, the guitars are basically the overdistorted power chords you get in any numetal band.    Don't even get me started on the male singer's voice, lets just say he should close his mouth and never open it again. This album does have it's moments, but The Gathering and/or Leaves Eyes are miles ahead of this bland numetal (as much as you hate to admit it, they are basically Korn with a female singer).
B000AL730Y|5.0|I held my breath on \\"Chaos\\" until the first play: with so much history, it's almost hard now to take a new Macca disc and judge it on its own merits without comparing it to his own work - and if that doesn't work, then the Beatles' output - and if that doesn't work, then the shadow of those other dead Beatles.<br /><br />I am pleased to say that Paul has created a wonderful album in \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\"  The lyrics are not all bright; even the most hopeful lyric is tempered with a darker, nearly cynical, delivery and dissodent chords and arrangements.  The playing, though not reaching the stellar heights of - oops, I almost did the comparing thing!  I'll write that again.  The playing (largely McCartney's) is full, inventive and concise throughout.<br /><br />Oh, OK, I'll do the comparison thing, but just a little.  This is several notches above \\"Flaming Pie\\", which itself felt too Beatle-tinged.  And it's several more notches above \\"Driving Rain\\", which, though experimental, just came at the wrong time (November 2001, a month after 9/11 and at the time Harrison died).  This collection, however, though definitely from the left-handed writer in that 60's band, but it is him, now.  The sound is PRESENT.  Unflinching.  Maintaining hope where hope has been beaten down like a narc at a biker rally.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, there's little chance that this disc will catupult the man back into the Number One position, on the album or singles chart.  However, more importantly, this may be Macca's renaissance, in the same fashion that Bob Dylan found his a few years back.
B00003CXRM|5.0|THis is a truly entertaining movie, with the characters well suited for their parts. The entire movie gives a viewer a good overall impression of life during the depression in the old old South, where the Klan still held sway in rural communities....and even though it addresses serious problesm of the day, i.e. bank robbers, bigotry, etc. it still keeps you laughing! A great flick!
B00002SWEM|5.0|All I can say is to regret that all these years I have lived without the chance of being aware of all that poetry from the Island. Except for 'Siboney', only lately all other songs were more broadcasted, thanks to the movie released eight years ago. All those well skilled musicians are object of our affection in the right measure of the simple life they used to live. Maybe this can explain it. The video is great and the steadycam has played an important role in the final result - the ballet and gym exercises. As they were about to perform that concert at the Carnegie Hall, they became astonished by the huge appearance of  the city. Instead, it was for the city to surrender to their huge virtuose. They all are great, but try to hear (and see) the piano of Rubn Gonzles and not to be touched.  I could'n't, my wife either.

Finally we are admitting that intelligence, performance, and yes--even success--can be achieved by those who appear to be more creative than academic.

Even better, Pink includes sections called Portfolios where the reader is given suggestions for ways to strengthen his/her \\"whole new mind.\\"
B000AL730Y|5.0|\\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard\\" - Paul McCartney - Capitol Records 2005 <br /> <br />OK, after repeated listening (I've probably heard the entire album at least a dozen times by now) I feel qualified to render my own \\"homemade\\" review of Paul McCartney's \\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard,\\" produced by Nigel Godrich. <br /> <br />Like Paul's first solo album \\"McCartney\\" from 1970 he plays most all instruments and does all the vocals. In my opinion, the similarity ends there. \\"McCartney\\" is basically a rough home recording. \\"Chaos & Creation,\\" while not over-produced, benefits from the same high level of production quality found on more recent McCartney releases, particularly \\"Flaming Pie.\\" Instrumentally Paul seems to draw heavily on his strengths; Lady Madonna-esque piano and Yesterday-ish acoustic guitar seem to permeate most tracks. The drums are simple and solid, yet distinctly \\"Paul\\" as opposed to the more polished Ringo. The bass is pure McCartney on every single track. The vocals are simply flawless and recorded very pure without the masking of effects or doubling. If you suddenly found yourself stranded on a desert island with Paul McCartney, this is the musician/singer/songwriter you'd have captive for your private entertainment. \\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard\\" is a pure, thoroughbred Paul McCartney performing quietly intense, melancholy songs defying categorization (with a few pleasant exceptions). <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Fine Line.\\" This is a straight-ahead McCartney piano tune combining the \\"potboiler\\" qualities of \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" with the melodic sensibility of \\"Hello Goodbye.\\" It was probably chosen for the lead-off track because of its unique sound and its upbeat. It's one of the most up-tempo songs on an album filled with delicate tracks. Although I'm sure it'll be a single, I don't hear it was being the biggest hit on the album. Out of a possible five stars I'll grade it four (or for future reference, ****). <br /><br />\\"How Kind Of You\\" has a dreamlike quality and utilizes eerie tape loops under Paul's piano and acoustic guitars. It may be the most obscure song on the album, although the lyrics and melody seem to draw me in every time. *** . <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" takes the classic \\"Blackbird\\" guitar style to another level with twists and turns on the guitar that can only be categorized as pure musical genius. Working within the same chord structure as \\"Blackbird,\\" McCartney turns the key of `G' on its head by using `passing' chords as key-changing primary chords. For those of you at home trying to learn this song on acoustic guitar, be warned that Paul uses his Epiphone Texan acoustic on this track which is normally tuned down a whole step for live performances of \\"Yesterday.\\" The lowered tuning makes it much easier to sing. Speaking of vocals, Paul uses his soft falsetto voice previously found on gems like \\"So Bad\\". \\"Jenny Wren\\" is irresistible. ***** <br /> <br />\\"At The Mercy\\" is a ballad that could have \\"classic\\" potential if it didn't convey such a dark side. Once again, it's unmistakably \\"Paul\\", making it an easy listen for serious McCartney fans. Still, every time Paul draws you in with the \\"hook-ish\\" parts of this song, he bums you out with a dreary/dark turn. *** <br /> <br />\\"Friends To Go\\" sounds like something from the \\"Tug Of War/ Pipes Of Peace\\" era without the weightiness of George Martin's huge production. On the DVD that accompanies the album Paul mentions he was thinking of George Harrison while he was recording this song. While I could hear the influence slightly from time to time, I'd still classify \\"Friends To Go\\" as an 80's-type McCartney tune. It's mid-tempo with a very catchy melody and great arrangement. **** <br /> <br />Had McCartney written \\"English Tea\\" during the Beatles era it would have been called \\"Granny Music\\" by John and George - a term they used to describe Paul's songs in the latter part of the 60's like \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"HoneyPie.\\" Fortunately, hindsight has shown that Paul's \\"Granny Music\\" factors heavily into the art form we now revere as `Classic Beatles'. \\"English Tea\\" scores at the very top of this genre. Both lyrically and musically it brings to the table Paul's complete uniqueness in the music world. Nobody else could have written or performed this piece. As far as I'm concerned, it's a Beatles song in the tradition of \\"Martha My Dear\\" much the same way Paul's \\"C'mon People\\" (Off The Ground) is a Beatles song in the tradition of \\"Hey Jude.\\" Once again....quite irresistible. Incidentally, the terribly corny lyrics were quite intentional. ***** <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" is a lovely acoustic song. It's only fault is that it's buried in the middle of an album already chock full of MORE lovely acoustic songs. Realizing this, I waited until I had some distance from the CD, then listened to it as the first track. Once done, it was immediately apparent to me how strong this piece is. Simply put, it's another finely crafted McCartney gem sure to be a favorite with his fans. **** <br /> <br />\\"A Certain Softness\\" is not my favorite track on the album. To me, it sounds more like one of Sting's psuedo-Euro outings than a Paul McCartney song. Ironically, it sounds a lot like the song Sting was nominated for at the Oscars along side Paul who was up for \\"Vanilla Sky\\" the same year. If not for the fact that Sting's song is a stronger piece of material, I'd have given this one a higher mark.*** <br /> <br />\\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" is a very dark, minor-ish song positioned in such a place on the album as to tempt the listener to remark \\"This is getting just plain dreary.\\" To be sure, Paul sounds depressed on this track. On the positive side, Paul's electric blues guitar riffs bring a certain amount of life to an otherwise sleepy and depressing tune. I could easily live without this one. Sorry, Paul...a few good rockers between slow tracks would have made some of these darker tunes stand out muchbetter. ** <br /> <br />\\"Follow Me\\" reminds me of Paul's stuff during the Ram/Wildlife period. OK, so it's another slow song in an already long succession of laid-back stuff on this album. However, this one is simply a well-written song with inspiring lyrics and strong vocal performance. **** <br /> <br />\\"Promise To You Girl.\\" We're back to \\"classic\\" status. The up-tempo portions of this song are Lady Madonna/Flaming Pie-ish. The harmony parts seem to have John and George singing along with Paul from `beyond'. I absolutely love this track. I particularly love the lyric \\"Looking through the backyard of my life, time to sweep the fallen leaves away.\\" ***** <br /> <br />\\"This Never Happened Before\\" is quite simply one of the best love songs Paul has ever written. The melody and chord structure are both surprising and dead-on target. I'll classify this one as the first GOOD song Paul has ever written for Heather. It's about time...the last few he wrote for her were borderline stinkers!(Heather, time to take \\"Your Loving Flame\\" off the CD player. You've finally been given your \\"My Love\\".) If Paul releases \\"This Never Happened Before\\" as a single, it'll make the top 10. Had this song been on 'Abbey Road' it would be considered a standard today. \\"This Never Happened Before\\" made the price of the entire CD worth it for me. Perfection. ***** <br /> <br />\\"Anyway\\" also scores very high. What you have here is Paul using the basic chord progression to the southern gospel standard \\"People Get Ready\\" and making his own song out of it. Once again, McCartney's ability to take something familiar and write a completely original song around it stuns me. This is his pure genius - he's pulled yet another unwritten classic melody out of thin air and shared it with the world. ***** <br /> <br />To conclude, \\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard\\" is a delicate, worthwhile album by the most famous and accomplished musician in modern history, seemingly nearing the end of his long & winding road, yet still far enough away to sound in his prime. Its only fault is being plagued by slow songs while lacking any serious McCartney rock & roll. A nave observer might accuse Paul of being incapable of \\"rocking\\" now that he's firmly in his 60's. Those folk only need to pop their heads in the door during Paul's new tour. One blast through 'Helter Skelter' should satisfy even the biggest skeptic. Apparently, \\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard\\" reveals what Paul McCartney wants to say at this point in his long, illustrious career. For those in a melancholy mood, this one is decidedly personal and heartfelt, with little-to-no political overtones or serious messages. For those not completely taken with Paul's softer side, I'm afraid you might find this album boring. Listen in the right frame of mind and you might be very surprised at what you hear. Yes, he's the most successful songwriter in history...but even without his track record there are shades of magic and brilliance in many of the compositions on \\"Chaos & Creation In The Backyard.\\" <br /> <br />As for me, I love this album because after listening to it I feel as if I've just finished hanging out with Paul in his studio, hearing McCartney songs nobody else knows about - some future public classics; others fiendishly private. <br /> <br />My overall rating: ****  (sorry about the 5 stars here on Amazon but they don't allow for 'half stars'! When it's Paul, you always ROUND-UP.) <br /> <br />Nice job, Paul & Nigel. I hope people give it a fair listen. <br /> <br />Vince S. <br />Canton, Ohio, USA <br />9/14/2005
B000AL730Y|5.0|I have just finished listening to C&CITB and I can safely say that this is a very, very good record.  I grew up with the Beatles and have been a lifelong fan.  It hardly goes without saying that since his first solo album Sir Paul has gone to great lengths to distance himself from that history and to disappoint most of us.  On this album, however, McCartney reverses himself and embraces the past with relish and it makes for a fine album.  It's almost as if he said \\"Hey, it's okay to sound like then Beatles, I WAS a Beatle\\".  I hesitate to say that this is the best thing since he has done since the Beatles because that's damning with faint praise.  Within a few minutes I found myself singing along to songs I didn't even know.  This record is definitely equal to his earlier work with that other band.  Welcome back Sir Paul!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I absolutely love Coldplay. They really haven't changed much, they're still the best group on the world. This album is a combination of soft ballads and smooth up-tempo songs. <br /> <br />My favorite is Twisted Logic because it combines both aspects. It starts of soft and ends up-tempo. <br /> <br />My advice: Buy the album NOW! Don't delay. You won't be disappointed.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This dvd is amazing!  The sound is great, and so is the setlist.  Dream Theater songs contain some of the greatest musicianship i have ever heard.  This concert never gets boring.  I love watching the \\"Instrumedley\\" performance... it's really good.   <br /> <br />The only complaint i have is that they should have included maybe one or two more songs from \\"Images and Words\\", but in the end, it doesen't really matter, because the dvd is still awesome.   <br /> <br />If your a fan of music in general, i think you'll like this dvd.
0226039331|4.0|This is the *best* NT Greek dictionary for students of the Greek New Testament.  Thorough scholarship; many entries exhaustively categorize word meanings and all provide references to other ancient literature.  A necessity for doing scholarly work in the New Testament, and a serious reference tool for the pastor or student.  If you do any work in the NT, you *need* this lexicon.  The 3rd edition revamps the earlier glosses and attempts to provide definitions for words.  Also has words from the Apostolic Fathers and other early literature. <br /> <br />However, the price is VERY STEEP.  Especially for students.  If you are a student on a tight budget (and don't need to purchase the latest and greatest copy of Bauer), I would recommend doing obtaining a used copy of the 1st edition, which can be found for under $30 at the time of this writing.  The glosses are basically the same in 1st and 2nd edition, the only thing that is changed are that more mistakes are corrected.  The 3rd edition's definitions are nice, but in general I find it is more helpful to get glosses to point me in the right direction and use a concordance/search program to get a better understanding of how a word is used in the NT.
B000002H70|5.0|I really can't say much beyond what some others have added on. <br /> <br />This album is simply brilliant. It sucks you in - literally. I didn't realise it untill my room mate asked me why I was playing the same album for the past three days! <br /> <br />If you thought that The Cure was just a syrupy poppy band - this album will certainly make you think again. I listen to mostly old stuff - Floyd, Doors, Scorpions, U2, Pearl Jam. Progressive and alternative and plain old classic rock, blues and jazz. <br /> <br />The Cure continues to be one 'oddity' in my collection - and it's  ALL because of this fantastic album. <br /> <br />Get this one. You won't regret it!

B000929AJQ|4.0|Nine Inch Nails' newest album With Teeth was a great return to the music world for them. Though the album is a bit different from their earlier CDs, the new sound is still good. From the driving beats of the singles \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only\\" to the harder edgier sound of \\"Getting Smaller\\", this CD is all a NIN fan could have hoped for after their 6 year break. Some of the other, more industrial-like tracks, are reminiscent of the album The Downward Spiral, a favorite among many fans. Though some of the songs on the album are a bit dull and repetitive, the good certainly outweighs the bad. It's not their best album, but I think that With Teeth was a great effort at a new sound that pleases old fans and new ones as well.
B000AL730O|5.0|I just wrote a whole long review of this album, but my computer froze, and I lost it.  :(  So, let me just say that this is an incredible piece of work by one of the greatest singer/songwriters of our time.  Paul McCartney is the ultimate songsmith.  I got my copy of \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" today when I got back from my college class. I've been playing it... the entire day.  What an unbelievable and ispirational album.  Halfway through the first listen, I was so overjoyed and moved by what I was hearing, I nearly broke down.  That has never happened to me, ever.  I highly recommend buying this album and giving it a spin!  Folks, Sir james Paul McCartney has done it yet again.
B00000F6LQ|4.0|Customers buying this particular item need to be aware of some serious quality control issues for the Collector's Edition. The first disk we received was defective, with a long scratch or substance of some kind engrained into the surface. We had it replaced by Amazon and this time the disk had two streaks of what we suspect may be glue on it, which caused the disk to skip very badly in play and even jump over scenes. We were eventually able to buy some CD cleaner and to get this off with a lot of effort -- we were desperately anxious to own this great film!  <br /> <br />The other issue is that the round spindle on which the disk is mounted in the case is made of such rigid plastic that it is very difficult to get the disk off it (this was true for both versions we had here). We managed to finally very carefully crush the sides of the spindle with a pair of pliers enough to get the disk out, but I think it would be very easy to crack the disk if removing it by hand.  <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that these manufacturing issues should lower the value of this amazing film, which is one of the funniest ever made. The box includes a script, which is great to read, and we now finally know all the words to the Camelot song thanks to the sing-along included in the extras!
B000AL730O|5.0|This is not just McCartney's best in over a decade. It ranks among the best of all 2005 releases. Unlike most of Macca's  catalog, this album contains all solid efforts, there's not one bad track; even the tacked on bonus instrumental  works. One striking aspect of this work is the absence of the catchy but somewhat cloying compositions which Paul has occasionally delivered. There's many solid melodies here but they don't tend to stick in your head; instead you want to revisit them and discover something that you missed the last time. Some of the credit undoubtedly must go to Nigel Godrich who apparently imposed some much needed discipline. Whereas I don't particularly appreciate the efforts of some other artists Mr. Godrich has produced, namely Radiohead and Beck, the man is obviously talented. However, it's the great artist that he's produced, namely Paul McCartney, who deserves most of the credit for adding this stellar effort to his immense body of work!

B000AL730Y|5.0|Paul McCartney is back with \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\", his first solo studio album since 2001's \\"Driving Rain\\". While most of Paul's recent solo material has been decent but spotty at times, \\"Chaos..\\" proves that McCartney has indeed returned to form as nearly every track on the album is on par with some of his most classic work.<br /><br />\\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" are both piano-driven rockers with trademark McCartney hooks while \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"English Tea\\" are derivitive of Beatle classics \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"For No One\\" respectively. There is even a slight George Harrison influence in the tracks \\"Friends to Go\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\". The two closing tracks \\"This Never Happened Before\\" and \\"Anyway\\" rank among the best ballads that Paul has written in years, the latter sounding much like \\"Let It Be\\".<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, Paul stretches out musicially on the mini-epic \\"How Kind Of You\\", \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" and \\"At The Mercy\\" which have a slightly different musical direction to them but are still unmistakeably McCartney. There is even an untitled hidden instrumental track at the end of the CD which shows that Paul is still not afraid to experiment with unusual sounds and musical ideas.<br /><br />The special edition includes a bonus DVD which includes a 30-minute long documentary on the creative process that went into the album as well as insights behind the inspirations of each track. There are also animation sequences and in-studio clips of various tracks. The DVD is a fine companion to the CD and shines a new light on the music being heard.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" offers no chaos but pure creation and is Paul McCartney's best album in years. The music is joyous and Paul's vocals show no sign of age whatsoever.<br /><br />The final verdict on \\"Chaos..\\": It's an instant classic and is Paul's best album of the new millenium.

B000002HMH|4.0|This is a review of the Metallica album LOAD.  LOAD is one of the most controversial Metallica albums.  It signifies a transformation of what Metallica is.  This transformation brought much criticism to the band.  I personally believe the criticism of Metallica and LOAD is unfair.  First we are forced to categorize the album into a genre.  This is where the problem begins.  Previous Metallica albums are a heavy speed metal to the just plain heavy rock metal of THE BLACK ALBUM.  It is difficult to compare Load to these albums in the sense that it is really a blues rock album.  We must therefore judge this album for what it is, blues rock.  I enjoy this album and appreciate it. <br /> <br />We must get over the fact that this is not the Metallica we have been used to from years prior.  Unfortunately speed metal was gone or in hibernation.  Metallica was constantly accused of \\"selling out\\" with LOAD and RELOAD.  I don't see it that way.  Yes both albums are much more radio friendly.  Most of the songs are not as complex and in depth as prior albums, but aren't a lot of Lynnard Skynnard songs radio friendly?  And Lynnard Skynnard kicks ass.  This is Metallica playing their version of a blues rock, minus the southern twang.  There are still aspects of past Metallica.  Songs like \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" and \\"Wasting My Hate\\" harken back to the bad ass and heavy riff of both the guitars and frontman James Hetfield's voice.  Other songs bring a new hauntingly melodic sound, such as \\"Until It Sleeps.\\"   <br /> <br />To be completely fair of all aspects though we must compare it to previous albums.  LOAD is nothing like MASTER OF PUPPETS.  I like LOAD and I enjoy it, but I don't think it is as good as previous albums.  This doesn't mean that it isn't a good album in it's own right.  It has its own kind of heaviness to it.  Ones of the best tunes on the album, and quite frankly one of the most underrated Metallica songs ever, is Bleeding Me.  This song is much like past 'Tallica songs.  I like to loosely compare it to the classic tune \\"Master of Puppets.\\"  Both songs are longer, complex songs.  They have a musical structure that they both build on throughout the song.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" is the 'kick you in the balls repeatedly' kind of heavy.  It starts strong and fierce and continues this way.  There is an incredible instrumental section in the song that is a slow and beautiful melody.  Then it builds and builds back to guitarist Kirk Hammet tearing off a furious solo.  Then back to the heaviness it started with.  \\"Bleeding Me\\" has just as much heaviness.  Just a different kind, the 'softly press a heal into your balls then slowly grind them down' kind of heavy.  This song starts of slow and melodic.  It slowly releases its pain.  It builds and builds to the middle of the song where it gets heavy instead of soft.  James shouts out heavily, then again Kirk rips off a bad ass riff.  Then again it returns to its slow, melodic heaviness that it started with.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" represents the fierce destruction that drugs like cocaine and heroine unleash on your life.  \\"Bleeding Me\\" represents the slow, painful death of killing yourself with things such as booze, etc...  They express these ideas brilliantly, just in different ways.   <br /> <br />That is the best I can convince you that LOAD is a heavy album in its own right.  I don't think it's as good as the past albums, but I think it is a very good blues rock album.  If you are a fan of Metallica's old stuff, try to listen to this album again with an open mind.  Metallica has always pushed the limits of music and requires this.      <br /> <br />

FOX knows jack about good programs, they just love sitcoms too much...you'd know that if you saw the first 5 minutes of Family Guy - Season 2 episode 1, where Peter lists about 50 sitcoms that FOX put on in the few years before realizing that Family Guy was something special.  Firefly is one of those special shows, and I hope it gets picked back up...if not, Sci-fi channel might do it once the contract with FOX becomes null.  Cheers to the best sci-fi programming on TV!
B000AL730O|2.0|Don't believe the hype- I suspect it's mostly old hippies who think anything McCartney does is great- anyone else will be bored to tears. <br /> <br />1. Fine Line- lively but forgettable.  The piano parts starts to annoy you very quickly.         <br />2. How Kind of You   - it was very unkind of Paul to include this stinker.  Just terrible, everything about it.      <br />3. Jenny Wren  - decent but nothing we have not heard before.       <br />4. At the Mercy  - This has good verse music but a plodding awful chorus that ruins it- if it didn't have the chorus, it might be good, but since it is part of it, you don't really want to listen to it much.       <br />5. Friends to Go- this is actually pretty good and it grows on you- but it is tainted by lyrics that make no sense.         <br />6. English Tea - short but interesting twee song, sort of half-baked. <br />7. Too Much Rain- this is one of the best songs- pretty good, but nothing masterful- just listenable.         <br />8. Certain Softness - terrible mambo number- waste of space. <br />9. Riding to Vanity Fair- interesting the first time, the 2nd time it is torture. <br />10. Follow Me- amother sappy ballad from the King of Elevator Music.   <br />11. Promise to You Girl- terrible uninteresting tripe.  would never make a Beatles album, as with most of the tunes here.         <br />12. This Never Happened Before- this is the worst song on the album and maybe the worst song he ever wrote, which is saying alot.  Dreadful lyrics, awful tune- even Barry Manilow would reject this garbage.         <br />13. Anyway  -    This has a great tune- too bad it isn't his.  A blatant copy of \\"People Get Ready\\"- Paul should get ready for a possible lawsuit- you can't take other people's tunes and put your name on it- it's almost a note by note copy- shameful and embarrassing. <br /> <br />so that's it- only a few good songs- \\"Too Much Rain\\" \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"Friends to Go\\"- and \\"English Tea\\" is okay for what it is- the restare pretty bad and even the better songs aren't worth much re-listen.  In other words, it's typical solo McCartney- not very good. <br />
B00020HEG6|5.0|Words do not even begin to describe the absolute beauty and wonder of this music. And despite the fact that I'm anti-Potter all the way, when I saw that John Williams did the music for this movie, I had to get the music.  It would seem to me, that the more recent the movie, the better Williams gets. I highly recommend him to anyone who even has a slight interest in movie scores and usually they are not disappointed.  My favorite songs include Lumos!, Double Trouble, Buckbeak's Flight, WIndow to the Past, Secrets of the Castle, The Werewolf Scene, and Finale.  However, none of these come close to the final song on this Album, Mischeif Manage. This is most certainly the reason Mr. Williams has been nominated for countless awards.  My friend and I especially love the song \\"Double Trouble\\" set to the famous words of the witches of \\"Macbeth\\". In fact it is the song we either start to sing or hum everytime a certain person we do not like passes by. The only problem is, we burst out laughing before we're even halfway through.  \\"A WIndow to the Past\\" is the new main theme for this particular album and is the most breathtakingly beautiful song I have ever heard, Hands down. IT begins with an alto recorder solo (and being among the few that play this instrument I instantly gave a little cheer when I first heard it), and slowly builds into the orchestra. The song builds into a darker, mysterious feel and seems to stop suddenly with a bang!  Then it continues, repeating the melody once more in a haunting refrain.  Each song is elegantly gorgeous and so awe inspiring, I always stop whatever I'm doing, just to listen to the climax of each one.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I agree with all the reviews in Amazon that caution buyers from purchasing this extended presentation of Gladiator.  The added story frames are not enough to make up for the significant loss in sound quality, particulary during quiet moments when the dialogue is difficult to hear, even with the sound turned up.<br /><br />Many reviewers are also angry with all the historical inaccuracies in the film -- too many for me to list here.  Even so, I think most people don't go to the movies to get history.  If they do, they are almost certain to be disappointed even with films that make a point of trying to be accurate.  Story always seems to take precedence over truth value.<br /><br />Russell Crowe won the academy award as best actor for his  perfomance as Maximus, Roman general turned gladiator.  He dominates the film from beginning to end, and a good thing too.  It is his story we care about, not the senatorial nonsense that comprises only a small part of the film.  Crowe is good enough to give this movie five stars.  Earlier versions of the film are the best bet for first time viewers because of improved sound quality.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Four years ago, Paul McCartney fans dutifully sifted through the wet mess that was \\"Driving Rain,\\" scratched their heads and begged for something better. For the sake of his fans and the legacy he so often frets over, McCartney thankfully delivers on \\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard.\\" <br /> <br />The story has been told and retold a dozen times already: McCartney challenged himself to make a thorough, coherent album and brought in Nigel Godrich of Radio Head and Beck fame to whip him into shape. The result is a reserved and melodic 13-track album that plays to McCartney's strengths as a tunesmith while swerving to avoid his silly and sometimes lazy tendencies. <br /> <br />Though the whimsical \\"English Tea\\" is probably the only song that truly harkens back to the glory days of \\"Revolver,\\" this is the first McCartney album in ages that isn't poch-marked by bad songs. (Let's face it, even the beloved \\"Flaming Pie\\" had some God-awful filler.) Addictive surprises are also found on the George Harrison-flavored \\"Friends to Go\\" and the soulful \\"How Kind of You.\\" <br /> <br />McCartney's probably at his best though when he tickles the ivories on \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"Too Much Rain\\" and the Wings send-up \\"Promise to You Girl.\\"  Some will complain that the sunniest ex-Beatle never turns the amp up and rocks out on \\"Chaos,\\" but it's important to remember that both he and Lennon found most of their solo success when they unplugged and got behind a piano.  <br /> <br />The \\"Chaos\\" experience is enhanced by a 30-minute DVD interview that features McCartney and Godrich fleshing out songs in the studio, along with a video of \\"Fine Line.\\" It's nothing earth-shattering, but probably worth the extra bucks for true fans. <br />
B000A3DFZE|1.0|Has the man who blistered our ears with Mayall and Cream (both the original and the recent reunion shows), who stood toe-to-toe with Duane, who shared the spotlight with the lesser-known-but-perhaps-more-talented Albert Lee and with various authentic bluesmen, and who is capable of so much more than just mailing in stuff like this listless set of elevator music fallen under the spell of a mind controlling cult (has he been seen with Tom Cruise?), surrounded himself with too many \\"yes\\" men and women, or simply gone over to the bland side, a fate worse than the dark side and a place where rock and blues have been eviscerated by a music industry that shares more than it might imagine with factory farming where animals live short miserable lives cannibalizing the otherwise unusable scraps of their predecessors?
B000AARKOO|5.0|This movie was not nearly as bad as people make it out to be...but I guess that depends on your personal taste.  In my opinion it was a great movie.  No, Orlando doesn't yet have the ability to truly carry a movie role himself, but I thought he did a very good job.  I simply loved the story, the music, and the true message and meaning of this movie.  We can learn from this, so we should.
B000002KO3|5.0|When Talking Heads released \\"Remain in Light\\" back in 1980, I became an ambassador of sorts, carrying my LP between my left arm and my ribs to all my friends' homes and putting it on the turntable an the first opportune moment.<br /><br />This recording became the high-water-mark for Talking Heads, a feast for the ears with its layered rhythms, loops and effects, snaking guitars, cool percussion, and, of course, reams of disconnected words more uttered than sung, with David Byrne sounding jittery and radiating discomfort. This session captured the natural evolution of the band, a brave fusion of punk, R&B, and world music.<br /><br />Now, as I play the CD, I'm still impressed by the coherent energy that churns through the first five tracks and remain alternately fascinated and irritated by the dissonant scattershot of the last three tracks. The songs bristle as though imps were imploring the band to dig a bit deeper.<br /><br />Eno's handprints are all over the place, yet he never hijacks the band and his added value here is enormous---especially when the band's subsequent lesser works (though Speaking in Tongues and \\"Stop Making Sense\\" are both worthwhile recordings reflecting a different direction) are compared to what Talking Heads achieved on \\"Remain in Light\\" and its predecessor, \\"Fear of Music.\\"
B00003CX9E|5.0|One thing I find brilliant about this movie is the central metaphor of the jigsaw puzzle.  We see Susan Alexander Kane working them at Xanadu, and the reporter Thompson makes a reference to one at the very end.  Clearly, the structure of the film is like a jigsaw puzzle, with Thompson (and the viewer) trying to put the pieces together.  In that sense it's a mystery story, but not a \\"whodunnit.\\"  Rather, it's an attempt to reconstruct one man's life.  There's a piece of the puzzle missing that only the viewer (not Thompson) gets to see.  But does it explain everything?  Thompson doesn't think it would, and I think I agree with him.  It's suggestive, but in the end there's \\"No Trespassing\\" on the secret life of another.
B000001EMW|5.0|Metallica and Cellos.  When the average one hears these things they would probably demand that they be put in separate rooms so to speak; that they do no go together at all.  Some metal puritans I know refuse to even listen to this and that's a real shame.  At first I thought \\"cellos?  That can't be right.\\"  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  This is perfection at it's best.  The way and style these guys play on their cellos is absolutely mind captivating and will even have you head banging from time to time.  The crystal clear quality only aids in making it even more beautiful.  The original Metallica songs were fantastic with the guitar solos and lyrics being the highlight.  Even though there is no one singing, you can still hear the lyrics coming from the cellos themselves.  The best thing is that they don't cover any songs past the Black Album, so no bad songs. One thing I like the most is when I play it for other people and then when they realize that it's Master of Puppets playing their first reaction is of complete astonishment.  There are other String Quartet tributes out there to Metallica, but those pale in comparison to these.  Metallica was a big impact to these four musicians and not just notes handed to an orchestra and them told what to play.  You can almost feel the passion coming off the strings of the cellos.  You'll see what I mean if you listen to it.  I've spoken too much about this album as it is.  If you like true Metallica and a variety of different kinds of music.  You'll fall in love with this.
0441172717|4.0|My fiance has been trying to get me to read these books for months! And usually this is not my cup of tea...but I finally read it and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I would give the book 5 stars, as it is a great first novel to a 6 part series. But as a novel all on it's own I give it 4 stars, because the ending of the book is not all that satisfying. It leaves you drooling for more, and thankfully there are 5 more books to devour.
B000068QY7|3.0|\\"Heathen Chemistry\\" finds Noel Gallagher trying both to right the faltering Oasis ship, and to expand the band's horizons by incorporating new songwriting voices. He finds only mixed success on both fronts (though the effort did lay the groundwork for the superior follow-up \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\"). \\"Heathen\\" ditches the poorly-received experimental touches from \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants,\\" but it overcorrects in the other direction, and the slick production makes the band sound too clean and contained on most of the tracks. Liam's songwriting improves considerably from the previous album, but new members Gem and Andy Bell's contributions sound like filler. <br /> <br />The strongest tracks are Noel's masterful ballad \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\\" one of Oasis' best, and the anthemic \\"Little by Little.\\" \\"The Hindu Times\\" and \\"Better Man\\" rock convincingly, but the too-slick production hampers their swagger. \\"Force of Nature\\" is an interesting change of pace that now feels like a practice run for the superior \\"Mucky Fingers.\\" \\"Hung in a Bad Place,\\" \\"A Quick Peep,\\" \\"(Probably) All in the Mind,\\" and \\"Born on a Different Cloud\\" are pleasant but inconsequential-- nothing to be ashamed of, but on previous albums they would rightly have been relegated to b-sides. Similarly, the acoustic tracks \\"Songbird\\" and \\"She is Love\\" are good, but they beg to be balanced out on the album by some hard rock muscle that never arrives. <br /> <br />It's hard to judge whether this album is superior to \\"Standing on the Shoulder\\" or not. Nothing here is as embarrasing as \\"Little James\\" or \\"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is.\\" But nothing except \\"Stop Crying\\" is as good as \\"Sunday Morning Call,\\" \\"Gas Panic!\\", \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\", or \\"Go Let It Out.\\" \\"Standing\\" is an album of highs and lows, where \\"Heathen\\" is consistent but a bit bland. <br /> <br />Luckily, after two stumbles, the band has hit upon a winner with \\"Don't Believe the Truth,\\" which follows the same basic musical blueprint laid out by \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" but with better songs (from all four writers) and a much-needed injection of energy and swagger. \\"Heathen\\" will be remembered as the album that put all of the pieces of Noel's masterplan in place, even though the reinvention didn't pay off until its follow-up.
0553573403|5.0|This is the first book I've read in quiet a while that I absolutely did not want to put down.  Whenever I finished a few chapters, I would continue to think about the characters and the story, wondering what was coming next.  Martin does a wonderful job of developing his characters.  I had gotten away from the sci-fi/fantasy genre, but now remember why I loved it so much as a kid.  I've already bought the rest of the series!
B0006J28BO|4.0|If you enjoy the films of Hiroyuki Morita, you will appreciate this clever tale.  This movie is sort of a sequel.  It's too bad that the 1st movie, Whisper of the Heart, wasn't released for American audiences beforehand.
B000AAF276|4.0|I don't know if this is or isn't EC's \\"best.\\"  More and more I have a  problem with all of the \\"best\\" talk about art:  Leonardo da Vinci's \\"Last Supper\\" and Salvador Dali's \\"Last Supper\\" cover the same subject matter, but are extremely different.  Is one of them better than the other?  I'm not sure that's an meaningful question--they are each their respective painter's artistic expression.  They're unique.   <br />This album contains a stylistically eclectic mix of covers and originals that represent aspects of an artist who has continued to evolve for over 40 years.  It's probably not meaningful to try to compare this work with his other work to determine what's \\"best.\\"  This is a very good album in terms of musical content (and a FLAWLESS one technically, IMHO).  Like another reviewer, I was cool to these songs on first hearing, but have warmed up to them with repeated listening-- (except for \\"Revolution,\\" which I just don't care for--at least not yet).   <br />EC reveals in the interview on the DVD side that this album was recorded pretty much simultaneously with the Robert Johnson cover album.  He said that, during the two years they were making \\"Back Home,\\" if he and his musical cohorts got \\"stuck\\" while working on a particular song, they would do a Robert Johnson song.  I have to wonder if that switch wasn't helpful for more reasons than the stylistic change it represented.  \\"Back Home\\" appears to be a real studio album--recorded piecemeal, with each participant laying down tracks, mostly in isolation.  It is well known that this is not EC's preferred method of production, favoring as he does the practice of recording as if he were doing a live performance---everybody together in one studio, playing the song all the way through, repeating until the best take emerges--in other words, the way the Robert Johnson album apparently was recorded (see the \\"Sessions for Robert J\\" DVD).  Maybe the switch from \\"studio\\" mode to \\"live\\" mode was what blew out the cobwebs and allowed them to go back to work on \\"Back Home.\\"   Probably it was both the circumstances and the content (the Robert J. stuff sounds like it nearly played itself).   <br />However it was \\"birthed,\\" this is a very workmanlike CD--the work of a journeyman professional.  Time will tell if any of the new songs join \\"Layla,\\" \\"Sunshine...,\\" \\"Tears in Heaven,\\" etc. in the pantheon of EC greats.  Whether they do or not, this CD is worth buying and playing, and I recommend the dual CD/DVD version for the content and the enhanced reproduction quality the DVD side makes possible (you can still play the CD side in the car).  The guitar picks that come with the limited edition are...cool---I'm just trying to keep them away from my 18 year old (also an EC fan). <br />I gave this one four stars, but seldom give five to anything, unless on first hearing it's a full-blown theophany.  Yeah, yeah, I know, \\"Clapton is God....\\"  but you know what I mean. <br />My one (minor) complaint is that, while the guest artists are identified on the album cover, the songs they play on are not.  You can assume (and hear) that Vince Gill is on the song he co-wrote, and you can hear John Mayer elsewhere, but it would have been nice to credit these folks better. <br />Anyway, buy it.  It's good.
0380807343|3.0|Coraline, nor Caroline, lives with her family in a flat in an old converted house.  The other residents seem to be very strange.  One day Coraline finds a door in the flat that leads nowhere.  At least it usually leads nowhere. <br /> <br />On the other side of the door there is usually a brick wall.  But sometimes it opens into another house where Coraline finds her other mother and other father.  They have buttons for eyes and want her to stay with them.  But when Coraline refuses the real trouble begins and Coraline must rely on her wits and some subtle help to overcome the dangers lurking on the other side of the door. <br /> <br />Some of this book reminded me of the Courtney Crumrin books what with their parents that don't seem to pay attention.  But the similarity is slight in the end.  Most of the book is original is simply plotted.  No detail is mentioned for no reason so readers who pay attention will probably not be surprised by much.  Still it is a fun book intended for younger readers.
B00001R3GI|5.0|I can't really add much to most of the stellar reviews on here. This is the real deal folks. I absolutely worship the Stones, both their recorded output and as a live act. But this album is on a whole different level. Truly, a defining moment for the band and rock music in general. This one sets the standard.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|All you sin city fans out there, if you dont own the barebone dvd of the film, just hold on for a while. All new 2 disc set of the film sin city will be released on 13th december. Maybe, one of the worst cash in attempts by any publishing house where two editions of the same film were released within less than four months.    Nevertheless, this edition will include the never seen before uncut version of the film alongwith the expanded theatrical version. It will also include 3 commentaries from Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino and   also a feature commentary on the austin premiere audience reaction alongwith dts 5.1 and dolby digital 5.1 tracks.     According to ultimatedisney, this dvd set is said to have all these great extras too:     1. 15-Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez   2. The Movie In High-Speed Green Screen   3. The Long Take: 17 Uninterrupted Minutes of Tarantino's   Segment   4. Sin City Night at Antones - Filmmakers, Cast and Crew   Party   5. 10-Minute Cooking School with Robert Rodriguez   6. Bloopers   7. Teaser & Theatrical Trailers   8. A Hard Top with a Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City   9. Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make-Up   10. Trench Coats & Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City   11. Booze, Broads & Guns: The Props of Sin City   12. How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller to Make the   Film   13. Giving The Characters Life: Casting the Film   14. Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino   15. Sin-Chroni-City Interactive Game     The dvd set will include complete SIN CITY GRAPHIC NOVEL too!!!     GREAT STUFF OK...BUT THEN HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BUY THE SAME FILM ON DVD?
B000002UJQ|4.0|I think this album is one of the best more mainstream albums radiohead has released, but overall it is their worst in my opinion(i haven't had the opportunity to aquire pablo honey or hail to the theif yet). Its a very good album to introduce people to Radiohead with and is definitely worth listening to. Though Radiohead is my favourite band, i think this album is slightly overated.
B0002TRSO0|5.0|After listening to this album one time I was hooked on Ray's sound.  He is a mellow songwriter with inspired and insightful lyrics.  He does a great job of expressing emotion using not only the lyrics of his songs but also the tonality of his voice.  Buy this CD and listen to it with your girlfriend and I promise she will be impressed.  \\"Forever My Friend\\", \\"How Come\\", and \\"Jolene\\" are my favorite songs from the disc.
0805017445|1.0|I am a Kindergarten teacher in Connecticut, and have been using this book for many years. I have the Big Book, a regular-size Paperback version, and four small hardcover ones that I use with an original tape of Bill Martin reading the story. These books are much loved, and I decided to replenish my library with new ones, only to discover that for some reason known only to himself, Bill Martin decided to change the format. In the original version, the pictures helped give clues to the words, which emergent readers need: i.e \\"Brown bear, brown bear What do you see?\\" was on the page with the picture of the brown bear. The words \\"I see a red bird looking at me.\\" and then \\"Red bird, red bird, what do you see?\\" were on the page with the picture of the red bird. In this newer, revised version, the page that contains part of the picture of the brown bear has \\"I see a red bird looking at me.\\" on it. When you turn to the next page,  with the picture of the red bird, you see the words, \\"Red bird, red bird, what do you see?\\" but then, on the same page you get the words \\"I see a yellow duck looking at me.\\" No picture clue given. I don't like this version, and it's now impossible for me to obtain a copy of the original version. I think they must be out of print. So I'm holding on to mine for dear life! They're worth their weight in gold!
B00006AW2L|5.0|Yes, I actually prefer the bastardized version to the UK. The running order makes alot more sense with \\"Paint It Black\\" kicking things off. I like all the songs on the UK (I too bought that in 2002 to get more bang for my buck) but the stereo separation was too extreme. The stereo here sounds more balanced. I find it odd that the two UK versions I have were done in Japan (Buttons & Aftermath)while most of the US versions were made in Germany. Today, I finally broke down to purchase the US Aftermath to find that this one was indeed made in the US. Can somebody shed some light as to why this is? All the discs were a marked improvement over the '86 releases. I would not trash the UK version of Aftermath-I realize this was the original running order & song selection in England & even the stereo argument is subjective. When I first played it in 2002- I liked the wider separation mainly because I was hearing instruments & vocals in the mix much clearer for the first time. However, now that the novelty has worn off, I find the US mix to have more punch. Either way- a tremendous album. I think I'll keep both. Who knows; I may want to hear the UK version from time to time but I definitely prefer the US version even if it is abridged. 5 Stars for either version regardless of your choice.
0895260131|5.0|Until 9/11 I was like millions of others ignorent of islam, and then I started to ask questions, and started investigating into this religion. What an eye opener!  <br />  <br />Of all the insightful books writen about islam by authors such as Bat Ye'or and Ibn Warraq, this book by Robert Spencer is by far the most readable, documented, information source to date.  Mr Spencer goes to great lengths to document his information. He spelles out in no uncertain terms what everyone who loves life and humanity should know about islam! <br /> <br /> This is a book that is easy to read, and easy to research for references listed.  A must read, and make sure to buy extra copies to give out!   <br /> <br />
B000002H4C|5.0|...To only make his tracks available on this CD, nowhere else. But he does have a good reason: His \\"theme\\" is what the movie is remembered for, hands down.
0671027387|1.0|Very very poor.  I was sorry I wasted time on this book.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I don't claim to be a from-the-beginning Elliott Smith fan.  Like a lot of people, the first I'd heard of him was his work for Good Will Hunting.  Eventually I bought Either/Or and although I liked his voice and the atmosphere/mood of the CD, I personally felt it was a little lacking.  A little too uneven, a little too homogenous, with no standout track or highs or lows to remember.  I enjoyed the album mostly for \\"Say Yes\\" and for \\"Alameda\\" and \\"Rose Parade\\" (the latter two being hometown loyalty more than anything else).  It was the same for XO and Figure 8...a few favorite tracks, nothing awesome to write home about.  I found myself WANTING to like Elliott's music more than I actually did, but kept up the listening because a) sometimes good music takes a while to sink in and b) as unremarkable as the CDs were, they were still pleasant to listen to. <br /> <br />Also like a lot of people, I was simultaneously bowled over and not suprised when Elliott committed suicide/was killed.  His drug use was obvious, from near-painful public appearances to interviews that glossed over subject matter that was plain to see even from the interview photos - he was haggard.  I eagerly waited for From a Basement on the Hill as much out of morbid curiousity as actual interest in the music.  I figured this album would be like the rest, or worse - with such a well-documented downward spiral, how could his music do anything but suffer? <br /> <br />So, so wrong!  From a Basement on the Hill is a solid, well-crafted effort - even as a collection of songs picked posthumously by friends and family.  \\"Coast to Coast\\" just soars, from the word go.  \\"Let's Get Lost\\" reminds me for some reason of Simon and Garfunkel - the simplicity and harmony is excellent...\\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" is a beautiful melody that gets stuck in yor head, in a good way...those are just the first three tracks, but the rest are just as memorable.  I get the feeling listening to the album that Elliott, whatever his personal problems, was finally comfortable enough with his music to experiment and use production and studio time to his advantage, adding layers of sound that were not on any of his previous releases.  However, the album does not sound \\"overproduced\\" - still evident is his excellent guitar work. <br /> <br />I'm reviewing this now after a year of listening to the album - it's still excellent.  Selfishly, I hope that at some point, the people in control of Elliott's estate get as money hungry as those who have been posthumously releasing every burp and hiccup of Jeff Buckley's material - I would definitely pay good money to hear the rest of the material on From a Basement on the Hill.
B0008JFMEC|5.0|Director Quentin Tarantino really blows up minds with this movie. One of the best films made in this time. Tarantino takes us back in time to an almost samurai movie, mixed with today's reality and problems. Uma Thurman's caracter the bride is a \\"super hero\\" for women of nowadays. Really great movie, original plot and lot's and lot's of blood and overall ACTION....
B0002S94OS|5.0|this is for that dumb a** who wrote a reveiw and didnt even listen to the album first off 2 pac sucks there is no rapper with musical talent that is a fact metal will never die
B0009X7BFA|4.0|This is a movie that you can say: \\"hey this was fun\\". Great movie, fast tempo, Brad Pitt was good as well as Benicio. The direction was great, my favorite movie of Guy Ritchie, his mix of action, comedy and sarcasm makes this a great movie. Don't miss it!
B0002IQEHI|4.0|This was a well-done thriller with a lot of twists and turns along the way.  The closing scene (on Mt. Rushmore) was a bit of a gimmick, but it was an entertaining and suspenseful movie.
076780421X|3.0|Fools Rush in keeps me laughing throughout.  You fall in love with the characters just about as fast as they fall in love with each other.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|British humor and zombie movies, what more could a geek ask for?  Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted by a couple of guys who know what it takes: write what you know and write what you love.  Aside from zombies (which many of us have spent enough time growing up with to at least FEEL like we know them) everything in this movie feels real.  From the mostly disfunctional relationships to the idiotic reactions of characters to bizarre situations, I think most people can relate.
B000683VI4|4.0|I cried the whole way through this love story.  Beautiful and so encouraging to true romantics!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's fourth studio album, \\"Kid A\\", is one of those albums where everybody's got their opinion. It's usually an absolute one, too. I'm probably one of those who is more on the side that absolutely loves this album. While I am slightly more partial to \\"OK Computer\\", to me that's only slightly, but there's more to say about it. While some may argue that it wasn't very groundbreaking or anything, if it wasn't a radical departure, I think it'd be a much more middle-of-the-road perceived record; the \\"Kid A\\" fans liking it less and the haters hating it less... Anyway, I remember listening to this album because before this I did not like Radiohead at all. I went to the store to see what the fuss was about, and from hearing the first note of the record, I was certainly intrigued. <br /> <br />It is an amazing record, complete with the Nigel Godrich production. No, you won't get the more streamlined rock songs of \\"The Bends\\", but this album has a lot to offer. Starting off with the synth-laden \\"Everything in its Right Place\\", this thing is one of those albums that's nice to chill out to. Lots of vocal effects, but interesting. The next track does the vocal effects too, but this time around it's much less telligible, but interesting avant-garde nonetheless. <br /> <br />But that's not really where the album peaks. There are two real gems from the album which make it worth owning. There's the bass-and-horn driven \\"The National Anthem\\" which will have you pressing repeat and then there's the quintessential \\"Kid A\\" track, \\"Idioteque\\". The beats are nice to hear and there's just something about it that's great. Although I thought Thom's falsetto was weird initially, it definitely fits with the music. <br /> <br />Elsewhere, there's the near-ambient instrumental \\"Treefingers\\", which while not anything special is a nice chill-out track. As is the album closer, the somewhat theatrical \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\". It's interesting as it sounds like it's going to be over but builds back a little bit, creating a sort of climax, just before ending. <br /> <br />Guitars are far and few between, which is really surprising for a band that has three members who play guitar. But where they exist, they are pretty good like in the acoustic \\"How to Dissapear Completely\\", a nice track about dreaming. It's also got Thom's easier-to-acquire vocals, in his normal tenor range. While the most commercial, \\"Optimistic\\" has a good message from the band that is also somewhat simple. It isn't as interesting as the other tracks from the record but it is okay. While I have opinions on the other track and could maybe explain, I don't think I could do it without sounding vague and repetitive. <br /> <br />But this album is an interesting one the first time you hear it, no matter what you listen to. This is the closest to the electronic stuff that they delved into, and since this album every subsequent Radiohead album has borrowed some from \\"Kid A\\". It's disappointing somewhat that they weren't ambitious enough to try and create even more ground, but what you get here is solid and worth being in your CD player. And no, you don't really need to be intellectual to listen to it. You just need to enjoy listening to stuff while you lay down or have an open mind. One of the two. I've given people my copy of the album and they all seemed to enjoy it.
B000031XCR|5.0|awesome CD. One of the best female vocalists of all time.
B0006L16N8|3.0|X&Y: 2005's A Rush of Blood to the Head. <br /> <br />X&Y is not a bad album. It's a fairly enjoyable listen and has some pretty good songs on it. But it's not exactly new either; in truth, this album sounds way too much like A Rush of Blood to the Head (AROBTTH). Take, for instance, \\"Speed of Sound,\\" the hit single from this album. It sounds almost identical to \\"Clocks\\" from AROBTTH.  <br /> <br />Coldplay confuses me. They released Parachutes several years ago, an album I consider to be a work of pure pop genius. It was original, engaging, fun, and just all-around brilliant. Then they made AROBTTH. This album was beloved all across the nation. I personally didn't like it as well as Parachutes, but I had to give Coldplay respect for doing something so different from their debut. I had hoped for another daring shift in style on X&Y. I was sorely disappointed. Seems Coldplay liked all the fame and money that came with AROBTTH and decided not to jeopordize it, so they just made it again. Which is sad, because by that point Coldplay was so huge they could have released a CD of nothing but cats screeching and it would have sold in droves. <br /> <br />It's a nice effort, Coldplay, but I know you can do better than this.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|A DVD set that delivers the goods and includes the outstanding feature-\\"Strength and Honor: Creating the World of Gladiator.\\" This is a must for anyone interested in the film process-Pre-production to release day on to the Academy Awards right up to the DVD you hold in your hands. This documentry on Disc 2 adds punch but the real gem is Disc 1-The extended version and the theatrical release.  My vote goes to the extended version.  And speaking of votes while Gladiator won Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe, director Ridley Scott did not win. What's that about?  There's always something screwy about these award thingies.  And how 'bout the score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard? They should get SOMETHING!  Maybe some kind of simple award that states, \\"You have made one of the greatest film scores in film history.\\"  That should cover things neatly I think.  Disc 3 might be the only weak link.  But it does feature the story boards of a \\"rhino fight\\" that never made it to the screen.  Overall, however, this is a great DVD package.
B000AL730O|5.0|.... it's MACCA!!!!!! <br /> <br />This is a true return-to-form for one of Britain's most popular knights.  Then again, my opinion of anything Beatles-related is purely biased since none of them (living or dead) can do any wrong in my eyes (and ears). <br /> <br />\\"Fine Line\\" is an awesome opener to this first release from Sir Paul in 4 years.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" is an instant favorite as well .... You simply cannot go wrong when Paulie picks up his acoustic guitar!   <br /> <br />Good job, Mr. McCartney!

B000001ELL|2.0|In the late 1970s, I was a HUGE Kiss fan. There was something truly special about what they were doing up to 1979. You won't find that with Dynasty. <br /> <br />I bought the record as soon as it hit the store shelves in 1979, grabbing the first copy I saw and racing home to get it onto the turntable. A new Kiss album was like Christmas in the spring. Yet when I listened to it, I just wanted to cry. The magic was gone. It was KISS, so I really wanted to like it, but it simply wasn't that likeable. <br /> <br />Decades later, I have listened to Dynasty again, to see if I might change my mind about my original youthful assessment of the album. I have not.  <br /> <br />The problem isn't just the disco-rock of the cringe-worthy \\"I was made for loving you\\" (the rest of the album isn't really disco). Much of it is a lack of good songs, something that has been plaguing Kiss on most of their albums ever since. You know you've got problems when the best song on the album is a Stones' cover, and you're having to bring in outside songwriters to help (it didn't work). The arrangements are lacking in energy, power, excitement, and charisma (sorry, Gene).  <br /> <br />If anything, the album seems like a continuation of 1978's solo albums (which also lacked the special Kiss magic). On Dynasty, each member seemed to be carrying on doing his own thing. It makes sense, then, that the better songs are those done by Ace Frehley, who had the superior of the four solo albums. Kiss's best music was produced during the years when Peter, Ace, Paul, and Gene were working in unity; a mini-orchestra producing a massive, marvelous sound. I still get excited listening to the early stuff, even after nearly 30 years. <br /> <br />If you're a younger fan who's newly discovered Kiss, go back to their early albums (up to 1977 with Kiss Alive II). You won't be sorry. But give Dynasty a pass and save your money.
6304119046|5.0|In the book America in the Dark, critic David Thomson writes that Citizen Kane is \\"the key work of the first American director to identify comprehensive fraud as a topic central to his culture.\\"  (This idea was certainly developed further in, for example, Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil, and, especially, F for Fake.) <br /> <br />Even setting aside the film's technical achievements and influence, its thematic interests are still quite relevant... <br />
B000ASATWQ|4.0|Here is my straight foward analysist. <br /> <br />If you were expecting anything like Welcome to Jamrock you will be a bit dissapointed. There isn't anything on the album as good as that but there are some nice tracks. This album is a good effort. A nice mix of music, just a little bit unexpected: <br /> <br />My opinion: <br /> <br />Welcome to Jamrock (Excellent!) <br /> <br />Confrontation (JUST OK: only deccent lyrics but very good production.) <br /> <br />There For You (GOOD) <br /> <br />The Master Has Come Back (JUST OK: lyrics just above deccent.) <br /> <br />All Night (JUST OK: tough riddim but bland lyrics.) <br /> <br />Beautiful (GOOD) <br /> <br />Pimpass Paradise (Excellent: Single Material!) <br /> <br />Move (GOOD, but lyrics could have been better) <br /> <br />For the Babies (JUST OK) <br /> <br />Hey Girl (Excellent : Single Material!) <br /> <br />Road to Zion (GOOD: I'm tempted to say great because NAS held it down but Junior really isn't saying anything great in this track. His flow is old school reggae. It gets a pass still. And it could easily be released seperately as a single). <br /> <br />We're Going to Make it (GOOD) <br /> <br />In 2 Deep (Excellent! Possible Single) <br /> <br />Kakhi Suit (Excellent!) <br /> <br />As you can see there is not one bad song on this album and five excellent tracks out of 14 is good for any album. Overall the album is good. If I would say anything negative about it, however, it's that it's a bit unbalanced. Some of the tracks just shouldn't be there..mainly the Just Ok ones. It would have been nice if Junior kept the album in the vein of tracks like Kakhi Suit and Jamrock but this yute is a talented entertainer with a varied taste in music. Therefore, I could understand why the album is the way it is.  <br /> <br />I on the other hand, would have just have kept the whole thing gully (LIKE JAMROCK!) and then hit them with the softer stuff on the follow-up LP. <br /> <br />My ratings still: <br /> <br />4stars. Soild all around showing. This album deserves to be heard. Respeck.
1841150355|5.0|I can't believe I put off reading Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS for this long. This spectacularly written novel resonates with emotion and insight as it follows the relatively ordinary details of the lives of three women separated by decades. Each woman lives a single day here, each is haunted by the novel MRS. DALLOWAY. Virginia Woolf is preparing to write the novel in the midst of unsettling thoughts and surroundings. 50's housewife Laura Brown finds refuge in the book as she prepares for her husband's birthday and finds herself tempted by thoughts of death. Clarissa Vaughan has been nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by her closest friend, the dying poet Richard, for whom she is about to throw a party. The three stories converge thematically; two are brought together by a shared character.<br /><br />You don't need to read Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY to appreciate this book because Cunningham has constructed a moving tale that stands on its own. Although a knowledge of Woolf's novel reveals the layers the author has carefully constructed, there is much here to enjoy without that frame of reference. The language is stunning, and the sentiments even more so. Surprisingly, Virginia Woolf is the strongest character despite her iconic place in literature, with Clarissa almost as well drawn. Laura is less memorable. Some of the minor characters appear with clarity while others seem tacked on, there only to support the ties to Woolf's novel. The homosexual characters (most notably Clarissa and Richard, with fleeting impulses from Laura and Virginia) are treated with affection and respect.<br /><br />THE HOURS is a short, easily readable book, although you shouldn't - and most won't want to - breeze through it. I recommend this book for a general readership.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Before taking the plunge and buying the rather high-priced director's cut, I figured I'd watch the original version first. I have always known about this movie, but when it first came out I didn't appreciate classic rock like I do now. Knowing this had to do with a rock band, and also knowing all the hype that surrounded it during it's release, I finally decided to watch it. I wasn't completely sure of what to expect when I bought it, but being a Kate Hudson fan, I had a feeling it'd be good. I found I was completely correct in this assumption a mere 20 minutes into the film. But I also went into this movie thinking it was solely about Kate. I was a bit dissappointed to find it wasn't, but I feel that Patrick Fugit had a more compelling story behind his character.<br /><br />This movie follows William Miller (Fugit) through a once in a lifetime experience. By faking his age, Rolling Stone unknowingly hires him to do an article about an up-and-coming band called Stillwater. Along the way he meets, and befriends, a \\"Band Aid\\" who calls herself 'Penny Lane.' She basically shows him how a band functions. He also befriends the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond. While the rest of the band refers to William as 'the enemy,' Russell looks past that and becomes a kind of role model for him, taking him under his wing. But when it comes time to turn in his article, William finds he still hasn't had an interview with the most popular person in the band, Russell. So William writes about his experiences with the band. When the magazine calls to confirm the authenticity of the article, the band says it's all false. There's the basic story.<br /><br />But this movie is about more than just the story, it's also about the music. It features one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and the rousing sing-along of Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' is worth the price alone.<br /><br />With memorable performances from everyone involved, this movie is without a doubt the best one I've seen in years. I wasn't expecting Patrick Fugit to do very good in a leading role (I saw 'Saved!' and didn't think he did as good as he could've), but he shows he can carry a movie as well as the next person. But the true standout is definitely Kate Hudson. She has the ability to make every one of her characters likeable and truthful to real life people, and it's no different in this film. Billy Crudup as Russell is one of my favorite people in this movie though. One minute he's the typical 'drugs, sex, and rock and roll' guy, the next he's a true human. Jason Lee even puts on a very good performance as the band's lead singer. Who would've thunk it? A five star movie all the way.een in years.

0099450259|5.0|Mark Haddon has written a moving novel about love and bravery through the eyes of a British autistic boy. Christopher discovers his neighbor's poodle dead, impaled by a pitchfork, and, because he adores puzzles, he sets out to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington . But Christopher is autistic, a boy who doesn't like to be touched and cannot decipher emotions beyond the tools his teacher has taught him, and so the task requires the huge effort of testing rules and facing his own fears. A literalist by neurology, he deconstructs life into a set of mathematical equations and physical laws. This unique perspective makes him a good detective on one level, where clues and logic rule, but it also fails him on another, higher one because he cannot understand the magnitude of what he uncovers.<br /><br />That Haddon was able to write a book from Christopher's point of view with all his quirks and still make him lovable is extraordinary. By necessity, the writing is simple and unadorned, but the language of details elevates it from the mundane. The insertion of mathematical puzzles and drawings add to the reader's understanding of how Christopher's mind works. Haddon's real skill is an understatement that allows the reader to comprehend what is going on even if Christopher cannot. Although Christopher cannot grasp subtlety and nuances, the reader can, and that's where the true force of this exceptional novel lies.<br /><br />This short, easy to read book can be completed in a couple of sittings, although its impact will last much longer. Highly recommended for a general readership.

0965404560|4.0|Ian McEwan's Atonement has the feel of classical literature: an elegant and slightly formal style, generous details, and a straightforward plot. Briony Tallis, a spoiled British 13 year old, spies her older sister Cecilia and the caretaker's son Robbie as they wrestle with an antique vase next to a fountain. Although Briony imagines herself as mature, she does not yet have an adult understanding of the world. When the events that follow do not fit her scope of comprehension, she forces them into place with a lie that forever changes the people she involves. The novel follows the principals through the war and ends as Briony faces her own mortality in 1999.<br /><br />Especially during the first part (there are four) which takes place just before World War II, I could not help thinking of Henry James and his intricate exploration of character and relationships. I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading a contemporary novel. The only aspect that jarred me into the 21st century was McEwan's use of metafiction (fiction about writing fiction.) Briony is an aspiring writer when the story begins, but we are told almost from the start that she will become an accomplished novelist. Throughout, Briony is keenly aware of the demands of her craft and how they distort the truth. As the novel progresses, the reader is made more and more aware of this self-conscious side until the end, when the final section deals with this issue alone.<br /><br />Personally, I'm tired of metafiction and find it contrived; however, McEwan's polished writing atones for this literary sin. The details of life both before and during the war are extraordinary, as are the intricate characterizations. Although parts of this novel are overdone, it is McEwan's expertness that triumphs.<br /><br />Atonement is a fine book that deserves widespread attention despite its dryness. I recommend this book for serious readers and those who yearn for more classicism in contemporary literature. You'll want to skip this novel, however, if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot.ant to skip this novel, however, if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot.

B0009353IW|4.0|I have known of Ry Cooder since I was a teenager, but never really got into his music until he made a big splash with his Buena Vista Social Club. That masterpiece should have made put me firmly in Cooder's legion of fans, but for some reason I never got around to checking out his back catalogue. Then Chavez Ravine appeared on the scene with its emphasis on pachuco music. When I saw that Lalo Guerrero, Don Tosti (both now dead), David Hidalgo and Flaco Jimenez were involved, I just had to buy it. <br />Make no mistake, Chavez Ravine is not a Buena Vista Social Club for pachucos. The emphasis here is on the story and its peripherals, and not on the music per se. The aforementioned musicians make cameo appearances throughout, with Guerrero appearing most frequently. I was a little disappointed that there was not more old pachuco music featured, but enjoy that which is here. <br />My favorites are: Don't Call Me Red, a hilarious number that takes a crack at the readiness of some people to tag as communists anyone who opposed their particular goals; Corrido de Boxeo that features the warm and earnest vocals of Lalo Guerrero, Los Chucos Suaves which features Guerrero once again on one of his old hits; Chinito, Chinito which features an excellent vocal performance by the Commagere sisters; It's Just Work For Me, a song which illustrates how easy it is for people to rationalize their participation in an injustice; Ejercito Militar, a song vaguely evocative of a Flaco Jimenez hit and which features him on his accordion; and the bittersweet Barrio Viejo, which again features Jimenez and the unforgettable vocals of Lalo Guerrero. <br />In addition to all the great songs, the CD also comes with an informative booklet containing lyrics in English and Spanish as well as a number of photos of some of the musicians and of Chavez Ravine the way it used to be. The former is particularly helpful in helping Spanish speakers decipher the mysteries of calo, the pachuco argot. <br />Hardcore Ry Cooder fans will probably like this regardless, but I recommend Chavez Ravine as well to the musically adventurous and to old fans of Don Tosti and Lalo Guerrero. Had there been a little more pachuco music, I'd have given it five stars. But even as a four star effort, Chavez Ravine deserves a place in your collection.
140004281X|5.0|In a word...wonderful! <br />Alice Munro is a master at character development.  Once you read your first Alice Munro you will be addicted.  When I read \\"Runaway\\" I wished they were more then short stories - I wanted the characters and stories told to somehow all connect and tie up nicely at the end, but that's not how it works.  Each is a short story and the ending is up to one's imagination.  I guess that's kind of the fun of reading Alice Munro's work.  Always a pleasure and treat to read her work.

I enjoy listening to both of them equally.

B0002BO0HG|5.0|Absolutely incredible CD! Antony has the most beautiful, haunting voice that I've heard in a decade. He's been compared to many artists, but is truly in a class of his own. For the people who claim that there are no longer any truly unique talents, Antony and the Johnsons have arrived. It's impossible to put this music in any catagory, but, if you like moody, soulful vocals and lyrics that are equally hopeful and depressing, this is the one for you.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Wes Anderson had it half right. Using the Sigur Ros song \\"Staralfur\\" to accompany a voyage into a watery, alien landscape in \\"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\\" seemed like an appropriate choice. Anderson probably reasoned that because Sigur Ros creates sounds that are otherworldly -- lead singer Jon Thor Birgisson warbles in a falsetto that approximates a lovesick, hermaphroditic extraterrestrial -- that the quartet's music would be ideal for a scene involving a Jacques Cousteau-inspired trip into an ocean of stop-motion animated mollusks. <br /> <br />So far, so good. But this was a happy scene (as far as Anderson can write and direct happy), and Sigur Ros does not make happy music. That does not change with the band's fourth album. But reading the tone of \\"Takk\\" (Geffen), it could be deduced that things have improved in the band's private universe. <br /> <br />Unlike 2002's ( ) the songs on \\"Takk\\" (which means \\"thank you\\" in Icelandic) have titles, are less meandering, and far less dense. Overall, the changes are subtle, and casual listeners who have been turned off by the band's experimental tone will be no more impressed by \\"Takk.\\" But Sigur Ros is a band that requires patience. The songs unfold at their own languorous pace, which often means eight or more minutes of plaintive layering. But with \\"Takk,\\" Sigur Ros takes tentative steps toward acknowledging the world that exists outside of its own head. \\"Se Lest,\\" which climaxes with a brass band playing a waltz, is a hypnotic series of wailing waves that crash exquisitely over a twinkling music box. <br /> <br />Any conjecture about the mood of the album is exactly that. The members of the band are maddeningly tight-lipped about their emotional state and the seeds of their inspiration. Lyrics also provide no clues, because what is not sung in Icelandic is sung in an imaginary language of phonetic gobbledygook. Since its inception in 1994, Sigur Ros has performed canorous emotions, not songs, and accepting theband's lack of musical structure is first frustrating, and subsequently exhilarating. <br /> <br />In the middle of the album's sprawling song cycle sits \\"Hoppipolla\\", perhaps the closest that Sigur Ros has gotten to a more conventional pop song. Internet message boards and optimistic critics will no doubt herald \\"Takk\\" as Sigur Ros's crossover to prog rock. <br /> <br />Thankfully, it is no such thing. Like all Sigur Ros albums, \\"Takk\\" is the soundtrack to a dreamy imaginary film that unfolds in a recording studio that was once an indoor swimming pool outside of Reykjavik. The lighter tone of the album has done little to minimize the pathos of the music. Side effects from repeated listening still include goose pimples and an eerie feeling of inner calm. But with ''Takk,\\" the list of Sigur Ros side effects now includes many moments of blissful euphoria. <br /> <br />

Buy the DELUXE VERSION, which has an extra live CD with the whole album live from a single concert plus Philadelphia Freedom and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting live.  The packaging is top rate, too.  The live album isn't just a mindless copying of the studio version.  Elton had a new band, which added a different feel to many of the songs.  It rocked a bit more (no strings, etc, because it was live).  The live album is a must-have, so don't  buy just the remaster!

0440238609|5.0|I read the whole trilogy straight-through after reading a glowing review by Christopher Hitchens in Vanity Fair. The books were on-par with The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. And there is the rub. The Dark Materials books were written in part as an atheist's response to the Narnia books. Pullman can barely disguise his contempt for Lewis, who is a hero of mine. The Narnia books have long been a staple for the education of Christian children, and bring to life for children the concepts of sin and grace. Tolkien too was a devout Catholic, whose books brim with Christianity. I will give Pullman his due. His books are beautifully written and are a thoughtful, though scathing, critique of Christianity. These books should be read by mature Christians, but to put them into the hands of immature minds who cannot yet read critically is not wise. Stick to Tolkien and Lewis for the children, and read these books yourself.

B0000214F0|5.0|Our parameters to define \\"crime\\" differ completely from its meaning 2 thousand years ago. Caligula and Nero, 2 emperors branded as \\"criminals\\" by the Christianity, could have been in reality an average product of these violent times.   Remember, the average Romans used to pay for the privilege of citizenship with half of their lives serving in the army and certainly dying in the war. And Rome was in war almost continuously for hundreds of years. I would indeed be surprised if all this would have not had any effect in the emperor's behavior. After all, life and death were nothing under the rule of Rome as well as another civilizations. Somehow life worth nothing even in our time of wars for resources, and I don't know if we, humankind, have learned anything from history.  War and slaughter are truly [...] and I doubt that sex is. Remember that soldier and [...] are the most ancient professions.  But coming back to this movie, I believe that most of the events shown here are true indeed. Sex, death, torture, etc were a normal currency in the Roman court as gladiator fighting and death was normal in the Coliseum's arena. Caligula added his personal \\"touch\\" to these events: the \\"head harvester\\" is so original and funny, gee, why didn't I think of this brilliant idea before? Did Mr. Guillotin invented his device based in the harvester? I think Caligula was both mad and smart despite other opinions in contrary. Naming his horse Senator! What a brilliant way to commit his crimes unquestioned by lousy senators. I have reasons to believe that the sex and brutalities portrayed by Tinto Brass were real. And the musical score by Prokopieff reinforced the idea that Caligula's mind was indeed both smart and sick, as it was the society that he ruled.  I recommend this controversial film to everyone over 18 and with an enough open mind to make an objective evaluation about the terrible events that may have occurred thousands of years ago.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This isn't their best album, but it still beats pretty much every other album i own. The guitar work is amazing, mikaels horrific growling and melodic singing are immense, the drums, the keys, the bass, its all superb! Very good lyrics. Bit of a mean story line to it, but it is opeth. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Looking forward to seeing them live now...! &lt;:-D
B00007KWHN|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this, amigo.  \\"The Yes Album\\" grabs you by the throat from the get-go with the galloping \\"Yours is No Disgrace,\\" a Steve Howe guitar workout that melds slow bluesy/trippy verses with fast-paced epic instrumental interludes. It clocks in at over 9 minutes of blistering intensity and noble beauty.<br /><br />Steve Howe offers basically a solo instrumental track with the Chet Atkins inspired \\"Clap,\\" which is a happy, jumping little number displaying his astonishing picking ability.  From there, Yes leaps back into cinematic mode with \\"Starship Trooper,\\" a slower paced, but majorly intense journey that stretches the senses with some heavy playing blended with lighter touches, all capped with a coda that rivals the Beatles \\"Hey Jude\\" for its repetitive, building payoff.<br /><br />The band's signature harmonies herald the opening of \\"I've Seen All Good People,\\" which is really a tale of two tunes...part one being an English folk ballad; the second a wailing rocking rave up.  The underrated, understated \\"A Venture\\" is the next song, which is sort of an atmospheric precusor to \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" on \\"Fragile\\" {at least, it reminds me of that}.  The album closes with \\"Perpetual Change,\\" which is a great, cracking rocker.<br /><br />The playing here is not as complex as the band would attempt on later albums, but it is certainly stunningly performed and incredibly arranged.  Whether it's for sentimental or artistic reasons, this is still my favorite Yes album release.  This \\"new edition,\\" with its much improved packaging and sound, plus bonus tracks, only gives the fans more to love.

B00003CXS4|5.0|Some people write in their reviews the movie is braindead, stupid and not funny at all. Well, it depends on what kind of humor you prefer. If you like Tarantino, Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie's \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\", films like \\"Thursday\\", \\"Get Shorty\\" and \\"Way of the Gun\\", then this opus is just for you. If you can't stand all of the listed above - just skip this one.<br />To my opinion \\"Snatch\\" is much better then previous Ritchie's work, more than that - it's one of the best criminal comedies. It's more criminal than others, it's more funny than others. Guy Ritchie actually did his best here and created an atmosphere of absurd, chaotic fun. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt is totally different from what we used to see, Dennis Farina is just soooo hilarious! Now I can't normally see him in other movies - I recall \\"Snatch\\" and begin to laugh hysterically.<br />The characters' lines are funny and the way they deliver them is even funnier. By the way it's one of the few films I had to watch with captions - I couldn't understand much of being said because of their cockney (if I'm not mistaken) accent.<br />Anyway if you like crazy criminal comedies - watch it without any question. If you don't - watch something else instead.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I have to caveat this review by saying that I wasn't familiar with the comic or graphic novels of this character.  That said, I really enjoyed the movie and felt that it blended historical and mythological themes regarding heaven and hell well.  The beginning when the primary relic that the film focuses on is found was particularly weak, however all of the characters had at least a few good moments with most of them being recognizable without being cliches.   <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves has more of an edge in playing John Constantine than in most of his previous efforts, but you'll still find yourself waiting for him to call for George Carlin pick him up in his transdimensional telephone booth ala \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\\"
B000067J1H|5.0|\\"Fight Club\\" is brutal. \\"Fight Club\\" is fun. \\"Fight Club\\" is romantic. \\"Fight Club\\" is philosophic. You'll find anything you want here. I think \\"Fight Club\\" was a pinnacle of David Fincher's career (we'll see). Some people got the movie's message wrong and thought that if you are bored with life - go and beat the [...] out of someone, receive a kick in the teeth yourself and you'll become happy. Everything is not that simple. The film tells us that there is more to life than your everyday breakfast-work-beer-bed schedule. People tend to escape from annoying routine and want something new. This movie is about searching. Searching something new. \\"Fight Club\\" is really cathartic - it gives the feeling of freedom, it gives hope, it gives the sense of deliverance from the weight we carry on our shoulders (everyone has his own).<br />The movie is entertaining and serious at the same time like other works of David Fincher (\\"Se7en\\" at least) so it's the perfect opportunity to have fun and food for thought in one film. Obviously not for the fans of mindless amusement.<br />I guess the two-disc edition is much better for it has a load of extra features, but it's hard to find nowdays.
630587493X|3.0|I first read \\"Bicentential Man\\" in college years ago and was moved by the powerful themes on what truly makes a person.  The movie skirts the surface of these thoughts but doesn't get into any of the characters enough nor is the theme sufficiently developed for any emotional attachment to be drawn to it by the end of the film.  Better acting than you'll find in most sci-fi movies today, however my less than positive review is definitely skewed downward because I read the book first.    It's worth a look if your a fan of science fantasy.

But I was wrong. This movie is just another Adam Sandler goofball movie. <br /> <br />Plot: Family Matters, Fat teen, Neglectful Parents, Relationships changes, etc.  <br /> <br />The Real Plot: Adam Sandler goofs around for about two hours, then makes fun of his fat daughter then trys to grope the mailman. <br /> <br />I thought the plot sucked. I hate the part when adam sandler wets himself, then crys and yells into the corner about how chris rock always got the best movie parts and how head of state was his idea. That part was kinda of depressing. Then there's other parts where i question the filmakers intenions. Like the part where Sandler runs into the middle of traffic and grabs his guitar and starts to sing the haunaka song part 3, then starts to make weird noises. Then he goes and falls into a river and yells at himslef for making 8 crazy nights.  <br /> <br />And that's just in the first hour.  <br /> <br />Trust me don't watch or rent this film. <br /> <br />This movie sould be called stupidity instead of Spanglish.  <br />
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Everyone is comparing this to their last cd, which was awesome, however, evolution of a band is expected and if you ask me this is a great step.  They cut back on the experimental \\"spacey\\" type influence and gone more straight forward rock and it is good!  People who haven't heard 30StM before this release will love the cd...the bad reviews are coming from a cd to cd comparison, however, I feel this one is just as good as their last, however different.  5 Stars!
0385513755|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time!  If you're in to mysteries and conspiracies, this book is perfect for you!  I highly recommend the illustrated version of this book, because much of the story relates to hidden messages and symbols in famous works of art...unless you're an art history buff, you'll probably want to see the symbols/messages for yourself, which are included only in this special illustrated edition.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This album clearly ellaborates on the contradiction of life as we see it and life as we wish it to be seen (i.e hapinesses, dissapointments, relationships). It seems to be an itinerant journey through the eyes of the writer. <br /> <br />Sonically, the beautiful arrangement of the guitar melodies (think an homage to The Cure, 'The Edge' from U2) give way to an edgier, hard rock, yet toneful distortion (think Deftones, Chevelle)and paint a visual canvas.  While being heavily produced it maintains a real modern and raw feel. Track number 11 is a great example of this.  <br /> <br />As a final track they have selected to do a cover of Bjork's Hunter... which is fabulous. I would think it would be a bit daunting to try and fill her shoes but Jared pulls it off in style! There is alot of emotion and passion that comes through in his singing style and this song is no exception. If for no other reason than to have this song on your playlist I recommend buying this album 'tout de suite! <br />
0553573403|4.0|I picked a paperback of this to read on the Banks instead of re-reading another volume of Tolkien's B-sides and loved it more than just about any contemporary fantasy fiction (\\"just about\\" is a nod primarily to Gaiman). The whole series up to date is a well-thought out and well-plotted multi-polar epic set in something like a Eurasia of X-XII centuries both stirred and shaken. The things I liked most about this novel have to do with elements of realism and relativism rather than fantasy per se. Just like in our own reality the best plans in this book oft go to waste, the smelly stuff regularly hits the fan, and nearly nothing is quite what it seems. Good does not necessarily triumphs over evil, and even if it does you sometimes can not tell the difference with all the blood flowing and body parts flying. Just like in our reality being honorable does not preclude one from untimely demise, actually - again just like in reality - often speeds up the process. I kinda like that - otherwise you get something like Harry Potter, where you know that nothing really is going to happen to the dude, lest the next book is called The Late Harry Potter... Lots of maihem, lots of sex - which is nice too, since I still never quite learned (having read all of the Tolkien's works) how exactly \\"orcs are multiplying\\"... Heroes do not have to go off on a quest somewhere to get their teeth kicked in - even if they just sit in one place somebody will try to get them. And again. And again. \\"Happily ever after\\" has a half-life of about two weeks in this book...<br /><br />Two small complaints - the Hollywood script-writing heritage pops its ugly head every now and then in a snappy one-liners, and even unpredictability eventually falls into a pattern when you can see where at least some things are going. But nevermind those, this book and the ones that follow it in the series still make for the titular Jolly Good Read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a sci-fi fan for a great many years and have been disappointed in the weak offerings from television probably since Max Headroom left the air.  A friend of mine introduced me to Firefly after it was released onto DVD.  The first five minutes of the pilot were enough to convince me that I loved the show.  The rest of the pilot convinced me this was the best sci-fi on television ever.  The production values and quality of writing make it one of the best shows of ANY kind, sci-fi or not! <br /> <br />Though I call it sci-fi, don't let that deter you if that's not your thing.  The show is a beautiful fusion of many genres, with a style and a wit all its own.  An example:  my father is so-so at best on the science fiction front, but likes Firefly for the gutsy humor and the Western flavor. <br /> <br />Give it try.  I'm 99.5% convinced you'll like it!  The other 0.5% are just crazy...
B00005JODA|4.0|There have been nifty thrillers over the years with conspiracy attached, and many of them have been good like The Parallax View and JFK.  Yet few of these have been able to rise above the visceral angst of suspense and intrigue to attain another level of human emotion.  One good example is the recent adaptation of John Le Carre's novel, The Constant Gardener.  Adapted by Jeffrey Caine and directed by Fernando Meirelles, this is a superior cinematic rendition of a good, moral suspense yarn told with methodical precision and emotional resonance. <br /> <br />Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is a volunteer-activist who marries timid diplomat, Justin Qualye (Ralph Fiennes) and follows him to Kenya in Africa.  When his wife goes missing, Justin decides to follow his wife's trail and find out what really happened and why.  The clues lead to a pharmaceutical drug corporation that is testing tuberculosis drugs on the lower class population.  What Justin finds is a shocking conspiracy of secrets and lies reaching up to the British government and a corporate entity that will stop at nothing to release its money making windfall.  As Justin discovers the truth, he begins to understand the ruthless nature of conspirators even as he begins to uncover the truth about his marriage. <br /> <br />This is a chilling mystery story that is at its heart a tale of romantic love between a man and a wife he really doesn't know.  Although not perfect, it does endeavor to be many things, and it integrates the love story that forms the soul of the film with an elaborate detective story that touches upon morality, fear, hope, and redemption and achieves them quite well.  It's like reading a long, complex novel. That a film could be filled with so many attributes is quite an achievement and a  testament to the source material by Le Carre, a constant source of complex, filmic material ever since the breakout adaptation of his The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in the 1960's.  It is also a tribute to directorMeirelles who has a sure hand in every scene and edit while never losing track of his many themes and maintaining strong performances from his talented cast. <br /> <br />At first Justin is oblivious to the insidious forces around him.  The garden that he tends to is a metaphor of sorts to a basic, uncomplicated view of his world that is suddenly shaken. The backgrounds in many scenes show a rural countryside with poor people struggling to survive.  Life is hard for the people in a harsh landscape.  There are always incidental shots of children usually in the background as casual bystanders or observers; they are the innocent ones. This story and its people are distant cousins of the drug gangs in Meirelles' previous, breakthrough film, City of God.  It is in this setting that Justin retraces Tessa's footsteps which lead to a dirty secret and a rediscovery of their love.  Throughout it all, there is an almost inevitable, hopeless feeling, like a stacked deck against Justin.  Then there is the question of trust.  Who to trust?  It seems everyone is either partly involved with the bad guys or reluctant to get involved.  There are different levels of trust.  There is the hint of marital infidelity and the questioning of loyalty.  In this respect, The Constant Gardener reminds one of the underrated Under Fire.   <br /> <br />The narrative fluidly flashes back and forth at will to show the beginnings of Justin and Tessa's relationship amid the intrigue in Kenya.  There's also lots of handheld camera work (Cesar Charlone) that gives the film a semi documentary feel.  While the look is raw and primitive, the editing (by Oliver Stone alumni Claire Simpson) is sophisticated and clever as various bits of associative imagery are connected to great emotional and informative effect.  A great deal of thought and planning went into this story and its adaptation to connect the dots.  <br /> <br />Fiennes is excellent as the beleaguered husband who seeks the truth about his wife.  He has a knack for playing tragic characters (Quiz Show, The English Patient), and he has never been better than in this role.  You feel his confusion and pain as he goes against difficult odds.  Rachel Weisz is terrific as the brave crusader of the African people who risks harm and her marriage by digging for the truth.  You feel her passion in Tessa's character and the free spirit that dominates every scene she is in. You just know that Tessa's own hard-headed agenda will get her in trouble.  It is a far cry from Weisz's days in action blockbusters like The Mummy, and it is her best role to date.  The rest of the uniformly strong cast is excellent particularly Bill Nighy as the slimy Pellegrin.   <br />  <br />If you are a conspiracy buff, then this is your kind of film.  Although it is a bit of a downer, ultimately it is a haunting fable with memorable imagery, and it is a film that stays with you long after it is over.  It should stay with Oscar voters for the long term as well. <br />
B00000J7A2|5.0|Early Beef, not much like his later stuff, and many times better than what follows.  'Electricity' makes the cd worth buying all by itself--the Theremin part is pure genius and, meshed with Van Vliet's vocals and the Magic Band instruments, there's nothing that  can equal it.  And the rest of the album ain't bad, either, but it could do without the crappy bonus tracks.  Tracks 1-12 are great.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|The original GHOSTBUSTERS and GHOSTBUSTERS 2 are great films, and the DVD packages are done well, but something is missing again in this new gift set.  This reviewer had hoped the producers of this package would include the original Ray Parker Jr. music video that contrubuted to the success of the film back in 1984. It wasn't included on either of the original DVD releases of the individual films. The music video itself was hilariously great and the song was a top ten hit. One of the highlights of the video is near the end as Ray Parker Jr and the four Ghostbusters (Bill Murray,Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson) are dancing down New York City's Times Square. The music video includes clips from the film, and the appearances from the likes of Peter Falk, the late John Candy, Carly Simon, Chevy Chase,Terri Garr,George Wendt,Danny Devito, Melissa Gilbert and Al Franken (all of who don't appear on in the movie). It's a shame because it would have made the DVD set a complete package and a worthy timecapsule.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't able to keep up with the show when it first came out Fox, but from the few I saw, I really enjoyed it. At least enough to go out and buy the box set.  Probably one of the best buys I've made, because the depth of the show and its characters is amazing.  Each crew member from Serenity brings different qualities and as a crew, you can see them struggling to find themselves and to just survive.  Firefly's got a great combination of action, drama, and comedy.  There are some great, serious, touching moments and then some of the highest of high comedy.  Any scene with Jayne in it is bound to be funny.     <br /> <br />I'm pretty sad that once I finish the DVD set, I can't look forward to more seasons, but at least Serenity is coming to the big screen.  I hope it gets enough good reviews to get Fox to consider reupping the series.   <br /> <br />Anyways, give the DVD set a look.  It's well worth it.

One mom thanked me because her son who hated to read, started to like reading because of this book.
B0001EKZOQ|2.0|Aside from the fine quality of the musicianship all around on this CD, it's not for me. I really can't stand the juxtoposition of the two main styles- Cuban bolero and Spanish flamenco. For me, bolero calls for such sweet melancholy, and flamenco singing does not evoke that: in this mix it just sounds tortured. Kudos for the effort, always worth trying, but to me it's not listenable. And most critics and audiences disagree with me anyway!
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Clive Cussler's popular series of novels featuring the character of Dirk Pitt have been around for many years but never turned into movies because the author has always maintained tight control over them. He somehow let his guard down (reportedly promised that the film would be a faithful adaptation of his book) and allowed Hollywood to adapt Sahara into a big budget action/adventure film starring Matthew McConaughey as Pitt in 2005.<br /><br />Sahara trots out the usual archetypes: Pitt is the dashing hero; Al is his comic relief sidekick with the Eva as the plucky love interest. The chemistry between McConaughy and Zahn is good and feels authentic. They play well off each other even if their characters never transcend their stereotypes. McConaughy proves to be a credible action hero firmly in the Indiana Jones tradition while Zahn is spot-on with his comic timing and is as watchable as ever. Alas, there is zero chemistry between McConaughy and Cruz who looks lost in this movie. To her credit, she has little to work with.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner. Lines like, \\"our methodology for shooting this scene...\\" are typical of this technically-oriented track. Eisner comes off as a little dry but his comments are worth a listen if you want the nitty gritty details of how this film was put together.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary with Eisner and actor/executive producer Matthew McConaughy. There is a nice, conversational tone to this track as the two men tell many anecdotes of filming.<br /><br />\\"Across the Sands of Sahara\\" is a featurette on the long journey to get this movie made.<br /><br />\\"Visualizing Sahara\\" examines how every scene was extensively storyboarded but was sometimes changed once on location or when someone would come up with a good idea.

B000A6T1HC|4.0|This may be the best Bartoli CD in recent years!!! No recent album of her thrilled me like this new one. I have the feeling of already being catched by the CD's arias and that didn't happen with the Salieri, Gluck, etc, albums, despite their obvious beauty.<br /><br />For the voice, this album reminds me of the sheer energy of Rossini Heroines.<br /><br />So why my 4 stars? Never seen such ugly pictures of her! Were they making a pic of her nostrils, or what?

So having said that purchasing this album and having a few listens to it I'm in transition to being a fan.  Good stirring but also haunting music that has found a home in the CD stacker to keep me company on long road trips.  A recommended buy.
6304936362|4.0|This is the Hollywood version of how Hollywood attempted to promote the first B-17 crew to survive 25 missions.  The PR guy just doesn't have the picture about the stress of war but catches on through the movie.  Memphis Belle is a good effort and the technical stuff and acting are good but it somehow lacks spirit.  For the collector, it is a good addition.  If you want THE WW2 bombing film, get Twelve O'clock High.
B00007B8PF|5.0|Perhaps they just don't like Americans, or perhaps they just horde the stuff to themselves. Either way there still is no proper way to get a whole bunch of early AC/DC tracks without buying the Australian imports.<br /><br />Not like its the best stuff or anything but WE ARE CURIOUS man.<br /><br />I've heard lots of it thru various sources.<br /><br />This version of HIGH VOLTAGE is the actual debut from AC DC. Virtually NOTHING like the American release. The only two songs that are on both are LITTLE LOVER and SHES GOT BALLS.<br /><br />Now pretty much all of the first four or five AC DC albums are different in Australia then in the rest of the world. This one however is the biggest difference. The album is completley different.  Way mor bluesy. I really like it. I know in the old days record companies did this stuff, but that was like thirty years ago. Four of these songs can be found on U.S 74 JAILBREAK but the song LOVE SONG was never released in the U.S. Can you believe that?<br /><br />The American version is really called TNT in Australia. It was changed to High Voltage then stripped of a few tracks and combined with the two from this release. The two cuts taken from there are ROCKER (however that is available on U.S DIRTY DEEDS) and SCHOOL DAYS (I still have yet to hear that peice.)<br /><br />I CANT BELIVE IT, and 74 Jailbreak is like twenty minutes long. They could have easily fit all these lost songs on one vinyl let alone one CD. They got JAILBREAK (the one that was left off of U.S DIRTY DEEDS)but heres what they missed.<br /><br />LOVE SONG (aus high volt)<br /><br />SCHOOL DAYS (aus TNT)<br /><br />ROCK IN PEACE (aus DIRTY DEEDS)<br /><br />CRABSODY IN BLUE (aus LET THERE BE ROCK)<br /><br />The imports are all available at Amazon. They Aussie imports of Dirty Deeds and Let There Be Rock have different album covers.<br /><br />Why complain? Nobody cares.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|This is one of the most far fetched & unrealistic movies i've ever seen. It seemed more like a Disney kids adventure movie. The talent of Matt McConaughey & Penelope Cruz is completely wasted. Steve Zahn ruins the movie with his typical idiotic performance & stupid one line attempts at humor. A good one to miss.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I used to HATE Radiohead.  I never understood it, thought they were boring, and overrated.  But I had to know what it was that friends of mine went on and on about, so I picked up OK Computer to give it a try.<br /><br />After listening to all the way through, I found a few songs catchy (Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Karma Police).  I didn't pick the album back up for a couple months just assuming they were okay.  Then, one night on a road trip with a friend, a friend of mine had Radiohead playing, and he started to point out all these things I didn't notice before.<br /><br />I went home and gave them, once more, another try.  And I loved it.  It started to get clearer with every listen, all the things I was too impatient or careless enough to really hear had passed me by every other time.<br /><br />Now it's one of my favorite albums and I own all of their CD's now.  My favorites on the album are Subterranean Homesick Alien, Fitter Happier, Exit Music, and Electioneering.  OK Computer is clever electro-art-prog-rock disguised to keep out all the pseudo-fans and ones who \\"don't get it.\\"<br /><br />This is the album to start with.
014118213X|3.0|If you are only going to read one novel by Forster, this is not the one. Instead of a cohesive plot, \\"Howards End\\" consists of a series of aphorisms loosely strung together by a rambling plot. The characters themselves are not particularly interesting, and the issues that Forster chose to focus on (Socialism v. Capitalism, Women's Suffrage, etc.) are dated and of little interest today.<br /><br />The aphorisms themselves are interesting and perceptive, but reading them has a jarring effect on one's enjoyment of the novel, since they literally appear on every page, often several times.<br /><br />A far better novel is \\"A Passage to India,\\" which deals with timeless themes (although within a contemporary context), and offers a more structured plot and more interesting characters. This seems to be the generally accepted view, although the Vintage paperback edition of \\"Howards End\\" does quote Lionel Trilling (the leading expert on Forster) as being of the opinion that \\"'Howard's End' is undoubtedly Forster's masterpiece.\\" One suspects that this quote was taken out of context.<br /><br />For pure enjoyment, I liked \\"A Room With a View\\" best. It reads smoothly, and for anyone who has visited Florence, will bring back happy memories.

This song alone is nothing short of a face melter.<br /><br />NIGHT CRAWLER and TOUCH OF EVIL are my two favorites.<br /><br />Its not as memorable of an album as say BRITISH STEEL, but compared to anything that happened after 1982, its very strong. Very solid. SO if you already have a Judas Priest well that seems to be drying up, this is a good place to go next.<br /><br />MAKE SURE YOU HAVE: BRITISH STEEL, SAD WINGS OF DESTINY, STAINED CLASS, and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I am not, nor have been a gig anime fan. But this movie is so brilliantly created. The story is great and so imaginative. For any mucis lover, especially one who likes to groove, get lost in the beat,or really experience music - this is somethign you want to own -- and watch over and over again. It's even great if you have company and you just want some good tunes and something interesting on the screen.
0792833201|5.0|Poltergeist is a all time classic horror film that has its surprizes within the movie!!!!!! It stars the talented Heather O' Rouke and Jobeth Williams!!!!! A family moves in a house that was built over a cemetery which brings the family a whole bunch of ghosts!!!! Only Carol Anne can see and hear the ghosts,because they come in their tv!!!!!! This movie is a classic and it was nice to see a horror film that was dealing with the supernatural instead of those other horror films which involved killing and gore!!!!!!! If you haven't seen this movie then you need to rent it sometime and i would put it in any movie collection,because like i say its a horror classic!!!!!!!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is one of those albums that the first time you listen to it you'll declare it to be crap. But, like all the best albums, you need to hear it multiple times in order to grok it. Many of the songs are so fragile (ha ha) that they sound as if they are about to shatter. Lyrically Reznor has aged, and astonishingly, unlike most artists, his music still speaks to me. No longer about teen angst, it seems to speak more to some of the more barren aspects of adulthood. Just stay away from the DVD-CD album. It doesn't play in many players being of an odd thickness. You should buy the record anyways.

B00026WU7I|5.0|I think Bob Dylan is the man and I like this record. Its no way his best. Most deppressing? Probably. I guess in the mid seventies people were really into soft music that made you want to slit your wrists. Dylan himself always asked how people could find such enjoyment in an album of his PAIN. Oh well, every song is worthy of some credit I will admit.<br /><br />TANGLED UP: Awesome song. I knew a red head who I gave this song to. I wonder if her hair is still red?<br />SIMPLE TWIST: I have had some sad and lonely nights when this disc IS crucial, mainly for this song.<br />BIG GIRL NOW: Oh christ, get out the razors....<br />IDIOT WIND: I do like this bit. Sometimes Dylan just really rips into his subject matter with extreme bitterness. Its great.<br />LONESOME WHEN YOU GO: Probably my least favorite on the album.<br />MEET ME IN THE MORNING: Cool song. Allright lyrics by DYlan stature, nothing amazing.<br />LILLY,ROSEMARY: I really enjoy this song a lot. One hell of a story, and a great way to lighten things up a bit. Probably my most favorite on this disc.<br />IF YOU SEE HER: ok<br />SHELTER FROM THE STORM: The live version on HARD RAIN is a million times better. Good stuff though.<br />BUCKETS OF RAIN: yeah, this is good too.<br /><br />I don't know how people could listen to this all the time without offing themselves but it is a GREAT disc. Just my least favorite of the countless DYLAN masterpeices.<br /><br />If you want a REALLY GREAT DYLAN you should get into LOVE AND THEFT, Dylans 2001 release, which truly is amazing. It won't make you want to die either.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Cannibal teens, psychotic hookers, talking dead bodies, yellow skinned child rapists, and a disfigured psycho with an affinity for trench coats. The third corner of hell? No, it's all mundane in Sin City, thus is the oddities presented in the Frank Miller created series of graphic novels. Miller set forth a legacy in 1991 when he created a series of incomparable visionary graphic novels called \\"Sin City\\" which had no superheroes, no intergalactic madmen, and no demonic entities, only the horror of mankind and the back alleys of the worst city in the world. Miller created a dark grim neo-noir series that would forever be revered among comic book creators, and when this movie was set to release, I never read any of the issues. While, being a hardcore comic geek I was aware of Sin City, I had never read the novels, and I bought them as soon as possible, and I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps it's something within mankind the series reflects, taboos that Miller tackles within the smoky haze, never-ending darkness, and introversion amidst the heroes whom are constantly teetering over to the dark side to justify the means. <br /> <br />One thing Frank Miller mastered with this series was though the books basically examined evil men fighting evil men, you could easily distinguish which people were fighting for a good cause and which people weren't. \\"Sin City\\" is an amazing series of comic books with incredible stories of crime and vengeance and director Robert Rodriguez presents a 99 percent accurate depiction in his adaptation of the hit series. Rodriguez sacrificed a lot for the sake of converting the series to the big screen and having Miller along with him directing at his side, they created one incredible piece of filmmaking that will surely become a classic. For years, even to this day, pretentious bookworms still like to refer to comic books as nothing but a kids medium with nothing to add to intellect or even imagination, but Miller basically proved them wrong turninga kids medium into an versatile medium with series and stories worthy of literature. <br /> <br />Sin City is not for kids, and as evident by the R rating, Rodriguez does not shy away from the violent content featured so prominently in the book. For people who have yet to read the books, they'll be disgusted and simply offended by the violent content featured, but the violent content does manage to bear a relevance in the books presenting the grim atmosphere present only in noir. And perhaps the most annoying of the crowd of skeptics and critics are the neo-feminists who basically dismissed this movie as sexist and misogynistic to women when basically men are depicted basically the same way. Women are hookers, lesbians, and sadomasochists, men are rapists, child molesters, killers, and abuse women. See how it all evens out Ms. L.S. from a certain Entertainment magazine? Well, they're basically wrong, and ignorant in their ways. Childish, ain't I? <br /> <br />Rodriguez along with Miller at his side manages to capture the mood perfectly for the book with everything from the comic books adapted on the screen with pin point accuracy, and this comic book fan is pleased. I loved the series, and was satisfied to see Rodriguez stuck true to the source material featuring a world comprised mostly of computer generated effects but manages to accurately capture the mood and dark atmosphere in which the tales take place. The story is set with three segments, all intertwined with one another to make the fluid story of Sin City, all of which is topped off with an amazing all-star cast of actors including Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and many other people from Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro right down to the bad-ass Powers Boothe, all of which are mixed in the tale of Sin City; and all of the dramatic operas are about vengeance and revenge, not to mention the great opening, and closer, which was the first time I actually enjoyed seeingJosh Hartnett on screen. I'd have to devote a list to the number of stars who appeared in this film, but it is surely an ensemble piece that even made Jaime King look talented! That's a feat in itself that Rodriguez and Miller accomplish. <br /> <br />The entire cast gives excellent performances and a few performances basically stood out for me, especially a certain Mickey Rourke who is just bad ass as the disfigured Marv who is framed for killing the only girl who ever loved him, and then there's Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson whom are just great in their segment. The most dramatic of the segments is left for last starring Bruce Willis as retired cop John Hartigan who nearly kills the senator's son, who happens to be a child killer, and is framed for the crime. The segment includes three good performances from Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and Nick Stahl who plays bad so, so good. I wish he were the villain more often. The movie, which has been compared to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (I love the books but that comparison is a bit of a hyperbole, and I'm not even a Tarantino fan), is one of the best comic book movies ever made, simply because it keeps the original quality of the book while losing none of the cache from the stories and never compromises Miller's artistic integrity which Hollywood would have originally done, and Rodriguez as always gives some amazing direction. <br /> <br />The storyboards for the film consisted of pages from the actual comic used, and it's like taking scenes from a movie on to a new movie. Miller always prided himself in being a rebel. Having had many bad experiences with Hollywood, he declared that he'd make his books like movies, and the man is brilliant. Read his work on Daredevil, Batman, and this series, and you shall see. You shall see, my friend. Miller is like a movie director who never was. If studio execs, my mortal enemy, hadn't jerked this guy around, he would have made an amazing director, and it took Rodriguez, anotherHollywood stalwart to see that. It takes brilliance to notice brilliance, and Rodriguez did much of the movie's work in his own home studio and really managed to pack a wallop of the movie for fans of both comics and noir, and Rodriguez doesn't alienate non-comic book fans, he invites people to bask in the excellence that is Sin City, but he does something some studios have yet to do, he honors the fans in the process. Seriously, I can discuss this movie forever, but I'll spare you the extra reading. <br /> <br />Hot chicks, big guns, bad ass bruisers, what more could you ask for? This is neo-noir for the new millennium baby, and one of the best comic book movies ever made that noir fans will also really enjoy. Yes, the line above was clich, but I don't care, this movie rocked with excellent performances, great stories, great direction, and just a hip style that hasn't been achieved since \\"Pulp Fiction\\". This movie kicks Hollywood in the nuts, and I hope they felt that.
0393035158|1.0|After five pages I put this book in my box of books to be sold to the used bookstore. The author would like to reduce our \\"war on terrorism\\" to a fight among religious fanatics--which is a joke. The Russians and Chinese have agreed to try to defuse the terrorism factor in the world and the first thing they emphasized was that problem was not a religious one, but due to politics. Just as in the United States, the Islam leaders use religion to encite their fighters. Read Howard Zinn

B00005QXDD|4.0|The band is Tenacious D, this being their first album it is also named TENACIOUS D. It could fall into the genre of rock and that is generally where i put it. When you listen you hear the great and hysterical lyrics of Jack Black and the guitar playing of his brother Kyle Gass. I'd have to say that it is definately one of my favorite bands. I would recommend this band to anyone who is looking for music that doesnt have to be taken seriously. some of their best tracks are \\"tribute,\\" \\"wonderboy,\\" and \\"FHG.\\" The music  does hve some language that parents wouldnt enjoy their kids listening to, but if your not a kid with controlling parents it's a great band. This is their first album so its hard to compare with other works, but they have released their dvd set that has all of their songs presented in concert and it has short videos and the HBO specials that they made.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul Mccartney's albums sound lightweight at first, then a couple of years later you love them.  This album is an exception.  It sounded great the very first time I listened.  Say what you want, naysayers, Paul McCartney is the most popular and talented musician on our planet, and this album is prime Paul.

This is a movie I heard rumblings about for some time now, and it sounded great-I like revenge movies alot. However, it is so much more. AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COST! Just go and rent, or preferably, buy the dvd and watch it yourself. The less you know going in, the better. The ending-Oh, the ending! Films known for their twist endings in the past are absolutely nothing compared to the twist in this one! I promise you will be left thinking about it for a good while afterwards.
B00006AFUR|3.0|the first time i heard 30stm was on one of those cable music choice channels & i listened to it for a few seconds & thought that sounds ok. So i bought the cd used & I am very surprised at how much i like it. a very high level of production (i would guess the singer being a movie star they could afford it) Some quirky weird lyrics (Mary was a different girl she had a thing for astronauts) lend to the space age feel even if they will not hold up over time as great songwriting. The new song i heard on the radio sounds very close to \\"shudder\\" emo. I wonder if the new cd will be a letdown i guess i'll have to read some reviews.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|It amazes me to see just how far Sigur Ros can go with their music. When they first started out back in 1997, their music was mainly ambient and didn't really have any structure. Then with the Agaetis Byrjun album, they actually started writing songs with actuall structures (Quite great songs, by the way). 3 years later, they came out with the dark masterpiece that is (), which used a lot of drones and strings. Now, they come out with their newest album Takk..., which is by far the most accomplished Sigur Ros album to date. It just feels like a natural progression from their last album. As much as I was a fan of (), I was hoping that they would be able to top it. Of course, they succeded in all levels. In many ways, it's a return to their first two albums. The opener, Takk..., is much like the opener to Agaetis Byrjun, and the first actuall song, Glosoli, is not too far from the format of Olsen Olsen (sweet pretty melody followed by a rush of sound at the end). However, it's a different rush of sound than on Olsen Olsen. Where as that song had a full symphony, the song is washed in distorted guitar. It's quite a treat. The next song, Hoppipolla, is another great song, like something out of a very sad movie. Meo Blodnasir continues the melody of the last song and puts in a few suprises too. Se Lest is the only dissapoment on the album, as the song, while still having a good melody and a different range of instruments, seems to meander with no real goal. Saeglopur continues the album's winning streak with a powerful string and percussion section. Milano is sheer beauty, and it's great to hear Jonsi's high pitched singing during the loud parts. It's a real treat that hopefully will be played live. Gong is the best song on the album, though, with it's haunting string opening, electronic beat, and the best singing Jonsi has done to date. The next song, Andvari, melts the previous song in a wash of strings, keyboards, and soft vocals. It is very reminescient of the softer moments of (). The last two songs, Svo Hljott and Heysatan, are in the veins of (). The first being another soft-loud treatment done very very well, and the last song being a quiet ballad not unlike the soft verses of Untitled 1 from ().

B000669GAI|1.0|Why do we need this.  It's not like the band hasn't made their material (studio and live) readily available to their fans.  Is this release just to harvest the last holdouts who don't really appreciate the band but want to have a few morsels to enjoy occasionally.
0425180638|5.0|I am truly hooked to this series, Cromwell brings it all home in this  one. Lucy opens this business and from the start you know it's going to take off from the first paragraph.  I once again finished this book in one sitting. I can't help falling in love with Marino and  the \\"doc\\". I can't wait to see how all this comes together in the end, truly a book you're going to love.

B000AL730O|5.0|i really think if the beatles would exist today this is how an album of them would sound. 'fine line' and 'english tea' look like a lennon/mccartney song. when you hear 'friends to go' it really looks like a harrison song. the whole cd is brilliant not much people can pull it of at the age that mccartney has. <br />but he has proved he still has te magic he had in beatles and wings. if you are looking for good music like the beatles or want to hear something new of the beatles this is the cd to get. <br />mccartney is the greatest, i think he deserves a little more respect so go and buy chaos and creation in the backyard.  <br />dont burn it!, dont copy it! buy it its really the greatest since i guess abbey road
B000AL730O|5.0|I have read about a hand full of reviews on the internet and about 10-15 on this site about this album. Most of the \\"Critics\\" are not to fond of this album. I really don't know what they are talking about, this album is great it has some really good tunes on it. I a realy big fan of Flaming Pie and Run Devil Run but I really hated Driving Rain it didn't do anything for me, it was one of the wrost albums i've heard in awhile but thats not what i'm hear to review. This album like i said is great it has some superb songs on it and some even remind me of some late Beatles tunes. Fine Line, English Tea, Promise to you girl, and Anyway are the tops in my book. The only thing about this album is that it may take a few listens to really get behind the music. Just remember when you put this guy down and say his stuff is no good or the well has dried up, hes the greatest singer songwriter we have seen in history, the most successful Beatle out of the bunch and has almost 100 top 50 hits under his wings. No pun intended. I am going to see him in October and i can't wait to hear Fine Line and maybe some other songs form this album. All in all i think if you do buy it take a couple of listens to it before you write a review. Cheers <br /> <br /> <br />The only thing that killed me on this Album is that I couldn't put this CD on my ipod for a guy whos worth about 770m pound you think he doesnt need all that extra money. But what can you do
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I can't understand how some reviews can dismiss the music of this album. <br /> <br />The concept of the album almost drove me away.  I couldn't imagine how Sufjan could pull it off.  Based on the reviews I read, I didn't really know what to expect.  Anyway, when I played \\"Illinois\\" I was totally blown away...and it wasn't the theme or the hype that did it:  It _WAS_ the music. <br /> <br />\\"Come on feel the Illinoise!\\" resonates a sort of from start to finish.  Sufjan Stevens links styles and sets both sparse and intricately involved arrangments to bring forth one of the best albums I've heard this year. <br /> <br />This album draws you in and keeps you fixated throughout.
B000AARKOO|5.0|You can always count on Ridley Scott for unparalleled cinematography and this movie is no exception; but, what many reviewers miss are are the overriding messages in the film.  These include the mad futility of war, manipulation of religion for less than principled purposes, the bloodthirstiness some are capable of (that continues to this day) and the ability of others to rise above retribution or revenge. <br /> <br />I found the movie striking and moving, and with powerful messages. It was worth a second showing for me and I'll buy the DVD for my collection.
B000001F26|4.0|I bought this disc used for a great price and it is more than worth it.  It gives me a Clapton fix when I need it and delivers a great group of his songs/hits.  If I want more, I know there are other albums with Clapton that will fill the void that this album leaves but I have no problem with this one.  If you are a Clapton disciple, you might buy this one but you'll surely own much more, too.  If you just need a jolt of Clapton, grab this one.

I wasn't even aware that she was showing the original score version, and at first thought she had a bought a bootleg version.   <br />I Loved It! It has a totally different texture with the original score. <br /> <br />What a lot of people don't realize is that there were several versions that came out on cable.

0765340798|4.0|The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, trilogy takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the sixth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's young son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually after sixty-five years brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) then Abulurd and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak. In the final story the pieces start to come together that were the basis for Dune some ten thousand years later as the groundwork is laid for the Harkonnen/Atriedes feud as well as the space guild and mentats<br /><br />As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.<br /><br />I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is ambitious so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.<br /><br />As a reader it seems to be in vogue to criticize this trilogy but as a writer I can tell you that these authors did a wonderful job of juggling this very complex story and telling the story without being confusing. Personally I am in awe of their accomplishment.<br /><br />I suggest that you read this with an open mind and don't pre judge these books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The bottom line is this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre.but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.  <br /> <br />I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read.

B00001QEE9|5.0|The one-two whammy of audience and critical indifference to \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Fantasia\\" killed Walt Disney's desire to experiment with the limits of animation in the 1940s. From then on, play it safe was his motto. This may be one of the greatest tragedies to beset popular American culture in the 20th century; despite the depths of pretension and kitch in \\"Fantasia,\\" it was at least evidence of a spirited mind in pursuit of the unattained -- but \\"Pinocchio\\" must have broken old Walt's heart. There are visual effects in this movie that remained unchallenged until the digital age, and it's worth recalling that every single one of them was drawn by hand. It has one of the most beautiful and exciting musical scores in the history of the movies (I can't hear Cliff Edwards' high, pure falsetto holding that final note of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" without chills), a deeply plangent sense of emotion that never tips over into bathos, and a wealth of detail that is still staggering after 65 years. But it may be too dark a movie to attain the popularity of more cheerful Disney cartoons like \\"Snow White\\" -- although even that one can frighten the tots. Now: where is the double-disc Special Platinum Edition???

B000A3DFZE|1.0|What is goin' on here? Thank God, I did not buy this pitiful attempt of music. My poor friend did buy it and asked me to listen, I told him it might serve better as a coaster for his beer glass so his wife doesn't get upset for leaving rings on the furniture. What is Clapton doing? I believe in the past ten yrs he has been steeped in banality, but this offering is horrific. Please listen to The Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton for a true understanding of this man's brilliance. Layla for some of his best songwriting and vocal phrasings. I never thought I could ever think this,let alone express it, but Mr. Clapton PLEASE put away your guitar until you once again discover inspiration, you are embarrassing yourself and tarnishing your legacy. It breaks my heart to make these comments, but at least my friend's wife will be happy. Peace.

But any doubts about the potential legitimacy of the comic book as an art form were thoroughly expelled by the end of the first page.<br /><br />The artwork, while not the best I've seen, is more than passable. The point of Watchmen, of course, is the narrative, and the impressive manner in which Moore evokes the little touches of this would-be alternate history.<br /><br />The writing is superb. Not 'for a graphic novel', not 'better than I expected.' The writing is superb even measured against most actual pieces of non-graphic fiction. The prose is not as dense or as taken to exposition as that of the typical novel; this is, after all, a kind of a comic book. Nonetheless, it is great and broad in its language and feel for the characters. Most impressively, you are virtually guaranteed to reference Watchmen for the rest of your life after having read it. Not many Spiderman tomes can say that.<br /><br />I've seen other trade paperbacks I liked, even some that I found to be profound. But Watchmen is the only one that has stayed with me.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I admit that I was a little upset when I heard about the enhancements made to the DVDs before the release.  I realized, though, that these movies, changes or not, were my childhood and are still a big part of my life.  When I got the DVDs, I was pleased that the changes (outside of Hayden's appearence as a ghost) didn't really affect the experience.  Sure, Han still doesn't shoot first, but at least they made it a Leone-style shootout rather than the travesty that was in the Special Edition, and even though Hayden Christensen is now the ghost of Anakin Skywalker at the end of Jedi, it doesn't change how emotionally satisfying the end is.  The clarity of the video and audio, while still not perfect (rumor has it that Lucas rushed Lowry Digital to make the release date), is the most crisp the movies have ever been.  Now that they are in digital format, they can clean them up even more without worry of deterioration. <br />I have always been a Star Wars fan since age 7, and nothing was more satisfying than actually having the original trilogy on DVD in my hands.  These were my movies, changes or not.  So what if Greedo is a bad shot, Jabba's digitized form in A New Hope still looks a little anemic, and Hayden is a ghost?  Star Wars is Star Wars, be it the original releases, the Special Editions, or the DVDs.  It will always be worth buying.  It will always be worth watching over and over again.  Without these movies, pop culture, as well as the lives of many people, would be drastically different.  Owe it to yourselves to pick this up and enjoy it for what it has always been, a culturally-significant experience and a sensory explosion.  Long live that galaxy far, far away.  May it never dissipate.
B000002P5W|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix Experience's second album, \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" shows the group taking a more sophisticated approach, using their studio time very effectively to produce some beautiful tunes, and ultimately express Hendrix's outstanding skill as a musician, both in his lyricism and guitar playing.<br /><br />Of course, Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell contribute to this album greatly as well. Mitchell's fierce drum runs are essential, and groovy as are Redding's groovy bass lines and his album contribution entitled \\"She's So Fine\\". \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" has many different sounds throughout and as The Hendrix Experience take a route towards some very energetic rockers, as well as dark melodies, which generally show that Hendrix was a sensational(and very underrated) songwriter.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\" is a deep, moving rhythm with formidable lyricism and a rather impressive vocal from Hendrix. \\"You Got Me Floatin'\\" and \\"Ain't No Telling\\" are both in the same vain, relatively hard hitters, with catchy choruses and strong rocking guitar riffs. \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" is maybe the heaviest song Hendrix ever composed in his lifetime, a thrash of blasting metal with a grueling solo, which is an obvious album highlight. For the most artistic tracks, you can look to \\"Little Wing\\", a popular number from Hendrix with a very familiar tune. \\"If 6 Was 9\\" is a great, relatively lengthy track. The self-titled song ends the album exceptionally well, with fantastic musicianship from the crew and very clean, beautiful solo from Hendrix to finish.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" is another essential along with the other two studio albums from The Jimi Hendrix Experience. It is very difficult to pick which one is the best, since they all explore different styles of music. This album seems to be Hendrix at his most artistic, while offering some of his best lyricism. Recommended along with any other selections from the Hendrix catalog.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Despite being one of the greatest living songwriters and despite haven proven time and time again his virtuosity and craftmanship, Paul McCartney's new material is always greeted by critics and fans with some skepticism.  Admittedly there are occassions where the criticisms are warranted.  Both Flaming Pie and Driving Rain contained a mix bag of gems and clunkers, yet I would describe both of those albums as good overall efforts.  Songs like \\"Your Way,\\" \\"Calico Skies,\\" Beautiful Night,\\" and \\"Loving Flame\\" wouldn't seem out of place on some of McCartney's best albums from his debut to Venus and Mars.     <br /> <br />His penchant for writing hummable melodies has never faded, and on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, Paul is more focused than he has been in recent memory.  Perhaps, Nigel Godrich found the key to keeping Macca out of his comfort zone and pushing the artist to challenge himself if not out of need then out of a desire to show the craftmanship and talent everyone knows that he has.  Paul plays almost all the instruments on this album, and perhaps this why it seems more focussed.  The result his a pretty much almost flawless effort.  It starts off with \\"Fine Line,\\" which is probably the most radio-friendly tune on the album reminding me of a cross between \\"Come and Get It\\" and \\"Lady Madonna.\\"  It's the kind of tune that you might start humming along to as if it's been one of your favorites for years.   <br /> <br />Things slow down a bit and at first I didn't think I liked \\"How Kind of You\\" very much but there is something about it that makes me want to keep listening to it.  Patience is it's own reward with this song.  If you don't like it at first, don't be surprised if something about it catches you when you listen to the album again.  The coda to this song is what makes me keep coming back to it.  It sounds like something that could have come off Abbey Road. <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is an acoustic song that has been compared with \\"Blackbird\\" exceptit has a strange chord progression.  It's okay.  Not one of my favorites on the album.  It would have worked better if it had better lyrics, which might also apply to \\"At the Mercy.\\"  Musically, I like the song, but it just seems like Paul got lazy in writing the lyrics and just came up with something on the fly.  It's a nice song if only for the music though.  <br /> <br />On the DVD that accompanies the special edition, Paul explains that George was on his mind when he wrote \\"Friends to Go.\\"  It's something I picked up on even before watching the DVD.  It's a truly fun off the cuff tribute Macca pays to George.  Here Paul more or less channels George's spirit and writes something that he thinks George might have written.  His voice even sounds a little like George on this one.   <br /> <br />\\"English Tea\\" is a fun little pastiche of a song in the tradition of \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Honey Pie\\"  It's has some very \\"English\\" lyrics and I think it's probably more amusing than most of his efforts to write in this vein.   <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"A Certain Softness\\" contain some of Paul's gentlest melodies while \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is certainly his most haunting song in recent memory.  Compared to most songs of this nature it may be considered a lightweight, but to hear a song like this coming from Paul makes it intriguing along with its slow and almost menacing rhythm.  It's nice to hear this side of Paul once in while.  I wish he'd write more songs like this. <br /> <br />\\"Follow Me\\" is a decent song but not too memorable while \\"Promise to You Girl\\" gives us a glimpse of Paul in rock 'n roll mode.   <br /> <br />\\"This Never Happened Before\\" is a beautiful love song and certainly the most beautiful song he has written since marrying Heather Mills.  Again, a great melody and while the lyrics aren't exactly Paul's best it certainly ranks up there with some of Paul's other great love songs like \\"My Love\\" and \\"Yesterday.\\"  It's the kind of song that would havebeen a classic by now if it were written 20 or 30 years ago. <br /> <br />\\"Anyway\\" is another great song with a solid melody, but what I really enjoyed is the jam at the end of the album about a minute or two after \\"Anyway\\" ends.  It's a good way to end this album an it corporates all the styles and musical influences at work on the album as a whole.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is paul's best work since Tug of War.  I think he benefits from having someone in the studio with him who will challenge him and force him to discover new subtlties to work with his talents. Kudos to Paul and Nigel Godrich for this valiant effort and for putting together something that benefits from repeated listening.
0060012218|4.0|Wow, the first time I read this, I was amazed. I though I'd never find a book almost as good as boy meets boy. But this is it. Its not as good but is still first-class story all the way. Brent Hartinger has written a wonderful book here, its not restricted for just that of gay or bisexual orientation. Okay, I mean its kind of meant for gay teens but there is so much that a straight teen can enjoy out of this novel, if he or she is willing to open their minds and try new things. And no, I don't mean sexually.   <br />The second time I read it, it played out so wonderfully I couldn't put it down again. That rarely ever happens. I love all the characterd:Russell  Middlebrook. Min , Gunner  and even Russ's  lover  Kevin.  <br />If you've read The Geography club, you HAVE TO read the order of poison oak. The sequel.  Its outstanding.  <br />recently the play version has  been released in major city's. <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|a few hours ago, I entered a review giving this album 4 stars. After listening to this album through twice already, the songs sunk in more and completely changed my opinion. Although my favorite album is still \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" without question, \\"Takk...\\" is now easily in second place. The album is listener friendly, and a new direction for Sigur Rs' sound, and definately not a bad direction either.
B000286S8S|3.0|those b#$tards have screwed over Dave-era fans again! How much more will we have to endure before these old lung cancer patient idiots get a clue and do what we all have been waiting for almost 2 decades for: a Van Halen reunion tour with Roth, not Hagar: it would sell out because everyone wants to see the original not the copycat. But that is beside the point, here is the album:<br /><br />Best of Both Worlds; released about a year ago it was the best of album Van Halen always wanted to release but instead released THe Best of Vol 1. which although only 1 disc had 3 very awesome new tracks 1 by VH with Hagar the other 2 by VH and DLR. THis new one however is 2-disc and features 36 of your classic Van Halen tracks.<br /><br />Pros and Cons<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />36 trackS: alot more Vh material could be covered here than Vol.1.<br /><br />ALmost half of Van Halen and 1984 on this album!<br /><br />14 or so classic DLR Van Halen tracks!<br /><br />I think about 22 Van Hagar tracks.<br /><br />Digitally remastered!<br /><br />Hey, It's Van Halen!<br /><br />Awesome digipack cover!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Too much emphasis on Van Hagar, too little on Van Halen.<br /><br />Liner NOtes: \\"DLR left the band. What happened? Anyway...\\" it is obvious that they still hold a grudge, can't they leave the past behind? They also pretend like Van Halen 3 never happened, but they need to because this is a chronicle of Van Halen's history.<br /><br />Track Listing: the three new songs are filler at best, and the three live tracks are unnecessary (they are Dave's songs anyway, use your own Sammy!) Instead of those tracks they should have included more material from VHII, Women and CHildren, Unchained and Van Halen III. I know what you are thinking: \\"WHy Van Halen III?\\" Well, it is history and the band has to have at least one from every album, no matter how bad.<br /><br />Just buy all the albums and create your own best of or buy the first one, this one had too much bad blood involved to actually be a great package.
B000AL730Y|5.0|McCartney's latest has been compared to his \\"solo\\" albums \\"McCartney\\" and \\"McCartney II\\". It's both an accurate and inaccurate representation of the music contained on it. The music is, as usual, tuneful and memorable and the lyrics are very good as well. It's clear that working with the producer of Radiohead had a positive impact. While McCartney plays almost all the instruments, he has a few guest musicians (including the talented Jason Falkner on guitar)make appearences as well. The songs are among the best he's written in a long time. It's clear that from \\"Flaming Pie\\" onward he's continued to improve his focus as a songwriter even his singing here feels more heartfelt than before.<br /><br />So where does \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" fit in? It's definitely a more consistent album than \\"Flaming Pie\\" (which had some filler on it)and although it doesn't rock as hard as \\"Driving Rain\\" the songs are full of inventive little touches missing from that terrific album as well. \\"Fine Line\\" the single is terrific and the stunning \\"How Kind of You\\" isn't one that knocks you off your feet on first listen but it works its way into your brain. Eventually you'll find it's a track you'll come back to quite a lot. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is one of the few tracks that doesn't come to life for me but the fine acoustic work reminds me a bit of \\"Blackbird\\".\\"Friends to Go\\" another great hook followed through by strong lyrics and melody and another winnner from Macca. \\"English Tea\\" has a bizarre recorder solo in it that just makes it work for me. \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" are both equally good. The latter is a song about betrayal while the former showcases what Paul does best when he's on his game.<br /><br />The spare production works very very well. This continues to show McCartney's artistic rebirth as he's released four strong albums in a row (I'm not counting the live album) with the \\"Flaming Pie\\", the amazing \\"Run Devil Run\\" and \\"Driving Rain\\". Definitely worth picking up for Beatles and McCartney fans. Worth picking up for anyone who likes great songwriting.<br /><br />There's a DVD with a 1/2 hour documentary included (about the making of the album)on the two disc edition that also features a performance and animated footage put to the music from the album as well. Personally, I found the DVD/CD combo to be worthwhile. 4 1/2 stars. If you purchase this at Bestbuy you'll have access to an excellent rocking song called \\"Comfort of Love\\" which makes the perfect companion piece to \\"Fine Line\\" (I wouldn't be surprised if it's been released as a single that way in a couple of markets).eatles and McCartney fans.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|Having only recently discovered this band a few months ago, I am blown away by how excellent , their first major label debut album is. Im a huge GNR fan, and its been awhile since I heard a band that actually comes close to getting me as excited about thier music as Avenged Sevenfold have.There is not one cut on this album that is filler, from track 1 to the end its all killer, not filler.<br /><br />My hats of to this band, and hope to hear many yrs and albums , as long as they continue to rock.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|You really don't need a best of for this band: there is only five albums and the last one is not really worth the time or effort. If you are new to Gun's n' Roses, maybe this might help a little but once you get either Appetite of Destruction or one of the Use Your Illusion albums this one will seem like a waste of money. It's really not that expensive to buy those three albums, if you shop at Best Buy you could get them for less than $45 altogether. If you still want an introduction to Gun's n' Roses and not miss any hits, just get the Best of Illusion disc (which in my opinion the track listing isn't that great but it'll due if you're new,) and Appetite and you already got enough best of material. Other than that you are just better off buying all their ORIGINAL albums and if you still have money left over buy their live album and then buy The Spaghetti Incident? Don't buy Hollywood Rose: it is a waste of money you pay $10 just to hear 5 tracks over and over again in different production methods! And you could just buy Sympathy for the Devil as a single or download it!<br />Stil not convinced? Let me give you an idea what to buy in what order: This is also my way of ranking Guns n' Roses:<br />1.Use Your Illusion I<br />2.Use Your Illusion II<br />3.Appetite for Destruction<br />4.GnR Lies<br />5.Live Era: 87-93<br />6.The Spaghetti Incident?<br />Don't buy the Greatest hits and if possible avoid UYI.
0393317552|4.0|The information contained in the book is thoroughly researched and enlightening.  Diamond's thesis is that modern-day civilization was solely determined by geography.  In my favorite sections he gives examples how geography affected plant and animal domestication, and he illustrates how the east-west orientation of Eurasia led to their rapid propogation. <br /> <br />The problem with this book, however, is not what it contains, but rather what information it is missing.  Diamond never wavers from his thesis even when it has many apparent flaws.  He discards the notion of biological/cultural differences affecting the progress of civilizations as \\"racist\\" and goes no further.  Well, unfortunately the unpleasantness of a theory has nothing to do with whether or not it is true.  Diamond owes his readers more than a brief dismissal of ideas which run contrary to his thesis.
B000002JS6|5.0|AC/DC's BACK IN BLACK album could be considered one of the best rock albums ever. This album is the first since the untimely death of Bon Scott and is just as good as HIGHWAY TO HELL. It is one of those few cds that you can actually listen to all the way through without skipping a song. This album is great for cruising down the road or if you are just wanting to listen to some good rock. Songs like \\"Hells Bells,\\" \\"Back In Black,\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" make this an album you don't regret spending money on.
B0009QZ456|1.0|The single \\"Crush\\" ultimately turned me off instantly as the fire-drill like shrill of the instrumental clashed terribly leaving my eardrums to wonder if maybe I prefer my morning alarm to this song...yet I continued listening to hopefully find a glimmer of hope for this one. DeGraw's third grader lyrics having to do with some girl that won't look his way, yet he remains to have a crush caused me to roll my eyes quite a few times...that is once I was able to understand the actual words through the messy, unorganized \\"noise\\". The varying intervals of segments in the song sound off-beat and simply draw away from a smoothness that was already lacking to begin with. The more I listened to DeGraw whine about her \\"crushing [his] soul,\\" the more I felt that this song was \\"crushing\\" MY soul as I continued to bear through it. If I were to come across his pathetic whining on the radio, I would first confuse him with John Mayer or Howie Day before switching the station due to the cliche, childish lyrics!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I started listening to this band after following a \\"related artists\\" link frm bjork and came across a bounty.

I'm looking forward to more! <br /> <br />I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi and I didn't watch Firefly when it originally aired on TV.  But a friend loaned me the DVD collection and now I'm hooked.  Had to have my own set to enjoy over again and share with family.   The show is somewhat complex and the use of multicultural expressions and dress was at first a little confusing.  Being able to listen to the additonal commentaries helped \\"flush out\\" the back story. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed Firefly more in DVD format than if I'd watch it when it first aired.  The shows were not broadcast in the preferred order, and a couple never made it on at all!  I highly recommend watching it in the complete format of this DVD collection.

B000BB1MI2|3.0|I cannot imagine anyone not making Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory THEIR biggest childhood movie. Not only it showcases a child's only craving since birth which is candy but also it gives him the idea that candy is the world's peace maker. That is why when Charlie and The Chocolate Factory was shown on theaters with Johnny Depp playing as Willy Wonka, I couldn't help myself but be thrilled at the notion of seeing my favorite childhood movie to screen again. Lo and behold, there it was in full screen, Dolby stereo sound -- THe Chocolate factory that ends all chocolate factories. The elfish Oompaloompas were still as entertaining as usual and so are the children's characters that also matches the old movie. But then the old Willy Wonka shine in this remake lost its luster when the movie failed to display one significant scene in the movie where everything is supposed to fall into place. The old movie had Charlie's grandfather commit one selfish mistake and reluctantly hid it from everyone until he cannot take it no longer and confessed to Willy Wonka and foiled all hopes on Charlie ever winning the Grand Prize. That made the movie heartwarming because Willy Wonka in the end decided to forgive the grandfather and considered giving him the Grand Prize anyway -- which is to replace him as the owner of the factory. Such a scene was never portrayed in this remake and it only made the ending dull. Charlie, in this remake, is the only one left without committing any mistake so he ended up winning the grand prize. He might have refused Wonka's proposal to come live with him as a challenge on the movie but altogether the essence of the movie changed with that sentiment. Oh well, remakes are remakes. They had to alter SOMETHING. But i love the old movie and I love Gene Wilder. :)

0930289528|5.0|and that says a lot. The art isn&#8217;t as spectacular as Top Ten, but it&#8217;s still good and it suits the style of the story. At base, it&#8217;s just political commentary, but it&#8217;s done rather well. I would recommend it solely on what Moore has to say about freedom (and oddly enough, it seems as pertinent now as ever), but that would do injustice to the spectacular storytelling. One last thing, given Moore&#8217;s &#8220;point&#8221;, it seems to me that the film adaptation cannot possibly be anything but a complete failure. Moore&#8217;s work in general seems to be too complicated and subtle for popular movies and it looks like we&#8217;re working up to what would be the grandest failure of all: a film adaptation of Watchmen.
B00025ETIW|4.0|My Chemical Romance has done a great job combining different genres. They have an emo/punk feel to it, mixed with a slight metal sound with the amazing guitar solos. When I listen to their newest CD \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" I really get lost in the emotional lyrics. \\"The Ghost of You\\" is my favorite song on the CD, and the music video for it is very intense. My Chemical Romance is a great band and I'm looking forward for their next CD to be released.

However, Krakauer is a good writer and did a nice job working with the material.  <br /> <br />An unprepared idealist goes into the backcountry with a head full of melodrama, that's about it. The ending is sad, but he brought all the circumstances on himself and wasn't smart enough to live through it.

B00000F169|4.0|Dark Star is one of those cult classics that simply must be watched.  I can't believe that John Carpenter and his buddies made it while they were still in film school!  In addition to being darkly funny, the movie brings up a number of surprisingly relevant topics.  Two decades ago, I quoted extensively from it when I wrote my electrical engineering master's thesis (on self-test in replicating systems), and last month I showed a clip of it for a presentation on philospher Nick Bostrom's ideas on simulation and reality at the gaming convention GenCon 2005.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  Most of the time I find holes in plots big enough to drive a semi through.  I'm sure there are holes in this movie too, but I'm so caught up in the adventure of it all that I don't notice.  I think that's what makes a good movie great.  The fact that you can sit down to watch it and be so completely absorbed that you don't notice little nagging details.   <br /> <br />I love Paul Walker and Gerard Butler and would sit through an hour of them doing nothing but flossing their teeth!

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I just finished watching the movie with subtitles and it is near perfect. I am really not all that biased towards Final Fantasy, I mean the game was fine but I am not a die hard fan.     The Movie surpassed my expectations. Square Enix did a beautiful job animating it. It also seams they learned from there mistakes in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. There is just enough dialogue to intrigue you, the story is very clear and straight forward and there are constant action scenes littered throughout the movie to keep you on your toes.     All the characters from the game get proper screen time and new characters get introduced nicely. You feel for the characters, especially Cloud as you see him more as a troubled soldier not being able to deal with death. He is not the flat perfect hero.     One confusing thing is that there are two evil guys that look almost exactly alike. They should have distinguished there personalities a bit more other than just the hair and a gun.    When you finish watching this movie you are left in aww at the sheer beauty of Computer Graphics, character design, environments and the intriguing story line.     The thing you are left thinking is why Sqaure Enix did not fully release this theatrically.

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Much to my surprise, Cube Zero popped up on Showtime this week. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of the original Cube. It was nice to see a low budget flick that demanded the use of brains as well as having life or death stakes. There were genuine surprises in Cube that held up well under second and third viewings and Nicole De Boerr is, well, remarkable. <br /> <br />Cube 2: HyperCube was pretty horrible. Slick ideas but the basic plot sucked. Assuming someone could build a hypercube, I find it a little ludicrous that, being able to screw with spacetime and quantum events, someone would then choose to torture people like that. Then the ending...without spoiling, it endangered my fairly happy view of both movies.  The first movie was good enough to equivocate my opinion of the two. Maybe it was because the first one never left the Cube. In it, you were as trapped as the poor souls inside. <br /> <br />Now, Cube Zero comes along. Hypercube must have banked some bucks to have created demand for a continuation. Its nowhere near as good as Cube, but its certainly better than Hypercube.  For the first time, you have an explanation, however implausible, for the Cube, a detailing that there were more than one and why they were created. Not sure I bought the explanation, but at least there is one.  <br /> <br />Only one of the characters was of any interest and that is only mild. There's now both supersoldiers and bad guys (really bad). The stakes are raised by throwing a child into the mix (and then out again) and then raised yet again.  <br /> <br />That last 'raising' of the stakes is the killer. The cool thing about the Cube was the presumption that if you were smart, thought your way through, you might be able to get the hell out of there. Oh yes, it would also help if you didn't have to deal with violent co-survivors. But now in Cube Zero, they're messing with your head, your memory, your intelligence. Instead of being trapped with your basic tool kit (your head) you don'teven get that. <br /> <br />Not as much a mess as Cube 2, but if this was the first entry, I wouldn't have bothered with any more.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|First off, I have to say to all the one-star reviewers that complain this album isn't as good as Led Zeppelin stuff: QUIT LIVING IN THE PAST. Robert Plant has come a long way since those days, and while I don't know if I can necessarily say that Mighty Rearranger is his best album, it's still great. There are several powerful tracks to be found on here, like \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" and the title track.<br /><br />Smooth songs like \\"Shine It All Around\\" and \\"All the King's Horses\\" also impress. The only problems I had were that the political \\"Freedom Fries\\" was a little too hard to follow; and \\"Somebody Knocking\\" ended really abruptly. Also, the hidden track after \\"Brother Ray\\" is a new version of \\"Shine It All Around\\", and I didn't really care for it. (Robert Plant with a techno song? Come on.) Oh well; Mighty Rearranger is still worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000002UAO|5.0|As I mentioned in another review, you can't really go wrong with the purchase of any Beatles album.  This album was one I had not heard a lot about, but after purchasing it I am not sure why.  It is fantastic.
B0007M22TI|5.0|After seeing the advertisement on the Discovery Channel I ordered this DVD.  Great quality, great show and wonderful Irish music.
B000002UAR|5.0|You can't go wrong with any of the Beatles albums, this one included, but honestly this is one of my favorites.  The White Album is a must have, and so is this one.
B000AL730O|5.0|Ranks amongst his best, like: <br /> <br />Band On The Run <br />Tug Of War <br />Flaming Pie <br /> <br />It has a great flow, from the first track \\"Fine Line\\" til the hidden instrumental track. Most songs sound as they were made during the \\"White ALbum\\" en \\"Abbey Road\\" periods. Very high quality, though no really singles, as we are used to with Macca. So, if you expect tracks \\"We All Stand Together\\", \\"Ebony & Ivory\\", \\"Say Say Say\\" or \\"Spies like us\\", this is not the place. But if you want an enriching hearing experience by a master of melody and who also delivers some of his best and most personal lyrics, than this is the album you should try. \\"Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four\\". Yes, definetely.
B00063MBU8|2.0|I give this two stars because the song \\"Welcome to my Life\\" is used in Conan O'Brien's \\"Hunky Newcomer\\" bit, so every time I hear that song, I'm reminded of that, and I laugh my ass off.  So at least I get some level of enjoyment out of it.  Thank you Conan, you are awesome.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Thanks for getting this DVD to me, I have been searching for this product here in South Africa for the past 3 years going to various video retailers. So I finnaly got this classic video which is one of the most amazingly funny comedy's i have ever seen. So thumbs up cant wait to get my next video through amazon.
B0002IU988|3.0|Alter bridge a replacement for creed!? I think not. While the music is on par with creed, the interpretation by the new singer is not. His vocals are not as strong as stapps and neither are his lyrics or melody. Leaves me wanting creed to reform. Please! <br />Hopefully stapps new cd will quench my thirst. <br />
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Cecilia Bartoli continues to grow as an artist and as an intelligent contributor to the realm of musically important yet neglected works.  The concept of this recital - exhuming works once censored by the Church as inappropriate - include works by Handel, Scarlatti, and Caldara, some of which have made their way onto the concert stage, and some that have fallen into the cracks of the plethora of music from this period.<br /><br />Bartoli is here supported by the fine conducting of Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre.  The songs range from the florid bravura of Scarlatti's 'Serafini al nostro canto' to the simplicity and restraint of Caldara's  'Aria di Santa Eugenia. Vanne pentita a piangere'.  It is of interest to know that these arias were for the most part written for castrati rather than for the female voice and Bartoli seems to appreciate that fact in her manner of performance.<br /><br />This is not only an album of gorgeous singing, it is also an important recording of premieres of works that, were it not for Bartoli's insatiable curiosity and intelligence, would probably never have been available for our enjoyment.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 05
B000AL730O|1.0|I'm sitting here at my computer trying to move this CD to my IPOD. I can't. My computer doesn't even recognize that there is an audio disc in. I paid over $300 to see him in concert a couple of years back, not counting purchasing every bit of his back catalog including the Beatles and someone makes a decision which doesn't allow me to put it to my IPOD? Record company (and I am assuming artist) greed. It's a shame. Gonna return this in the morning unlistened to. How Do You Sleep Paul?
B000641ZA4|5.0|Don't expect anything else than videos, and you'll be pleased! <br />What you get is all 32 Genesis music videos, including their newest Carpet Crawlers 1999 with Peter Gabriel AND Phil Collins.  Besides, the editorial description mentions the name of each and everyone of the videos here.  The case displays the name of the video director and producer for each video, plus a nice collection of covers off their singles represented in the videos.  32 in total.  No extras, no hidden stuff, just their videos with option for DTS or 5.1 sound.  At this price, you get almost 3 videos per dollar, if you like Genesis, can't miss!
B00006JJ51|1.0|I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. I expected this to be a soundtrack of songs played by NWA (Northwest Airlines) on their planes. Instead I heard a couple of guys whining about police and white people.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Backyard goes back to Paul McCartney's Wings days.  Many may consider it better than his past efforts, but it is the evolution of McCartney's solo career.  He definitely has not forgotten where he has been.  Yes, there are tinges of Beatle-like melodies that reminisce \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" (I can't help to mention that the accapella portion almost sounds like the opening chords of Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody or \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\"), but for the most part, there are new melodies that listeners will come out thinking, that's not bad at all, like the sing-able \\"Fine Line\\" or the sentimental \\"This Never Happened Before.\\"  \\"A Certain Softness\\" has a \\"Besame Mucho\\" Latin feel to it.  For some listeners, besides the Beatle comparisons, there are also the McCartney and Wings comparisons.  A few of the tracks sound like fragments that might have come off the \\"Tug of War,\\" \\"Driving Rain,\\" \\"Ram,\\" or \\"McCartney\\" album.  However, the most notable tunes on the record are \\"Friends to Go\\" and \\"At the Mercy,\\" which appear to pay homage to George Harrison and John Lennon.  While listening to \\"Friends\\" I kept thinking there's something missing, George's slide guitar and back-up vocals.<br /><br />For those fortunate to obtain the special edition CD, the bonus DVD provides behind the scene footage and commentary on the making of \\"Chaos\\" and interesting tidbits about each song.  In addition, the package includes a video for \\"Fine Line\\" and an instrumental collage of several of the tunes from the album that accompany the line art of Brian Clarke and a short video of \\"How Kind of You.\\"<br /><br />Overall, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is recommended for McCartney fans as well as Beatle ones too.  It's great to see Paul still doing what he does best.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Here is a recording that both at once makes you feel like you are in the Scottish highlands and at the same time watching a good old garage band that is really hitting their stride together..its both old and new, mellow and heavy(not in a heavy metal sense), and a great example of musicians who play together as ONE unit. Jethro Tull is one of the most unique band of musicians and this is a great start for anyone interested in a listen. Not for the faint of heart...you will either love it or hate it, but you wont deny the quality of the songwriting or musicianship!
0800177177|5.0|I first saw this movie as a young lad not even into his eigth year of life, and i adored it. one of my favorite things about this movie is the portrayal of Renfield by musical genius and movie cameo superstar Tom Waits. I am a huge fan of both his musical and film work, and he plays the insane incontinent so well. This movie has a great deal going for it, it has a great story, stunning visuals for it's time, decent acting, except Keanu, when will someone tell him that he can't act? The biggest draw for me was Tom Waits, pure and simple, i will watch an otherwise dreadful movie just to see five minutes of Tom Waits.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is, above all else, a seminal work in Paul's career. It does more than any other McCartney solo work to tie together various threads, to connect the many fine lines, running through his catalog. It is a watershed and revelation both musically and lyrically. Musically, Paul revisits past musical themes and renews them, the renewal tying together perfectly with the lyrical and personal renewal it is now obvious he has experienced. In short, the album is a list of personal revelations and wisdom, which points to an understanding that there is a greater good, a greater whole at work in the world. And a realization by the artist that his role in this, both in his personal life and within the world at large, is to use his gift, his art, his music, to add to the greater good. It's a noble sentiment, one perhaps that McCartney has long felt, but here he is delivering on it. <br /> <br />Throughout the record, McCartney's lyrics are conversational in tone, familiar. And while it feels like he is singing to an old, familiar friend, someone he is comfortable with, it is more likely the songs are being sung to and about himself as much as they are about someone or something else. Its like the moment McCartney has described when he first played \\"Hey Jude\\" for Lennon, and John supposedly said \\"he's writing this song about me\\", and Paul said \\"no, this is about me.\\" The fact that McCartney is mining familiar musical idioms is important, because it is through these he is able to communicate comfortably: the \\"Blackbird\\"-feel of \\"Jenny Wren\\" invites us into its familiar structure; \\"A Certain Softness\\" and its latin-tinge reflects so much White Album inventiveness that it's a comfort to hear. <br /> <br />\\"A Fine Line\\" is a perfect example. The piano-driven rocker, harkening back to \\"Lady Madonna\\" with perhaps shades of \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is part motivational speech, part half-told story (\\"Paperback Writer\\") where the listener fills in the rest. Is it ananti-war caution against foreign adventuring? Is it Paul cajoling himself to not accept mediocrity, because \\"you decision makes a difference\\". By selling himself short he is selling the world short. It's the Liverpool Oratorio's lyric \\"not for yourself but for the world were you born\\" writ in pop terms. When he sings, with great conviction, \\"come on back to ME\\" one gets the impression he is summoning his muse. <br /> <br />His muse delivers. A stretch in the middle of the record is some of Paul's finest work ever. \\"Friends To Go\\", which does sound like a Wilbury Tune, does, as Paul has described, channel George Harrison, both in its one-off guitar ballad structure and in its anti-social core. The revelation in this rather fun song is more in what the lyrics do reveal about Paul's muse: a level of imagery not heard from Paul in years has returned: \\"I've been climbing up a slippy slope/I've been climbing up a slowly burning rope\\" is the kind of vivid image regularly conjured previously by Paul: \\"made her look a little like a military man\\"; \\"and I thought the major was a lady suffergette\\"; \\"the lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling\\". <br /> <br />The return to this level of descriptiveness continues in \\"English Tea\\". Perhaps its missing a central character to tie it all together, but the \\"lines of hollyhock and roses\\" and deliberately \\"twee\\" lyrics are superimposed on one of Paul's best musical scores in ages. This perfect marriage of lyric and music, so common in the past to Paul's best work, is also at the center of \\"A Certain Softness\\", whose latin flavor recalls \\"Step Inside Love\\", and whose production, and amazing vocal sound like it was recorded between \\"I Will\\" and \\"Los Paranoius\\". And the voice. Paul sings the entire song in a falsetto he has rarely used since Wings. And though he reaches at times, he largely succeeds. Its THAT voice. Its almost eerie. <br /> <br />Likewise, \\"This Never Happened Before\\", which mines the same territory as \\"My Love\\" is every bit as personal (obviously about Paul's feelings of renewal through Heather). But again, the voice is stronger than it has been on record since perhaps Tug Of War. And like \\"English Tea\\" the lyrics overlay a brilliant musical score, one that deftly and maybe even accidentally employs all sorts of classical conventions that are sure to send fellow musicians mind's spinning: just how does Paul do that? <br /> <br />How indeed, because \\"Promise To You, Girl\\" features an amazing core of harmonies, revisiting \\"Because\\", an incredible jazz-inflected intro, a piano-driven rocking core, that somehow meets up with the jazz-intro in the final verse, and ends up tying the harmonic section, the rocker and the rest all together. It is not possible to write a song like this unless you are, well, Paul McCartney. Likewise, \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\", where Paul lyrically expresses more anger and sarcasm than he has expressed on record since \\"Too Many People\\", only works because it subtly brings together a descriptive Dylan-like verse with a musically driven chorus, that I swear features tubular bells which are purposely echoing Paul Simon's production on \\"Scarborough Fair\\". Either way, the music cleverly drives home the impact of the lyric. <br /> <br />Paul has found his way through too in delivering production and performance to enhance songs that if done wrong would be uninteresting. \\"Follow Me\\", thematically similar to Driving Rain's \\"I Do\\" features simply the best middle eight of Paul's solo career: <br />Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love <br />Through the words of heartache, to the end <br />On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in <br />The perfect place for me to find a friend <br /> <br />\\"Anyway\\" begins with a gospel quote (\\"People Get Ready\\") which works because it evokes a place and time, and then the song takes off into a new direction musically. It is probably the weakest track, as it seems a place Paul has visited in the past (\\"OnlyLove Remains\\", \\"Through Our Love\\") perhaps more effectively, but the performance and production make it fit in with the core of the record. <br /> <br />And at the core of the album are four songs which are revelatory lyrically and tie the entire work together. \\"How Kind of You\\", the most experimental track, lays what could be a typical ballad form over a swirl of tape loops, reminding one of Paul's experimental, avant-garde days in swinging London, as he sings perhaps the most personal lyrics heard from him since \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\": \\"I thought I'd never find, somebody as kind, as you\\". Obviously singing of his renewal with Heather, but in a more direct and effective way than on Driving Rain. \\"At the Mercy\\", then, expands on the theme, describing that we are all \\"at the mercy\\" of the world around us, that the best we can do is to find and deliver kindness. <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\", which in quality is near-equal to \\"Blackbird\\", expands on this theme, against a musical backdrop that only McCartney could provide, and describes how we \\"spend our days losing sight of life\\". It is the female protagonist, as so often in McCartney's work (\\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\\") who bears the weight but also the wisdom of the world, having the ability to guide us to that peaceful place described in the album's best song, \\"Too Much Rain\\". <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" is simply a classic McCartney ballad, at once uplifting the spirit, using its music, words and performance to take us to a different place. The falsetto returns here, along with McCartney's expressive vocal style which has too often drifted into mediocrity, even given great material. Not here. His vocals soar. And the message, to \\"laugh when your eyes are burning\\", harkens back to another work: <br /> <br />Don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better <br /> <br />If there is a weakness, it is a lack of rockers. Only \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Promise To You Girl\\" really deliver here. But in a way, that is not what Paul was going for. This is an introspective album. By playing most of the instruments, the message is that every bassline, flugelhorn piece, tubular bell, is an expression from Paul himself, not some colour a hired hand is providing. Self-made rockers can work (\\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\") but perhaps don't serve the larger purpose of this album: a redefinition musically and spiritually of the artist. Paul's entire career, from \\"Lady Madonna\\" to \\"Fine Line\\", from \\"Martha My Dear\\" to \\"English Garden\\", \\"Blackbird\\" to \\"Jenny Wren\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\" to \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is tied together here in a way perhaps that is hard to believe is possible. But then again, this is the guy who recorded \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"I'm Down\\" back to back in one recording session. <br /> <br />Paul has throughout this record delivered the songs, the performance and the production, redefining himself as an artist. It will no longer be possible for Paul to with a straight face sing songs that mean little or nothing to him. He has demonstrated his great gift, of music and of spirit, that hearing it once again, will be hard to forget.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a very great CD this cd rocks the whole world great, <br />and \\"Civil War\\" is one of the very best by GNR. If you love GNR <br />then get this CD because it rocks and is better together with <br />their debut album \\"APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION\\".
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is beautiful music that is relaxing, soothing, and refreshing.  The young women are excellent vocalists and present a concert that is from the heart.  The orchestra and other singers are supurb.  This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time.  Hope they do another one soon!
B00000DGUY|5.0|This is a great album, though there are 2 reasons you shouldn't <br />buy this album. There are missing too many songs, plus bad edits <br />of songs such as favorites like \\"Money for Nothing\\". Everyone's <br />favorite song is \\"Sultans of Swing\\" which is better live. My <br />favorite song on this compilation is \\"Tunnel of Love\\". The live <br />songs like \\"Your Latest Trick\\", & \\"Love over Gold are alright <br />but the studio versions are better. This CD goes better toghther <br />with Love over Gold because of \\"Telegraph Road\\" and other big <br />hits. Why does this go better together with Brothers in Arms? <br />Brothers in Arms is a great CD but overrated!!!!! The only CDs <br />I see in stores are either this, Brothers in Arms, or their debut <br />album. What's the point? Anyway, great CD. BUY IT!!!
0316172324|2.0|Blink flies by too fast.  It was to me like reading a series of newpaper articles.  But very interesting nevertheless.
0385336810|1.0|But if not, you'll be bored silly by this book. I know I was. I've rarely stopped reading a book before reaching the end, but I was sooo close with this one. The only reason I kept reading was because of all the 5 star ratings I saw here. I thought, surely, it must get better. It has to! I was waiting for all the 'laugh out loud' moments that everyone was talking about but they never appeared. My advice: if you're not laughing away midway through, abandon ship! It doesn't get any better. In fact it gets worse.<br /><br />To be honest, I tend to read more serious stuff. I've read a couple really great 'chick lit' books but this one really falls short.  I picked it up at the library  in search of a quick light read. I didn't find it such a quick read because I just couldn't get into it. And yes, it's light but really dull and well, for me anyway, boring.<br /><br />Where do I start with what I disliked about this book? The characters are flimsy caricatures -- completely unbelievable and they're all so irritatingly thick. The dialogue never really goes anywhere. Emma has this completely irritating habit of starting every other sentence with \\"er, uh, um....\\" Whatever laughs there are are so belaboured that they're just not funny anymore. For instance, the big scene where Jack spews all of Emma's secrets & her colleagues respond in shock to every single darned one goes on for some 4 pages ('You're really a size  6?' 'You have a  Barbie bedspread?' 'You hate crochet?' bla bla bla...) Boy, funny stuff. You already know what all of them are anyway, so there's just no sense of suspense or tension. And in general, you know what's going to happen ages before it does, so as I was reading I kept thinking 'oh come on, get on with it already!' I found the writing style just plain flat and uninspiring. There's just no depth of any kind. Worst of all, the plot line is so contrived.  I completely get why Emma would think she was 'madly' in love with Jack after just a couple dates but what's Jack's deal? Are we really supposed to believe that some multi-millionaire CEO would fall in love with this ditzy, dim junior employee who is easily what, 20 years his junior? Riiiight. And Jack's 'big secret'? Now THAT made me laugh because it was just soo silly! And the sappy ending? Yuck!<br /><br />Sorry, I just could not recommend this one unless you were shipwrecked on a deserted island with absolutely positively nothing else to do and even then, maybe not. I truly am baffled by all the rave reviews here. It reads more like a teen novel than something for adults --  very, very, very sophmoric. Anyway, you get the point. I really didn't like it.<br /><br />I would, however, like to recommend 2 other chick lit books that surpass this one by miles. The Other Side of the  Story by Marian Keyes is an incredibly witty, smart, sparkly, genuine laugh-out-loud book. I couldn't  put it down and although it's long, I was disappointed when I was done because I wanted more. Girl's Poker Night by Jill Davis is another very funny, very bright book. Both of these books are everything I think this one hoped to be.Are we really supposed to believe that some multi-millionaire CEO would fall in love with this ditzy, dim junior employee who is easily what, 20 years his junior?

B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"Radiohead's\\" 3rd album Ok Computer is complex and intense the whole way through. The sounds on this album vary from alternative rock to technological sounding themes. One of the album's epic tracks is \\"Paranoid Android\\". Which switches time signatures throughout the song with dynamic shifts, and interesting guitar sounds. This album is definitely a positive step for the band. They have strived forward with new songs and sounds with each album. This is no album to pick out a couple of songs to listen. It is amazing the whole way through, and I highly suggest you purchase this album if you have not already.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album was masterfully created. Not normally my type of music, but you can't not like it. He is a genius!!! The track Porcelein featured in \\"Beach\\" is beautiful. I want to know what some of the lyrics are actually saying other than traveling so far and in my mind im floating. Amazing. Moby is like the new Yanni. I think he has his own way of composing. In my oppinion this is one of his best albums. The sound is a little bit of pop and funk as well as some new age classical. Keep it up Moby!!!
B000AL730O|4.0|Maybe I'm amazed, but I frankly wasn't expecting the 63 year-old Paul McCartney to demonstrate such ability pull an entire album's worth of great material out of his hat. (In fact, \\"Chaos\\" may just be good enough to rekindle Brian Wilson's professional jealousy, fire up that old Beatles-Beach Boys \\"rivalry\\" and force HIM to deliver that one more classic set of tunes that I know has to be lurking in there somewhere!)  Somewhat brooding and introspective for the usually sunny-side-up Macca, with some of his most mature lyrics to date, \\"Chaos\\" has an overall chamber-pop feel (not surprising coming from the man who single-handedly invented the genre with \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"). The man's undeniable gift for a melody still runs rampant, although he does a bit of Beatle-ish recycling, particularly on \\"English Tea\\"-but to good effect. Definitely a cut above most of his output of the last decade, and much more worthy than our latest crop of Beatle wanna-bes (anyone who's heard Jet's \\"Look What You've Done\\" knows what I'm talking about!)
B0006L16N8|1.0|man, coldplay sucks.  Post 1997, music in general has just sucked.  We're devolving.  Is coldplay the best we have?  I am saddened.  The music industry is in dire need of a colonic.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Yes, we've had many greatest hits albums by MJ, but he's not the only artist that has released numerous greatest hits albums. <br />Despite everything, this is great music! Michael Jackson will always be the King of Pop. I like the fact that he includes \\"In the closet\\" in this one because that is a great song but it doesn't seem to get alot of recognition as his other songs have despite the fact it was a top ten hit! I will give this five stars simply because these are great songs & many of them are classics!
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray has graced us with another 5 star CD that from the first listen makes you feel great, even though it has a dark edge! A move away from techno, this CD travels a slightly different path, but one that still takes you where you want to go. Although \\"The One I love\\" is the first single and a great tune, \\"Hospital Food\\" has to be my favorite. Rarely has an artist delivered more of what I love CD after CD, yet still bring something new to the table. DG does, and for my money he could sing the phone book and make me happy, but like his past two CDs, this is a great collection of songs that puts him in an elite class of performers. Needless to say, there are many hours of listening yet to come, but right out of the jewel case, this one is a winner and on my best of 2005 list. And for the record, the copy protection thing is clearly a nuisance that will allow you to copy it to your PC and make copies from there, so why bother at all. Copy Protection is a silly effort that doesn't address the real issues brought on by new technology and people who don't believe that artists deserve to make money for their work.
B00082IJ08|5.0|First things first.  This album is some-what odd, and a little violent.  Now that we've got that out of the way, this album is fantastic.  The only song I knew very well before checking it out was \\"Feel Good Inc.,\\" which is a great song.  I guess you would call this a \\"tecno\\" band, but I could be wrong.  The highlights of this album are \\"Feel Good Inc.,\\" \\"November has Come,\\" \\"Dirty Harry\\" and my favorite, \\"Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head.\\"  Anyone should give these guys a chance, because they succeed with \\"Demon Days.\\"
B0000009SF|5.0|I am stitting here reading some of the reviews of this album which Ihave had in my possession in one form or another since it came out in the early 70's.  I have to laugh becasue I never have seen so much ponitficating by so many on what is clearly describable: this is an album FZ did in the early 70's with a big band, some great improvisational moments and another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he described it as fusion music, which is what it is.  Of course Miles Davis invented fusion music and a lot of the early proponents were graduates of his band (John Mclaughlin, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, etc).  Anyway, this album succeeds in that vein.  No need here to speak of the talent of Frank Zappa, who could write, produce, arrange any kind of music. Period.

B000067FP8|4.0|This Joe Dante sequel to Gremlins has a few glitches as it doesn't really explain the little teddy bears. Gizmo's owner dies and he is taken to a lab where he escapes and soon has baby teddies. Of course, they are bad, but this time they make Gizmo the cute creature turn bully.  <br /> <br />I was good yes, but it seemed to jump from scene to scene without explaining what is happening.
B0002EXH4A|1.0|Whiny 80s metal, laughable Sex Pistols cover (the lyrics must have been deciphered whilst Mustaine was on drugs), pretty lousy all in all.
B000067FP7|5.0|Joe Dante has brought such classics as Gremlins, Gremlins 2, and Explorers to name only a few. This one, Gremlins, takes the cake as his mostm aspiring directing adventure. <br /> <br />A small teddy bear like creature named Gizmo is adopted by some love sick teen who puts water on him and thus brings into this world the most gruesome creatures everyone has ever seen.  <br /> <br />Just think, Gargoles whenever you watch this. There are so many gags that you will possibly split a gut or two.

0451169514|5.0|IT would easily have to be the best book I have ever read. Got my attention early, which is critical for any book to last past the 2nd or 3rd chapter for me. And once it had my attention, it didn't let go, for all 1000+ pages. <br /> <br />I felt like I was getting sucked into their world, and feeling everything they did. As soon as I would pick up the book and continue from where I left off, I felt like I was transported into Derry.  <br /> <br />Also, would I be the first to say that the book wasn't long enough! I wanted more. I was so captivated by the lives of the 7 kids, that I wanted to know more about what happened after they (thought they had) killed IT in 1958. I wanted to see how they became split up and went their different ways. I also wanted to see a little more of what happened after they went their seperate ways again in 1985. Did Ben & Beverley get married? What happened with Bill and Audra? What happened with Eddie's wife when she found out he was dead? What happened with Mike & Richie? I just could not get enough of them!  <br /> <br />I feel like writing to Stephen King and finding out if there are any unpublished chapters.
B000AL730O|5.0|Fabulous album that is introspective, can be understood and is a \\"great listen\\".  Truly a great work by one of the best song writers ever.  If you want to listen to lyrics that are shouted at you, learn about whores, kill cops or disrespect women, then this is not the album for you.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|My name is Jackie and I would like to say that I personally like the album for many reasons. Britney Spears' is such an icon to pop culture and I believe that her song \\"Toxic\\" was such a hit! When I went to my cheerleading competition my senior year of high school, there were about 6 squads that did that song for their routine. It was that popular! It was also one of my favorites at the time. It always made me want to get up and dance. The other song that I believed to be an awesome one was \\"In The Zone\\" with Madonna. Madonna is another one of my personal favorites. I've idolized her forever. Even though Britney and Madonna have had their weird moments in the spotlight, I still support them in most of what they do.
B000002B7U|3.0|Ozzy's \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was originally released in early 1986, and it seems a bit like something that was cranked out merely to satisfy the record company's thirst for another album. Don't get me wrong though--this is not a BAD album at all.<br /><br />Regardless of how much Ozzy hates the hit \\"Shot In The Dark\\" nowadays, it's quite a strong song: an engagingly melodic rock ballad with excellent guitarwork and atmospheric synth.<br /><br />As for the remaining tracks... Well, this is one of the most average albums I've ever heard in my life. Again, this is not to say it's BAD, because it's not--track after track has moderately engaging melodicism, although none of the tunes are particularly catchy, and the lyrics tend to be on the weak side as well. Ozzy doesn't strike me as sounding particularly inspired vocally, but I think this goes hand-in-hand with the material being so-so. Ozzy aside, I don't have any bones to pick with the performances or the production, it's really just the material that's problematic. All that said, this is an album that you won't feel COMPELLED to turn off once it's playing, yet it never really makes you jump out of your seat either.<br /><br />\\"The Ultimate Sin\\" is the second and last studio album from Ozzy featuring Jake E. Lee on guitar, and it certainly isn't as inspired as \\"Bark At The Moon\\", Lee's first with Ozzy. \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" isn't a must-miss, but it's best left for diehard Ozzy fans.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|It's not a joke to say that \\"Takk . . .\\" is Sigur Ros's most accessible album, but anyone who heard its cryptic predecessor, \\"(),\\" knows that the Icelandic quartet has a long way to paddle to reach the mainstream. <br /> <br />Specialists in abstract soundscapes that sometimes coalesce into melody, singer Jonsi Birgisson and his cohorts don't construct verse-chorus-verse rockers or loop-and-thump ravers. But the band, working with co-producer Ken Thomas, has brought new focus and presence to its wispy music on \\"Takk . . . \\" (which means \\"Thanks\\"). While such fantasias as the 10-minute \\"Milano\\" resemble a mash-up of Eno, Sibelius and Radiohead, the pretty (and relatively compact) \\"Hoppipolla\\" has moments that suggest a Nordic interpretation of circa 1966 Beach Boys. <br /> <br />   <br />The group has playfully labeled \\"Takk . . . \\" its rock 'n' roll album, and the drums and guitars are more emphatic than before; \\"Glosoli\\" even builds to a climax that crashes and burns like My Bloody Valentine. Devotees of Sigur Ros's breakthrough release, 1999's \\"Agaetis Byrjun,\\" may find this one too extroverted. Yet there are many familiar timbres, starting with Birgisson's falsetto and including twinkling keyboards and slithering bowed instruments (guitar and violin). What has changed is the sense of dynamics, which doesn't alter the band's fundamental design. It's just that many of this disc's loveliest passages are set off by roars rather than whispers. <br /> <br /> <br />Hell, even if you tried, a serious, involved listen to Takk... will blow that can right open. It's that well-constructed, thoughtful, emotionally provocative and cathartic. <br />Takk is one of the very few ways major labels get it right. Music like this deserves a wide audience, for its sheer audacity, skill, and penetrating beauty.  <br /> <br />This is simply the best of Sigur Ros. <br /> <br /> <br />

1878424777|5.0|This book is an excellent tool, extremely useful for creating a happy and productive life.  Although the four agreements may sound superficial on the surface, listening to the book (on tape or CD) a few times more can continually bring you to a deeper understanding, and help you discover new ways of applying his principals to your everyday experience. Simplicity can be a real treasure. I have purchased extra copies of this for people I love, and they've raved about it.

B00097DX3U|4.0|30 months ago, the three members of Rage Against the Machine that were not Zach de la Rocha teamed up with former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, and released a wonderful, self-titled debut. It's surprising that this debut was a great one, but it's even more surprising, to me, that Audioslave have stuck around long enough to release a sophomore album.<br /><br />At a critical (and often tricky) time in a band's career, Audioslave have pulled through and released \\"Out of Exile,\\" and album which is very solid. Some critics say it sounds too much like Soundgarden, but I disagree; I think Audioslave have their own sound-one which is very unique. I didn't realize it earlier in his career, because I'm not a big Soundgarden fan, but I know now that Audioslave also have a really good singer. It's hard not to notice that, as he croons, mewls, hums, and sings cleanly, that his voice is very tuneful and that he can carry a melody about as well as any singer.<br /><br />\\"Your Time Has Come\\" has a groovey opening riff which is kind of similar to that of the previous Audioslave tune, \\"Cochise.\\" This song's verses flow well into the choruses, which are very catchy.<br />\\"Out of Exile\\" has beeping guitars and gentle singing in the verses. The choruses are a little bit heavier (which is typical with this album), and a nice (albeit fairly short) guitar solo is included near the end.<br />\\"Be Yourself\\" begins with some light guitar strumming, but then it turns to a catchy, dwindling/twinkling guitar noise. Chris' voice remains restrained throughout this song, which might be the catchiest song on the album, and it also has a good, wah-wah guitar solo.<br />\\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" is a surprise choice for the third single. It has more catchy strumming and a lightly thumping drum beat, but it doesn't have anything that makes it really radio ready. It does have a great guitar solo, however; a solo which might be the album's best.<br />\\"Drown Me Slowly\\" is a bit heavier than its previous songs, with some crunchy riffs and a guitar solo which vaguely reminds me of the RATM classic \\"Bulls on Parade.\\"<br />\\"Heaven's Dead\\" has more good crooning my Chris, but, musically, this song is nothing new. It's more of the same guitar strumming and drum beats. Fortunately, this song's beat does gain a bit of momentum.<br />\\"The Worm\\" has mostly spacey guitar noise. The most memorable part of this song, though, is the chorus, when it jumps in volume and Chris raises his voice to a semi-shout.<br />\\"Man or Animal\\" has fast, stop-start riffs, fast drumming, and a small, beeping guitar solo.<br />\\"Yesterday To Tomorrow\\" has guitar noise and singing in the verses, making this song sort of remind me of \\"Like a Stone.\\" This song's chorus, however, has spacey, echoing vocals.<br />\\"Dandelion\\" is musically nothing different from any of the other tracks. It begins with a humming bass line and some guitar strumming which turn to crunchy riffs. Fortunately, the song's chorus is very catchy; Chris sings \\"hooo\\" melodically.<br />\\"#1 Zero\\" has spacey, echoing guitar strings and more good singing. I enjoy this song, though, because I like how Chris raises his voice in the middle of a word. I also appreciate the two-part, 20 second guitar solo.<br />Finally, \\"The Curse\\" is kind of forgettable. It's about all the same pace, and nothing really stands out to the listener.<br /><br />\\"Out of Exile\\" doesn't quite detonate like Audioslave's debut. It may be because this album doesn't have any songs like \\"Set It Off,\\" or it may be because Tom doesn't get as many opportunities to wail and rock profusely, or it could be that Chris doesn't stretch his pipes as much. But, for whatever reason, this album isn't quite as explosive.<br /><br />Fortunately, this album's pros outweigh its cons. This is still a good record, and I recommend it to everybody, especially those of you who liked Audioslave's first album. \\"Out of Exile\\" is probably 2005's best alt metal/rock album. And, with this album, it's safe for me to say that Audioslave are probably one of the best rock bands of the new millennium, and they are definitely one of the most surprising.s of the new millennium, and they are definitely one of the most surprising.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|In any crowd of people over the age of forty, you're likely to find at least one or two who can still remember being blown away by Disraeli Gears. And, in any crowd of high schoolers, you have a decent chance of finding a few kids just learning to play \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". Eric Clapton has all kinds of fans; fans of the early blues, fans of the groundbreaking psychedelia, fans of the classic rock, fans of the laid-back blues-rock, fans of his pop experiments, and fans of his acoustic renaissance. <br /> <br />For a man who has shown so many musical faces to the world, it isn't surprising that no one knew just what to expect for his latest solo effort. After all, it's been quite a few years since  his last studio effort, and no one could really categorize Reptile anyway.  <br /> <br />Back Home isn't another earth-shattering feat of studio wizardry. It isn't a milestone in rock music. It isn't \\"The Contemporary White Blues Guitar, Volume II\\". It is, however, a decent piece of work. <br /> <br />The album's opener gives a good overview of the album's general feel. You won't be hearing much stripped-down soul-baring; most pieces are layered with rhythm instrumentation, backup singers, and organ (provided, naturally, by the ageless Billy Preston.) \\"I'm So Tired\\" is upbeat and bouncy; the country flair is a bit heavy for me, but I've heard worse. <br /> <br />After the title track, the album begins to sag, especially under the weight of the blandly R&B \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\". These unremarkable, all-chorus stretches hurt Back Home more than anything; the filler between the meat, empty space which could have been better filled by a few more blues standards.  <br /> <br />Things perk up after a bit; \\"Revolution\\" is a nice bit of reggae, with a few saucy bakground licks. \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" it's not, but it kicks the album up a notch, albeit a small one. <br /> <br />\\"Lost and Found\\", Doyle Bramhall II's contribution, is undoubtedly the best track of the album. Whenthat raunchy, bluesy riff floated out of my speakers, I wanted to thank Doyle personally. (Note to Doyle: If you're reading this, thanks.) <br /> <br />\\"Piece of My Heart\\" isn't too bad. Like \\"Revolution\\", it's only the second best song by its title I've heard, but it moves things along. <br /> <br />Back Home suffers from the same problems that earned Me and Mr. Johnson lukewarm reviews. Places that should be little more than a man and his guitar are plastered with layers of noise. The approach works sometimes, but more often, it makes me zone out. Or, more often, it makes me switch over to 'Derek and the Dominos: Live at the Fillmore'. <br /> <br />All in all, Back Home is genial if a little bland in spots. It does hurt to hear EC spouting out an entire album without one remarkable solo, but age can do that to a guy.  <br />(Note to Eric: If you're reading this, that was a challenge.)
B000002UC5|5.0|35 years after its release, this album continues to be my favorite McCartney album. While the songs on Band on The Run and Flaming Pie may be more developed, there is a charm about McCartney that the others don't have. Around the time that the Beatles broke up both Lennon and McCartney completed their own solo albums. Both sought to return to a more primal or elemental music. To go back to the beginning and start over as it were. While Lennon found bitterness, anger and disillusionment, McCartney returned to a sense of the pure joy of making music. In fact if you compare McCartney to John Lennon Plastic Ono Band you can see what made the Beatles so great. These two guys were complete opposites in so many ways, like a battery, they generated a lot of electricity between them. This album is different than any of Paul's other albums in that is entirely home made. He recorded it at home and played all of the instruments himself, with occasional backing vocals contributed by his wife Linda. Many of the songs feel like fragments, unfinished musics much like the songs which form the suite on side two of Abbey Road. The CD starts with The Lovely Linda which ends almost as soon as it begins, clocking in at less than one minute. That Would Be Something is a little longer. The simple bass, guitar and drum groove and lyric really pull you in. Valentine Day reminds me of the instrumental surf records from the early sixties. It consists of a melody played on electric lead guitar accompanied by acoustic rhythm guitar, bass and drums. Every Night sounds like it could have been a single. I read somewhere that George Harrison said that this song could have been really good with more production. I disagree. With guitar, bass, drums and Paul's pristine vocals what more does it need? Hot As Sun Glasses is rather sunny instrumental, very hard to describe. It could have horns in it, but maybe he got that sound out of guitars or synthesizer, I don't know. There is a nice organ melody on it as well. Glasses is a very brief piece which could consist of feedback or flutes or I'm not quite sure. This is followed by a bit of McCartney fooling around on piano and vocal that fades out quickly. It reminds me a bit of the unnamed song between Cry Baby Cry and Revolution 9 on the White Album. Though it seems more light hearted than haunting. Junk is a kind of gentle lament for the junk in the yard. Paul wrote it in India in 1968 and initially recorded it for the White Album. That recording is on Beatles Anthology 3. This one is pretty much the same, but it seems to have a few notes played on vibes (toy vibraphone perhaps?) or maybe some bells. Man We Was Lonely is a kind of cowboy tune about the break up of the Beatles. It has some nice electric guitar work. I'm not quite sure what to say about Oo You. Momma Miss America is a rocking instrumental, longer than any of the previous tracks with some great guitar and piano. Teddy Boy is a kind of story song which was originally recorded for the Let It Be album. Singalong Junk is an instrumental version of Junk. This leads right into Maybe I'm Amazed, one in a series of great piano based songs Paul was writing along with Hey Jude, Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road. I remember this being on the radio for months back in 1970 when it came out. I don't think it was even released as a single though I could be wrong. This is followed by one of my all time favorite McCartney songs: Kreen-Akrore. The song is primarily played on drums with a couple of great electric guitar breaks and some jungle sound effects. Very avant-garde.<br /><br />If you just want a McCartney collection I would go for Wingspan which includes some of the best songs from McCartney along with a lot of other great songs. But if you want to delve into the individual albums this is a good place to start. Go back to the beginning with McCartney's most personal album.as well.

B0000E64TR|5.0|This is what I call a perfect album. It has tender moments like the original \\"Candle in the Wind\\" (I loved the Diana one too)and then rocks out for \\"Saturday Night's Allright for Fighting\\". And covers all emotions in between. \\"Jamaican Jerk-Off\\" is a lot of fun too. <br />The bonuses on this CD make it well worth it, even if you already own the album. <br />

B000AL730O|5.0|Forty years ago this month, the Beatles released Paul McCartney's melancholic, autumnal \\"Yesterday\\" as a single in the United States.  Between the June '65 Yesterday/I've Just Seen a Face/I'm Down recordings through the March '67 She's Leaving Home sessions, Paul was at his musical peak, expanding the musical palette of popular music and focusing on the images he wanted to convey in his lyrics. <br /> <br />This brings us to Paul's newest release - \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\"  Having listened to it in its entirety this evening at home, I can say that this album, taken as a thematic and unified whole, rivals Revolver and Pet Sounds and George's All Things Must pass, and may narrowly stand above Sgt. Pepper/The White Album/Abbey Road/Band on the Run/Imagine/Ringo.  <br /> <br />I know this statement is bound to cause controversy.  Let me explain.  First, with this album, McCartney has had his first real partner who could veto/censor/modify his ideas since John L. and (early) George M. four decades ago.  Second, this album is both introspective/autobiographical and universal at the same time.  In many ways, \\"Chaos\\" is the mature, adult response to \\"Pet Sounds\\" whereas \\"Pepper\\" took on \\"Pet Sounds\\" musically all those years ago. <br /> <br />In terms of tone and timbre, this album closely resembles the acoustic/piano textures of the quieter tracks on the White Album, McCartney, and Ram.  The prinicpal difference, which makes this music MATTER, is the four decades of life experiences Paul has had since those halcyion and bygone days.  If in the White Album, the Beatles were in the autumn of there musical career together,\\"Chaos\\" finds Paul in the autumn of his life - the shadows starting to lengthen, mortality facing him squarely in the eye, the ghosts of friends and lovers now long gone haunting this man.  By any standard, this album is more than mere pop music, it qualifies as musical and compositional expression of the highest order.  After all, McCartney's recording career now spans an awe-inspiring FORTY-SEVEN YEARS (dating from the 1958 McCartney/Harrison recording \\"In Spite of All the Danger.\\"  Listen carefully to the music and the lyrics - you can hear, in the shadows, the bittersweet and now long lost harmonies of John, George, and Linda in this beautifully haunting music.   <br /> <br />Just like \\"A Day in the Life,\\" Paul here confronts the sadness and difficulties of real life and still believes, as we should all believe, in love and hope.  Not a bad message for a world grown weary by war and natural disasters this September, 2005.
B000AL730O|4.0|Sir Paul McCartney's previous album, 2001's Driving Rain, was awarded almost unanimous critical approval. Interestingly enough, I loved it at first but slowly grew out of it, instead of the other way around. Pundits across the board are now giving their even more fervent blessings to Paul's newest effort. But will Chaos & Creation in the Backyard (2005) prove a repeat performance?    Well, let's see. At the recommendation of legendary Beatles maestro Sir George Martin, Chaos & Creation in the Backyard is produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame. Not surprisingly, he was an excellent choice. Godrich had a much greater hand in the creative process than most of Paul's former producers - it was at his behest Macca's touring band was dismissed, forcing the ex-Beatle to provide almost all the instrumentation himself ala his homemade solo debut. But Chaos & Creation is anything but homemade; with tasteful, layered arrangements and a crisp, glossy sound, there's a sense of craftsmanship and professionalism here that was lacking in the 1970 record. And if it wasn't directly his doing - Paul's own age and resultant maturity probably had some effect - Godrich's quality control was more than likely a factor in Chaos & Creation's moody, introspective tone.    Indeed, this record often finds Paul in or striving for a darker humour than his wont. To mixed results: Riding to Vanity Fair sags beneath its self-conscious malaise, but the rainy-day Jenny Wren is evidence Macca can still do damn fine melancholy. Which is not to say C&C is a gloomy album: this is Paul McCartney after all, a lover and an optimist at heart. So the LP has its share of romantic ballads and feel-good \\"uppers\\", even if there IS a conspicuous dearth of Sir Paul's trademark stylistic diversions. Both lyrically and tunefully Chaos is a marked improvement on Driving Rain. It's still hit-and-miss - witness the simplistic rhymes of Follow Me and This Never Happened Before, or How Kind of You's melodic meandering.But they're none of them BAD, and the pastoral tableaux of English Tea, pensive melancholia of At the Mercy, and Top 20 (!) single A Fine Line, among others, atone amply.    Because even when the material doesn't entirely work, the McCartney/Godrich partnership manages to salvage whatever charms a tune may possess and bring them to the fore. Whether it will ultimately turn out to be an encore of Driving Rain, I can't say; but as far as I can see Chaos & Creation in the Backyard is a respectable addition to a legendary oeuvre.
B000003TAR|5.0|The first Nirvana CD that I ever bought was In Utero. I opened the package, popped the CD into my car stereo, and began to listen to my first real taste of Nirvana. I was immediately hooked; I don't know how I had thought of myself as a music lover when I had never truly listened to Nirvana. This CD changed my taste in music, not just classic rock, but all music that I listen to. My favorite track on the CD is \\"Rape Me.\\" I'm not exactly sure why, but it just stands out to me in a way that the others don't. However, I'm not saying that the other songs aren't great, I love the whole CD and I can't just listen to one song when I put it in; I have to listen to the entire CD. If you have not yet listened to or bought this CD, I would highly recommend that you do so as soon as possible.
6305014140|3.0|First off, all the negative reviews seem to based on violence and 5 total minutes of sex and nudity.  Also most of the negative reviews that think there is no plot and the story is stupid. These people just were not paying attention and in there explination of what they thought was a plot explained it all wrong.  I gave the movie 3 out 5 stars because of the halfhearted effort of vhs transfer to the DVD.  You would think with such a highly successful movie they would try to make the DVD with some quality.  The only thing good about the DVD is the its is ono DVD and you don't have to deal with the obsolete VHS player.  I do recommend the movie and if you don't like animation, excessive violence, and gratuitous sex scenes, don't watch it. <br /> <br />Here is a synopsis of the flick:  Do not read if you want to figure the movie out by yourself. <br /> <br />A village has been wiped out by a mysterious plague which is actually a ruse (a trick) created by a group of villans called the 8 Devils of Kimone.  The devils actually killed the villagers and made it look like a plague to steal gold from a ship that is scheduled to dock at a nearby port.  A mafia like clan from a adjacent village sends in a bunch of warriors to inspect the village because they do not believe it is a plague.  The warriors get their A$$ kicked by one of the Devils of Kimone thats skin can become as hard as rock a deflect swords and such.  Kagero, the female lead who has been cursed by poisonous skin and has never and can never have contact with anothe human is the only survivor of the clan but is captured by the demon.  The demon does fondle Kagero pretty graphically and Jubei the main charcachter, a ninja vagabond (a nomad/drifter, a person without a home) traveling the countryside happens upon the situation and eventually defeats the demon.   <br /> <br />Throughout the movie, Jubei keeps running into an mysterious sly old man who eventually reveals he is a detective working fo r the local police.  The old man tricks Jubei into helping him by poisoning him with a nija star.  The old man will give Jubei the cure if he helps hunt down the devils ans if he does not help him, Jubei will die.  <br /> <br />Kagero which is also searching for the devils for the revenge of her clan reluctantly joins Jubei and the old man in the quest.   <br /> <br />Jubei battles each of the Devils along the way in some pretty intense fight scenes and eventually finds out throught the old man the the leader of the Devils is a cohort from his past (excuse me for forgetting his name) in which Jubel fights and chops of his head.  The leader who has discovered the majick of reserection and invincibility has come back to steal all of the this gold.   <br /> <br />As the adventure continues through the film.  Kagero falls in love with Jubei but due to her condition/curse cannot physically show Jubei how she feels kissing or otherwise.  Kagero thus does not want to let herself fall for Jubei and attempts to drive him away by being rude and combative.   <br /> <br />Time is running out for Jubei and his poison and in a shocking turn of events the old man tell Kagero that she can nullify the effects of Jubei's poison with her own, however, she is skeptical.  In teh final battle, Kagero is mortally wounded and while in her final moments has an embrace with Jubei who has also fallen in love with her.  Kagero dies and Jubei survives and continues on with his nomadic ways thus ending the film. <br /> <br />
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Attack I've been listening to for a long time, and every song on this album is amazin, expect the hunter, it is to slow and boring....but other then that the CD kicks the crap out of the first, Leto's screaming is borderline insane, and once you listen your hooked, a must have for all 30STM fans. Get off your asses and buy buy buy this wonderful CD
0930289455|4.0|There's been so much already said over this book, that something more, so far after the fact, seems almost pointless.  But I want to weigh in, to at least get my thoughts down on paper, and if it helps others, all the better. <br /> <br />I bought this book in July of 2005, and had to go to ebay to do it.  It's a shame that there isn't a modern printing for sale on Amazon, because all people interested in superheros or Batman or just good stories should take a look at this one.   <br /> <br />What's most interesting about this book is the differences between Batman and Joker.  Sure, in some ways they're the same, and that's been explored, but this story makes them utterly different and completely incompatable through most of the tale. <br /> <br />The Batman is presented as the ultimate stoic figure.  He is a shape that exists only to oppose the Joker.  He is a mythic man, an epic hero, unassailable and barely human, though he makes a plea for humility and understanding.  That warrior's compassion comes from a much older type of tale, its roots back in mythology.  Batman is myth, an archetype, and in this book his exemplifies that perfectly.   <br /> <br />The Joker, on the other hand, begins a modern figure.  A man with futile dreams struggling to make ends meet, he is fearful and conflicted and has good intentions but lacks foresight.  He is us, and a string of bad choices (and bad luck) create the Joker.  The Joker is a mythic figure as well, but one with much more modern roots.  Batman's myth happened to him, like destiny.  Joker brought his own ruin upon himself.   <br /> <br />There are ambiguities in this, of course.  The Joker is insanity to Batman's order, and in this chaos there is the idea that the Joker is making it all up, that he simply believes this to be his origin for the moment and it will change to something else at another time to suit his fancy.  The Joker's reality is subjective, a soft substance he can mold to his will.  He lives in his own dream, and cannot break out of the world he's designed (light and twisted humor and glee and his idea of rightness in him escaping and Batman pursuing).   <br /> <br />Batman on the other hand is the world's ultimate realist.  He sees the Joker as his foil, and their battles as a dangerous, doomed escalation.  He knows there will be a heavy toll to pay, and there is (in the casualties Joker leaves along the way).  In the end, the clash between reality and insanity can only end one way.  Batman claims one will kill the other, but the truth is much more bleak--either peace will be made, or both sides will die in the struggle. <br /> <br />The end of the story is the strangest point.  Here, more than anywhere, they are seen as reflections of each other.  The two men are utterly at odds, but there is a rightness here and a hope that perhaps in some dim future there will be a reconcilliation.  Yet, it is stalemate, and will always be stalemate, and that is the perfection of these two when used correctly.  Neither can win, because they live in different worlds with different rules and one would collapse without the other.  It's fundamental character design. <br /> <br />It's also one amazing book.   <br /> <br />I just wish it was easier to get a hold of.
B00000AFGM|3.0|I'm not a foaming at the mouth,mosh brained teenager that thinks Manson is the coolest thing around. I have never seen him live and would not be caught dead at one of his shows. First of all most of his songs are boring and sound like a whining kid that thinks all there is to do is hate everything. But this cd is one of the best he puts out as far as music goes. If i had to pick a favorite by Manson this would probaly be the one. I got this and other cds by Manson out of sheer curosity to see just what he had to really offer. He never exceeded with all the cds i got of his the low expectations i had set. He basically hates everything and everybody. Whether or not he is really a satanist or not is up to the listener. I think he is a fake and uses his so called bad childhood to entertain lame brains with shock and vulgarity. I have heard metal bands that i would be more inclined to believe were into satanism than Manson is. I think his satanic views are just used for shock value and nothing more. Anyway this is about as good as it gets for Manson with this cd.
B000AL730O|4.0|Although a lot of this CD has songs that deal with sadness, loneliness, anger and bitterness(Chaos), the arrangements are built with interesting instruments, unexpected chord changes, close harmonies and varied tempos(Creation).  Fine Line is a good, uptempo pop tune, heavy with piano.  Jenny Wren has great guitar at the start, then a drum taps in, followed by a beautiful and haunting reed instrument(a duduk).  Promise To You Girl displays some great harmonies in the style of Queen more than Wings and the lyrics are more optimistic and upbeat here.      If we must compare any of this sound to the Beatles there is an obvious song, English Tea.  Kind of like a Martha My Dear or any of the Rutles loving parodies.    This Never Happened Before has a short running bass line that puts you in the mind of You Never Give Me Your Money from Abbey Road.  Finally, there is a hidden track that has an assortment of quirky honking horn sounds and tape loops in the style of Strawberry Fields. You can find a new sound each time you listen and it is a very pleasing CD performed virtually all by Paul. A well crafted CD.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Manson is without a doubt one of the sickest individuals to ever come along in music. This is probaly the hardest of his offerings and the most raw. Manson has some very freakish ideas about the world,people,God and Government. Althouth i do not agree with his outlandish opinions he does have some catchy tunes that will probaly become classic over time. I have 4 Manson cds and this one is the most brutal even above Holywood I think. Like one review said all you need of Manson is the greatest hits and you have him in a nutshell. I gave this a 3 because he does have good technical production even thought this cd is not the best at that. He does seem intelligent but so did some of the most notorous serial killers also and look what they did. If you never heard Manson try the Lest we Forget Cd first and see what this freak has to offer.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Do I love me some Death Cab?  I sure do.  Did I like the idea of the band changing labels, and at that a major label?  No.  But, understanding that this is the groups chance to shine I listened to Plans with an open mind.     Having years to perfect they're sound, Plans is a step in the right direction.  Chris Walla once again resumes the task of producer and does a reasonable, crisp job.  Now, I say reasonable only because I've grown to love the groups lo-fi sound, the new album is too precise for my liking.  However, this is the most accessible of their records and what I believe the band wanted to accomplish.  The production has been evolving from 1998's \\"Something About Airplanes\\" to 2003's \\"Transatlanticism.\\"  We've listened as the sketchy sound has faded away.  With each year the production is cleaner as they become more accomplished in the studio.  Listen to Death Cabs older records, the guys have always had the makings of a mainstream band without the marketing and production.     The songs are some of the best Gibbard has put to paper.  Delivering lines like, \\"Im thinking of what Sara said/ Love is watching someone die,\\" the presentation is so slick you barely notice how cold that remark is.  \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is the first single and destined to be played on countless tv shows.  I'd describe it as lines delivered over a wonderous acoustic background.  Some of my personal favorites include \\"Different Names For The Same Thing\\", a piano-driven beauty.  The lush, folk track exploring our vulnerability \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark.\\"  And the upbeat \\"Crooked Teeth\\" which goes against the rest of the songs feel.  The album's mood isn't a downer, but its not happy, I'd describe it as refreshing or maybe rejuvenating.  It's calm and peaceful.    Stuck in the middle of the constant \\"what's indie and whats not\\" debate Plans is on the edge of genres.  Some of the people who have followed their past music may feel put off.  It's different, and not the best of the Death Cab albums.  It's good, but not reaching the high standards we have of this band.  Groups that take the risk of losing they're fan base either swim or sink and only time will tell what the future holds for the gang.  The indie snobs best kept secret isn't so secret anymore, I guess will just have to share with the rest of the world.        Plans receives  A Bliss of 7

B0001D0FTW|3.0|Not that this is a bad album, it has a few good songs but it has it's bad ones too. Definately not Theater of Salvation worthy. It's still worth hearing though.
B000001GPX|5.0|Now I understand why many consider Beethoven to be the greatest classical composer of all time. These two intense symphonies, especially the 5th, left my jaw lying on the floor. Carlos Kleiber does a superb job of bringing these symphonies to life. Albums such as this have helped revive my interest in classical music.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Simple - this is one of the best live albums around, especially if you love electric blues guitar (although the acoustic tunes are excellent as well).  <br />I had this on vinyl as a teen back in the 70's (I think I only bought it at the time because it intrigued me that there was an Irish bluesman) & picked it up on CD the first time I saw it had been released. I now also own the DVD version as well. <br />Great songs, great playing & great crowds - you can feel the enthusiasm of the crowd & the passion of the band. \\"back On My Stompin Ground\\", Tattoo'd Lady\\", \\"I Wonder Who\\" - not a bad cut on here. <br />I wish I could have been there or at least had the pleasure of seeing Rory live. He is missed - where's the next great Irish bluesman when you need him???
B000AL730Y|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I am not the bigest fan on McCartney's solo fan (his solo career I find is the worst of the Beatles) so after Driving Rain, I was expecting another McCartney blunder album and then continue listening to the new Dylan bootleg series. <br /> <br />Boy Paul proved me wrong on this one. When I finally was able to listen to the CD I listend to it 4 times back to back. I'm truly amazed. The songs blend so well together, I can't bear to stop listening to it. The music actully is magical, which is more then I can say to most albums I've heard of late for any artist. Thank You Soo Much, Sir Paul. I can't wait to see you on the 26th, and please play as much as this album as you want.

To make matters worse, much worse a serial killer has moved into town, some gang rapers are loose at the high school and he's adopted a homeless dog that's just too cute for words.  A[...]<br /><br />I've never read the book, so I can't comment on the movie vs. the book, but for a made for network TV movie I thought it was surprisingly well made.  Much better than the stuff I hear they show on those channels.  I have no idea why the DVD got an R-rating.<br /><br />In the extras Magnum mentioned they are planning to make more of these movies.  That'd be cool; I'm looking forward to it.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Like I just said, NOW I \\"get\\" Sigue Ros!!  For a few years, since I gave their music a try, on \\"()\\", it didn't register at all.  My brother-in-law is a fan and asked me to buy him that record as a birthday gift.  Plus, being into critics' faves and unconventional music the world over, I knew Iceland's Sigue Ros was a band for me to check out...so I listened, and listened and listened some more...I thought it was interesting but nothing I would listen to more than once.<br /><br />Well, my friends, all I needed was a KEY, and that key is Sigue Ros' new album, \\"Takk...\\", now I understand, and I am blown away by this masterpiece of a record.  NOW, I will understand and love their prior 3 records too...what I also needed was some context.  And that context is both \\"dreampop/shoegazer\\", 4AD, and unique music from Scandinavia in general.<br /><br />It's beautiful, impressionistic stuff, VERY melodic but totally unconventional, innovative arrangements and songstructures, the approach to each song, or \\"piece\\", is utterly original.  NOBODY makes music like this these days.  The closest I can compare them to is prime Cocteau Twins, latter-day Radiohead, a mellower My Bloody Valentine, but those comparisons don't do Sigur Ros any justice...seems Sigue Ros is just more emotional, maybe that's the key!!  They are just one of those bands you have to hear for yourself to understand, that's it.  Jon sings in a falsetto that he always sounds female...and in both Icelandic + Hopelandic, not a word of English...but that's OK because MUSIC is the universal language and Sigue Ros is able to convey a wide range of emotions in their own brand of music...it all leads to total euphoria, a complete release, a flood...don't be surprised if the tears start flowing during the climaxes of songs like \\"Glosoli\\", \\"Milano\\" or \\"Soeglopur\\"...their music kind of subconciously triggers emotional wells you didn't know existed.  Unexpected and totally satisfying!!!  Jon plays his Les Paul, not strumming but with a custom violin bow, creating a unique sound...plus there are aggressive feedback rock elements, not unlike My Bloody Valentine, as well as lots of strings and drums.<br /><br />Not at all commercial, but that's fine, as Sigue Ros' music is a pure exchange of emotion...and radio can never convey this type of personal give and take, because it can never be about a bottom line here.  Kudos to Geffen/Universal for recognizing how important Sigur Ros' music is, how beautiful and unconventional it is, and keeping their exposure at an alltime high, so people can discover their music for themselves and take 'em to heart.<br /><br />Could be best album of 2005, bar none.ng but with a custom violin bow, creating a unique sound...plus there are aggressive feedback rock elements, not unlike My Bloody Valentine, as well as lots of strings and drums. <br /> <br />Not at all commercial, but that's fine, as Sigue Ros' music is a pure exchange of emotion...and radio can never convey this type of personal give and take, because it can never be about a bottom line here.

B000022TSY|2.0|I finally got around to watching this \\"landmark\\" - this \\"generational touchstone.\\" After 35 years of cultural saturation - the music, the Academy Award montages, the one-liners - I watched it. Or at least I tried. It was extraordinarily disappointing. I'll bet I \\"had to be there.\\"<br /><br />Here's a movie which deliberately portrays late-sixties counter-culture with the \\"counter\\" component completely missing from the self-awareness of its participants. The characters are portrayed not as culturally savvy human beings who have tuned in, turned on and dropped out, but rather as pie-eyed mildly retarded adults on chrome-moly hobbyhorses frolicking across the country occasionally bumping into folk who misunderstand their unmeasured, playful skinny-dipping innocence. If this film weren't so revered it would be endearing as an interesting museum piece - not as a cinematic record of 60's culture, but as an unwitting artifact of 60's culture. As a film to be revered it fails.  As an artifact it is as successful as a piece of Sumerian cuneiform.<br /><br />But the film is preachy - in the non-verbal way that films can be - in the way that the choir can never quite notice. The scene where Jack Nicholson smokes \\"grass\\" is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Here's an early-thirties ACLU lawyer in 1969 written to act all agog at the sight of weed. \\"You mean...mar-i-wa-na??\\" he gawks like he's being offered the ignition key to an alien spacecraft.<br /><br />In fact the only salient problem with this movie is that it tells a small, feeble lie - and does so in a silly sales-pitchy way. It lies by underplaying the deliberate and wry character of 60's counter-culture in an effort to intersect its participants' motivations with traditionally appreciated dispositions like joy and innocence and googly-eyed curiosity - and it does so with a dishonest straight face. It is the inverse of Reefer Madness pitched dry. All bitternes, measurement and calculation is attributed to the capitalists, rednecks, homophobes and jingos who litter the woods, the coffee shops and the highways. The net-effect this film had on American culture was as a springboard for the American motorcycle aftermarket industry - as anyone who is IN that industry, such as myself, can attest to. Thousands of would-be Captain Americas rebelled against \\"the man\\" by giving \\"the man\\" their paychecks in exchange for fork tubes, flag helmets and chopper 'zines.

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I must say I have found Battlestar Galactica series on SciFi to be one of the more suprisingly enjoyable and well written shows on television but all of this is alreadly known. The soundtrack developed in either a collaborative or independently and cooperatively by Mr. Richard Gibbs and Mr. Bear McCreary are both excellent. <br /> <br />The bulk of the CD is composed of interesting hybrids of tribal/Arabian/European classical pieces and North African influences. There are a fair amount of pieces which are quite nice but somewhat contextual and situational to the show but are nonetheless quite good there are two exceptions, however,which prompted my purchase, I recently saw some parts of \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming (II)\\" and the pieces, 'Passacaglia' and 'The Shape Of Things To Come' were set into the background of a rather pivotal moment and quite frankly I was amazed and to my suprise moved, needless to say I was here rather instantaeously. <br /> <br />These were two beautifully composed and performed pieces, and at first I kept thinking to myself these must be covers or variants of something by Bach or Handel but I researched a little bit and he managed to pull of a moment of perfect beauty that sounds like it was composed by one of the great masters so it would seem at least to my ears that Mr. McCreary has done something rare in music let alone television soundtracks.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Iceland in 3 lessons:    - Bjork: Unsurpassed so far, insanely weird style, but simply great singer, with awesome ideas and influences. If you have to listen to only one album, well, I won't be able to tell you which one, it's so hard to choose! Just try them in the chronological order, you'll understand...    - Mum: Eerie voices, superb music, simply great. Last album slightly less impressive, but \\"yesterday was dramatic today is ok\\" as well as \\"finally we are no one\\" are albums that need to be part of your music collection. Discovered during a Sigur Ros concert, I simply fell in love with them (incredible to believe they were \\"only\\" a support band).    - Sigur Ros: \\"Agaetis Birjun\\" changed my music standards. This album opened me to the more underground scene, the way less accessible sounds, but also the lot more meaningful and creative music, it's simple, it's the only album I played during about 6 months in 2000. Superb. Then \\"()\\" came, very dark album, very hard to access, but so powerful if you take the time to listen to it... makes you kind of think. And now \\"Takk\\". Well, simple, complicated, obscure, clear, eerie, sad, joyful, SUBLIME! Closer to Agaetis Birjun in its style, way more upbeat than (), it's simply Sigur Ros at their best.    Iceland rocks guys... feel like moving?
B000AL730O|5.0|This finely-crafted new album is reminiscent of McCartney's earliest solo work--think, \\"McCartney I\\" and \\"Ram\\"--and is a treat from start to finish. There are no weak tracks, and gems such as \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"English Tea\\" are surely destined to become classics. Although his post-Beatles work is admittedly uneven, McCartney here builds upon the return to form which began with 1997's \\"Flaming Pie,\\" and continued with the also-superb releases \\"Run Devil Run,\\" and \\"Driving Rain.\\" The informal playfulness of his best solo work is in full flower, and one can only hope that future albums will live up to the high standard set by \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\" Very highly recommended for anyone interested in either Paul McCartney or the Beatles, this is one CD you will play over and over again.
B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"Jesus Walks\\" by Kanye West in \\"The Collage Dropout\\" is nothing less then inspiring and innovative. Changing the way rapping is known, Kanye West manages to mix a soulful masterpiece that is not only changing the way people think about life, but the way that the message is received. It challenges hip hop listeners to explore a new way of singing, not completely changing the music, but making the beat different and catchy. As you listen to the song you hear the singing of solders  smoothly but surprisingly drifting into the drums of war. The track begins to give out the true message which is when West's strong voice  begins its story on how our sociality is corrupt and how we have wandered so far from the truth, that we only care about the materialistic things in our world. Then briskly you hear children singing \\"Jesus walk with me\\" our future doctors, lawyers and police officers. Then to complete the piece the rhythm gathers it all together giving a feeling so mind-blowing that only your soul can explain it. West being a expert producer in beats, managed to mix R&B Soul and old school jams to create a song that cant easily be forgotten. . Another reason that this song is so special is that even though its talking about religion and faith, its not put in the categories in which most rapping song get into. Finally somebody has broken through the walls of modern age music to give off a new but inspiring song that has a true meaning.  Not hidden between vulgar language and useless lyrics that only make the world that we live in more difficult to understand and learn what the truth really is in life.
B000AL730O|1.0|I complete lost interest in anything Paul released after Band on the Run. But when I heard Drivin' Rain, my appreciation was renewed. Boy is this thing ever getting hyped.  Best post-Beatles work?? Gee - not even close.  After the grossly overlooked Drivin' Rain, I was expecting this to top that, what a disappointment. I almost fell asleep in the car during the morning rush hour listening to this piece of drivel.  I can't imagine him performing any of this stuff live.  If you don't have Drivin' Rain - do yourself a favor a pick up one of the used copies here online for $3 (or George Harrison's Brainwashed), a much better bang for your buck than this waste of plastic.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Celtic Woman is simply amazing. I personally think the live DVD concert is better than the CD because you have the live magic that you do not get with the studio. I wish they would come out with a CD version of the live DVD now that would be amazing.  <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|At the beginning of the summer I was in a frantic state. I heard that Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, and Paul McCartney were all releasing albums within basically three weeks of each other. Clapton's came first and I could not have been more disappointed. A true letdown if I must say. Then came the Stones. Once again I found myself puzzled. Was this really what I was waiting for? I had been expecting something much better especially from the Stones. After two lackluster releases from two usually great acts I was hesitant to buy this one. However I took a chance and my fourteen dollars were the most well speant in quite a long time. Leave it to McCartney to give us the album we deserve as music listners. This is by far one of the best albums of the last twenty years by anybody.  An album this fresh, this melodic, this powerful has not been released since U2's Joshua Tree.  Paul McCartney proves that he is better than almost anything out there.  Never before has his music had such a purpose and such intensity and meaning. His voice rings like it sounded in the 60's. The musical ability here is just incredible. The McCartney legacy has diminished since the 80's, but this could be the album to put him back on the top once again. Truly brilliant. Expect it to be rewarded come Grammy night. It just seems like that type of release.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|Let's face it.  Anyone that is coming up on eighty years old, and has had such a long career in music could be excused if he \\"phoned in\\" an album like this one.  I buy every B.B. King CD that comes out, and think of him as a national treasure, so while I planned to buy this one upon release, I didn't expect much.  I was wrong.  This is a very fine album. It is at a level that might make many performers 50 years the junior of King envious of his skills.  Even at eighty, he is a valid performer, and not a novelty act.<br /><br />This is King's second studio album of duets in recent times (\\"Blues Summit\\" was a live album), and in my opinion this is superior to the \\"Deuces Wild\\" disc from 1997.  I looked at the list of participants on \\"80\\", and while some were obvious, such as Clapton, others were surprising for a blues disc.  I was not sure what to expect from some of the \\"friends\\", not because of the talent, but because of the genre that they came from.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised by what on paper might seem like miss-matches.  I expected to have a few duds in the line up, but no... they were all not only tolerable, but enjoyable.<br /><br />Some highlights for me: Van Morrison trading vocals on \\"Early in the Morning\\" is very nice.  Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top mixes his Texas style blues with King's more traditional style on \\"Tired of your Jive\\" to good effect.  Clapton plays call and response with King's guitar on the often covered \\"Thrill is Gone\\" taking the song to a different level.  Mark Knopfler plays his subdued, understated guitar off of King's equally minimalist fills on \\"All Over Again\\" to good effect.  The Eagles' Glenn Frey gets nice and bluesy with his vocals on \\"Drivin' Wheel\\", as does the Who's Roger Daltry on \\"Never Make Your Move Too Soon\\".  The most contemporary to King in the line up is Bobby Bland, and the chemistry is so much better than with many of the other performances.  You can just tell that they like and respect each other based on the banter between the lyrics.<br /><br />Some better than expected surprises:  Sheryl Crow is a fine singer, but I was not expecting her to blend well with King.  I was wrong.  The same can be said about Gloria Estefan, whose normal musical style is far from the blues.  Both of these ladies pull this off with great renderings.  John Mayer is the baby here, and if I had not seen him on Clapton's \\"Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD\\", I would have thought that this kid does not deserve to be in the room with King.  I was again wrong in this assumption.  Even pop king Elton John does not disappoint with his blues based vocals on the \\"Rock This House\\", the most rollicking track, and the track I was sure I would not listen to more than once.  Wrong!<br /><br />This is first and foremost a B.B. King Album, and that is clear.  The other participants are very respectful and do not try to over-shadow the master in either vocals or guitar work.  Another thing for the guitar fans out there, is that there is a mention in the insert that anytime King is playing guitar with a guest guitarist, his guitar will come out of the right speaker.  This is good information.  I spent the day with my balance knob cycling back and forth isolating King against the likes of Clapton and Knopfler, and then letting those other players shine.  This little tidbit of information will enhance the enjoyment of hard-core guitar fans.n the banter between the lyrics. <br /> <br />Some better than expected surprises:  Sheryl Crow is a fine singer, but I was not expecting her to blend well with King.  I was wrong.  The same can be said about Gloria Estefan, whose normal musical style is far from the blues.  Both of these ladies pull this off with great renderings.  John Mayer is the baby here, and if I had not seen him on Clapton's \\"Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD\\", I would have thought that this kid does not deserve to be in the room with King.  I was again wrong in this assumption.  Even pop king Elton John does not disappoint with his blues based vocals on the \\"Rock This House\\", the most rollicking track, and the track I was sure I would not listen to more than once.  Wrong! <br /> <br />This is first and foremost a B.B. King Album, and that is clear.  The other participants are very respectful and do not try to over-shadow the master in either vocals or guitar work.  Another thing for the guitar fans out there, is that there is a mention in the insert that anytime King is playing guitar with a guest guitarist, his guitar will come out of the right speaker.  This is good information.  I spent the day with my balance knob cycling back and forth isolating King against the likes of Clapton and Knopfler, and then letting those other players shine.  This little tidbit of information will enhance the enjoyment of hard-core guitar fans.  <br /> <br />

B000088E6D|5.0|I had heard a few of Michael Buble's songs and thought I'd try out a CD.  This CD is all I listen to now!  The songs are timeless and very relaxing, but up beat to listen to. A must-buy!

B00005OCMR|5.0|I've read so many reviews TRASHING the special effects of Tron and its plot. First of all, it's easy with our modern ILM and digital masterpieces like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Jurassic Park, etc. to criticize a movie made in 1982 but the bottom line is that the effects, for its time, were amazing!! I remember as a kid watching this movie with my mouth hanging open. I watched it, as a matter of fact, this week, on DVD and it still impresses me.  <br />The key to being thoughtful and critical of movies is to be able to watch them in the context of their time.  I could easily watch Star Trek episodes and say, \\"ha!! Look at that! Since our FX are so much better now days, that series isn't even relevent!!\\" That's, in a nutshell, what I read one reviewer saying, that the FX of Tron are corney by modern standards to it's irrelevent. Not at all..... <br />I think the plot, and keep in mind this IS a Disney movie, though simple, is a good one.  It deals with a big brother government that wants to make everyone think the same, live under one rule, if you're not with us you're against us, etc. kind of government. To be in good standing with the Master Control, one must not believe in the \\"users,\\" or, to the computer programs, 'God.'  So, atheism is the key to getting good training, promotion and success.  Those who oppose the MCP are treated like Roman Gladiators only to perish.  Flynn takes on an incarnation of sorts becoming a \\"user\\" and a \\"program\\" almost resembling a kind of computer Christ. Very interesting notion.  Neat parallel.  The movie if full of Christian-type allegories and overall is very entertaining.  <br />There is no sex, hurtful violence or garbage. Clean movie, I as an adult still love it, and it's in general a great flick. Give it a break folks!
B0007GAERG|5.0|THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI was what we've all been waithing to hear from Mariah Carey.  In this album, she let go of all her cares and composed a cd with 14 fabulous tracks. She begin this hot album with her first single \\"It's Like That\\", and from there every track after that one was bound to be on some billboard somewhere.  In this album Mariah selected carefully what she wanted to put on it, and her end result was far from great. The second song to hit the televison and radio stations was \\"We Belong Together\\", and every female everywhere has listened to this song plenty of times, while crying about the relationship with their significant other. The latest song that has the females in the clubs going crazy, and the males confused is \\"Shake it Off\\".  This song is terrific, as is all the songs on this album. Mariah Carey's latest cd is wonderful, she showed all her musical talents in the album, and in turn all females are happy to blast her cd loudly. There's a song for every occasion on the cd, and therefore this is the best album I believe she has produced.
B000099T2L|3.0|<br /> <br />                  <br />I reviewed this ablum upon it's release and i'm updating the review. I really give the album 3.5 stars.  This was Beyonce's first time out of the gate. The CD is a good effort for her 1st. It's filled with radio friendly pop and several well know talented Guest stars namely Jay-Z, Big Boi off OutKast and The Great and Late Luther Vandross among others. Jay-Z gave her street creditablity and an audience that would have been a little hard for her to reach. It would have been nice to have a little more Beyonce than the all star team but this helped insure the album would sell big and it has, 4 million to date. There are some highlites such as Be With You, Me, Myself and I and The Closer I get to you . Her writing and vocals are decent and she's getting better.  While she can carry a tune, her vocals are not as strong nor does she have the big powerhouse voice she's been credited with by critics who are in love with a certain part of her anatomy. But she does have the ability to deliver a song and she always gives a top notch right on the money never skips a beat performance. Some of the songs in the second half could be DC3 songs,which Dangeously in Love is. The album starts off fun and exciting and then turns into a dud.It becomes drown out and boring. Dangerously in love won 5 grammys and a ton of other awards. While I think it did deserve a grammy or 2, 5 was differently overkill. Hopefully Beyonce's next solo effort will be a little more creative and heartfelt. When she really expresses her real and true self, she'll gain the credit for being a serious artist. When the songs are real, she'll become real. Here's a run down track by track.  <br /> <br /> <br />Dangerously In Love  <br /> <br />1. Crazy in Love 5/5 - A completely enjoyable dance song with a Crazy old school horn sample and a hard driven beat. Jay-Z serves up a rapper's delite with his perfect verse giving it exactly what it needed. Vocals are good on this one butthe lyrics are pretty simple.  <br /> <br />2.Naughty Girl 2/5 - Good beat, Okay vocals but fails to  capture the feel of Donna Summer's orginal sexy and sensual version.  <br /> <br />3.Baby Boy 4/5 - Great beat, Banging Rap provided by Sean Paul(he made the song), B did her thing, was her 2nd #1.  <br /> <br />4. Hip Hop Star 5/5- Classic OutKast Flavor. She seduces Big Boi and Sleepy Brown on this one, Very funky.  <br /> <br />5. Be With You 5/5 - She did a really great job on this Bootsy Collins hit.  <br /> <br />6.Me,Myself,and I 4/5 - Great song, Great lyrics, wonderful vocal performance. She completely delivers on this cut. You can invision her finding this self discovery.Could have also been a DC3 song.  <br /> <br />7. Yes 3/5 - Typical song nothing special, could have been a DC3 song.  <br /> <br />8.Signs 4/5 -This is one from Missy, good job, great production and she pulls off the sexy vocals on this one.  <br /> <br />9.Speechless 4/5 - Great song, well written and beautifully sung. I think she acheived sexiness and sensuality on this cut.  <br /> <br />10.That's How You Like It 1/5 - This is the worst song on the album. She's accompanied by Jay-Z on this cheesy not worthy cut.  <br /> <br />11. The Closer I Get To You 5/5 - Fantasic Job. She's Blessed to sing along side The Great Luther Vandross and holds her own beautifully. I was really proud of her when I heard this cut. Great Job!!  <br /> <br />12. Dangerously in Love 2 - 2/5 Nothing special about this song. Made with DC3 1st time around. Displays the same flavor, nothing new.  <br /> <br />13. Beyonce Interlude - 3/5 A clear and honest reflection on how she feels for her special someone(Jay-Z).  <br /> <br />14. Gift From Virgo- 2/5 - Although the song is not good, it does let you in a bit to her personal side.   <br /> <br />15. Hidden Bonus Track Daddy 3/5 - A heartfelt tribute to Daddy.  <br /> <br />That's my review of Dangerously In Love. If your are a fan of hers or DC3 you'll enjoy it and if you like crazy in love don't expect the CD to be more of the same, it's not, but there are some cuts that are worthy. Music 1st and Image Last. Peace and Love!!! <br />  <br />  <br />
B000AL730Y|5.0|Paul has truly created a dark, brooding, introspective classic. It's as if he is sitting in front of you spilling out his heart. I agree with many that it does get better with each listen, however I enjoyed it from the first play. Nothing cute or \\"silly\\" about this music.  <br /> <br />There is no huge \\"radio friendly\\" hits, however I find all the songs to be solid without a clunker in the bunch (ok, English Tea is a slight incomplete throw away).  <br /> <br />The sound is tight, melancholy and mature (kind of funny to say Paul is now \\"mature\\" at 63), from the thumping opening number \\"Fine Line\\" to the beautiful \\"Jenny Wren\\" (yes, much like \\"Blackbird\\"), to my favorite song on the CD, the closing sweeping \\"Anyway\\".  <br /> <br />I encourage anyone who has \\"given up\\" on Paul to listen to this CD and give it a chance. I'd also recommend recent stand outs like \\"Flaming Pie\\" (Beatle \\"esc\\" mode) and \\"Run Devil Run\\" (Rocker mode).  <br /> <br />Paul is making some of his best music since the early 1970's and this started with his \\"Flaming Pie\\" CD. No doubt this will be a big hit with fans and critics (for once!) a like. I also see a ton of Grammy's in Paul's future.  <br /> <br />Pure excellence! Thanks Paul.  <br />

B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles experienced an overwhelming twist of fate and undeniable grow up process in their career. Now that the psychedelic roads have been transited, they decide to turn aside and explore new possibilities into the classic lyricism. There is something in their minds about the uncertainness and riddles about the their future as ensemble. Every one of them has grown up by his own way and the differences seem to be major than their collective ambition. All of them know they established a road, and the first signals of rivalries begin to appear in the horizon.<br /><br />I was just a middle teenager when I had that dark presentiment listening these songs. They seemed to be preparing to their big audience all over the world, that the end was coming. It' s hard to express in words to all that new generation who did not live that age, but I beg you to imagine the circumstances without looking forward; and for those all readers who lived those ages, may be it is easier to guess what I mean. The obscure sensation of Farewell remains as a quiet and stormy cloud, above us.<br /><br />On the other hand, the themes of this prestigious, simply are emblematic and flaring: \\"Get back\\", \\"Let it be\\" and \\"The long and winding road\\" are reasons (just by themselves) more than enough to acquire this historic album.<br /><br />What else can I add?<br /><br />The rest is silence.<br /><br />And let it be!
B000646MNE|5.0|I absolutly love this series and can't wait to buy the collectors edition, since I haven't bought any of the other DVDs yet.  I do have a question though, and I can't seem to find it anywhere: Will the collectors edition have all of the extras on the first box set, plus the new extras, or will the new extras replace the extras that were on the first box set?  like, all the commentary and others that were included in the first box set?  Thanks!

B000AL730Y|5.0|Chaos And Creation In The Back Yard, Paul McCartney's 20th studio recording since The Beatles, marks an end to a nearly four-year hiatus since his last studio recording, 2001's platinum certified Driving Rain. The new 13-track album is co-produced by Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis and Beck) and McCartney, and was recorded in London and Los Angeles over the course of the past two years<br /><br />Chaos And Creation In The Back Yard is a return to the basics for McCartney. The album successfully fuses his undeniable song writing talents with his unparalleled musicianship. In fact, McCartney is credited with playing the majority of the instruments on the album, which is somewhat reminiscent of McCartney when he was credited with playing all of the instruments. They include the drums, guitar, bass, keyboards, as well as many of the less traditional instruments such as block flute, harmonium and flugelhorn.<br /><br />Chaos And Creation In The Back Yard is a mix of up-tempo piano driven McCartney instant classics such as the new single \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Promise To You Girl\\" and more introspective darker tracks such as \\"At The Mercy\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\". One of the many highlights is a track entitled, \\"Jenny Wren\\", which Paul describes as \\"daughter of Blackbird\\", as well as \\"Follow Me\\", which McCartney debuted at The Glastonbury Festival, while on his '04 Summer European Tour.
B000002U94|4.0|Classic live recording.  A cd that you can listen to from start to finish and a big finish it is with \\"Let It Rock\\"....Bob Seger could write songs and it is evident here as this live recording could easily be part two of a greatest hits release.  Put this one on, turn it up, and you won't be disappointed.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I was intrigued by this album when it was released and listened to it many times throught the years. It is standing up to the test of time exceptionally well and giving it less then 5 stars is denying our heritage. It is an essential work and with all its controversial elements, it also contains some of the most brilliant moments of progressive rock.
B00005JL1C|1.0|I just don't get this movie. Lea Thompson looks appetizing as Amanda Jones and for some reason dumps super cool rich kid Hardy Jens to go out with some dork who is friends with a drummer that looks like she digs chicks. Hardy Jens is pretty much me in high school, but with more money. I wasn't rich in high school, but I was incredibly good looking and carried myself with a quiet confidence that some called arrogance. In the real world, Lea Thompson would never have left me for a poor tool that likes to draw tippy the turtle. The only turtle she would have wanted to see was the giant tortuss in my pants. This movie is such a joke in that this isn't how the real world works. I'm sure some girl in Wisconsin loves this movie thinking that romance is alive and well. I hate to break the news, but hot girls like guys like me, JAbs,Kroll and Burns. They don't dig kids that are art geeks. At the end, the art tool ends up with the drummer chick while Hardy Jens keeps having the best pary. They don't show it, but Hardy Jens probably hooked up with a couple of chicks at the party. I totally understand Hardy Jens. It's hard to have to deal with people that are so far beneath where you are at. Hardy Jens was doing Amanda Jones a favor by dating her. Have you ever heard of great players bringing teammates up to their level. That's what Hardy Jens did for those around him. He brought them up to his level. I think people caught up in this movie miss that fact that popular, good looking people need to surround themselves with others like them. It keeps balance. People need to rewatch this movie and understand that Hardy Jens is all that is right with popular people and this movie is just not possible in real life.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This was imho the best CG movie of the year.  As an avid Final Fantasy fan, I can say that if you've played the original game you MUST see this movie. <br /> <br />I'm sure many of you have seen the blasphemy that was The Spirits Within.  If you're expecting it to be as boring and overdramatic... no.  Each scene is filled with action and blessed eye-candy, and I must say this was worth the seven or eight year wait (since the original PlayStation game).  The plot IS deep, and fills in nearly all of the plot-holes the original game left open. <br /> <br />I do wish SQEX would have used the other characters more (ie. Cid, Yuffie, Barret, Vincent, Red XII, and Reeve/Cait Sith), however with all of the pluses to this movie I would hardly consider the lack of appearences from the other characters a huge drawback. <br /> <br />Even if you haven't played the game, you will be pleased by all you see.  I suggest this to everyone looking for a good action or CG movie.  It really is just that awesome.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Beautiful comedy with terrific kung fu, very nice movie to spend time on watching it by whole family on sunday night
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Sigur Ros are my favourite group, and this album doesn't disappoint me. But I don't believe it is their best work. It's certainly beautiful and fresh, but only a few of the pieces actually make me think and wonder. Like the fact that Track 4 appears to be a reprise of Track 3, and Track 5 has a strange, hard to pin down structure, like a piece of music you might hear in a dream, some incongruous oompah music surfacing like a stray theme from the subconscious. To describe this album as Sigur Ros's pop album or rock album would be foolish. Hoppipolla is their most pop-oriented piece, but the rest of the album doesn't stray too far into that territory. Glosoli is very much classic Sigur Ros, starting quiet then rising to a stirring crescendo with guitars crashing in. Often their music is about moments of epiphany, of celebration. Even at its darkest, there are inspiring revelations. The darkness is mostly kept at bay on this album, though the final few pieces bring a level of contemplation to the work. Andvari is a particularly fine, string-led piece. Milano and Gong are pieces that have been played live for some time. Milano appears here in somewhat abbreviated form, but nevertheless is pretty effective, its twin moments of epiphany in tact. The album as a whole is sonically impressive, with better production and mix than the previous two albums. It's perhaps derogatory to describe it as ear candy, but it works on that level. One of the main virtues of the last album was its stripped-down approach. That is not the case with Takk. The kitchen sink has been thrown at the material. It depends on a listener's taste whether they prefer less or more. ()was brilliantly monochrome. Agaetis Byrjun and Takk are lavish technicolour. My own instinct is for less, but there are moments when I like the multicoloured approach taken here. But I doubt that anything here can really stand up to Alafoss (Untitled 5), Ebow (Untitled 6), Dauoalagio (Untitled 7) or Popplagio (Untitled 8). They don't have the same substance and slow-burning majesty. Takk is certainly a more immediate proposition, but it is a touch lightweight in comparison. Needless to say, this album is better than anything produced by any other band in the past couple of years. Perhaps in time I will view it as a masterpiece, I don't know. But for now, it falls slightly short of their past glories.
B00012BSHG|4.0|The pool holds plenty of water and is colorful and inviting for the kids!  The padding on the bottom is especially nice to cushion harder surfaces.  Granted--a lot of inflation was needed, but we also bought the hand pump and that did the job (and gave us some exercise--but it did not wear us out--and we're grandparents)!  I found the plug drain in the bottom no problem at all.  We pulled the plug and came back later and all that was left was a little puddle in one corner. The height of the sides was great, but I would have liked it a little longer in length.  Bottom line--this was a great buy!
B0002X314C|5.0|This has been one of my best CD purchases this year. Some of the topics he sings about aren't anything I can relate to (e.g.cheating), but nevertheless, it sounds good. The \\"Used to love U\\" song is my favorite. It's fun and angry at the same time. Overall there are many good songs on one CD. John Legend has a distinctive voice. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.
B000063147|5.0|Hey everyone, this is a7x's 1st album and its great, i've heard people say crap about this one but I like it. My friends don't like it, they just like waking the fallen but i like it, it's got a bit more punk-ish feel than waking the fallen. But yeah this is a good album except for the slow piano songs but otherwise good. I'm still not sure what genre it is but if i had to say i would say uh....punk-metal? Yeah, buy this along with waking the fallen and you'll be happy.
0679805273|5.0|When my children graduated from high school, I bought each of them this book and had the guests at their party sign it for them. The book itself is a wonderful ode to both the scariness and exhilaration of growing up and being in charge of your own life. The guests loved it and spent a lot of time making it a keepsake for my children by picking out pictures or phrases that they loved and then writing a few words of encouragement or congratulations. A marvelously inspirational book and a great gift for children of all ages. Enjoy!
0895260131|5.0|Personally I found the information on the Quran and Mohammed nauseating and depressing. I think there should be a sign posted on the front of every Mosque, \\"Abandon hope, All Who Enter\\"! We are dealing with people who's core belief are to subjugate and murder and conquer other Human Beings. Mercy, Forgivness and Meekness is not in their creed. We would do well as a Nation to keep this in mind. To ignore this threat will be the genocide of Civilization. Islam Is a Fascism that has been rampant for a thousand years. A Fascism that began with a small Band of murders and thieves seeking justification for their actions and Spencer backs up all his points with indisputable direct references to the Quran. <br /> <br />GR Godin

B000089RVX|4.0|I had a huge liking towards this CD.  I liked it, because of its haunting lyrics and sound...that were dark and \\"unhappy\\".  I found that it had reflected a lot towards my feelings when in states of bad moods.  What I found was that during the first 5 or 6 songs, they're catchy, and had their own sound and originality to them...but later in the CD, some of the songs were beginning to sound the same.  I also found that you can listen to this CD for so long....but overall I enjoyed it.

B00025ETIW|5.0|A lot of people today have only heard of My Chemical Romance from MTV or the fourteen year old next door. I got into them from neither. I just simply picked up the cd at a store and gave it a listen.  <br /> <br />   At first, I pretty much hated the cd. I mean, I like AFI and Muse, the Misfits and the Sex Pistols. This was too poppy, to packaged for a MTV audience that would listen to it now that \\"punk\\" and emo are popular. But then I gave it a second try a few weeks later.  <br /> <br />   After actually listening to the lyrics, paying attention to the music, and finding out more about the band, its earlier album, and their history, I realized that I was hooked. Yeah, it's not London Calling, or The Black Album, but it was good. The songs are catchy, but push the bounds of what one would normally hear in a \\"popular\\" band. For those who are willing to explore beyond 'Helena' and 'I'm not Okay', they can find songs about undead revenge, murder in a gunfight, the dangers of prison, and a man willing to do ANYTHING to be with the love of his life.  <br /> <br />   I'll admit, I know most of the lyrics to all the songs. And the record is rather emo. But emo, (and to some extent, music in general) is about emotion. It's about hanging your heart and mind out in the open, and going through a cathartic purge to rid yourself of all those hopeless, depressed, angry feelings that people get after a breakup, death in the family, etc. <br /> <br />    So the band might not get any airplay when the next year rolls around. Those people who only listen to My Chemical Romance because they're popular will be gone, and emo, punk, screamo and hardcore will be underground once again. So what! If the music is good, and the fans can relate to it, who cares if the band is number one on MTV, or will never get beyond playing clubs and out of a small indie label.  <br /> <br />    My Chemical Romance is a band that will hopefully last beyond their popularity on MTV. The music is solid, and filled with powerful imagery and lyrics that most people can relate to (if they've had a bad breakup, depressed point in their life, hell, had a crappy time in high school). Life isn't all roses, dearies, and bands like My Chemical Romance provide an outlet when things aren't looking up. <br /> <br />   All I can say is; when did the music stop being about relating to the fans? When did it NOT become okay to have an image? To acknowledge that a band's music combines many genres, and manages to reach a wide fan base? Hell, to admit that they want to be successful? Green Day is no less guilty then My Chemical Romance in these areas. People just need to get over the hype and label advertising and just give them a listen. Like me, they might be suprised that a \\"popular\\" band can make  an ablum of good, entertaining music that is full of hooks, and probably wouldn't be so controversial if it had come out on a indie label. <br /> <br />   My top songs: <br /> 'To The End' 9/10 <br /> 'You Know what they do to Guys like us in Prison' 10/10 <br /> 'Ghost of You' 9/10 <br /> 'Thanks for all the Venom' 10/10 <br /> 'Hang 'em High' 8.5/10 <br /> 'Cemetery Drive' 8.5/10
B0007GAERG|3.0|The emancipation of Mimi by Mariah Carey is one of the best albums that she has ever made. Her new pop cd is a sure comeback. This new album does make the statement that Mariah Carey is one of the best female artist of our times. Her album is a combination of upbeat songs and also emotional slow songs. She comes together with some of the top rappers such as snoop dog and nelly and twista. Mariah Carey new songs are already hitting the air ways such as We Belong Together, Shake It Off, and It's Like That. Mariah Carey's new album is going to bring her back to the charts and all over the air ways.
0698118308|4.0|This book by Eric Carle is a simple book that I believe could be used many different ways.  You could use this book in weather themes, during a cloud unit, or to stretch the imagination. <br /> <br />You could follow this book with an activity in which your children do their own cloud making, possibly out of cotton balls.   <br /> <br />I think that this book is fun and I really enjoy the illustrations.  I would definitely suggest having this book as a part of your classroom library. <br />
B000AL730O|1.0|I swore I wouldn't buy another McCartney album after being totatlly disappointed with \\"Run Devil Run\\" and \\"Driving Rain.\\"  But I gave in to the temptation, hoping against hope I wouldn't be let down a third time. <br /> <br />I was let down a third - and final - time. <br /> <br />Oh my God, what a bad album!  Mindless dribble, poor production, lousy orchestration, it goes on and on.  I swear, I knew the next lyric before it was sung!  Trite, overused, uninspired libretto. <br /> <br />So, with that said, I recommend that no one buy this piece of trash.  The music of McCartney - enjoy the \\"old\\" stuff because the well has run dry.....
B000AL730O|5.0|This album is briliant. The last two albums paul released can't compare to this masterpiece. This is the closest thing to the way the beatles sounded (pauls best creative time in my opinion) scince he recorded McCartney(self titled album). The compilation of different instruments is where the beatles realy brought me to see their creativity and shows me that paul still has it. Rock on paul   see you in concert the 27th in boston brother!!
B000AU9UYM|3.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" to take the foul taste out of my mouth left by Joel Schumacher's versions. Christian Bale looks the part of Bruce Wayne, and you can believe he's a spoiled millionaire, oh that's right, he's a billionaire now, who secretly believes in noblesse oblige. However the movie overall was too much of a recap. The idea of the brooding Batman is getting old too.  <br /> <br />When Bob Kane and Bill Finger first established Batman's tragic background it was almost as an after-thought, tacked on to their sixth issue, followed by a seperate adventure. I would suspect the idea of the hero as an orphan was to make it's easier for him to keep a secret identity. We can't have his mother sewing his name into his Bat-panties.  Batman is like the gunslinger from the old Westerns who saddles up to the saloon bar to say, \\"I'm looking for the man who shot my pa.\\"  <br /> <br />The \\"dark Batman\\" appeared well before Frank Miller, and came out almost immediately after the campy TV series to help us forget the show. I suspect they were trying to compete with Marvel Comics moody heroes like the Thing, the Hulk, Captain America, and Spiderman. The first two were monsters, CA was out of time and place, and if Spiderman's aunt wasn't in the hospital, he was fighting his allergies. However, \\"Batman Begins\\" is nothing to sneeze at.  <br />
6304119046|5.0|I first saw this film when I was sixteen.  I can't say I understood everything about it, but I found it very intriguing.  Somehow the snowball scene stuck with me the most.  Since then, I've seen it a few more times and read a fair bit about it.  There aren't many films that would lead me to do that.  I have to say it's a film that really offers a lot, to me at least.  Each time I've watched it I've gotten something more out of it and have been deeply affected by it. <br />
B00005JLEU|4.0|The imaginative quality and animation in this movie are first rate...this is a  must see. The subject matter applies best to children over 4 yrs old since there are spirits, and some mild people eating scenes.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|\\"Welcome To Jamrock\\" lives up to the hype surrounding it, giving the listener a wonderfully produced reggae album.  Damian Marley proves himself as a highly talented musician, furthering the legacy that comes with the Marley name.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's 'X&Y' is British Pop perfection, a beautifully crafted but flawed masterwork not afraid to take musical risks, but alas, not courageous enough to take lyrical risks. The best tracks on the album are the ones that raise the bar of British Pop: 'Fix You', my favorite track for its emotional lyrics and music, 'Talk', for its inventive lyrics and catchy chorus, 'Square One', which has multiple layers of beautiful music, and 'Twisted Logic', with its astounding guitar chords. The rest of the songs on the album follow Coldplay's musical formula in top form while staying safe lyrically (which is strongly the case with 'Speed of Sound' and 'A Message'). 'X & Y'is ambitious, thoughtful, and musically strong, making up for some lyrical repetitiveness that gives the album its minor but forgivable flaw. It is highly recommended for fans who preferred 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' to their debut album 'Parachutes'.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Rs are one of the very few artistic bands in the industry. They have a sound that is more than just unique.    Unlike many bands, Sigur Rs don't whore themselves about the place giving false impressions about what they can deliver. In fact, you'll rarely even see a photograph of the band. Their marketing seems to consist of telling a few people and letting word spread. A very risky way to approach things but these guys are quite extraordinary and don't really require anything more.     Takk is Icelandic for \\"thanks\\" and, although there is still somewhat a of material we heard on their last album ( ), it is a lot more energetic and there is even a track which you could dance to if you were so inclined. The band have some rather complicated song and sound structures and I wanted to know how they approach their song writing. The pieces are so intricate that I couldn't even hazard a guess.      It would not come as a suprise if many of you have not heard of Sigur Rs. They like to keep a rather low profile with the idea that this will ensure that only serious music lovers tend to hear about them, but I believe that everyone should have a listen to Takk, their forth album and their truly best ever.     Takk is the record to justify every amazing claim ever laid at this band's door. Huge and intimate, this is more than just music, this is ART, at last.
B000002J1Y|4.0|1973 was a good year to be a Yes fan. Maybe too good; the double 'Tales....' was followed quickly by the triple whammy of Yessongs. Possibly, this avalanche of vinyl proved too much for even the most ardent lentil-munching tree hugger, because from here on Yes evolved from Yes the band to Yes the product; changing line-ups, different sounds down through the years,  all under the brand name Yes. So this album captures Yes just at that point where they were at the apex of their powers as a band, a complete unit. So what about the music? I feel it definitely helps if you are familiar with Yes's studio albums (Fragile, Close to the Edge) and not the other way around; this probably wouldn't be a good place to start to get the know Yes, though its certainly not in the 'completist' realm (I feel that Yesshows belongs more in that category). This live set has a thundering rawness that can only be captured live, and is refreshing because it feels like a live album. Its somewhat overwhelming, a bit hard to take in all at once, but therein lies its charms; the intensity of Jon Anderson's vocals or some of Howe's stunning guitar work reveal themselves over repeated listenings.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's new platter \\"Howl\\". I've been analyzing this record with the other BRMC's albums and I find that \\"Howl\\" is a very logical progression, whether temporary or permanent, in their musical career path. These guys always had soul and the songs on this latest disc are just fantastic examples of the depth of their songwriting and musical abilities. And I'm a sucker for experimental albums (for lack of a better term), from U2's \\"Pop\\" to Pearl Jam's \\"No Code\\" to Alice In Chains \\"Jar of Flies\\" to Jesus And Mary Chain's \\"Stoned And Dethroned\\"....I just love these less commercial albums where you can play them over and over again and never play them out.<br /><br />That's how I view BRMC's \\"Howl\\". This record is simply amazing.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This is definitely the most entertaining film of 2005, by the end of it, I was wanting to see more. The music is superb and fitting for each scene. Although you might not understand the plot that well if you've never played Final Fantasy VII, the action scenes really are enjoyable. Square-Enix poured their hearts into this project and made an amazing film. Buy this for your DVD collection, you will not be disappointed.

This book tells you what Jewish people had to go through in those troubled times.  This past summer, me and my family went to Amsterdam and we visited the Anne Frank house.  I was so excited!  I couldn't believe, that so many people had to live in such cramped conditions.  Thank You Anne Frank!!!

0316286850|5.0|A timeless classic.  Kevyn Aucoin is one of the most talented make-up artists of all time.  The looks he creates are gorgeous and inspiring.  He gives you the option to chose products from any cosmetic line rather than being forced into one line.  This is a great book for someone who is looking to advance their make-up application.  Anyone who is truly interested in make-up and creating classic faces would appreciate this treasure.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|The action was good in this movie, but everything else was crap. <br /> <br />The plot isn't anything special. They go to Africa for some coins and they end up having to stop a virus from destroying everything. It's really not that original. <br /> <br />The characters are weak. Steve Zahn does a good job, but his antics have grown old. Matthew Mccounaghey(does anyone know how to spell this?) is cool. Penelope Cruz deserves an academy award. Just kidding, she sucked.  <br /> <br />As for anything I didn't mention, assume it was awful.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie caught me by complete surprise.  I was expecting a typical dumb teen flick about a lovable nerd with unfortunate hair, slacker wardrobe, and a silly name reminiscent of Yahoo Serious!, but this film is totally its own animal.  Some reviewers have likened it to a male WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE (far from it) or to early Jim Jarmusch.  It's better, in its own way, than both.<br /><br />The Jarmusch comparison I get, though you could as easily, and as superficially, compare this film's director, Jared Hess, to fellow BYU-alum Neal LaBute.  Or maybe Hess was influenced by Renoir or Kurosawa or Pasolini, who knows?  (Though clearly not by Tarantino.)  And while it's true that when Jarmusch started his career he tended to do scenes in one long take, with fixed camera angles, mostly (or so he's said) to save money on film stock, and that Jared Hess may have had some of the same budgetary restrictions, I don't think that has anything to do with the way the film was shot.  And I'll tell you why: there is a knowing, almost insouciant intelligence behind the mise-en-scene of every camera angle, and of every action that takes place within each frame of this film.<br /><br />For example, late in the film there's a shot of a road in Idaho, seen from a distance.  The only action?  A yellow school bus enters frame on the left, leisurely travels through the middle of the shot, then exits.  That's it.  There's no real reason for that shot to be there.  It doesn't further the plot, it does nothing to develop the relationships between the characters, all of which means that technically it's a \\"waste\\" of film.<br /><br />So why is it there?  Because when you live in a small town in Idaho (as I have), sometimes watching the school bus go by might be the highlight of your morning.  Some Idahoans (and I expect some Iowans and even most small town Californians or New Yorkers) tend to notice these things.<br /><br />The shot also runs counter to the usual Hollywood storytelling style, which would go something like this:<br /><br />EXTERIOR: Road.  A yellow school bus enters then crosses the frame.<br /><br />  CUT TO:<br /><br />INTERIOR - The Bus.  Napoleon and Deb are sitting on a bench, too shy to talk to one another.  In the b.g. Summer and her coterie are happily making fliers for the election....(etc.)<br /><br />By inserting just such an (apparently meaningless) shot into his film, and by playing against our expectations of what cinematic grammar dictates should follow (a scene inside the bus), Hess plays a game with the audience, drawing us in, making us into another character in the story, if you will, because in our forcibly detached observations of the action our minds need to fill in the blanks the way a small town observer with nothing else to do is forced to watch a local school bus until it moves out of sight.  With just one shot (though there are many others like it) Hess has turned us all into denizens of small town Idaho.<br /><br />What really got to me, though, even more than the throwaway shot of the school bus, or the amazing dance \\"skit\\" Napoleon performs at the election rally, is the game of tetherball he plays with Deb, the girl he likes, at the very end of the film.<br /><br />It starts off as a lame, incredibly awkward back-and-forth, as if the two actors had never played the game before.  Or perhaps as if the director could only afford to do this scene in one take and hadn't had time to let the actors rehearse beforehand.  But the way that little game of tetherball ends, and the way the camera slowly pulls back as it builds to that ending, you're reminded of the way N.D. threw Summer's campaign button down the school hall.  He did it awkwardly, yes (which is the way he does almost everything).  But he also did it with all his might.  He threw it as hard as he could.<br /><br />So as he starts to \\"cream\\" Deb at tetherball you grin and realize that this scene sums up what the entire movie (and what the character of Napoleon Dynamite) is all about.  He loves Deb, so he starts off playing as awkwardly as she does.  But in the end he can't help himself.  He has to hit that ball as hard as he can.  As he does, Deb ducks under it, a little nervously at first, then with a kind of proud wonder at how hard this boy she likes can hit the ball.  It ends up being an awkward teenage love song and more of a dance of joy than the solo he does at the election rally.  And you don't get that kind of result--that distillation of character and theme into one cinematic moment--by sheer accident or through a lack of money or rehearsal time.<br /><br />There's a reason this little film has attained cult status.

0393307050|5.0|The Aubrey Maurin Series kicks off in grand fashion with this, the first book: Master and Commander. I was first made aware of this book by watching the movie and because interested enough to purchase it. I was not in store for both the entertaining and frustrating moments which awaited me. <br /> <br />It's hard for me to place exactly how I feel about this book at present. I just finished it today so perhaps more thought could have gone into this review, but I usually feel that these initial feelings are correct.  <br /> <br />The book begins in Port Mahon, a British controlled island off the eastern coast of Spain. We are introduced to the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin) rather quickly and are then whisked off into the world of 1800 Europe. Patrick O'Brian did a simply fantastic job of writing this book in a fashion that a contemporary literate seaman of the 1800s would be able to understand it completely. Rigging and locations in the ship are presented with very little explanation from the very beginning and I found myself (like others in these reviews) quickly lost in the technical jargon that so heavily populates this entire series. While you do begin to have some familiarity with all of this it is still good to have some nautical dictionary nearby in order to gain a better understanding.  <br /> <br />I most enjoyed the detailed descriptions O'Brian uses to give as accurate a picture as possible of life on the seas: it's cramped, it's loud, it's dangerous. O'Brien is able to capture a fantastic picture that is used as a backdrop to exemplify the exploits of Jack Aubrey and his hot headed Lieutenant James Dillon as they capture French and Spanish ships in daring raids against impossible odds.  <br /> <br />There are two characteristics of this book which I found to be most problematic:  <br /> <br />The first being the the extreme use of nautical terminology which can be extremely confusing if you are not intimately familiar with sailingships. I found myself quickly lost in the two climactic moments at the end which involve multipe ships because I simply had no idea what was going on aside from a lot of death and destruction.  <br /> <br />The second problem is the extraordinarily abrupt changing of events which O'Brian uses throughout the book. The reader can be whisked to opposite ends of the boat to a different person's perspective seemingly without warning. This occurs regularly and requires the reader to constantly go back a few pages to find out when the transition occurred.  <br /> <br />As an addendum, I have heard that Post Captain (the 2nd book) is a little more easy to follow. <br /> <br />Overall, though, I recommend this book as a fantastic forray into historical fiction. While you do need some interest in the topic to help carry you through, if you have that you'll find a great adventure ahead of you and many additional books to carry you through.

B00000AFFI|5.0|1. i chose to review this because it is my favorite of polly's records. it happens to be one of the best albums ever. <br />2. the drum programming is very dirty. i always like grimey wu-tang style drums that have distortion and filtering and EQ knobs turned in the wrong direction. there are lots of these little sonic treats sprinkled throughout the lp. sometimes they jump out at you like bones breaking and sometimes they are little skittish noises and samples. whatever it is, it succeeds in evoking raw animalistic pleasure. it could have sounded dated but by grimey-ing up he beats they sound like organic creatures's  voices than electronic drums. <br />3. this record came out post ok computer. everyone was trying to top that record and since then the approach to music making from most artists has been about constructing good albums.  <br />4. With the technology at hand, sound manipulation is so easy that virtually anything you hear in your head can be put onto \\"tape\\".  In the hands of a psycho, the results can be dangerous but far more rewarding. in polly's case, she takes full advantage of the technology, lyrically and sonically projecting her psychosis onto these characters. i would say she is a deeper more soulful trent reznor. also more terrifying and sensual than reznor.  <br /> <br />This album is for anyone who wants to explore themselves through musical experimentation. Beyond it's dark exterior and the initial horrors we encounter in her stories, at its core, it is a record that heals wounds by exposing them.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This album went completely over my head. I found it very hard to relate to the problems and issues Miss Carey sings about, but this could be due to the fact I am indeed a mouse mat, and have difficulty comprehending  most things. Lacking ear drums also meant I could not hear Miss Careys inimitable wailing.    I'll give it 5 stars because this CD would probably make an excellent drinks coaster. Now thats something I can relate to!
0440178002|5.0|When I first read Shogun in 1994, a Japanese girl who went to my school saw me with the novel and asked how I liked it. I told her I liked it a lot. She said that's fine but keep in mind it has about as much validity in relation to Japanese history as the tales of King Arthur do to Britain of that era.<br /><br />Point taken.<br /><br />The basic premise is this: In the year 1600, an English ship's pilot named Blackthorne, while leading his privateering vessel across the Pacific in search of the Spanish treasure fleet, crash-lands on the shores of the great island kingdom of Japan. Blackthorne and his crew are catpured by the cruel Japanese samurai and held captive---sometimes under torture. Japan is at this time barely a generation removed from first contact with Europeans, and has a delicate alliance of sorts with the Spanish, with whom they trade to mutual (though self-serving) advantage. Blackthorne and his crew find themselves confronted by Spanish religious figures who seek to convince the Japanese of the danger the \\"heathen\\" English present to this island of the gods. However, Blackthrone interests one of the island's two principal warlords,  who interrogates Blackthorne and finds interest in him. Blackthorne is reprieved from a certain sentence of death and is given opportunity to learn Japanese customs and the Japanese language. He becomes embroiled in the seething politics of the island, then on the brink of a potentially terrible civil war between rival factions. Blackthorne at first desires only to return home to England, preferably with many riches in tow, but gradually he comes to feel the native way of life is superior to that of his own people. He falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman, serves the warlord who has elevated him in status to that of samurai, and then becomes part of the intricate, dangerous struggle for survival and dominance underway around him in a hostile, gloriously unique island empire.<br /><br />Shogun has a highly entertaining story with many released human emotions, enough action to keep it from ever getting boring, and in its details on Japanese culture and the religious/political clashes boiling over among the competing European nations who are visiting Japan for the first time, it is still, fantasy aside, the kind of novel to vanish inside for a couple of wonderful weeks.<br /><br />I really loved the people inside Shogun and found its story excellent in virtually every detail. The villainous Lord Yabu has to be one of historical fiction's mightiest examples of a figure one loves to hate. He went a long way toward stealing the story with his tireless ambition and unabashedly evil heart. The east-west love story that found its way into the center of this story meant less to me than details of the coming civil war, and I almost thought it at times got in the way of other parts of the plot I was more interested in and wanted to see move forward.<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that in Shogun, as in the other Clavell novel I read, \\"getting there is half the fun\\". By that I mean the events as described form the basis of what makes up Shogun, and ultimately there IS no final act here. All through the novel I kept waiting for war to come. I kept expecting that so much of what I was reading was preparation to the conflict for supremacy that was the soul of the novel. But not so. Shogun ends before the long-expected war unfolds, and that was slightly unanticipated.<br /><br />This is a complex, interwoven novel of races and civilizations meeting for the first time, of events macrocosmic and microcosmic, and of mutual culture shock in a foreign time and place where a number of remarkable people are cast head-first into events much larger than they are, and for which their pasts provide them with little preparation.rtaining story with many released human emotions, enough action to keep it from ever getting boring, and in its details on Japanese culture and the religious/political clashes boiling over among the competing European nations who are visiting Japan for the first time, it is still, fantasy aside, the kind of novel to vanish inside for a couple of wonderful weeks. <br /> <br />I really loved the people inside Shogun and found its story excellent in virtually every detail.

B00005R5G9|4.0|This is one of my favorite fun movies to watch when I'm in the right mood. It's not Casablanca, but it has fun, quirky, memorable characters and a heartwarming plot and conclusion. <br /> <br />It's also one of Kim Cattrall's (Star Trek VI, Sex and the CIty) earlier appearances, and takes great advantage of her ability to be impish. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie that fits the \\"romantic comedy\\" niche defined by Meg Ryan, you may find this movie too quirky and not mushy enough for you. If you are looking for a high-fantasy movie with careful detailed continuity, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are looking for lowbrow slapstick like the Police Academy movies, you won't find as much of it as you might think from the cast names. <br /> <br />If you are excessively politically correct - say, you hated the funny Indian accented guy in Short Circuit - you will find plenty to complain about in this film too. <br /> <br />But if you still have a sense of fun and the ability to relax and suspend disbelief, you may also find this among your favorite movies, and want a copy to watch when you are in an impish mood.
B00005OAIE|2.0|Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.      If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.    I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity.  However, Mayer has crossed the line.  Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.    If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off.  But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression.

B00000J7SS|3.0|As another reviewer indicated, Davis needed to do something to get Jazz moving parallel to Hendrix. (notice the similar cover art and title language).  <br /> <br />Quality of material was a secondary goal and is debatable with interpretations that include: abstract, ambient, and experimental.   <br /> <br />What is more clear is that the main album goal (and a successful one) was to remove both structure and instrumentation restrictions from Jazz. <br /> <br />As a powerful legacy, the emergence of the supergroups, Mahavishu Orchestra, Return To Forever, and Weather Report, would virtually redefine the Jazz audience.
B000AL730O|4.0|... and that's meant as supreme praise for what is a bluer, more minor key McCartney than I have ever heard solo or with the Beatles. At times, the sophistication of the key and tempo changes are so sublime, it's been at least since Costello's efforts with Bachrach that any songwriter has sought so sincerely to elevate the craft of what he does. McCartney's newest is very different from the celebration of his new romance in DRIVING RAIN. This is more a man in his 60's taking stock of life, allegorically mind you, as this isn't a confessional type of record. But it puts me in mind of the incomparable John Tams, whose latest THE RECKONING, is just out as well. Tams writes with a wizened gaze upon the world, and while never one to jot down a silly love song, his tender moments resonate all the more truly for the experiences he's undergone. <br />That's what has struck me time and time again in the course of this McCartney disc. This isn't Wings. This is the man who wrote \\"Yesterday,\\" older, wiser, an artist who has lost a wife, seen his children grow and move on, become a grandfather, reflect on the gifts his parents left him to lead his life. Thus, you have a poem/song \\"Jenny Wren\\" that is as sublime as \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\" \\"English Tea\\" is a William Walton reflection on the civilities of what used to be England, as charming as \\"Penny Lane.\\" \\"How Kind of You,\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before\\" are love songs from a man whose life has been lived with reflection. There is a depth to both that is a bit disarming, as though McCartney is indeed lifting the veil on his interior life. In short, this is a profound collection of songs, none of which are soaked with hooks, but all of which tend to live with you long after the CD has played through. <br />There is a difference as well when McCartney handles all the instruments. You'll notice a less spontaneous live band approach. In its own way, that adds to the feel and atmosphere of the record. It should be interesting to see how these songs play out on the upcoming concert tour. They will, of necessity, change. But within the confines of these sessions, I think McCartney's solo efforts have been done with deliberation. Thus, when strings arrive, courtesy of the direction of British composer Joby Talbot, they usher in a texture and a quality that does to these songs what the quartet did to \\"Yesterday\\" way back when. Give McCartney the credit to introduce a dudek to a ballad. The touch and sound of that instrument is a stroke of genius. It has always been in the little things that McCartney has been most amazing, and you'll find that true throughout this disc. <br />Like Clapton, McCartney has had to consider what to do now that the tribute to George, the NYC Benefit and the Moscow concerts are over. Funny that Clapton should turn in a stereotypical Macca record, and Paul should reach down and realize the promise that he was in heart and soul the very embodiment of Cole Porter, perhaps bluer. I would never have expected this from Paul. I'm glad it's here. It may or may not reach the commercial appeal of other discs, but for those of us reflecting on our lives, it will live longer, with many tunes to mull along the long and winding road.
B000009RC2|5.0|Mclaughlin's association with Miles Davis served as preparation for carrying Hendrix over into Jazz and the beginning of Jazz-Rock fusion.      What resulted was the first of the fusion supergroups and this debut album.    Noonward Race, Vital Transformation, and most of all ,Dance of the Maya (with the borrowed guitar sound) are standouts.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|The special effects were great; however, the plot was slow moving. I was bored with the story line. John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down. What was good about the movie is the fact that it showed that you don't have to work your way into heaven. It showed that although you may have a lot of faults, God will accept you where you are in life. All you have to do is accept Him. <br /> <br />
0062502182|4.0|im personally drawn to portugese authors.  in both the works of jose saramago and paulo i sense a very strong current:  both of these men have a gift for capturing the essential human spirit in prose.  to me, the alchemist was a dance; seamless blending of wordplay and personality, reaching for a portrait of the beauty of human experience.  the story is fair and lighthearted, a saunter; however there is something quite magical about it.  one could say it comes with paulo's integration of mysticism and arab cultures.  there are many scenes where the reader, with the help of paulo, can deceive the senses into letting go as to transcend the present and play amongst the ethereal literary setting.  all this works together to make reading this book a pleasantly positive and enjoyable experience.  when low scores are given i do not understand what one could possibly be seeking other than a nice story.  in terms of storytelling, this one is exceptional, and it would be something else if all approached this one with intent and respect.  it deserves at least that.
B00005JN5X|3.0|I must say that I had expected Broters Grimm to impress and entertain me as much as Sleepy Hollow, but it turned out to be a rather boring fantasy/horror/comedy movie. The set designs, costumes, and special effects deserve more credits in this film, while the story and performances were mediocre or even silly at times. What was Monica Belluci doing here with merely less than 10 minutes of screentime? I mean afterall, she's the current \\"It\\" girl in European movie industry.<br /><br />Wil(Matt Damon) and his younger brother Jacob Grimm(Heath Ledger) are so-called con artists who make a living pulling off tricks on unsuspecting witch-terrorized peasants. One day, the brothers are hired by the people of Marbaden Village to retrieve their missing girls. With no real training whatsoever, the brothers set out into the nearby forest to find the missing girls. They are assisted by Angelika(Lena Hedey) who had some knowledge and skills to protect herself from the evil-enchanted forest. Her two younger sisters were also abducted myteriously by unseen force in the woods and her father had been missing for many years as well. During the mission, the brothers and Angelika encountered strange things and gets attacked by moving trees and a powerful wolf that occasionally gets transformed into human form. To her surprise, the wolf turned out to be her father who had been rescued and controlled by the powerful Mirror Queen(Monica Belluci) who had been the leading force in the abduction of the girls in order to perform a ritual that would reverse her old age to youthful beauty again.....<br /><br />Johnathan Price gives a striking performance as a arrogant and powerful French authority. He was a bit of a comic relief with a pretty realistic accent, but his character is somewhat on the sidetrack from the main plot.  Heath Ledger had a hell of time trying to display numerous clumsy mannerism and behaviors. Matt Damon occasionally failed to maintain a perfect British accent and he never quite managed to deliver the jokes effectively. What was more annoying was the brothers had to go through very amateurish looking fight scenes that certainly required no stunt doubles. The sultry and beautiful Monica Belluci was willing to don on two looks; the fairest of them all and the oldest and ugliest of them all. Gotta love her elaborate headpiece and cleavage revealing costume! I was also disappointed by the not so climatic happy ending. No wonder this film got postponed for so long before releasing this summer.ver quite managed to deliver the jokes effectively.

B000006OBQ|5.0|This essential album shows you Frank's act , complete with a monologue , which is the only part I pass by as I'm interested in hearing him sing , not tell jokes .  <br /> <br />His voice is more lived in , but his ability to communicate is not diminished . <br /> <br />The songs themselves are beautifully rendered - there are ballads and swingers , plus saloon songs . The Basie band are enjoying themselves immensely and that comes across plainly . <br /> <br />This would be a good introduction to the live Sinatra . <br />We had it on in the background at our wedding party and it created a great feeling in the room . <br />Let Frank transport you back to 60's Vegas - get the martinis ready and dim the lights ! <br />A record for a party - dancing or dinner . <br />Try it out and hear great entertainers doing just that . <br />
B000B5XOXY|3.0|NOTE - My actual star rating is \\"4 out of 5\\", but I originally felt 3 was more appropriate.  My review is the exact same, but the star rating is just a notch higher.  (><) Sorry    REVIEW  I feel bad for this movie.  For better or worse, it suffered the inevitbale comparisons to Tim Burton's blockbusters.  I'm not sure if the mostly-negative audience really wanted to like this movie or not.  I'll get to that later...    What this entry in the \\"Batman\\" library is what any work of art is from a new artist - an interpretations.  What Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman (director and writer, respectively) saw the Batman character as, at least just judging from the movie, is an exciting hero who battles crime with a huge arsenal, and has a few emotional demons on the side.  Is it as genius as Christopher Nolan's vision in \\"Batman Begins\\"?  Certainly not, but for the summer of 1995 and even today, this concept is entertainment.    Val Kilmer brings out the public businessman out of Bruce Wayne, but only falters in bringing the reclusive side that Michael Keaton played so well.  As Batman, the crime-fighting hero, he gets the chance to display better fight choreography, but doesn't seem to invoke any plausible fear in the hearts of the villains.  Even though Batman is a publicly-accepted figure, he loses some of the mystery.  In short, Val Kilmer didn't live up to Keaton's strengths, but overcame Keaton's turn in areas that needed work.    Chris O'Donnell is actually good here as Dick Grayson and Robin.  He's eager and adventurous enough to convey that inner need for danger and thrills.  I didn't feel enough anger in his role, but that's forgiveable.  As Robin, he's actually pretty useless in this movie.  The Bat-Boat is destroyed, he gets suckered into captivity by Two-Face, and is rescued by Batman.  O'Donnell is a great Dick Grayson, but Robin's shortcomings weren't his fault, but instead the writers'.    The villains are expertly-acted but not expertly-written.  Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent-turned-Two Face is very good here.  He's maniacal enough to scare anyone, but his schemes to kill Batman are beyond ridiculous.  I know that's his character, but that's where the presence of Jim Carrey's Edward Nygma/The Riddler comes into play.  Nygma is a lunatic as well, but his menacing intelligence is more dangerous that the under-estimating Bruce Wayne realizes.  The Riddler is a menace, but not a sadist.  Many fans devalue the combination of Two-Face and The Riddler.  You see, because Two-Face is gifted as a criminal but lacks a strong intellect, The Riddler is his perfect match.  It could've been drawn out better, but it still works better than most might even realize.    Nicole Kidman as Chase Meridian is interesting.  She wants Batman, but Bruce Wayne doesn't really fascinate her too much until later in the movie.  She's a sexually-hungry woman who knows how to delve into the human psyche.  Kidman is perfectly-cast here, because she's beautiful and comes off as a well-read psychiatrist.  However, she could've been given more to do as a doctor instead of just being gorgeous enough to pass.    The setting of Gotham City, as many have noted, is a huge contrast between the moody, grim vision of Tim Burton.  This Gotham is a neo-fantastical light-show with lots of colorful costumes, flashy buildings, and overly-elaborate sets.  Realism doesn't have much place in this world.  But that's the point I feel everyone misses.  \\"Batman & Robin\\" was so obvious with its camp and silliness that it became annoying.  This movie is so much more subtle.  Just look at the Circus chapter.  We are first drawn into the spotlight and extravaganza of the show, then given some subtext within the Meridian-Wayne date, as well as the trust between the Flying Graysons.  Then, a dangerous battle of survival concludes safely, only to end with tragic consequences.  To tackle all of those moods, paces, and angles is a very difficult task.  This chapter does not unfold jarringly or unexpectedly, but is given a sense of control and care.    There are quiet scenes of the troubled Bruce Wayne and of the frustrated Dick Grayson to counter the over-the-top action sequences.  \\"Batman & Robin\\" used those scenes as fillers, but this movie does care about its characters.  Even though the action and vision of the film is given more attention, the people who inhabit Gotham City are given texture.    I don't think this movie could've avoided the negative reviews.  I guess most of us like this movie, because the average rating is 3-out-of-5, which is my verdict.  I like this entry because even though the movie is imbalanced, Joel Schumacher at least attempted to give some drama to contrast the action.  But because he made it clear that this was to be just that - an action movie - I forgive the shortcomings better.  Many claimed that this movie lost the spirit of the comic books, but so did Burton's two films.  \\"Batman Forever\\" doesn't go too overboard, and is worthy of a purchase...and a spot in the \\"Batman\\" series.    FINAL NOTE - This is already available on a bare-bones DVD, but I think that even those who hate this movie should look into checking this one out for the Extras.  The commentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes always give a film more appreciation.  This is no exception.  As for \\"Batman & Robin\\", view at your own risk.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|when ever you listen to true reggae music....within it is a message....its either about future problems facing society, current and past problems. reggae music teaches and move you at the same time......listen very carfully to the words of \\"welcome to jamrock\\". \\"poor people a dead at random, political violence can't done.....youths get blind by stardom. to win election politicians dem trick me, a ghetto education's basic, and most of the youths dem waste it, and when them waste it, thats when dem mek the guns replace it\\". <br />there are a few hip hop artists on the album....not my thing but i give this album merit because the message is more than the minor flaws in the album. get it!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|If you haven't seen Firefly, but are a fan of witty, character-driven original sci-fi, go out on a limb and buy this series.  It should never have been canceled!
B00000K31Q|5.0|I saw this movie when i was about 12 and from that moment on i loved it. It doesnt take itself too seriously, the light pg-13 humor really reveals that. <br />\\"So mr verona you exposed yourself to the lunch lady?\\"  <br />\\"I didnt expose myself it was a bratwurst.\\" <br />\\"Quite the optimist arent we?\\" <br /> <br />Its dialog like this that really pushes the movie. It keeps you laughing but also you can relate with the characters. The soundtrack is great and overall of of my favorite movies ever.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite at first watch, was one of the worst films I'd seen in awhile but after my teenager watched it over and over again and began using quotes in day to day life, I became a fan as well! It's soon to be a contemporary cult classic like Rocky Horror was in the 70's!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I think his lyrical content on this album is outstanding!Jr. Gong is deffently on his way.I just love him like he is so inspiring and insperational!!He is a genius!!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  I am so glad I purchased it.  My teenage daughter and my senior citizen mother love it also.  It spans three generations.  It doesn't get any better than that.
0312323859|5.0|Darcy's at it again, although this time she leaves the country and heads to Europe to have her baby. Giffin manages to take what could have been a terribly unlikeable character (at least, I didn't like her in Something Borrowed) and show us how she learns to change. I liked that this sequel didn't just rehash what went on in the first book, but gave us new characters and a new setting that made it an entirely new book.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I've a Dream Theater fan since 92 and I've seen them many times live, including the Train of Thought tour. Many of the Amazon reviews say this is there best DVD and I would have to agree that the quality is high. The bands performance is as solid as you would expect. In terms of production quality, I'd put this set right next to Led Zepplins DVD set or Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society - Boozed Broozed & Broken-Boned DVD <br /> <br />If you are a die-hard fan, you'll definitely enjoy the segements on the second disk. John, Mike, and Jordan each have segements talking about their stage set-up, which I found to be a highlight of the package.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|So, it's a good thing I can write this review rather than trying to tell you about the best album to come out this year. Wow! Rich, lavish orchestrations. Simple, pared-down acoustic compositions. Whimsical, playful music. Touching, poignant lyrics. It's not often you'll hear a string quartet, recorder, electric guitar, glockenspiel, and banjo(!!) on the same album. And this is the best collection of offbeat and often-hilarious song titles. \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" practically had me in tears, bringing back memories of the excavation of his property and the discovery of all those boys' bodies. \\"Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!\\" and \\"Jacksonville\\" are two songs that I've repeated a dozen times so far (since purchasing less than 24 hours ago). \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!\\" is probably my favorite song, for its haunting (pun intended) chorus and powerful string arrangement. And did I mention the great song titles? If you're from Illinois, you'll truly appreciate the effort Stevens made to get the feel of a place or to even find out some of the strange events, such as the \\"UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois,\\" and the ghosts of famous Illinoisans he evokes. This should be required listening for everybody in Illinois--maybe the Secretary of State can issue a copy with each drivers license.
0393324818|5.0|Don't judge a book by its cover.  Ostensibly the title and cover of this book would lead you to conclude that this book is all about baseball.  It isn't.  When I was handed this book I was expecting a dreary George Will book about the symmetry of motion in baseball or how baseball is the smart man's sport.  My expectations were very low.  The first few pages quickly put that concern to rest.  This is a page-turner that you will not put down. <br /> <br />Have you ever wondered how the Oakland A's with a team that looks so unlike other major league teams can be a consistent winner?  The A's General Manager Billy Beane found market inefficiencies and effectively exploited them.  He recognized that other teams religiously used subjective measures and the wrong statistical measures in evaluating a player's worth to the team.  Billy Beane found the right measures.  And, he recognized that the measures being used by every other team inflated player's salaries not because they contributed to the team's bottom line but because they looked the part or their stats looked good on paper.  He looked for talent where others were simply not looking and he found it.  This allowed him to field a winning team for far less than others. <br /> <br />He developed a strategy to exploit the system by seeking out players not deemed worthy by conventional measures.  For instance, short stocky players did not fit the image of a baseball player.  Because of their smaller strike zone they walk more frequently, meaning they get on base more often.  While other teams were looking at batting average or RBIs, Billy Beane was using statistical measure such as on-base percentage to measure a player's contribution to a winning.  He focused on what's important. <br /> <br />Billy Beane recognized that using the traditional measures of a play's worth and the scout's reliance upon subject measures didn't match up with what really matter to winning.  He leveraged this market inefficiency to build a winning team year in and year out.  The key is in proper valuation as it relates to measuring what directly contributes to your bottom line or, in the case of the A's, winning.  <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I am a long time fan of metal music and I enjoy watching and listening to it's evolution.  In \\"Volume 3\\" Slipknot has really made something spectacular in this new genre of metal.  This album is full of musical merit and tons of human emotion and experience.  The sound is clean and polished but still hard and heavy, full of creative riffs and distinct enough that it leaves no question in the listeners mind who is playing.  Vermilion pt.2 was a shock to me the first time I listened to the album, I never expected such a bittersweet ballad from Slipknot.  Vermilion pt.2, among other songs on the album, brings back the rock ballad and carries it to a new level.  The song is beautiful and sad yet still rockin'.  Slipknot is maturing and sending out it's tendrils into uncharted territory for the newest generation of metal music and I am loving it!  Each song has layer upon layer of rich sound that yanks my inhibitions out by their roots and forces my inner rocker to emerge from the shadows of the day to day facade of a working stiff and causes her to explode with pure joy!  Okay, that was dramatic, but seriously... if you love rock music and love metal music give the album a listen.  [...]
0740748475|5.0|Thank you for this comic, just thinking about it makes me nostalgic for my wonderful youth when I actually read the paper every day if only to read this comic.

B00003CXBH|4.0|I have always found this film to be both deeply moving and sometimes irritating (not due to the film-making, however). Its a genuinely honest film and is not manipulative.  <br /> <br />It shows the human condition in all its complexity and some of the themes (and, actually, occurances) of the film are not removed to the 18th century.  They are still taking place in the 21st century: the exploitation of world cultures for western economic gain.  <br /> <br />The religious aspects of the film are even more complex with no easy answers given: all the religious characters have the strengths and frailties that come with religion:  seeking to love humanity while also needing to convert the \\"heathen.\\"  Somtimes the two ideas can come into conflict (although most religious of a certain type don't see this). <br /> <br />The most moving--and religious--sequence in the movie (and it still gets me worked up even thinking about it) is at the conclusion of Mendoza's penence.  It is the act of compassion and forgiveness on the part of the Guarani of the man who had been so evil to them that Mendoza truely experiences conversion and which brings about the outpouring of real feeling both in crying and laughing.  It is a deeply religious (and human) experience of love--and the most Christian moment in the film. <br /> <br />Did the Guarani show this love and compassion only because of the work of the Jesuits or out of some enherent quality of their society and culture?   <br /> <br />But that's for another discussion--- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400082773|5.0|A well written, thought provoking self reflection of one of the most brilliant (and still evolving) men of our time. Without knowing much about Obama save for his electrifying speech at the DNC I picked up and put down \\"Dreams From My Father\\" several times before actually committing to reading it. I'm not much of a fan of biographies, or memoirs - especially ones of people who are still in the middle of their lives - but I have to say that Obama's writing style and honest approach make this book well worth the read.<br /><br />This is one of the most well written memoirs I have ever read. At some points it reads so much like a novel that I stopped to check the cover and make sure there was no \\"as told to\\" or other writing credit. The prose is lean and lyrical - while occasionally the themes are repetitive, I overall loved the circular nature of his exploration of life, race and class. I appreciated the honesty and integrity of his thoughts on black culture and the struggle to define blackness and appreciate life in the US. I think he exposes a lot of the most painful truths about race in this country that remain today, while offering hope and reason - rather than condemnation - to black and white alike.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who have indicated that the book does feel unfinished, also that he did not spend much time with talking about those in his life who were very supportive (mother and grandparents) but I saw two reasons for this. First, the book  is unfinished in the sense that he is also \\"unfinished\\" and what it does cover is a sense of opening, discovery and closure around a complicated relationship with a parent that existed primarily in his own impressions.<br /><br />Which brings me to reason #2: the unresolved relationship with his father fueled much of his early life choices. It feels only natural that these two stories be told in tandem. Now that he is a senator and much older through experience I would be curious to know how the telling of his life might change. As he indicates in the forward of the new edition - with so much distance between that experience and the life he's lived between Kenya and \\"now\\" there is much in his life that has to do with the impressions others like his mother and grandparents made. I suspect that rewritten to encompass more of his life, those other areas might balance the struggle to \\"find\\" his father and himself in those early years.<br /><br />All that is to say: don't let his \\"preoccupation\\" with an absent father steer you away from this book. It in no way feels self indulgent or as an \\"open wound.\\" Instead, I found an inspirational journey and a thoughtful exploration that made for a quick read!telling of his life might change.

0399152717|3.0|Kurt Austin is not Dirk Pitt; I think we can all agree on that. <br /> <br />Having said that, let's be charitable and allow that the story has a certain Pitt factor.  It's reasonably well thought out (a bit outlandish, but oh well, aren't they all), and the return of a familiar character is its own reward. <br /> <br />What left me cold, though, were 1) inadequate proofreading, 2) too much compression of the action, and 3) an unnecessarily red herring. <br /> <br />First, the proofing.  There were a few glaring errors in puntuation.  That was bad enough, but one of the characters, on a brief assignment in Rio, speaks \\"perfect Spanish.\\"  Uhm.... 'scuse me, there, but don't they speak Portuguese in Brazil? <br /> <br />Second, the compression.  A lot of time is spent noodling around in locales which seem secondary to the story, and then, all of a sudden, a lot of time passes and tasks are miraculously already done. <br /> <br />Third, there is a discovery -- no spoiler here, you'll have to read it and see -- which, while it would be sufficient to warrant an entire novel, or at least a major subplot, ultimately feels gratuitous or worse.  This is the reddest of red herrings, and I felt a little cheated. <br /> <br />None of what I write will deter the hardcore Cusslerian from devouring this book, and I'm not unhappy that I bought it.  As an introduction to Cussler's work, it's substandard, and might deter a first-time reader from pursuing his better works.

B000AA4M9U|3.0|As with most of these duets albums, B.B. King's 80 has some excellent songs mixed with some that are less than so.  The best song on the album is \\"Early In The Morning\\" with Van Morrison that makes you wish that the two would record an entire album together.  Elton John rips through a rousing live version of \\"Rock This House\\" and Roger Daltrey flexes his considerable vocal muscles on \\"Never Make Your Move Too Soon\\".  Daryl Hall adds a nice touch of Philly soul to \\"Ain't Nobody Home\\" and Sheryl Crow shows she has the voice for the blues on \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\".  Eric Clapton goes through the motions on a listless \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" while Gloria Estefan is in over her head on \\"There Must Be A Better World\\" while trudges along at a numbing seven minutes.  The rest of the album is fairly pedestrian.
B00062J00S|5.0|\\"You've been given a wonderful gift George, the chance to see what it would be like if you were never born.\\" Thus spoke Clarence, angel - second class, to the suicidal George Bailey, owner and manager of the local, recently bankrupt \\"Building & Loan Co.\\" in Bedford Falls, somewhere U.S.A.<br /><br />Of course George doesn't believe this silly, little old man is really an angel, nor does he believe his wish to \\"never have been born\\" has just been granted. However the reality of the situation is soon to set in when he discovers that no one in Bedford Falls has ever heard of George Bailey. Not only is he viewed as a stranger in town, but the town itself is nothing like it was before he met Clarence. In fact it's no longer 'Bedford Falls.' It's 'Pottersville.'<br /><br />Yes, George finally comes to realize that Clarence is right, a life is a terrible thing to throw any. We are all connected to each other in ways we could never imagine, nor fully comprehend. The absence of just one life may have devastating consequences on others.<br /><br />Has George learned his lesson? Can an angel - second class, reverse the wish and restore George back to his family and friends in time for Christmas? And lastly, has Clarence finally earned his wings? Considering the fact that \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is one of the most beloved Christmas films of all-time I'm sure you already know the answer.<br /><br />Simply the best Hollywood has to offer at Christmas, or anytime of the year! Thanks to director Frank Capra and the whole cast for making this film a part of my holiday family viewing tradition.
0679777547|2.0|I'm not a frustrated comparative literature major stuck in a dead-end job whose only creative outlet seems to be posting reviews on Amazon, so I won't bore you with five-star words. <br /> <br />But I am a magazine editor and voracious reader--so I know what I like. If you are looking for a taut, thrilling, suspenseful, character-driven mystery, look elsewhere. I got to page 237 and had only experienced one pulse-quickening episode, when the protagonist, Corso, is chased for a few seconds down a narrow street by a menacing driver. He slips out of the way at the last moment and bumps his poor, widdle hand. <br /> <br />If you are intrigued by leather book bindings and obscure 16th century demonology, you'll happily breeze through the first 237 pages. As for me, I'm giving up on this snoozer for now.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins are the reason that people like grunge/alt. rock. Every song on this album has a different feel, yet they all blend together to create a beautiful musical experience. For those that like their heavy guitar riffs and searing solos, Cherub Rock, Today, Geek U.S.A. and the absolutely amazing Rocket will satisfy that appetite. For those that like the mellower side of rock, Disarm, Soma and Spaceboy are quite fulfilling. Some songs blend both qualities, like Mayonnaise and Hummer. Corgan's vocals are amazing, all the guitarwork is poignant and creative, and the whole atmosphere of the album is one of technical beauty. This album shows that good songwriters can write good songs without watering down their abilities. Buy if you like music.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|When I received the CD,I popped it in and WOW! What a CD! ALL the Duets are just Great.I was really surprise from some of the artists like Sheryl Crow and Gloria Estefan,these two know the Blues,and then to hear Elton John belt out\\"Rock this House\\",and \\"Drivin'Wheel\\"with Glen Frey,and\\"Tired of your jive\\"with Billy F Gibbons,all I know what to say is WOW!!!!Any Blues fan that don't get this CD,doesn't know what they are missing

B000002IMG|5.0|HELL YES. THIS ALBUM KICKS YOU RIGHT IN YOUR PANCREAUS . TESTAMENT IS AN AWESOME BAND . AWESOME . PERIOD ! THIS ALBUM WAS A KILL-RUSH FOR MY EARS. THE SUMMER THIS ALBUM CAME OUT I WAS GOING TO BE A SENIOR IN HIGHSCHOOL. WE HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS GOING TO BE A SOPHMORE. WE NICKNAMED HIM STUBBY \\" FOR REASONS ON ANOTHER REVIEW \\" AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS YOUNGER THAN US , HE NEW HOW TO HANG WITH THE BIG BOYS. HE WAS A WONDERFUL METAL-HEAD AND FRIEND. HIS FATHER OWNED A TAVERN THAT WE WOULD HANG OUT IN AFTER HOURS \\" USUALY FROM 3 A.M. TO WHENEVER WE PASSED OUT . IT DIDNOT RE-OPEN UNTIL 3:30 P.M. WE COULD ROCK OUT AND PLAY POOL AND OF COURSE ALCOHOLIC BEVIES . STUBBY COULD ONLY LET A SELECT FEW IN BECAUSE OF THE MEAR FACT OF AN ALLOUT PARTY IN HIS FATHERS PUB AFTER HOURS WOULD BE DEATH IF WE GOT BUSTED. JUST KNOWING HIS FATHER, HE WOULD PROBABLY JUST SHOOT US ALL RATHER THAN TO CALL THE COPS. STUBBY WANTED TO THROW AN ALL-OUT RAGER BEFOR SCHOOL AND SINCE WE COULDNOT HAVE IT AT THE PUB, HE CAME UP WITH AN IDEA. WE WOULD BRING THE ALCOHOL OUT OF THE PUB AND THROW A BON-FIRE PARTY. NOW BON-FIRE PARTIES WERE BY NO MEANS RARE IN BEMIDJI MN. BUT TO HAVE ONE SUPPLIED WITH FREE BOOZE AND AN INVITE LIST THAT NEVER ENDED, WELL . HE ASKED ME IF I WAS UP FOR THE TASK. \\" ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS HOW MUCH TROUBLE THAT I WOULD BE IN AND THAT IT WAS WORTH IT \\" I SAID YES AND HE INTRUSTED ME WITH THE KEYS AND THE CODE TO HIS DADS TAVERN. THURSDAY, STUBBY WAS GOING TO DO INVENTORY IN HIS DADS PUB AND THEN GO HOME WITH HIM WHEN HE CLOSED 2:00 A.M. MY JOB WAS TO GET WHAT HE HAD NOT INVENTORIED OUT OF THE PUB AND READY FOR FRIDAYS RAGER. NO PROBLEM RIGHT \\" WHATEVER, I WAS STRESSIN HARD \\"NO ONE WANTED TO GET BUSTED. ONCE YOU GOT INSIDE, YOUR SAFE, BUT GETTING ALL THIS ALCOHOL BACK TO THE CARS YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE. WHEN WE WOULD SNEAK IN AND HANG WITH STUBBY WE WOULD LEAVE OUR CARS DOWN THE BLOCK AS SO THAT THE PARKING LOT WOULD STAY EMPTY.  NOW WE HAVE A LOADING DOCK OF HEADBANGERS READY TO MOVESOME KEGS AND BOOZE EXCEPT WE DON'T WORK FOR THE UNION. WE HAD TO MOVE FAST AND QUIET. NOTHING I DID IN MY LIFE WAS QUIET. NOTHING. THE MODIVATION FACTOR AND RUSH BEHIND THIS WAS AN ALBUM BY TESTAMENT A NEW ORDER. YES ! I WAS PUMPED AND NEEDLESS TO SAY SO WAS EVERYONE ON FRIDAY WHEN WE ARRIVED WITH MORE ALCOHOL THAN ANYONE COULD CONSUME. THE PARTY STARTED AND SO DID TESTAMENT. THIS TAPE MUST HAVE PLAYED 3 TIMES OVER. THIS LITTLE MIDNIGHT RUN THAT I DID FOR STUBBY HAPPENED MANY MORE TIMES UNTIL 1991, AND EVERY RUN I WOULD PLAY THIS VERY ALBUM. IT WOULD PUMP ME UP AND MAKE ME FORGET ANY FEAR THAT I HAD. IT STILL DOES TO THIS DAY. I RETIRED FROM THE MIDNIGHT RUNS WHEN I DECIDED TO MOVE TO CALIF \\"THOUSAND OAKS\\" . I RETURNED HIS KEYS TO THE TAVERN AND HE GAVE ME A NICE JACKET WITH THE LOGO/ADDRESS OF THE TAVERN AND A HUG AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I WOULD EVER SEE STUBBY. R.I.P.

B000002G26|5.0|I've always been a big fan of \\"Greatest Hits\\" cds.  They contain all of the well-known songs that people are familiar with without all of the album-filler songs used to fill in the remaining spaces.  This case holds true with this great collection from Bryan Adams.  All of his most well-known songs are here without any album fillers.    The disc starts off with one of my favories: \\"The Summer of '69\\".  This is an autobiographical song for Adams, who's talking about his first guitar and growing up in Canada.      There is an equal mix of ballads and rockers on this disc.  From the amazing \\"Robin Hood\\" theme \\"(Everything I Do) I Do it For You\\" to \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\", this disc has something for everyone.  I highly recommend this cd.  All of the songs are great, and you'll find yourself listening to it over and over.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I'm a relative newcomer with respect to DCFC.  I adore Transatlanticism, and am also a fan of Gibbard's other musical endeavor Postal Service.  \\"Plans\\" takes everything to a completely new level, trumping Transatlanticism by a landslide.  This album is beautifully crafted and completely captivating.  Anyone who is worried that it might be too mainstream, I beg you to listen to \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" and reconsider that stance.  The songs may be polished, but the emotion fueling them is raw and honest.  Quite honestly, this is song writing at its finest and an album for DCFC to be proud of and for any person interested in music with a soul to enjoy.  The songs are mellow but pensive, melancholic but ever-hopeful.  It might be a departure from DCFC's very early work, but it's a truly gorgeous progression.  If you are looking for music that will move you, a true work of art, look no further.
B000A59PMO|5.0|For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.<br /><br />In what is possibly one of the best shows on television today Veronica Mars first season aired in fall 2004 and fast developed a devoted fan following.<br /><br />For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.<br /><br />So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's wife and children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).<br /><br />Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who was ousted after accusing millionaire software businessman Jake Kane of murdering his daughter (and Veronica's best friend) Lilly.<br /><br />Now a private detective Keith is still investigating the murder and determined in his conviction that the man in jail for the murder is innocent. He is supported in this belief by his daughter a fact which has made her a social outcast from the popular clique to which she once belonged.<br /><br />The murder-mystery and the mystery to a rape that occurred before the show opens both serve as the season-long story arc. But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From stolen poker winnings to missing school mascots to  missing dogs and busting a fake ID card ring, Veronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other misfits) must navigate a world of secret societies, shady Kane security personnel and a largely hostile school environment.<br /><br />In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace. Teddy Dunn plays tortured with some secret that he struggles to keep hidden as Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of actor Aaron (who is played by Harry Hamlin of LA Law and Clash of the Titans fame). Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil.<br /><br />Not to spoil the ending of the show for anyone who missed it on its initial run over fall 2004 to spring 2005 or the reruns of select episodes over the summer of 2005, this show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last two episodes of the season.<br /><br />On this DVD set of six discs we are promised deleted scenes, a gag reel and extended takes. The release was supposed to have already happened, but was pushed back when fans complained that they didn't want a bare-bones release. I'm happy though because now it is scheduled to arrive on my birthday - Oct. 11. What a fantastic birthday present!<br /><br />Personally I cannot wait for Season 2 that starts Sept. 28, 2005. Creator Rob Thomas has promised us a great new mystery and besides that question that burns the most is the one that Thomas left us with at the end of season one - just who was it at the door?eady happened, but was pushed back when fans complained that they didn't want a bare-bones release.

B00000DLUV|5.0|I was turned on to the Bee Gees several years ago by my parents. (Yes, I'm under 30 years old!) I bought this CD for my dad 2 christmas' ago, as I knew he loved the group and thought this compilation would satisfy his musical palate. I was right and as a reslult, I became a big fan. The mixture of songs both from their earlier career in the 60's to their late behind the scenes writing infuence in the 80's, is truly spectacular! So many fan favorites and a touching tribute to their late youngest brother, Andy, make this CD a must have.
1891252089|4.0|This is an excellent look at Ashtanga Yoga. Swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at Yoga: Standing Series and Finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich, with the Primary Series as the filling in the sandwich; and the idea of a vinyasa as the \\"etch a sketch\\" which clears the slate for each new asana, and his \\"physics of flight\\" and \\"ground transportation\\" as a means to jumping forward. My only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold-out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page. It would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down. Also, (Ok, I have one more wish)I appreciated the break down of the Sanskrit word into meanings, but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too. Otherwise, it is nearly perfect.
B00008ADPF|5.0|The Up Side: Nickelback are one of the very few bands who can balance loud, rock driven guitars with sweet pop-like melodies, and actually pull it off. When you're not rocking out, you'll be singing along at the top of your lungs. The Long Road is no exception to Nickelback's award winning, medium heavy sound. Song for song, TLR is without a single weak link, making for a complete and rewarding listen. Singles like Someday and Figured You Out are obvious smash hits, but when a band can create an entire 40+ minutes of quality material, equal or greater than said singles, you know they've got talent! The Long Road really is quality radio-rock for all moods, and the hooks are out of this world!! <br /> <br />The Down Side: Jealous critics/musicians, usually those without much talent, are quick to judge such a tight sound, and that is exactly what happened with Nickelback and The Long Road. Bad press for such a good record boggles my mind, because although The Long Road isn't exactly a favorite with various web zines and online music reviewers, it truly is a timeless rock and roll album.  <br /> <br />The Flip Side: Nickelback have a sound and style that work for them, and they aren't ready to give that up just yet. So while everyone else is making drastic changes to their sound just to keep up with trends, Nickelback keep it real.   <br /> <br />The Conclusion: The Long Road will have you singing along for years to come, and if you liked Silver Side Up, chances are you'll like this one even more. <br /> <br />The End.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|diffrent, but its stillclutch and that is all that matters. very nice disc
B00006AG5N|5.0|Because I already own essentially all these songs on CD, I put off buying this CD for over a year, and then only bought it because it has so many songs (31) on a single disc.  Yes, I had read \\"remastered\\" in the title; however, I had viewed \\"remastered\\" as simply a minor bonus.    So you can imagine my surprise when I immediately noticed the significantly improved sound that \\"remastered\\" produced!  It's hard to put in words; the best I can do is to say that even if you own all these songs on CD already, buy this CD just for the superior sound of this remastering job.    And you don't need an audiophile (expensive) sound system, because I listened on sound equipment that cost less cost less than $100:  a 3-year old Panasonic (portable) CD player (SL-SX290) with $38 ($19 on sale) Radio Shack headphones (Pro 35A).      Yes, Elvis's voice is much clearer, but in particular I appreciated the greatly enhanced instrumentation, particularly on the earlier recordings.    1/14/06 Update:  When I played a mix of songs from both this CD and \\"Disco Years, Vol. 2: On the Beat [1978 - 1982]\\", on non-audiophile equipment, I was surprised to find that this CDs sound quality was noticeably better than the sound quality of \\"Disco Years!\\"  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard it (and several times).    \\"Non-audiophile equipment\\" means:  Several Tivoli Songbook radios (which have only a 2.5\\" speaker) whose FM signal was from an FM transmitter whose audio was from a (JVC PC-XC370) boombox.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't see this series during its limited run on tv, but I've been a long-time viewer and fan of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel so when a friend recommended I watch this series I ordered the DVD set.  What a brilliant series!  A true western set in outer space with well-written and beautifully acted characters, a fascinating plot that brings them all together, and buckets of humor, pathos, and adventure.  I can't wait until the feature film comes out this month!
B00005JLZN|1.0|The only way for me to make my point is to possibly give away the ending. I promise to watch my step, but if you want to be surprised at the lame \\"twist\\" then stop reading.<br /><br />Alright, here it is. David Gale, a devout anti-death-penalty advocate finds himself on death row for the murder of his close friend and one-time fling. It seems like an open and shut case, but David is swearing his innocence and says he's being framed, which catches the attention of \\"Bitsey\\" Bloom (now there's a name that just commands respect)<br /><br />Anyway, the film chases its own tail for a little and, after a while, it's insinuated that David may have made himself LOOK guilty just to attract attention to the cause by becoming some kind of martyr.<br /><br />See ... here's the problem, two-thirds of the way into the movie the film's story paints itself into a corner it can't get out of. What we're left with as the film begins to reach its 'big reveal' are two different directions the plot can take to resolve itself:<br /><br />1. David is actually innocent of the crime, and tampered with the evidence to make himself look guilty - This doesn't make any sense because he's disproving his own argument. If he subverted the justice system to make himself look guilty and he's then convicted, isn't that proof that the system works? 'The System' isn't cheating Gale, Gale's cheating the system by tampering with his own trial to get the verdict he wants. How can this then be held up as proof that the death-penalty is wrong?<br /><br />2. David actually did it - In which case he was convicted of murder and is sitting on death row. This, if true, means we've wasted two hours of our time watching Kevin Spacey over-act.<br /><br />The thing is, neither of these scenarios work. In either option, David SHOULD be on death row; he either doctored his trail to get himself there or he's actually a murderer.<br /><br />The film was CLEARLY trying to make a statement about the injustice of capital punishment, but in the process only managed to (pardon the pun) shoot itself in the foot and discredit its own argument.pun) shoot itself in the foot and discredit its own argument.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had seen this in Toronto and had thought that nothing could be better than seeing it on stage.  I am glad that I was wrong.  The singing is fantastic, the costumes, actors, everything.  I now have re-written my memories to include this DVD in it, replacing what I had remembered.  I would recommend this as a MUST HAVE!!!

B000AL730Y|1.0|I was so excited about this release. The critics were saying it his best ever. I heard the new song \\"Fine Line\\" in the Lexus commercial and was really pumped to have a night of first listening to a new McCartney album. But I don't like this type of music. It still is an impressive display of musicanship since he plays nearly every instrument on every track himself. The reason I still give it one star is because it's one star relative to other McCartney albums.  <br /> <br />Nowadays if an artist has 1 good song on an album, its a hit. In that case, this is gold. Fine Line is great. But I really don't like so many slow acoustic and piano songs about being so deep in love one after another like that. <br /> <br />As a rock fan, Fine Line is one of the few tunes I like. I like the type of voice he sings in. I call it the \\"Flaming Pie\\" voice. Would make a good ELO song, too. If the vocals on this were not so upfront and compressed, I would even like it better. <br /> <br />English Tea is another I like. It's very English, which I like about Beatles tracks every so often when they threw one in. I don't like the strings intro on it. But it's a short fun song.  <br /> <br />With Promise to You Girl, I finally heard something that gets my toes a tappin'. Great Flaming Pie/Elvis voice. Awesome little jingle-jangle piano. I could do without the Queen-style vocal harmony but condsidering the rest of the album..this was refreshing. The third and final song I liked on this album. <br /> <br />Sorry, Paul. Love ya, pal. Just not my cup of English Tea.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|i don't know how he does it. great album after great album. he's got two more coming out this year, does he sleep. he writes so many songs though he would come out with more than three every year if his label would let him. this one could please any of the people's paticular style of ryan. all of his albums are mixed together in one on this one and i love it. i love the fact that he's so diverse ans has different styles. that's part of what makes him great. he's all the types of music i like- rock, folk, punk, country , and blues.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Brave New World~ Iron Maiden is a solid straight forward metal album that sounds just like metal should. Metal can not be said to be difficult music to play or sing to. Yet one feels like they give it their all and put in everything they have and that is more then many bands do when they seemingly mail in their performances. The lyrics are trypical metal lyrics and if one expects something insightfull and intelligent then one has picked the wrong genre. These guys write simply yet effective metal lyrics and as such they serve their purpose quite well. This is a very good metal album not to be missed.
B000AL730O|5.0|I've listened to C&C 5 times straight through since I bought it yesterday and it just gets better and better. These are beautifully crafted songs, brilliantly arranged , sung and played with sincerity and heart. It's an album that satisfies both emotionally and intellectually and well I just love it! IMO it's Paul's best collection of songs ever, especially Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, English Tea, Friends To Go, Riding to Vanity Fair, Fine Line, Anyway & Promise to you Girl. And the others are quickly growing on me ;-) This album is/will be a classic!  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000068TPN|5.0|From the first scene, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" puts you into the thick of action with all the realism that could be mustered. In the first scene, a viewer could find themselves a bit overwhelmed by the realism of the combat, as well as the blood in some places.<br /><br />Once through the first scene, what follows is a movie that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride through the lives and loves of the men of the 1st Air Cav. They were the first unit to engage the North Vietnamese forces in a major battle and along with being outnumbered, they were also testing a fledgling style of battle using helicopters.<br /><br />The movie inserts you into the lives of the men and also their families and wives. You will find yourself fully immersed into their loves, joys, pains and problems. The story fully engages you with the emotions of losing husbands overseas, losing friends, and losing men. It is a powerful movie and a powerful story. if you watch it in groups, keep a supply of tissues nearby.<br /><br />In terms of the battle scenes, they are violent and realistic, however they fit well into the context and they show something of what it must have been like to be in the middle of an intense battle. This is not surprising, as Hal Moore, (played by Gibson in the movie), consulted on this movie.<br /><br />All in all, this is among the best war movies I have seen, both for the powerful story it tells and the sheer level of action that it shows. It will pull at your heart, and do it powerfully. I unreservedly recommend this film to anyone.
B000002G8H|5.0|\\"Slowhand\\" is one of Eric Clapton's finest albums to be released during the late '70s and rightfully so!!!<br /><br />Clapton's stellar musical chops combined with a solid backup band makes for what is undoubtedley a signature album.<br /><br />The opening trio of \\"Cocaine\\", \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and \\"Lay Down Sally\\" have gone on to become Clapton standards with the latter two tracks being amongst his best original compositions.<br /><br />Elsewhere on \\"Slowhand\\" are standout tracks such as \\"Next Time You See Her\\", the blues-driven \\"Mean Old Frisco\\", the flowing instrumental of \\"Peaches and Diesel\\" and the extended funk-rock jams of \\"The Core\\" which, in addition to Clapton's solid guitar work, features a superb vocal performance from singer Marcy Levy and a great sax lead from sessionman Mel Collins (who is actually a former member of the prog-rock giants King Crimson).<br /><br />Since its release in 1977, \\"Slowhand\\" has stood the test of time as a staple of classic rock. The album still has a fresh vibrant sound that doesn't sound a bit outdated or disappointing. With Clapton's powerful guitar and vocal work, great musicianship from his band and Glyn Johns' solid production, there is little wonder why the title of this album has become a nickname for Clapton himself. One listen to \\"Slowhand\\" proves that Eric Clapton has earned the title rightly.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I love Ray Charles. He has spoken to millions over the last few years and his honoray cd is no different.  <br />He has a soul about him that reminds me of several people.  <br />It reminds me of Billie Holiday. It reminds me of Eva Cassidy. It even reminds me of Melody Gardot. (funny this CD reminds me of women).  <br /> <br />BUt I think he is amazing.  <br />His voice soars.  <br />He sould penetrates deep into our hearts.  <br />He is a man of great power through music.  <br /> <br />And I am going to pick up extra copies of this one for sure!
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Backyard sounds like a little bit of everything from Beatles to Wings to solo McCartney. It echoes most of what he has written, so it covers a wide range of his own signature style and sound. Much like McCartney and McCartney II he plays just about all of the instruments, which makes Chaos an even more accomplished work of art. I hear bits from Revolver, Magical Mystery Tour, White Album, Abbey Road, Ram, London Town, Tug of War and the classic Flaming Pie. The spirits of George Harrison, John Lennon and Linda are very present throughout which is a tribute to them.  It is very well produced thanks to Nigel Godrich. George Martin should be proud of him. I am also a huge Radiohead fan and I hear some of the slightly darker moods and feelings that are evident in their songs. For instance, the major/minor chord sequence on How Kind of You sounds a lot like Motion Picture Soundtrack from Kid A, right down to the same accordian. Maybe Nigel had a little to do with that as well. I will say that Chaos is as important as OK Computer or Revolver without hesitation. There are many layers that aren't evident upon the first or second listen. You can't absorb it all without hearing it multiple times. Credit to Nigel for telling Paul the truth about what he should do. He pulled no punches with McCartney and that's a good thing. I'm going to the show in Philly on Sept 23rd. It will be the 5th time I've seen him live, and Radiohead 5 times too. Both are the best live shows ever!   \\"It's silly Willy with the Philly band, could be OO-ee...\\" - ROCK SHOW.

0895260131|5.0|If you really want to know more about Islam read this book.  We sure are not being kept informed by our elected politicians or news media.  Since Muslims declared war on the United States and the West it makes sense to find out what Islam is all about.

B000957O82|3.0|First of all: Will Smith is WONDERFUL in this movie. I felt that his character was a noble man in that he liked women and made it his life work to help other men (not guys) who also liked women become confident in their pursuit of their \\"Heart's Desire\\"<br /><br />However the Love interest of this movie is an unforgivable bitch. The movie does tie up messy loose ends with typical unrealistic Hollywood flair, but even this procedure is sloppy and unconvincing towards the end. Watching Will Smith apologize to this person makes the ending that much more heinous.<br /><br />So let's see, 5 stars for will Smith and his clients, a serious Turkey for the love interest. I'll split the difference with 3 stars.

B000AL730O|3.0|I'd like to start by saying I think McCartney is a musical genius, a true artist, a minstrel of old.  But, sadly, this subdued and introspective album is not one of his better efforts.  I've bought just about everything by him through the years, even his lesser known singles like \\"Sally G\\" and \\"It's Not True,\\" and it seems as if all the criticism of the past has made him change in some way.  Now, it seems, he concentrates more on his lyrics than his melodies -- and he is the undisputed master of melody.  \\"Fine Line\\" is the only passable \\"hit\\" on the album, although I really like the insightful \\"Jenny Wren,\\" the playful \\"English Tea,\\" and the seasoned \\"At the Mercy.\\"  The album undoubtedly features a more mature and sagacious McCartney, although many of the tunes sound much alike.  And, regrettably, most of them are fillers.  George Harrison once wondered how McCartney could come up with so many diverse melodies and never seemingly run out.  Well, let's hope he still has a few melodies left.  Combined with more intelligent and mature lyrics, it could make for a great future album.
B000002ILG|5.0|It's pretty obvious what's going on here.  One day in the 80s, a record producer living in a plush apartment in Manhattan barked out orders to one of his underlings: \\"find me a beautiful rock singer, a blond guy, someone that will make the girls go crazy.  Also get me an out-of-this-world guitarist.  I don't care what the guy looks like or how ugly he is.  He can look like a vampire for all I care.  The important thing is that he can play guitar solos that will confound everyone--even the editors of Guitar World magazine.  Finally, get me a drummer and a bassist with big hair.  I want them both to have mullets.  Otherwise, I don't care too much about them so long as they don't get in the way of the beautiful vocalist and the freak guitarist.\\"     The underling assiduously carried out his task and found, respectively, Mike Tramp, Vito Bratta, Greg D'Angelo and James Lomenzo.  Tramp was spotted walking down the street with one supermodel on each arm.  \\"Can you sing?\\" the underling asked.  \\"Sure,\\" Tramp said.  White Lion had its singer.  The underling discovered Bratta at a guitar shop.  Bratta was trying out a guitar.  500 people were watching in awe.  The guy was like Yngwie Malmsteen on steroids.  Pinch harmonics, sweep arpeggios, 30-note melodic sequences in half a second, nothing was too difficult for this fretboard wizard. \\"Are you in a band?\\" the underling asked.  \\"No,\\" Bratta replied.  White Lion had its guitarist.  D'Angelo and Lomenzo were recruited at a movie theater.  The two were sitting together.  Patrons seated behind them were complaining: \\"we can't see the screen because of that wall of hair.\\"   \\"Perfect,\\" thought the underling.  Once it developed that the two understood what drums and a bass were, White Lion had its drummer and bassist.      Now, you might expect that a group thrown together in this fashion would have no chemistry and would not be good.  That is what I would expect.  But this group rules!  Somehow, against all odds, the record producer's project was successful!      Here you have some of the finest rock songs to come out of the mid/late 80s.  You have amazing sing-along choruses, and blistering guitar solos that will make you shake your head in amazement.  Surprisingly enough, this album also contains coherent songs that actually stand on their own as songs.  I probably don't need to explain the merits of \\"Wait\\" or \\"When the Children Cry\\" to you, but you also should know that three other songs on this album (\\"Lonely Nights,\\" \\"Sweet Little Loving\\" and \\"Tell me\\") are also exceptional.  Buy this album and relive the 80s.  See for yourself that it is possible for a formulaic group to become a great group provided that they have the right attitude and are talented enough to pull it off.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This album is dreamy. We can't stop listening to it and niether can our friends!
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first saw the show on TV, I really didn't appreciate the effort that the cast put into doing this show.  While some of the cast are not the greatest singers, the overall effect is really charming.  The CD also makes it easier to really hear and understand the lyrics, which are quite funny. A strong recommendation for Buffy fans.
6304884419|4.0|With Bob De Niro and Chazz Palminteri staring in a mob movie, you know it has to be good.  Written by Palminteri, \\"A Bronx Tale\\" is the story of a boy going up in the Bronx of all places who toys with falling for the \\"glamore\\" of mob life or staying straight and living a clean and good life like his father.  With Machiavelli Philosophy and \\"The Test\\" this movie is sure to entertain.
6301971558|4.0|This time Gable is Victor, a big game guide in Africa catching animals for zoos & circuses. He's a bit thicker & more fatherly.  Anyway, he hooks up with good-time girl, an absolutely stunning,  Ava Gardner as Honeybear. She is at her sexual best in this movie. Young, graceful, beatiful Grace Kelly as Linda drops in with her plot device husband Donald, the anthropologist. She is guilt ridden as she & Victor fall into a hopeless, doomed love affair. Meanwhile the native are restless & so are the tigers  & the gorillas thrown in for some action. Honeybear is jealous & tries to break them up with some innuendo & dialogue that even the giraffe understands but not good ol' Donald. Lots of interesting stuff happened off screen to hype this movie. First of all they were all on location for a long time in Africa. Gable proposed or propositioned Ava who was married to Frank Sinatra. He visited the set & even played Santa Claus to the cast & crew. There was also a rumor that Gable slept with Grace Kelly. He had a crush on her as she reminded him of Carol Lombard, the love of his life. Wow! Clark Gable & Jean Harlow & Mary Widsor & Ava Gardner & Grace Kelly. Tough life.  The end of both movies is exactly the same. It may be interesting to see both versions back to back.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|30 seconds to mars are and excellent band and this definitely an addictive album... I just couldn't stop hearing all songs over and over again. Guess everybody who listened to the previous album and bought this one found a powerful musical growth in \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". Leto's vocals fit impressively well in their alternative well-cared-sound. I'm from Portugal (Lisbon) and there's already a pretty good amount of fans over here.=D <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|All of Tool's work is beyond outstanding, but this has to be the best album they have yet to put out. It captures everything that makes Tool the band they are: Maynard's intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics, Adam's mix of hard and snake-like guitar riffs, Justin's subtle but necessary bass, and Danny's off the wall beats. \\"Eulogy\\", \\"H.\\", and \\"Aenema\\" are my favorite songs on the album.  Most people would probably not classify Tool's music as beautiful and melodious but if you are a fan like I am, I'm sure you'd see right where I was coming from. This album really accentuates this part of their music. Aenima includes some rougher songs, but not their hardest.If you are looking for a CD that represents the harder side of the band, you should probably buy Opiate, their first EP.Every single one of Tool's CDs are amazing but this generally is the typical Tool fan favorite.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Although I'm a huge Beatles and Paul McCartney fan, I haven't bought a Paul McCartney record in many, many years (since Tug of War).  This record is wonderful.  I just listened to it three times in a row tonight and I just want to hear it again.<br /><br />I was listening to virgin radio uk on my iTunes and heard some great versions of Friends to Go, Too Much Rain, and Follow Me, recorded in their studio.  Just him on guitar, yucking it up with Pete and Geoff. They've archived the show to a web page (for now at least<br />[...]<br />In fact, I wasn't aware of his new album until I heard these bits from that show.  I'm sure glad I did.
B0001US62I|5.0|No, he doesn't.<br /><br />Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha!<br /><br />The only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it. The voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition. Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a \\"devil\\" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo. However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner).<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless.<br /><br />Worth owning!
0887308589|5.0|I bow to the man (Scott Adams). This book is frighteningly accurate in the way it profiles modern software-related companies. For me it acts as a bible of every-day pitfalls to watch out for. When things are rotten don't expect any big warning signs saying \\"ROTTEN-ROTTEN BEWARE\\". <br />No, it's in the everyday working life that you see the signs of decay, and this book has them all.
0425152251|1.0|I was forced upon reading this book for my Advanced Sophomore World Literature and Composition class. It was the most painful thing I have even endured. The book was practically a philosophy textbook disguised as a novel; not a pick for a leisure read. However, if you are a person in need of a better understanding of philosophy, or a single philosophical topic, this book is very good about going into great detail about that stuff.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a story with a plot, however, you have come to the wrong place. Turn back now. Once the point of views switch in the middle of the story, random characters such as Winnie the Pooh and Alice and Wonderland start making appearances; as if to show the author was bored or something. Then, the book just gets completely jumbled as it comes to an abrupt stop at the very end.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's a very slow moving book. It might appeal to somebody who is majoring/interested in philosophy and the history of philosophy, but anybody else would find it incredibly boring. I didn't like it.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|There are some movies you finish and you just know - on all levels - they're bad (I'm looking at you White Chicks!). Then there are movies like The Brown Bunny. It's one of those movies that everything within was telling me wasn't good, but yet I felt there was some pretentious urban coffeeshop connoiseur in a tight retro t-shirt and coke bottle glasses somewhere sniveling at the ignorance of people like me for not understanding the genius of this film.     So I pondered it for a while and decided that, while there are certainly aspects to respect, in the over-simplified classification of good-or-bad, I still have to lean toward the bad.    When done well, excessively long, silent shots can work very well to subtly further a story or emotion while drawing the viewer into its rhythm. I cite \\"Goodbye Dragon Inn\\" as an example. While I appreciated the desperation and loneliness conveyed by the lingering shots in Bunny, after a while I felt as though they had nothing more to convey, and they worked to the detriment of their initial impact.     While I appreciated the twist of his ditching his first flower-named female while she was packing (preventing a predictable storyline to follow), as well as the inner turmoil evidenced throughout, I didn't ultimately feel as though the message of the movie was really profound enough to justify the plodding build-up to get to it - it didn't pay off for me.     And as for the sex stuff at the end, I can't really believe people still make a big deal about seeing that stuff. Someday maybe we'll get over it.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Ok, for all you tools who keep saying \\"omg it took Trent 6 years to write this\\" Trent has been gone dealing with a severe alcohol addiction that almost killed him.  That's why every project he was involved with over that period dropped or disappeared, now with that out of the way.  This album, has its moments.  Some of the bad are, the drums.  I'm not attacking Dave Grohl's skills, listen to his Queens of The Stone Age work, it is just awesome, but with Nine Inch Nails it just doesn't fit.  The drums will usually line up great during the chorus but during the rest of the songs just sounds horrible. The effect of this is felt more because of the albums big shift to focus more on drums, bass, etc. and less on production.  This works great on \\"sunspots\\", very addictive sludgy guitar riff, but just sounds awful in the intro's of \\"you know who you are\\" and \\"the collector\\".  Almost any part of the album that involves just drums, a guitar, and Trent singing sounds off.  There is one seemingly directionless song on this album too \\"With Teeth\\", the song goes nowhere, just starts exactly how it ends.  There are some great moments though \\"Sunspots\\", \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\", \\"Right Where It Belongs\\", \\"everyday is exactly the same\\", \\"all the love in the world\\".  All have some great moments.  But this is what \\"with teeth\\" is, songs with their moments, not the consistent gems of \\"downward spiral\\" or, I know I'll get some frowns with this, \\"the fragile\\".  Don't worry though if you don't like this NIN outting another will be out a lot sooner than usual Trent has been saying that kicking alcohol has him a lot more focused.  Also expect a different tone, which kind has started here, Trent is generally happy now, except with politics of course.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|An amazing file and I do have to agree that you'd probably get lost if you didn't play the game at all.  You'll be wondering who's who and who these other people are and what's going on a lot.  There's a couple of places in it where the timeline becomes non-linear which will confuse a lot of people but it's easy to pick up on.  <br /> <br />Definantly worth the money.
B000AADYYO|5.0|After hearing the incredible differences between Damnation, the ultra-light album, and Blackwater Park and My Arms Your Hearse this band became an instant favorite of mine.  This album, like all of their previous is great.  What is even better is that the album has taken a lot of very different steps away from previous outtings.  For one Mikael's clean vocals have a wider range on this album, \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" being an example of this.  A heavy as hell intro that evolves into a light fragile acoustic interlude followed by, another change from previous albums, a Tool-like drum beat backed by some palm muted guitar.  I hate to say Tool-like because Opeth makes the sound all their own I just want to try to give a description of the music.  Another element of change is the work of Per Wiberg.  His organ and piano work add an epic feeling to some of the songs.  Or a blues feel to the end of \\"Hours of Wealth\\".  Then there is of course \\"The Grand Conjuration\\".  Just a fantastic song, is just heavy as hell and then has a great shredding-like guitar solo in it.  The final song on the album, \\"Isolation Years\\" a beautiful slower song about what else, but isolation.  Really shows how Mikael has experimented with a wide vocal range.  My final take on this album is that the lyrics are amazing, very cryptic at times, and probably Opeth's best outting.  However, there is not one heavy song on the album that is filled with growls, this isn't really a complaint but more of an observation of change.  This shows that the album really is a blend, of the good parts, of their previous works.  Great job on Opeth's part, hope their new label treats them well.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Yes, I am a diehard Clapton fan and I too was hoping for a bring the walls down rock and blues album; but, this is an excellent piece of work!  Vocally, EC is at his best.  The variety of styles keeps the album moving.  I was actually surprised each time a new track started, because each song was so different.  The lyrics are beautiful as well as meaningful.  The guitar work, though subtle most of the time, is still excellent.  If you don't like the soulful sound of \\"Love Don't Love Nobody', then apparently you just don't like music.  \\"I'm Going Left\\" is also outstanding.  No need writing about each song, it's a great CD, with maybe 2 weak songs.  The Limited Edition Dual Disc is well worth the money.  The EC interview adds insight to the album.
B000AL730O|5.0|After several listens to this new CD, I have to say there is not one song I do not like.  This Never Happened Before seems to be written for both Linda and Heather and I found it very moving.  English Tea is a fab song, very twee as the lyrics go. <br /> <br />I haven't decided on my favorite or which songs I hope to hear in concert, but I won't be disappointed with Sir Paul's selections from the new CD.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|These guys ROCK!!!!!  Got turned on to the band pretty recently and I have been impressed with every thing about these guys!  They are unbelievable!  I have been listening to them at work and now all my co-workers are huge fans!  The only thing better than their latest CD is seeing them live!  Check out their site [...] for tour info...you won't regret it!
B0006AZMFM|3.0|This is easily described as adult pop. Nothing fast enough that you would imagine a music video w/ choreography, slower songs- understand the comparison to Celine, but this girl is younger and gives the MUSIC a much younger feel. Some of the darker songs could be comparable to Tori Amos's sound. I don't understand why we haven't heard of her here. Don't let terrible one-hit wonder natalie imbrulia influence your opinion on Aussie music. For younger listeners I suggest Lucie Silvas, who has a Christina Aguilara vocal range and, which she doesn't use yet to it's advantage.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Imagine being taken and thrown into solitary confinement for 15 years without any knowledge of what you had done to deserve this. You can imagine the pain,frustration and rage building over the years, especially when hearing that the wife you had was murdered during your confinement and you are blamed, not to mention the daughter you don't get to see for those long years. Then one day you are suddenly and unexplainably released and expected to solve this little mystery in 5 days. This is the story of Oh dae su. The violence is flinchingly real(especially the torture scenes), the cinematography and acting great, and the ending sick and disturbing. This is how I like my movies! Please do what you will to see this movie even if that involves going on a hammer wielding ass-kicking crusade to the nearest video store. My rating: 9.5/10.
B0002VYQ2U|5.0|I LOVED \\"Come away with me\\" and was nervous about Norah's sophomore album.  Would it be as good?  Turns out I liked it even better than the first.  Tunes are catchy and slightly more upbeat than the first album.  Added bonus tracks are good too.  I love Moon Song and Sleepless nights.  Would HIGHLY recommend it!
B00068NVI4|5.0|Excellant concert, recommend highly if you are a Yes fan, you will not be disappointed
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Okay, call me crazy. I live in the so-called live music capital of the world here in Austin and what moment I anticipated the most here of recent weeks is the release of Takk by Sigur Ros. After watching the devastation of New Orleans, my favorite city on earth by the forces of nature and neglect by man I've had as much reality as I can stomach for now. What cure could be more apropos than the surreal, other worldly beauty of the new Sigur Ros - Takk CD?  Nothing could prepare me for the chilling, stark, and absolutely gorgeous songs that have been crafted with loving care. So keen has my escape been premiered that I went out in subsequent weeks and purchased the two The Album Leaf CDs - Seal Beach (reissued with the live tracks while on tour with Sigur Ros) and In A Safe Place (backed with Sigur Ros in a recording studio setting) to help satiate this chomping at the bit restlessness. It worked. Those excellent discs in their own way helped stir the stew and kneed the bread for the major musical threads now coursing their way through my subconscious as the Takk CD remains on repeat. As I slumber to the musical equivalent of adult Neverland tales I am thankful for the timeless quality and careful attention paid to every detail. The need for something ethereal and not grounded is overwhelming at present and they serve it up in abundance. This is like nothing else around and I hope that nothing else ever is. Their previous albums () and Agaetis Byrjun are Icelandic skyscrapers also, but Takk makes the huge leap forward to solidifying their unique qualities as substantial and lasting. I stand, no make that floored and speechless. I can no longer wipe the smile off my face as I can crimp the wings of my soaring spirit.<br /><br />The superb packaging and art design of CD pack is reminiscent of an old English first edition Victorian novel. Perfect in every aspect. Those willing to drop their guard and notions, there's plenty to be blown away by. Experiment soon. The effects are chilling, raucous, ambient, and melodic beyond compare.fects are chilling, raucous, ambient, and melodic beyond compare.
B00006879E|5.0|Your music is beautiful with alot of feeling behind your words, my emotions were touched.  I saw you, Adam, on the Ellen Degeneres Show a few weeks back.  Since then, I have been trying to remember your groups'name.  Internet makes many things possible, pretty scary.  Anyway, I didn't realize that I have been humming along to a couple of your other songs on the radio- now I know who the artist is!!  Big accomplishment for me. I can now go out and buy your album.  Jane is a lucky lady.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|What is the deal with this guy? Everybody fawns over him like he was the second comming or something. All I hear is some guy singing wispily over hushed atmospheric accompaniment. Okay, there are some fairly standard wispy pop horns here too. But I dunno - mixing Americana, over-erudite lyricism and early 90's twee just doesn't seem that groundbreaking to me. This record is pleasant in it's own dull little way, but these reviews seem like a sort of collective psychosis. I will admit that this is one of the greatest album TITLES in years, but the music just isn't.  I don't see what Sufjan does here that's any better than stuff groups like Belle and Sebastian, Willard Grant Conspiracy, and Trembling Blue Stars were putting out 10 years ago. Enough mopey singer-songwriters already. I'm calling for a moratorium on anyone who sounds even a little bit like Nick Drake. Who's with me??   Paging Merle Haggard. Beatdown needed in aisle 3.
6305922756|5.0|I have a list of movies that should be seen by all rock musicians.  This one tops the list.  If you have ever toured in a rock band, the truths in this movie will have you torn between laughter and perplexed recollection.  Some of the other titles in my list of movies that should be seen by all rock musicians are:<br /><br />* Standing in the Shadows of Motown<br />* Almost Famous<br />* Rock Star<br />* Amadeus (yes, rock musicians SHOULD see this movie!)<br />* and many, many more.....<br /><br />Enjoy... and turn the volume up to 11!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I think this album is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard! It IS way different from the first, but that is a wonderful thing because that means that the band is diverse. I love both albums and find their distinct diversification to be brilliant!! 30 seconds to mars defines the future of GREAT music! Everyone get out there and buy the album, as a matter of fact, buy BOTH if you don't already have them! Hope to see you all at their upcoming shows!!!!
0790731509|5.0|This movie has so many classic scenes!  From the 50 eggs to the shaking of the tree to the digging and filling of the ditch, this movie carries weight.  If you have not yet seen this movie, you should make time and do so in the immediate future.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|What is there left to say about Icelandic four piece Sigur Ros that hasn't been said before? <br /> <br />In the ten years since their conception they've continually managed to astound, encapsulate and bewilder all in the space of one piece of music - no point saying song as Sigur Ros don't strictly do \\"songs\\" - creating the perfect accompaniment to any kind of celluloid moment from Tolkien-esque wizardry to Barry like thrillers. <br /> <br />The critics have loved them from day one, and finally with `Takk' getting the Hollywood seal of approval from people like Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow it seems like the name checks could pay dividends when the sales-related pay cheques arrive. <br /> <br />Whereas their last long player `()' bordered slightly on the overblown and pretentious, `Takk' is more of a return to the grandiose, dream theatre of 1999's `Agaetis Byrjun' with more expensive production thrown in for good measure, and straight from the word \\"Fara\\", where the title track effortlessly glides into the elegiac nursery rhyme of `Glosoli', `Takk' sounds like it could be Sigur Ros' most accessible record to date. As `Glosoli' builds and builds into the sort of climax usually reserved for volcanic eruptions, the aftermath is like a sweet feeling of relief, as the quietly moving `Hoppipolla' follows suit, almost soothing in contrast to it's precursor's dynamic explosion. <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine what inspired Sigur Ros to write this album but if `Se Lest' is anything to go by, then maybe six months locked up in a feral cat sanctuary was one of their between albums vacations?  <br /> <br />The hushed lullaby of `Saeglopur' and graceful ambience of `Milano' set the scene for the `Loveless' defined orchestral fervour of `Gong', a monolith of simplistic notes and chord changes with more layers than a wedding cake and a penchant for unexpected twists and turns that only Hockenheim can match in it's complexity. If dream weaving were an art form, then Sigur Roswould be the master tutors par excellence. <br /> <br />By the time `Heysatan' closes the record, it's almost time to open one's eyes and return to the land of the living.  <br /> <br />`Takk' raises the bar for any of Sigur Ros' post-ethereal soundscape contemporaries. There isn't really anything else you can say about Sigur Ros or this record that the music doesn't translate in itself, and in my book, that is possibly the highest compliment you can pay any artist past or present.
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't think I can add anything more profound or noteworthy regarding this record than what has already been posted by the 500 plus reviewers before me. I came into jazz late in life, having grown up listening to rock and roll through my late 30's. It was around the time of my 40th birthday that I first heard \\"So What\\" on a jazz radio station, and I was immediately drawn to this recording like a magnet. I raced into a record store and bought \\"Kind of Blue.\\" I became an instant convert to jazz, almost overnight. I have probably listened to this record thousands of times during periods of both sorrow and joy. This record has kept me good company over the years. Interestingly, I seem to find something new and interesting with each repeated listening. Kind of Blue is a classic piece of art that certainly belongs in any record collection. The cast of characters who created this timeless recording reads like a who's who list of the greatest jazz musicians of the 20th century. The playing from Davis, Coltrane, Evans, et al is simply superb. Kind of Blue is arguably the single best jazz recording ever released. What more can I say? If you don't have it, go out and buy it today....This is essential music...
B0006L16N8|4.0|This album is much better than their last eight albums which fell short, due to the overusage of screaming and water noises.  This album excels because of its new incorporation of woman singing and reverberating sounds heard on a daily basis (i.e., screaming and water noises).  I love it!  It takes me back to their earlier days in the 50's when they experimented with doo-whop and wrote 23 second ditties.  The only disapointed on this album, their thirteenth, is that he gurgles and spits way too much.  Because of that and his usage of the word \\"fixxer pots\\", I find the album inapproriate for younger listeners (under 15 crowd).  Nevertheless, I will be listening to this for years to come and will no doubt breathe with greater ease.  10 pounds good!!!
0517122707|3.0|After my visit to the great city of New Orleans just a week before the devastation left by Katrina, I decided to read this award-winning novel that is set in New Orleans. And it's true that this novel has the city at heart. As a matter of fact, the city itself becomes somewhat of a character in Toole's novel. But in the end, I can't fully admit to having loved this book. <br /> <br />And this is mostly due to the story's main character. Ignatious is a large, very loud, very opinionated man that can never find the errors in his ways. His life is nothing but a sham, and his mind is a ludicrous fried mess. Being well in his thirties, he still lives with his mother, does not have a job and refuses to take ahold of his life. <br /> <br />No wonder he is giving his mother headaches. Ignatius is just a big bag of problems. So after his mother has a car accident due to his carelessness, she decides that he needs to find a job in order to help pay for the damages. Reluctantly, Ignatius agrees. As we follow him from job to job, the character becomes more and more ridiculous, more and more irresponsible. <br /> <br />Ignatius got on my nerves, plain and simple. Although some moments had me smiling, I rolled my eyes more often than anything else. These characters are clueless, desperate and very, very emotionally empty. I like a little more substance and three-dimentional characters when I read a book. And the ending itself is much too evasive; nothing is really resolved, nothing is explained, nothing is settled. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the novel for taking me back to New Orleans, albeit in the 1960s. In here, we find great pleasure in following these characters around the great city.  <br /> <br />In the end, this somewhat comic novel simply didn't do it for me. Although I could appreciate some of it, a greater part of it left me feeling a little bitter.

B000AL730Y|4.0|This CD sounds different than any other McCartney album to date. The instrumental interludes are more atmospheric. Some songs such as Riding to Vanity Fair are darker in sound utilizing minor keys. Overall this is a much more mature and subdued McCartney. Occasionally the mood harkens back. English Tea sounds like it would been at home in the Sgt. Pepper days. McCartney acknowledges George Harrison's influence in Friends to Go a song with nice Beatlesqu background vocals. Other influences he admits to in the DVD are Randy Newman (Anyway) and Charlie Chaplain (Too Much Rain). There are elements that seem to owe something to Coldplay McCarneys favorite contemporary band. The only song that I would skip over is A Certain Softness, a song that is too lightweight for this collection. The CD would have been better if \\"Softness\\" had been replaced by Comfort of Love, The song offered as a download to those who get this CD at Best Buy (Does anyone know if Best Buy the only place this download is offered?). Comfort of Love is more catchy than most of the songs on the CD and could easily have been released as a single. <br />Following a courant trend there is a hidden track at the end of the CD, an unnamed instrumental. Mcartney Plays most of the instruments, with his tour band playing only on Follow Me, and then only in minor rolles. <br />Overall this is not the catchy pop we expect from McCartney, but songs that creep up on you and get under your skin with their deceptive complexity.  <br />The best part of the DVD is the making of section where Paul and Producer Nigel Godrich talk about the development of the songs. This section also has a segment of Paul presenting a new song at the Glastonbury Festival. This made me wish they had included more from the Glastonbury performance. The animated line drawings part is only worth one watch. It's not really animated but the drawings from the booklet being panned with instrumental backing tracks playing. <br />The in studio performance video for Fine Line is OK. <br />
B000002KM6|5.0|I have to say that this is the FINEST work overall of the DAVE era. The \\" Anchor \\" song of this album is my own personal national anthem, \\" Unchained \\". The greatest guitar  work you can ever hear ( I am a guitarist ). Although other excellent songs are \\" Dirty Movies \\", \\" Mean Street \\", \\" Sinners Swing \\", and, \\" So This Is Love \\". The entire album is fast paced for the most part and it is good to catch your breath with, \\" Push Comes To Shove\\". This is another album that you should buy and keep in your collection if you can never buy another VH-CD ever. <br />I can say that the first 6 VH albums are worth your time but if you can only afford 1 make it this one.
0451191153|5.0|i am really enjoying this book.  i don't want to put it down.  i am not finished yet, but I still don't see why it caused such stir when it was published.
B00006AW2S|5.0|At the time ( 1965 ) when this album was released the hit single \\"Satisfaction\\" was riding the #1 spot for along time.The other top 40 smash hit \\"The Last Time\\" ( previous hit ) could also be found on this album. Even if these were the only 2 songs on the album that would be enough. The other 10 songs make it, very possibly, Rocks all time champ.From \\"Spider & the Fly\\" to \\"Cry to Me\\" and every song in between, the Stones showed the world that they were fast becoming a complete band. It you only have a budget for 1 Stones album - MAKE IT THIS !!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I loved this album. There is beauty, joy, pain, and many other feelings all wrapped up in these tracks. Every word, emotion, and cry resonates in your bones.  <br />Whether or not you liked 30 Seconds To Mars first album doesn't matter. A Beautiful Lie is something you should experiance for yourself. It differs greatly from the first album and is a much more personal experiance.  <br />Just buy it. Listen to it. I'm sure you'll love it.  <br />
0060736267|2.0|My bookclub picked this book as every once in a while we do a classic and many in my club had fond memories of this book.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it.  I got about half through and was never engaged in it.  I found myself skimming much of it and finally decided that I'd move on to something else.  I think if you enjoy lots of detailed description, this  might be a good book for you.  It moved too slowly for me, though.
B00000J7SS|5.0|While jazz has had such a great evolution since it began in the early 20th Century, from traditional, to swing, to be-bop, the very late sixties to the early seventies brought up a very important progression in the genre thus far. Fusion was something that some have argued is what really defines jazz, this was one of the first that actually established fusion for what we know of today. Along with his other album \\"In a Silent Way\\", that came out just a couple years prior to \\"Bitches Brew, Miles Davis created a very unique musical form, that many have labelled these albums especially \\"Brew\\" as being utterly genius. So what defines fusion? Miles being a fan of much of the \\"pop\\" music that debuted in the sixties combined that with jazz, creating a \\"fusion\\" of sorts. Davis combines his talent with other important jazz musicians talent as the basis for \\"Brew\\". Many of the musicians who would go on to form their own pioneering fusion bands such as Return to Forever, The Weather Report and The Mahavishnu Orchestra are present on this album including, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Lenny White and Jack DeJohnette among others. The music on this album is nothing but fascinating. While most songs are pretty lengthy in time, each musician has their time in the spotlight, that's not to say that Miles is thrown in the background, most of the solos is played by the Davis. It is easy to see why many conservative jazz musicians didn't like the album, the songs are very different sounding, even more so to fusion we hear today like John Scofield, various Chick Corea bands and Pat Metheny for example. The music can get some getting used to, but the music will eventually overcome and one will find themselves in amazement. The title cut is probably the most interesting on the album. With its' almost pulsating introduction and atmospheric, very experimental keyboard sounds, until Miles enters playing a very haunting almost fanfare sounding lick that introduces the song. There are many other important highlights that one hears on \\"Bitches Brew\\", from the techmicality of \\"Spanish Key\\" to the closing of the album with \\"Feio\\", is all apart of a very genius album. Although to some there may be better fusion bands and albums out there, it really doesn't get any better than this. \\"Bitches Brew\\" is an album that any musicians or music listeners should consider, for it is such an important landmark in the world of music that helped to create such an important genre that includes everything from Sting to Smooth Jazz to The Weather Report.
1561007919|3.0|I haven't opened this book to listen to it so I can't speak to its condition. They should give more time before asking for feedback. It arrived promptly.
B000AL730O|2.0|He's showing his age by preaching. No doubt the over 40 set (that's me) will dig this CD, for nostalgic reasons. But does this CD represent something, new, fresh,or different? Nah!
B0000UJDLM|3.0|Short Circuit is entertaining enough on a boring day, uplifting enough on a down day.  It is just what it says it is --just enough to be what is needed to get over that hump feeling.   <br />This movie is great for the young to watch, but if you are an adult don't expect any enlightenment--not there, but it is great for just seeing a movie for the entertainment of seeing a movie.
B0002S94OS|5.0|The band that arose from the underground and kicked mainstream in the ass. Well sort of, signing to Epic has given the guy's a lot of crap, though they don't deserve it, if anything signing to Epic and having Machine produce their major label debut has made them nothing short of a force to be reckoned with. That said, ever since buying this last fall it still has a valuable spot in my cd player. The Faded Line is my favorite track of the record, catchy guitar riffing and the outro with the machine like sounds, though that could be Mark Morton's unusual guitar leads, produce this weird haunting landscape. Their live show will defiently open you up more to this band, ever since I first saw them I've been addicted, they always come and destroy the venue, well at least in Seattle they have, \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" is a defienite must own for any metal/hard rock fan, unless ofcourse your too elitist to accept the fact a band 10 years strong would like to make some $, but whatever, get the hell over yourself would ya.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Simply put: This wicked album is CRUCIAL! If you love the last one, you'll love this one. Some people say TREE was better than JAMROCK. I disagree. I believe that JAMROCK is even better! Why? Well, for better or worse (you decide) there are less guest Rappers on JAMROCK. There is also a lot of STEPHEN MARLEY, which is great, since Stephen's new one, ''GOT MUSIC?'' was postponed. Listening to JAMROCK, there are times when my jaw drops open, amazed at the ''conshus vibez'' blazin' through this entire album. Much Respect to Damian & Stephen Marley! And, of course, thanks and praises to The Most HIGH!
B000002H5I|5.0|This is a truely great album and I love it, I love Tracy Chapman and I love listening to this CD. I had the tape but it got worn-out after repeatedly listening to it and now I have the CD and its one of my most precious possesions. The songs arouse all kinds of emotions and from the beginning (Talkin bout a revolution) to the end (For you) takes you on a musical journey that will leave you wanting more. The lyrics are written in the package and in several languages as well. My brother and sister both have this CD and they love it. My only slight criticism is of the song (behind the wall) which is an a cappella,  and (If not now) which is way way to short. This album and its contents transcend time and if you are a true music lover, then you need to buy it, well worth more that the money. Thanks a lot Tracy.
0609610570|3.0|Interesting perspective on corporate business.  Unique complilation with text and the author's quotes.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Yet another Clutch album. Yet another masterpiece. Talk about groove. Talk about blues. Talk about rock. Damn. Clutch seem to go unnoticed, even in today's music scene, and it's simply unfair judging by how much talent is in this great band. Fans of this band will know that a Clutch album is always a must-have, and this is no exception. How they keep making such quality material after so long and with very little or no mainstream success, is beyond me..though very popular as a cult-band, they're hardly heard on the radio or played/talked about on MTV. (And that's the way the band wants to keep it, it seems)    This album kind of snuck up on me, as i only just recently heard about it's release and so i went out to buy it about a week ago. I'm more than just impressed with everything about it, from the artwork and fold-out cover to the great guitar work on this album, not to mention the overall musicianship. Neil Fallon's vocals don't sound *as* harsh as on previous albums, at least to me, but they may have to do with the great production on this album. The trademark crazy rhymes/lyrics are still there though, delivered with the same style of old.    My favorite songs for the moment are; \\"The Incomparable Mr. Flannery\\", \\"Gullah\\", \\"Mice and Gods\\", \\"Never Be Moved\\", \\"10001110101\\", and the country-vibe of \\"Gravel Road\\". There are alot of highlights on this album though, so one just has to listen to it as a whole and take it all in. There are also two instrumentals which are great. They are; \\"Small Upsetters\\" and \\"Tripping The Alarm\\". The album closes with; \\"Who's Been Talking?\\", and it's pretty much the most quiet track on this album. This album i think will grow on alot of people. That is to say, that it'll take a little while to get into. For me, it did..it took a few days for it all to come together. But once it does, you'll be listening to it quite frequently.    So here you have it.. Clutch. New Album. 14 songs. 55 minutes long. If you're already a fan, it's a no-brainer. For new fans, i'd even start with this. Maybe try the samples first and see what you think. This is, yet again, another really enjoyable album by Clutch. It's definitely worth your time if you're even slightly into Rock or Hard Rock/Blues.     I'm already wondering how their next album will sound like..
0060516402|5.0|Excellent reading.  The interesting tidbits of information about how the various companies evolved made it difficult to set the book down.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|All I have to say is WOW!  This is quite possibly the best album I've heard in a while.  All the songs on it stray from the sound of their original self-titled realease, but from my perspective it was a step in the right direction.  Saying that is VERY hard for me given that their first album was on non-stop play in my car for about a year. <br />    As far as the new album goes, they have adopted a variety of sounds from emo to screamo and plain old alt-rock.  Be wary of my wording because I don't quite think those categories fit their sound but it's what has bounced around in my head while listening to it.  My favorite songs have to be The Kill and most importantly R-Evolve.  I think both songs truly capture the emotion and raw passion that this group has for music. <br />    Through various plays in my car I have converted several people who swore they would never listen to this group.  A true testament to the genius the guys put into the record. Definitely pick this one up!!!
B00023B1A8|1.0|Anybody that knows anything  about music will tell you that Stephen Stills is the greatest guitarist that ever lived.  Look his name up on the internet, any site will tell you this.  Without him, there is no Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  Although they are the best ever together.  Stills is lead singer and guitarist
B000006E4C|5.0|If you have ever heard of Steve Reich, it may have been in a Music Appreciation class in college. His genre is minimalism, considered by some to be &#34;America's classical music.&#34; If you have never heard this kind of music before, it could really bother you. This music has a whole different philosophy underlying it. What is music supposed to do for you? Popular classical music typically has strong form, and seeks to provide the listener with many types of variety in melody and chord-progression. Minimalism intentionally does away with a lot of that. In Steve Reich's music, rhythm is very important, and in 18, continuous pulses, melodic patterns, crescendos and decrescendos all swirl and dovetail. Repetition is used to create a tonal &#34;picture&#34; for you to soak in as subtle variations are introduced and eventually fade out. The result is colorfully impressionistic, and at times jazzy.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Listen, I hate the politics but I gotta admit these guys are tight on this.  Best drumming I've heard in a while.
B000AA305M|5.0|I knew immediately upon the first listen that this album wasn't going to leave my sound system anytime soon. The expanded, lush, acoustic producion on this album is a welcome new aspect to David's signature 'sound'; the orchestra sounds gorgeous - as do the horns; David's voice is stronger than ever and he's using his vocal range to excellent effect here.  <br /> <br />A stunningly powerful album from start to finish.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I grew up reading Tolkein's books and other books in the same genre (e.g., C.S. Lewis, Feist, etc..).   <br /> <br />In today's fast pace world of corporate American jobs (in my case firms such as Morgan Stanley, IndyMac Bank, Homestore), it is always a nice to have a reprieve through the vision of someone such as Peter Jackson who truly captured the essence of the books in his films using all the insider trading secrets he has learned through the years.   <br /> <br />I've read all of Tolkeins books when I was a kid, but found the sec ond one to be my favorite.  The movies were no exception. <br /> <br />So if you are a movie afficianado, I encourage you to watch these films while you are still young at heart. <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Although I am, and always will be a HUGE 30STM fan, I must say, this album is BEAUTIFUL.  Yes, it is not exactly like the last album, but a little change wont hurt anyone!!!  There are similar sounds and new sounds.  If you liked the old album for its unique quality, you'll love A Beautiful Lie for its unique quality also...may not be the exact same type of 'unique' but if you buy it, you may discover you like it better.  You may not.  Its up to you.  I LOVED IT!!!!!
B000002LPD|4.0|In 1991 Van Halen released their ninth studio album \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.\\" It was their third album with lead singer Sammy Hagar and their first collaboration with producer Ted Templeman since \\"1984\\" (1984). Perhaps because Templeman was back at the helm as co-producer, \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" rocks a lot harder than its two processors \\"5150\\" (1986) and \\"OU812\\" (1988).<br /><br />Released in the waning days of pop-metal, right before the onset of the alternative rock boom of '91, \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" eschews many of the commercial aspects of \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812.\\" While the album overall is quite radio/MTV friendly, the album lacks the ballads and keyboards of Van Hagar's first two albums.<br /><br />I find \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" to sound more like Sammy Hagar's 80s Geffen albums-\\"Standing Hampton\\" (1981), \\"Three Lock Box\\" (1982) and \\"VOA\\" (1984) as opposed  to the early Van Hagar albums or classic Roth-era Van Halen. In short, \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" is meat-and-potatoes, no nonsense AOR rock n' roll.<br /><br />Van Halen and Hagar's third collaboration saw all involved return to their roots, more or less. The band opted to make a great hard-rock album, as opposed to a more commercial adult-contemporary one.<br /><br />While \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812\\" were strong, the band hadn't sounded so good in years. Unlike \\"OU812,\\" you can actually hear Michael Anthony's bass. Drummer Alex Van Halen didn't play on some lame drum machine (as he did on \\"5150\\") and the tone and mix sounds much better here than it did on \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812.\\" Sammy Hagar's lyrics showed more depth and he, as always, gives a fine vocal performance. And, it goes without saying that Eddie Van Halen sounds as great as ever, contributing at least a few screeching solos to each song.  And while the band certainly rocks harder here than they did on the two proceeding albums, the song-writing was still strong. The album is filled with good hooks and sing-along melodies. Although some songs are better than others, there really isn't any filler on \\"For Unlawful Canal Knowledge.\\"<br /><br />Up to this point in the band's career, the overall tone of Van Halen's catalogue was celebratory. \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" represents the last album of that era. It was really the last feel-good Van Halen album. Although \\"Balance\\" (1995) is a fine album, it was a distinctly dark album released in a musical landscape that had abolished all traces of 80s rock (Van Halen, KISS, Aerosmith, were among those spared). \\"Van Halen 3\\" (1998) saw Van Halen experiment and venture out in a way that Van Halen's fans almost unanimously rejected. \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" was released at a time when bands like Poison and Warrant enjoyed mainstream popularity and huge commercial successes. Much like \\"Balance\\" reflected the dark musical landscape of the times, \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" reflected the sunny careless days of Beverley Hills 90210 and George H.W. Bush's \\"1000 points of light.\\" That is not to say that \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" lacks substance, as the band shows depth in songs like \\"Right Now\\" and \\"Judgment Day.\\" But the album's overall tone is bright and optimistic, unlike \\"Balance\\" which is pessimistic and dark.<br /><br />\\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" opens up strong with the arena-rock anthem \\"Poundcake\\" which was the band's most rocking song since \\"Panama\\" (from \\"1984\\"). \\"<br /><br />\\"Judgment Day,\\" has a great groove and Hagar shows some depth with his questioning of the religious right and televangelists.<br /><br />Although \\"Spanked\\" is mid-tempo, it never gets tepid. The lyrics are a little stupid, but stupid in a naïve, Sammy Hagar/jock rock kind-of-way, so I'll give Hagar a pass.<br /><br />\\"Runaround\\" is just a fun song that keeps up the momentum.<br /><br />\\"Pleasure Dome,\\" whose meaning is obscure, is said to be a song about masturbation. This song has an almost mystical vibe to it, with a really cool drum roll-it'sdifferent for Van Halen and a really cool song.<br /><br />Although the title of \\"In and Out\\" may lead one to believe it's just another stupid song about sex, it actually is far more substantive than that. The major point of the song being that life is hard and you have to pay debts throughout life.<br /><br />Although not an album highlight, the catchy mid-paced \\"Man on a Mission\\" keeps the album going.<br /><br /> \\"The Dream is Over\\" is a personal favorite of mine. It has a great infectious groove, catchy sing-along chorus, and killer solos-in short, it has all the ingredients of the perfect Van Halen song. It's a song about letting go, of letting a dream die and moving on. \\"The Dream is Over\\" demonstrates Hagar's everyman wisdom at its best.<br /><br />The album's huge hit and centerpiece \\"Right Now\\" introduced \\"Generation Y\\" to Van Halen. \\"Right Now\\" should silence Van Halen's detractors who claim that the band never had any songs with substance.  Sammy Hagar's lyrics may not be witty and clever like Roth's, or profound like Lennon and Dylan's. However, as previously stated, Hagar's lyrics do encompass an \\"everyman wisdom\\"-a blue-collar insight that you learn though the school-of-hard-knocks, as opposed to reading Plato. \\"Right Now\\" shows this kind of insight. And while the song's theme-live in the present, forget about the past, don't worry about the future-may seem obvious, Hagar's lyrics are clever and memorable. He tells the theme in a way that puts life in perspective.<br /><br /> \\"316\\" is a short lullaby-like acoustic instrumental tribute to Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang.<br /><br />I see the upbeat \\"Top of the World\\" as a sequel to \\"Dreams\\" (from \\"5150\\"), but with guitar in place of synthesizers.  This upbeat rocker is strong enough and a good way to conclude the album.<br /><br />In all honesty, \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" can't touch the classic first six Van Halen albums-but very few ones can. Nor is \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" quite as strong as some of Sammy Hagar's solo albums-\\"Danger Zone\\" (1980), \\"Standing Hampton\\" (1981), and \\"Marching to Mars\\" (1997)-as some examples.  Still, although Van Halen purists will never accept anything after \\"1984,\\" \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" is a strong album that should please most fans., with a really cool drum roll-it's different for Van Halen and a really cool song.  <br /> <br />Although the title of \\"In and Out\\" may lead one to believe it's just another stupid song about sex, it actually is far more substantive than that.

B000088E6D|4.0|Do you like big bands?? Throw in a touch of jazz and add a great singer and you've got this album. Michael hails from Vancouver BC. Highlights on this album are his cover of 'Sway' which was very popular quite some years ago, his version of George Michaels' 'Kissing A Fool' and a cover of the Bee Gees' 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart' with backup by Barry Gibb. This album along with his February 2005 release of 'It's Time' which has gone platinum, will give you an evening of pure enjoyment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you did not give this cd five stars then either you have only listened to it once or you are musically retarded. I can think of no other reason why someone could not think this album is a masterpiece. The sheer talent and thought put into this work is just amazing. The first time I listened to this cd I thought it was a pretty good cd. The second time I thought it was great, the third time a masterpiece. And it just keeps getting better.
B000A42QIU|5.0|This album, Very and its much more rare companion, Very Relentless, can be summed up in the Pet Shop Boys' own words (one of the lyrics taken from the song Yesterday When I was Mad) -- they've 'both made such a little go a very long way'. A very long way, indeed.<br /><br />All of the songs on this album have the same feel -- the same texture, the same lyrical quality, the same 'groove' if you will -- which is remarkable for a collection of different songs, from ballads to a roaring remake of the Village People's Go West (a song Toyota still uses occasionally in advertising -- listen for the backing music). One would almost swear that the actual Village People are making up the chorus as Neil Tennant's high-pitched, flat voice calls out 'Life is peaceful there' as the gruff, deep voices growl, GO WEST!<br /><br />All the songs are dancable (not true of all the songs on all the albums) -- the videos which accompany this album all have the same computer-generated motion and costume and background (someone in the Pet Shop Boys camp obviously had recently discovered computer-generated graphics and animation and decided to have some fun!). I was frankly a bit disappointed with the videos, because the idea was original, but it was the same idea for each video (and we fans are used to stylish, original videos for each song).<br /><br />This album will please Pet Shop Boys fans; it may find a good home with electronic/disco music fans. As with all Pet Shop Boys songs, listen to the lyrics -- they are witty and thoughtful -- the song Dreaming of the Queen actually plays on a recurrent nightmare/stress dream that the average Brit would have but Americans don't -- the stress that the Queen drops by for a visit when you're not ready (either undressed, or dirty house, &c.) -- probably the closest equivalent stress dream in American terms would be the test-anxiety pop-quiz-you-haven't-studied-for dream.<br /><br />Other songs include the poignant The Theatre, in which one can sense the frustration of struggling artists as they watch their more successful compatriots pass by; To speak is a sin, recapturing a word from a previous hit, It's a sin, something the no-longer Roman Catholic Tennant likes to muse over now and again; the first semi-hit Can you forgive her, a crashing, triumphant, psychological song that reinforces the ambiguous sexuality of this duo (later to be made less so).<br /><br />So, pay attention to the lyrics, and have a Very Very good listen.can sense the frustration of struggling artists as they watch their more successful compatriots pass by; To speak is a sin, recapturing a word from a previous hit, It's a sin, something the no-longer Roman Catholic Tennant likes to muse over now and again; the first semi-hit Can you forgive her, a crashing, triumphant, psychological song that reinforces the ambiguous sexuality of this duo (later to be made less so). <br /> <br />So, pay attention to the lyrics, and have a Very Very good listen. <br /> <br />

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|there are only a few songs that sound like the first cd...for most bands that would serve as disaster.  but i think that they have revamped their sound and it is still good music.  leto screams a lot in this album, so if that is what you are looking for this is a must buy.  there are a few slower songs.  # 11 is the best song on the album.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|People desperately want there to be a resurgence of epic rock music and for that reason are calling this terrible album a masterpiece. It feels like a bunch of disjointed riffs and sound effect noodling thrown together with terrible guitar solos by  in between. Jamming with this guitarist must be the most frustrating thing in the universe but you'll appreciate that after listening to this because the whole album is basically a jam session that features an incredible drummer but otherwise musicians who are trying to be something they are not. In fact the drums are the most prominent instrument on this album. 5 stars for the drummer, 1 star for the insipid lyrics and non musical garbage of the rest of the album.
B0006J28BO|4.0|As a fan of Hayao Miyazaki, I was surprised to find that this companion to his Whispers of the Heart did not have the character designs that are so recognizably in his style. However, the animation was incredible (as always from Studio Ghibli) and it was easy to tell from how the characters moved that it was his style of animation. Hiroyuki Morita has done a very nice job as his successor. <br /> <br />Compared to Whispers of the Heart, this movie was much more of a children's piece; a lot of kids might be bored by parts of Whispers of the Heart, which focused more on a girl growing up than the fantastical adventures of the Baron, who appears in both movies. It was a lot of fun, though, and I really enjoyed it. The only problem I had with it was that the subtitles sometimes didn't reflect what was being said in the actual Japanese track. I haven't listened to the dub, but since the voice actors are fairly well-known, I imagine it's pretty good. Cary Elwes would certainly make a good Baron.
B000002H48|5.0|As a child of the 70's who grew up in a very \\"no nukes\\" home this album was on the turn table every night.  What a great find for me all these years later as I start my own family.  \\"Power\\" is one of the nicest, smoothest, most heartwarming songs every performed.  <br /> <br />The geniune love, care and respect these artists had for each other and mostly the earth and it's future generations pours through on every note.
B00008YZYM|5.0|This film is a wonderful \\"feel good\\" movie for the whole family to enjoy.    The story is about 2 twins who were separated at birth and then accidently meet at summer camp.  Their adventures and experiences leave the viewer with lots of laughs and entertainment. Dennis Quaid is great and Lindsay Lohan shows great talent in playing both twins.  My niece came to visit this past summer and watched the movie at least 5 times in the 2 weeks she was here.  Would highly recommend this.
0141301120|3.0|The sequel is more scattered than the original with some nice moments, but not as many as the first book, and it doesnt hang together as well.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Seldomly do I find an album that sits and shines next to my classics collection. Rare is it, that the album actually stays there for more than two weeks to a month. Aside from 2005 being one of the most explosive years in music since 1994, The Mars Volta cooked something that starts fire and sends fans either running or basking in the warmth.<br /><br />'Frances the Mute' is one of those albums that is a rare breed. There's a level of madness and to a degree that's somewhat glorifying and all out beautiful. Case in point,  \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus.\\" An eye opener for anyone still left with \\"Televators\\" back in 2003. Spanish chords and Cedric's wispy, hollowed voice echoes like a lullaby until the band literally explodes to the point of seperation into a fast, catchy, riff riot. Think of the Big Bang theory, but do that in a politically correct way, too.<br /><br />Anyone who wants a second coming of Led Zeppelin's \\"Dazed and Confused\\", might be psyched(literally) with \\"The Widow.\\" Being the band's first single, it's only a three plate meal of the genuine banquet Volta has to offer. Cedric shines in this, but Omar seems rather styled even in a static, 'out of the henhouse' sort of way. There's beauty in style. I just think of blue lights and foggy roads, but that's me...<br /><br />\\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is a song I was at odds with. At first, I loved the heart attack riff that basically starts a Spanish fiesta, but for awhile I didn't understand why the song would be so basic. Verse, chorus, verse. Never did I think Mars Volta were capable of being this stoic, but I was wrong. Although I found the song eating my marrow, I also found it repetitive for some reason. Hell, I still skip to it today, though.<br /><br />More and more effects and an aura that either takes you to and from strange places or just pisses you off. I can't even begin to tell you how many people complained that they don't want to hear five minutes of static. It's not that, though.(So I explain, again.) It's a movement, it's a power that has no source. Ambience is about the one thing Mars Volta yearn to create and in the end, there's an atmosphere far more suitable than the burning sky today.<br /><br />\\"Cassandra Geminni\\" is why anyone should buy this album. In the thirty minute finale, this song plays like a hybrid, Paul Verhoeven/Oliver Stone love child film. There's the slow, the fast, the slow, and a lot of fastness back again. I would say controversial fastness...the type of fastness that can kill a man. What am I saying? There's no such thing as \\"fastness\\", but there's also no such thing as a thirty minute opus in this lifetime...<br /><br />But there is, but there is. When Cedric screams, \\"Now there's no light...\\", the drums kick and blast away a sound no different than the machine guns of a militaristic world. Omar basically makes love with his guitar and the band itself, especially organs and Spanish underlines(horns and sax), make this song probably one of the most important musical pieces in recent memory.<br /><br />You have a little of this, a lot of that, and a sum of all odds. Hell, that's exactly what this album is. Besides, my pick for 2005 Album of the Year.<br /><br />Not too shabby, not too shabby...again.) It's a movement, it's a power that has no source.

0895260131|1.0|I only gave it one star since it is intended to be a serious and thought provoking book.  Enlightenment for the weak minded perhaps, but it read more like a parody created by the Daily Show. <br /> <br />This is such bad propaganda I am embarrassed for those that read it and found its horrible twisting of historical fact as a rationale for determining the direction our country needs to go.  It is sad that more than half of our nation's discourse is provided by Rush Limbaugh dittoheads and Al Franken clones. <br /> <br />For any intelligent and well read individual, enjoy the unintended joke.
0393317552|1.0|The author attempts in leaps and bounds to make causal inferences such as, \\"Because so-and-so plant developed on the Euphrates, the region thrived culturally and economically.\\" For each of these myriad statements, he skips about 76,000 mediating factors along the way, as well as 4 billion other possible explanations. The cause and effect statements as put forth in this fiction novel are dangerous, unscientific, and completely uninteresting to anyone remotely logical. This was the absolute worst over-hyped book I've read in 5 years. It clearly overlooks the scientific method for the sake of appeasing the liberal masses. Big brother is now a liberal since this is the only kind of garbage \\"science\\" you can get your hands on anymore.
B000002897|5.0|Yeah they're from Seattle, but this AIN'T GRUNGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is soooooooooooooooo much better...<br /><br />I bought this album right after it was released, a few years later they came to N'Awlins with Sponge, The Ramones, Soundgarden, RATM, Metallica and a few others. It may have been Lollapalloza, I can't remember.. Anyway these guys were absolutely amazing.. We all went to see the 'headliners' but we left talking about 'The Trees'..<br /><br />This is one of those groups that you forget about. The CD gets put on the botton of the pile and you forget about it.. Then one day you'll hear Nearly Lost You or All I Know on the radio and you think \\"$h!t, I haven't listen to the Trees in a while\\" So you dig it out, and it sits in your CD player for the next month because you just can't stop listening to it...<br /><br />I have probably listened to this CD more then all of my Nirvana, Soundgarden and Alice In Chain cd's combined.. This one is THAT Good...<br /><br />From the beginning of Shadow of the Season, to the end of Julie Paradise (possibly the best song on the album) this album just never lets up.. And Talk about diverse.... Nearly Lost You demonstrates the great song writing ability that these guys possessed, and is an instant classic. The Secret Kind kicks @$$, and then to go from that right into The Winter Song, which is a slower, yet 'hard' 'ballad'..<br /><br />It really is a shame that these guys didn't garner more of a following, they really were an awesome group...
B000002G87|5.0|To me, the song \\"Layla\\" is the penultimate rock 'n roll song.  For a lot of years quite a few people thought that Eric Clapton had lost it.  He was doing albums like 451 Ocean Boulevard and stuff like that.  I'd just tell them \\"He wrote 'Layla'!  He doesn't have to prove anything else.\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" is a beautiful examination of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" story, and tells it in a unique and effective way. I bought this CD as a result of a recommendation from a friend. It absolutely blew me away! <br />The main storyline of this musical is based upon the book by the same title, written by Gregory Maguire. It explores the history of Elfaba, a young woman destind to be known as the \\"Wicked Witch of the West\\" by the inhabitants of Oz. \\"Wicked\\" tells of Elfaba's childhood, how she was born as a result of an extramarital affair participated in by her mother and a travelling salesman. Elfaba is green as a result of her mother imbibing a green elixir while in the company of the salesman. Elfaba suffers ridicule and neglect from her mother and father, and is instructed to care for her younger sister Nessa, who is destined to become \\"The Wicked Witch of the East.\\" Elfaba and Nessa attend a school (Schizz,) for aspiring sorcerer's and sorceresses. While there, Elfaba is roommate with Golinda, (not a typo), who eventually becomes \\"The Witch of the North.\\" I will not give away anymore of the plot, I will just say that this musical explores innocence, idealism, and the struggle for exceptance as well as the lasting power of friendship. Not only does this musical have an interesting storyline, but it also has unsurpassable music! Stephen Schwartz, who wrote such hits as \\"Pippin,\\" \\"Godsspell,\\" and Children of Eden\\" is responsible for this gem. The cast is absolutely superb particularly Idena Menzel, who portrays Elfaba, (you may recognize her as the actress who portrayed Maurene in Rent,\\" and Kristin Chenoweth who portrays Golenda or Glenda. There duets together are stunning, and the supporting cast is equally beautiful, conveying the joy, fear and anger of the citizens of Oz and Schizz students. All the voice and orchestral music blends perfectly. Some unforgettable songs on this CD ar \\"Schizz,\\" \\"When I Meet the Wizard,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" (by far the best song!) and \\"For Good.\\" This CD is a must-have. Everyone should give it a chance. Happy listening!

B0009VRHLK|4.0|After the critical acclaim of Buffalo '66, there was a certain amount of anticipation for what its writer/director/star Vincent Gallo would do next. He responded with The Brown Bunny, a film that, to put it mildly, polarized critics and audiences at the Cannes Film Festival. It met with harsh criticism and cited by some as the worst film ever to be shown in competition. This was largely in response to the film's notorious ending with co-star Chloe Sevigny and Gallo that outraged many. The film's deliberately slow pacing also didn't endear it to audiences. Gallo, not one to back down from a fight, engaged Roger Ebert in a highly publicized war of words that got quite nasty. Now that the dust has settled and the film has been quietly released on DVD, people can see for themselves what the fuss was all about.<br /><br />Stylistically, Gallo favours long, static takes, often holding on a shot for as long as he feels is necessary. In some respects, it's a throwback to the minimalist cinema of Monte Hellman, specifically Two-Lane Blacktop with its judicious use of dialogue and no frills production values. Gallo certainly has an ear for the right piece of music for the right scene, like the sad, wistful music of Gordon Lightfoot (\\"Beautiful\\") and Jackson C. Frank (\\"Milk & Honey\\") playing over shots of the road to create a particular mood.<br /><br />It would be so easy to dismiss Gallo's film as a vanity project run amok. After all, he wrote, directed, edited, produced, shot and stars in it. The Brown Bunny lacks Buffalo '66's humour and this seems to be a conscious decision on Gallo's part. In every respect, this movie is the antithesis to anything Hollywood is producing. Like Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Gallo's film is a cinematic endurance test-can you watch a man drive around for close to 90 minutes with the occasional interaction with other people? Yet, there is a certain poetry to The Brown Bunny, a certain simple beauty in observing every day things, like someone eating dinner or shopping for a rabbit or just driving cross-country. There are no intense car chases that defy physics or CGI-generated worlds.ng dinner or shopping for a rabbit or just driving cross-country.

The book is fun, humorous, and teaches you things that might help you survive. Some of the stuff in the book can actually happen, but maybe without all the zombies etc. But what if thier was a real zombie take over? Want to be prepared for it? I would, so read this book.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am speechless........ this movie is superb. <br />I have been waiting 2 years to see this movie and it was well worth the wait. <br />Seeing the movie for the first time just makes you want to cry (the trailers dont do it justice) its just so cool!
047158651X|4.0|As a chemistry major at Baylor University, I like to have a set of textbooks on the side to refer to when studying for my classes. I appreciate the detail that V&V went into while writing this book, and I do find it very fitting for my major. There are also plenty of illustrations to fit to the material, and I find them quite helpful. If you are a chem major looking for a little more information, I would recommend this text.  <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|With Advent children you return to the city of Midgar and get to see old reunions come once again, and it is sooo good to see the old folks in a new style. This is one GREAT movie, what Square might have lost with Spirts, they will make up for it with the Children. This is the movie SquareEnix should have released first. Everything is great, and the battles are simply...AMAZIN! Must buy!
B000060OFT|4.0|I think a lot of reviews of this film have been unduly harsh. I have had a fair amount of Shakespearean exposure (I was an English major in college), and I am actually impressed with Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the text.  Some people are so blinded by the seeming erudite stuffiness of Shakespeare's work that they forget what this play is really about.  `Romeo and Juliet' is a teenage melodrama!  With that said, this film works well. <br />      <br />* To begin with, Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes come off just right as the \\"star-crossed lovers.\\"  They handle their lines - perhaps - a bit awkwardly, and their key scenes are overacted.  But as far as I'm concerned, their somewhat `poor' performances are actually perfect.  In the reality of the play - Romeo and Juliet's behavior (though arguably passionate) is less than genuine.  They are young, fickle, and full of hormones, and what might seem like acts of heart-felt love and desire are actually just curious explorations of subversive behavior.  <br /> <br />* Many have lamented that the dialogue in this film (essentially) mirrors the original text ... but changing the text (in any major way) would be a huge mistake.  Shakespeare's plays are not famous because they have a great story line - they are famous because of the unbelievable writing.  It would, therefore, be pointless to modernize the dialogue.  Shakespeare's plays ARE the dialogue.  <br /> <br />* Although this film - compared with other renditions of the play - is decidedly modern, certain elements do contribute to a sort of timely ambiguity.  The cars, guns, drugs, and music suggest 1996 (or thereabouts), whereas the gothic mansions, the ball, the feuding families, and the oppressive presence of the Church seem somewhat anachronistic.  I think this ambiguity speaks to the universality of Shakespeare's work.  Does it even matter when this play takes place?  Have hot-blooded teenagers changed that much over the years?  <br /> <br />* Lastly, the ambience of Lurhmann's film is intoxicating: zipping, choppy cinematography, an over-abundance of gaudy electric lighting, and an intriguing soundtrack.  It's very titillating in an adolescent sort of way.  Anyone who does not find the scene - where DiCaprio is dragging on a cigarette against an orangey sunscape, with Radiohead's \\"Talk Show Host\\" slowly pulsing in the background - sentimentally sexy - well, you must not remember what it's like to be 15.    <br /> <br />All in all, this is an ingenious approach to a classic text - not to mention an entertaining film.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Seriosly these songs are the sh*t. Christina beats ass with this album. She has an incredible voice that many singers lack. Just like her previous album, Christina put out about 4 singles that were all very different from one another. Dirty got you dancing in the clubs, Beautiful got you singing along and Cant Hold Us Down was definintly repping for all the Ladies. Did she even win a Grammy for this album? If she didnt, the Grammy people should be poisoned. Great Job.
B000002C2E|5.0|It is wonderful music from one of best musical poets.  I am so glad to have it; the process went very well in receiving it.  There were no problems at all.
B000002UDB|5.0|It's hard to say that any Beatles album is underappreciated, but I believe this one is.  It did not make the Rolling Stone top 500 albums of all time, and a lot of people may actually try and tell you it's not very good.  <br /> <br />I could not disagree more.  Despite the fact that it is \\"basically a soundtrack,\\" it features not only some of the best songs in the Beatles catalogue, but some of the greatest songs ever written.  \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"All You need is Love,\\" \\"Hello,\\"...pretty much the entire album. <br /> <br />The other thing about this album is that it is weird, and I think that turns a lot of people off.  Sgt. Pepper's and Revolver were experimental, but Magical Mystery Tour is seriously psychadelic, and I don't think people were ready for the Beatles to sound this out there.  <br /> <br />Another common arguement is that Magical Mystery Tour sounds like a collection of singles, rather than an \\"album,\\" that all of the songs could be hits.  To this day, I will never understand how you can criticize an album for being too good.

B000AL730O|5.0|I loved this album the first time I played it and it just keeps getting better on repeated playings. Nigel Godrich is definitely a first rate producer.  McCartney has needed a strong hand to cut the crap and Godrich delivered.  The songs are amazing and Paul's drumming fits perfectly with the songs.  The best decision Godrich made was dismissing the band. McCartney playing all the instruments gives the whole thing a more \\"McCartney\\" feel.  I Love the songs FINE LINE and FRIENDS TO GO.  As a long time McCartney fan, I can say without reservation, that this is definitely one of the best albums he's ever released.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is really a masterpiece, this guy is a genius with the beautiful melody in every song, in every chord, in every instrument. McCartney is the most wonderful musician around the world. I hope don't wait 4 years for the next album.  <br />
0893860220|5.0|Sorry for going too strong in the title for this review, but I can not stop saying good things on this work of art. Sri Nisargadatta is so clear & simple with his communications yet in his profound reality, The Self, which is where he speaks from I can't help but to pause and feel a deep intuitive sense that I have just been bestowed the highest truths of all creation. In fact sometimes, without trying, my mind in silenced by what he says as if his words were a mantra. I usually come out of that state with a \\"whoa\\". The other writers that can accomplish a silenced mind state just from their writings are Buddha: The Enlightened One, Huang Po: Transmission of Mind & Dr. David Hawkins (not so much in Power Vs. Force, but in \\"The Eye of I\\" and \\"I: Subjectivity and Reality\\").   <br /> <br />This book is formatted in a very useful question and answer style where the questioners do not pull any punches. They fiercely question the (stateless) \\"state\\" that he speaks from. They ask for the truth, receive it directly and most eloquently, and then ask for the truth again in a different more attractive package - go figure hehe.  <br /> <br />To read the book is to love the book. To love the book is to love truth. Namaste.   <br />

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|You know how it goes. actor starves, actor makes it big, actor gets a band. you also know that most actors turned singers are mild to moderately talented. some may even make a video or two. ( bruce willis and eddie murphy never mind don johnson) <br />    30 seconds to mars is a truly talented band and Jared has something to say. <br /> <br />  The true test of an actor/singer is to have people who do not know that you are in a band fall in love with the music. I heard ATTACK  on a music survey and thought this is a great song. it has good riffs  with great vocals. i found out who the artist was and bought the cd.I played the whole thing and fell for it.HOOk Line and Chorus. the albumn has a great feel to it. the songs wax and wane over the course of 50 or so minutes. you are up and pumping your hand in the air, mellow and then back up again. rock is not dead. 30 seconds to mars has what it takes in the rock world. never mind the fact that most women in their 20's know the lead singer and writer of songs not as JARED LETO the actor but as JORDAN CATALANO the mysterious and devilishly handsome high schooler leaning against the locker in MY SO CALLED LIFE back in the 90's. Brings back great memories but this music is bound to make new ones <br />if you like A.F.I. Live, Fuel etc.. then you will like this band
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation (C+C) is an unprecedented success for solo Paul; as he has fully come to terms with Beatle Paul, his fellow Beatles and the 21st Century to cast a verbal tapestry upon this hard of hearing, weary world.    Re-arrange the tracks in the following order and add the 2 single B-sides of the single Fine Line to fully appreciate a thematic/concept munument of sound, words and emotions.    Start with Anyway.  This sets a tone/mood more reflective of the whole.  This invites us to \\" make yourselves at home.\\"   This \\"curing of sorrows\\" is about transitions in his life and meeting John, Linda and Heather - and for our intimates - anyway....  then the jam/coda sparkles and cracks with a preview of the kaleidescope of sonics and tuneful creations to wash over us.       Too Much Rain follows; obviously John was present in his mind and psyche; \\"wheels keep turning (\\"watching the....\\"), lamenting how they'd \\"hide their feelings\\", and \\"won't happen again.\\" John wrote \\"Rain\\" and layed out the theme of perception and dealing with those rainy feelings.    Promise to You should come next with Paul playing the Sun King here, with his Revolver personna Good-Day Sunshine/Get You Into My Life bleached soul.  Exploding with Man-Woman exuberant love - plus his declarations of Universal Love for all in the world to hear and soak in the vibes.    Friends to Go - Yes George' influence is heavy, as is the theme of seeking comfort in the afterlife (the \\"other-side\\") for his dearly departed.  Even joy, as the horns of \\"All You Need is Love\\" crows off in the distance of the music mix.    Follow this with Growing up Falling Down and English Tea, two White Album offspring showing off his versatility and creativity.  \\"Growing Up\\" is very haunting as I can see George, John and Ringo swaying, smiling and enthralled with this Beatle-esque bubbling brew ( circa 1969?) song they seem to have ALL co-written.  (this is as close as we can hope for).    Jenny Wrenn; sing \\"Heather Mills\\" overJenny's name and the song is self-evident.    Next song: Certain Softness. Growing in love with his wife's apparant surprising complexities and textures inspires Paul on his next song to Heather and her \\"certain sadness\\" and \\"touch of wildness.\\"  He's nakedly smitten - and honest.    Next: Follow Me.  This is about John, higher power, God, friends?  All?  Open to different shades of meaning, but you gotta believe he thought this after meeting John and traveling, playing with the Beatles and having John  lead the boys in their chant of \\"To the top of the toppermost.\\"  Follow Me, they did.    Next:  This never happened to me Before.  But it happened for Paul, more than once, and he appreciates it in this inspired love tome.      Fine Line:  This is towards the end of the Fab Four, when EVERYBODY left the group a time or two  and he wishes they could have solved the problems with a rocker like this.  \\"All is forgiven, come back, come back.\\"  Indeed, Get Back, it was a painful time.    How Kind  should follow here, how the aged wizened boys would treat each other now.    Round out with At the Mercy and Vanity Fair, but be sure to include the B-side roockfest: \\"Comfort of Love\\" in-between; it's all about: having it all except - voila! - \\"CAN'T BUY ME LOVE !!!  This propulsive rock n' roll song is what the album needs and validates the fan's pleas for such on this CD.  Add this and the problem is solved.    SEE THE FINE LINE SINGLE REVIEW SECTION WHERE I DESCRIBE THESE ESSENTIAL B-SIDES !     O.K. Macca, you can laugh and goof on me and this review now, I love the album.  Yeah, yeah, yeah !!!
B0000009RX|5.0|Literally. The Greatest Album In The History Of Music. I've listened to this so much I can replay the entire thing in my head and I know all the weird background noises and inside jokes and everything. <br /> <br />You probably know about the hippie-bashing on this album but it goes into much more than that: horrible parents, drinking, government, cops and of course boogers kept in jars. (And yes I'm serious.) Zappa and The M.O.I. weren't pro-war or against love. They we're against how the hippies spreading their message by not actually doing anything, just complaining and smoking pot. <br /> <br />Although some of it is humorous, there's always an underlying truth and creepiness to the message. Check out the harmony in \\"Concetration Moon\\", \\"Don't cry, gotta go bye-bye, suddenly die, die. Cop kill a creep. Pow, pow, pow!\\" <br /> <br />The album will sound like a mess at first especially with all the complex musicianship on it and weird noises and studio effects. Check it out with headphones to see what I mean. (You gotta listen to the absoulutely beautiful opening piano solo on \\"Absolutely Free\\") The album is literally filled with odd breaks in-between songs and during them that won't make sense at first but you get you realize the genius of it all like a non-stop symphony. <br /> <br />The songs are weird but catchy like \\"What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body?\\" which is probably won't seem like a song you wouldn be humming for days if you just read the title. <br /> <br />Things to check out during the album: <br />-Eric Clapton's cameo on \\"Are You Hung Up?\\" <br />-The messed up take on \\"Hey Joe\\" on Flower Punk <br />-The surf music at the end of \\"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\\" which is a song by The Rotations called \\"Heavies\\" which Frank produced early in the '60s and can be bought on the \\"Frank Zappa: Cucamonga\\" compilation. <br /> <br />Seriously, I was skeptic, too, after hearing about this album even after the first 1 or 2 listens you probably won't really digit but it is DEFINITELY worth it. You'll be saying you're the \\"Indian Of The Group\\" after a while.
B000AL730O|4.0|There aren't many peolple alive (or dead, just one or two) who'd tell Sir Paul McCartney former Beatle that some of his submissions for a new album were naff.  But Sir George Martins' suggestion of Nigel Godrich, the producer who turned Radiohead from miserablists to legends, was more than just inspired. <br />Nigel Godrich refused, point blank, some of the songs Paul brought to these sessions.  Looking back there's so many times McCartney could have used producers like this, his last true classic (Tug Of War 1982) was produced by George Martin, The Beatles' own in-house producer. <br />It seems that Sir Paul is not yet ready to raise a snobby nostril and tell an upstart to leave.  The first thing most Mccartney fans will notice is there are no 'paper bag over the head' moments of twee embarrasment to be had here.  The closest contender being the Noel Coward pastiche 'English Tea', that turns out to be just...fun, like 'When I'm 64'.  Not agood song, just fun. <br />Throughout Paul is reined in from sugary-saccharine sweetness, turning songs like 'Riding To Vanity Fair' from pure schlock to beautiful compositions with haunting backdrops, and giving tracks like 'Fine Line' and 'Friend To go' a sense of fun lacking in his music for 23 years. <br />B****y Hell! I've been listening to every word this man has uttered for 24 years! <br />Maybe I should get a life. <br />Then again if this album is an idea of future utterances, then maybe I should listen a while longer.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I just saw Batman Begins. I've seen all five Batman movies. I was somewhat disappointed with recent Batman movies and put off seeing this one because I expected very little. I was pleasantly surprised. Batman Begins is the best Batman movie by far. I liked the characters and cast. The story was somewhat dark, but there was also humor in it. Even though Batman doesn't appear until partway through the movie, Batman Begins is filled with action and there's never a dull moment. I hope there will be a sequel!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I have been a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars since 2002.  Three years have now passed and I am glad that their new album doesn't sound like the first album.  Why would anyone want to hear songs written about the same things over and over again anyway?  I love that they decided to change it up.  Some people would disagree, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.   <br /> <br />Now to the songs: <br />Attack:  4 out of 5; This song is a good choice for the first single.  It doesn't stray too much from the first album. <br /> <br />A Beautiful Lie:  5 out of 5; This song is one of the most stand out tracks off of the album.  Great lyrics and beat. <br /> <br />The Kill:  4 out of 5;  In this song the lyrics sucked me in the most.  They are so powerful and you could feel how much emotion is being poured out in the recording, or if you're lucky, live. <br /> <br />Was it a Dream:  5 out of 5;  This song is so beautiful it almost made me cry the first time I heard it.  Enough said. <br /> <br />The Fantasy:  5 out of 5;  The first time I heard this track was live at Irving Plaza back in early August.  After only hearing it once, I was hooked.  The melody and catchy lyrics stuck in my head until I picked up this album the day it came out.  In my opinion they should choose this song as the next single.  Plus I love the added giggles within the song. <br /> <br />Savior:  4 out of 5;  Love the lyrics in this song.  Jared loves to make his message heard and his screams in the song go along with my point. <br /> <br />From Yesterday:  5 out of 5;  There isn't much to say about this song other than I love it! <br /> <br />The Story:  5 out of 5;  This slower ballad on this album is so great.  It is such a relaxing song to listen to when you have had a stressful day.  It makes every problem go away at least for a little bit. <br /> <br />R-Evolve:  5 out of 5;  This track is another stand out track off of the album.  After listening to the lyrics, it makes you think more aboutlife.  Hence the chorus, \\"Does it feel like we've never been alive inside?  Does it feel like we've only just begun?  A revolution has begun.\\" <br /> <br />A Modern Myth:  4 out of 5;  This track is the most opposite of what was on the first album.  The string players in the song help make the song more beautiful than it already is.  I just love it. <br /> <br />Bonus track <br />The Battle of One:  5 out of 5;  This sounds more like the first album but fits in anyway.  There are not that many lyrics but the song kicks butt. <br /> <br />Hunter:  5 out of 5;  Originally a Bjork song and 30stm make it their own.  This cover is something I never expected to hear from them, but I am glad they decided to do this song.  Jared's voice really shines in this track.  It is a must listen, but some tend to skip over it and I'm not one of them.  It just needs some getting used to that's all.   <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|This album had an unusual effect on me.  Normally I have avoided Sir Paul's solo efforts like the plague- not wanted to be reminded of how difficult it has been for someone (with so much talent) to find it so difficult to live up to the standard of his work during the 60's.  I'm not saying he 'lost' his talent since the break up of the beatles, but it has just been criminally hard i guess, to live up to the impossible high expectations of the beatles.  Sir Paul doesn't have to change the world anymore, he's already done that once, so why should he need to prove himself to the nasty critics who always compare him unfavourably to his old band mate.  You can't change the world twice with the same style of music anyway I say.   <br /> <br />I listened to this new album all the way through, without looking away from my computer screen.  I can't get through the first three tracks on most albums these days: so much filler, so little talent, so much imitation, so many 'hacks' and worse, so much false and empty innovation.  So, on that alone, I guess that I must have enjoyed it.  But because it's paul mccartney, it's almost impossible to be objective (not that we should have to anyway) about his work- it's been copied so many times and is just so 'written in stone' that I think most critics *can't* actually review it fairly.  As soon as I hear his voice, I am seven years old, sitting at my dad's stereo with headphones on, listening to my beatles collection.  Makes it very hard to actually 'hear' these songs. <br /> <br />So I played a little game:  I was imagining that it wasn't paul mccartney, but some new songwriter from england.  Let's call him 'eric wangler'.   <br /> <br />Holy crap.  Eric knows how to write a song!  I thought the first song was decent, but they got better and better!  Mr. wangler understands the form of the pop song perfectly.  He knows how to craft a beautiful melody, but avoids melodic cliche by providing just enough variation.  He knows how to staywithin the verse chorus verse structure, yet doesn't follow it slavishly, and not one song is the same form-wise: always a little suprise when you feel tedium about to set in. Most songwriters thing they HAVE to go to the second chorus after the second verse.  Wangler steers clear of such formula.  <br /> <br />Harmonically, his chord progressions are quite striking-  he stays within the pop idiom, yet innovates harmonically more than most pop writers.  Diminished runs, baroque progressions, odd little chromatic modulations.  Really very clever. Wangler does the twee beatles pop thing (i think he must like the bealtes), but in a genuine way that avoids the vocal double tracking, flanging, mellotrons, timpani and pantsy fluff that EVERY other band uses when they try to sound like the beatles (and pretend that it was an original).  Eric evokes that era, without any effects.  A guitar, piano, stripped down drumkit and a sincere vocal.  A flute and some strings at most are the only other additions.  Try that elliot and mr. finn.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, eric stays simple, but heartfelt.  It would be easy to go of on an overly complicated overblown costello-like crusade of literary pretensions, attempting to match the 'wit' of the music, but he keeps the lyrics simple- even if at times he sounds uncertain- it adds to the charm.  kudo eric, kudos. <br /> <br /> The production is beautifully simple and warm.  Eric plays all of the instruments, and the same intimacy that stevie wonder managed on his early 70's albums is achieved (WHY did he hire other musician? oh why?) <br />  <br />This eric fellow might go far.  WHAT?  he's 62 years old?  holy...ok...that's weird. well, this old dude is keeping it real!  He outclassed most other songwriters around now. By the time he's 70 he might be able to get a band. <br /> <br />Well done mr. wangler.  Well done. <br /> <br />Mirko Ruckels <br /> <br />
0920236162|5.0|We loved this book. Not only is it a very quick and entertaining read for me, my 6 year old adored the princess. There are several \\"messages\\" at work in this book which are positive reinforcements for girls of all ages. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone but it is a delightful and contemporary story that needs to be part of every young girl's library. <br />
B000002J0B|5.0|This is the first Led Zeppelin album I've listened too. I've heard songs such as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and the live version of <br />\\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\". But this is the first full album I have listened too and I must say it was pretty damn good. It's taking me a while to get used to Robert Plant's voice, it's different...But this has some great songs on it. Here they are; <br />1. The Song Remains the Same-5/5-Musical intro is good. While I can't tell what Robert Plant is saying, I think this song sounds pretty cool. <br />2. The Rain Song-5/5-Interesting lyrics, Plant's voice sounds really cool. Guitar playing is great. <br />3. Over the Hills & Far Away-5/5-Like this song a lot. Great chorus. The live version on \\"How the West Was Won\\" is a lot better though. <br />4. The Crunge-4/5-Will someone please tell me what this song is about. It's pretty cool. <br />5. Dancing Days-5/5-Catchy, lyrics are good. I love the beat in this one. <br />6. D'yer Mak'er-5/5-F**king awesome song. The beginning is kind of strange, but this is one of the best songs on the album. <br />7. No Quarter-5/5-I don't understand the purpose of Plant's voice distortion thing in this song....However, it does sound pretty cool. <br />8. The Ocean-5/5-Great lyrics. <br />A-
0060254920|5.0|My goodness - I just read some of the negative reviews of the book and am stunned.  (I have to say here to people who like to `throw books into the trash', please donate them to a library or charity if you do not like them - I have read of books being thrown into the trash in so many reviews - the irony of this is amazing.  People hate the book because they think it will teach their children to be amoral, yet they happily throw a perfectly good book in the bin!  Do you not wish to teach your children lessons in respecting the environment and in respecting books and property in general - what does a child think when they see a parent throw a book in the bin? They receive a gift from someone - mummy throws it in the bin - great lesson to teach your child!).   If you don't like a book, PLEASE pass it on to someone who will.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, the negative reviews on this book have totally missed the plot.  The book is about a little boy's imagination and his flights of fancy.  Your child is not going to turn into a little brat if he/she reads this book.  Along with Sam and the Firefly, Where the Wild Things Are is THE book that I have never forgotten from my childhood.  This is why it is a classic....because it stands out for so many people. <br />
0743526937|4.0|Getting to Yes started a revolution in negotiation, both by stressing principled negotiation and in making the material accessible to a very wide audience.  It is still a good read, is still taught in universities and continuing education, and is an excellent starting point for people who are new to negotiation but intend a deep study because of its historical significance and its content.<br /><br />However, having taught Getting to Yes and having used principled bargaining in practice, I think there are a few shortcomings that are dealt with in other books.  While Fischer and Ury do make the point that principled bargaining includes sticking to your priciples and not being a pushover, it is not emphasized enough.  I have even found myself being too cooperative after reviewing this text because the emphasis is on being cooperative.  I think this is a partcular danger for new/lay negotiators, especially if this is the first text they're exposed to or they intend to practice these concepts in daily life.  The tone of the book is just a bit too friendly.  As a result, there has been a backlash (wrongly, in my opinion) against this text in some quarters.<br /><br />The verbal judo section at the end is excellent, giving techniques for dealing with unreasonable people that are great.  I would've liked more of these very practical tips and examples to go along with them, but the book as a whole is already a lot to digest.  Newer versions of GTY do add more material here.<br /><br />Newer texts take these problems into account.  The best, in my opinion, is the follow-on by Ury, \\"Getting Past No.\\"  It can be read without having read \\"Getting to Yes,\\" although it is very interesting as a follow-on, too.  In it, Ury is clearly taking into account the criticism that GTY was too soft and he presents a more robust vision of principled bargaining.
0425173739|3.0|A trip to Egypt, a cruise up the Nile and a visit to the Cataract Hotel in Aswan last year prompted me to read Agatha Christie's famous detective novel, \\"Death on the Nile.\\" Apparently, the author wrote the novel while staying in the famous Cataract Hotel. <br /> <br />This is the first murder mystery by Christie that I have read. I was hoping for a little bit more detail and information about where the story took place - Egypt, the Nile, local culture and customs, and tourism in that region during the early part of the 20th century. However, the author barely touched on any of those topics throughout her story. Instead, she focused on character development, personal conflicts and relationship dynamics while planting clues as the story progressed into the who-done-it that she is famous for. Even though I enjoyed the pace and writing style of the book, I was a bit disappointed at the end having not learned a thing about Egypt. It's a good thing that I have been there to know where the story took place. <br /> <br />The Cataract Hotel is one of the most beautifully decorated and astonishingly architected buildings that I have ever seen. The ceilings seem to extend to the sky, whose primary function I assume is to act as a receptacle for the often unbearable heat that suffocates the area. It proudly stands on top of a giant hill overlooking the River Nile and a Genghis Khan Mausoleum that sits on the opposite bank of the river. This hotel is definitely one to be seen. For as astounding as it is, and the simple fact that Christie actually stayed there, it is very surprising that she neglected to describe its exquisiteness in this book.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Never say that one Dylan album is your favorite over another.<br />You always have to change your mind. I'm on to this one today, BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, my FAVORITE!<br /><br />This album just has a lot of great stuff on it. Only just reading these reveiws have I realized that one side is electric and the other side is acoustic, whaddaya know! It was always just Dylan to me!<br /><br />MY PICKS ARE:<br />SHE BELONGS TO ME (yes)<br />MAGGIES FARM (yes, although there are countless better versions)<br />115th DREAM (awesome, he's so stoned he can't even SING!)<br />GATES OF EDEN (very chilling)<br />ITS ALLRIGHT MA (Oh YEAH! THIS SONG RULES)<br />BABY BLUE (Gotta have it)<br /><br />Of course there ain't a bad track anywhere on this so just put it on and enjoy.<br />P.S HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is still my favorite, I was just trying to get your attention.<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: though the rules of the road have been lodged, its only peoples games that you got to dodge.
B000AL730O|3.0|This is a good album, but not as great as all the accolades. Yes, it is interesting. Yes, it is darker. Yes, it is well produced. And yet, it's still not as great as it could have been. Anyone following Paul McCartney's career knows he's been on the ascent for some time now. His songwriting skills have improved, his singing, his phenomenal band, the live shows... It seemed he was poised for a great album. Chaos is a side step. Nigel Godrich made him bring songs that attempted emotional resonance. That's a good thing and very needed in McCartney's work, but he still didn't push him past the simplistic, self-explanatory, dad by the campfire, lyrics (AKA: bad writing).  This undermines the great melodies that abound in this album. A great song has to not only be note perfect, but word perfect. One bum line can sink it. And often it's only one or two lines where McCartney needs to go poetic (in the modern fragmented sense) and instead goes sing-song, (Note: Riding to Vanity Fair, This Never Happened Before, Too Much Rain). Sometimes it's more than a couple lines, (Follow Me, At the Mercy, Anyway, Jenny Wren). What he needs, if not just told that \\"it's not good enough,\\" is someone to assist him with lyrics.  <br /> <br />Also, Nigel Godrich has insisted we want an album that sounds like Paul McCartney. True, but what we really want is the songwriter who appeared on Abbey Road, Let It Be and the White Album. No, the middle eight of Tug of War is not Paul at his best. And though this album is far superior to Tug of War, I can't help noticing that the slick production is causing people to believe this is McCartney of old, as they did with that album. Also, Nigel, bossa nova is not Paul's strong suit (Certain Softness)... how about a great ROCK album? A few great rock songs, (their germination evident on Driving Rain), in addition to good pop songs (A Fine Line, Promise to You Girl), those moody tracks, and just good songs regardless of category (How Kind of You: still somebum lines, damn it!) and you'll have a great album. For now, we're left to take the best of Chaos and Driving Rain and make a good compilation. That's no small thing, but for an unequivocal return-to-form, a la Time Out of Mind, we still have to wait...  <br />
B00008NG5V|3.0|Still very good but it seems that Jack spent a lot of his musical and lyrical ingenuity on the first album and he starts to run out of ideas... I mean, not that there were too many ideas to begin with. After all, his is pure and simply music of relaxation, surfing abandon, get-mellow-and-chill-out kinda stuff and one simply shouldn't expect too much. Still a very worthy album and I enjoyed several songs very much. Favorites - \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\", \\"Holes To Heaven\\" are superb and a couple of others are really good.
0783223218|3.0|This is an OK movie. It has its memorable moments, and the fight scenes are pretty good to a point. But there are also a lot of very boring parts. This movie is pretty good in terms of fights, quotes, and determination, but along with a reasonable amount of boredom, it is not nearly as gruesome as a shoot-em up/beat-em up movie is meant to be. It has blood here and there, some scenes more than others, but there are plenty of R-Rated thrillers that are better not only in terms of blood, violence, and language, but also better period. Overall, this movie is average, and if I had my choice, I MIGHT see my favorite scenes of it again. See this flick only if every other movie sucks or if you can find absolutely nothing to do.
B0000024W3|4.0|What does that mean anyway? In 1970 Dylan released what would be considered his first \\"flop.\\" After continuesly doing \\"wrong, but no wrong\\" in the sixties I guess everyone just decided that this was wrong.<br /><br />Self Portrait was Dylan saying \\"I'm only human.\\" I'm not just making this up, he actually said that. To some it made Dylan seem like a strange cat. I know my first experience with this album left me with a big question mark over my head.<br /><br />First of all you got a lot of cover songs. Very rarely does he do this. He's covering odd material too, from Gordon Lightfoots gold rush anthem DAYS OF 49 to the fifties ballad BLUE MOON. He switches his vocals all over the place. He sings LIKE A ROLLING STONE in his \\"Nashville Skyline\\" voice, the results are iffy.<br /><br />Second, I don't know whats up with ALL THE TIRED HORSES, what is this supposed to be anyway? Its a bunch of ladies singing the same verse over and over for four minutes. Is Dylan riding off into the sunset?<br /><br />WHATEVER! WHO CARES? DYLAN DIDN'T. My guess is that he wanted this one to flop so that the hordes of people would leave him alone. They didn't. People b*tch*d and moaned and as always,  still bought the record.<br /><br />Its still got a few gems on it, aside the cover tunes, I don't dig most of em. Its the crap that I listen to Dylan to stay away from (The Boxer? I hate Simon and Garfunkel!) But QUINN THE ESKIMO is a cool song. The ALBERTAs are cool, the SADIES are cool, GOTTA TRAVEL ON is a great tune, and lets not forget my personal favorite MINSTREL BOY which is hidden somewhere near the end. Thats a great tune!<br /><br />I give this one four stars because there's a whole bunch of TIRED HORSES on this one, and I really don't know how thats S'posed to get me any riding done.<br /><br />Get the essentials first (this ain't one of em)
0765310015|4.0|The book was good from the first page, but not interesting until about halfway through. Erikson did not do enough to bring his characters to life and so there was no emotional attachment whatsoever to any of the characters. This makes the book a bit boring and difficult to read. It's like he starts explaining a complicated situation, then he introduces the players, and then the reasons for the parts they play in this complicated situation which you are still trying to understand (It should be the other way round).  <br />Also, considering that there was a war going on, there wasn't enough actual fighting.  <br />What I do think is really original, though, is the way magic is used in this book. I really like the world Erikson created; enough wizardry and magical creatures to make it a fantasy novel, but containing a good amount of similarities to the world we know from our own history books. It's also interesting that the women are taken to be equal to the men. <br />If you like George Martin, you'll probably like Erikson although he's not nearly as good. <br />On the whole, it was a very good book and I look forward to reading the next one.
B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is the greastest rock group ever.  Rolling Stones are close but in the Bosses shadow.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I for one am a huge Hulk fan. I love the comics, and pretty soon will love the video game. Hulk, in fact, is my 5th favorite comic book character topped only by Punisher, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Tigra. I thought I would love this film. Unfortunatelty, most of it was just chit chat. However, the fight scenes and the way Hulk smashed and the final fight with the evil father were wonderful. Also, I thought Betty Ross was cute. Put these facts together, and this film averages out big time. It wasn't the worst, but it is way under my top movies. If you like comic book movies, watch Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Batman, Elektra, Daredevil, Blade, and Superman. Only watch this if you've seen all of those and /or if you have nothing better to do because everything else sucks. What I am trying to tell you is that this movie is OK. Only OK. And that is all. End of story.
B000002C2E|5.0|I bought this in '97 on cassette, I had a long bus trip ahead from Vermont and needed something new to pass the time. I had heard that Dylan had just come out with his best in years.<br /><br />My initial reaction was: Is Dylan singing through a treche?<br /><br />Needless to say the sound very quickly grew on me and this is one of Dylans spookiest sounding albums for sure.<br /><br />LOVE SICK is crazy good, so spooky, I love the fact that they put him in that Victorias Secret commercial. Dylan is SO COOL! DIRT ROAD BLUES is also very cool, MILLION MILES, NOT DARK YET, TILL I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU, COLD IRONS BOUND and especially the sixteen minute ramble that tickles the god damned brain stem HIGHLANDS are my favorites here. Everything is great though, I really enjoy the feel of this album. SOLID WORK.<br /><br />Get LOVE AND THEFT his 2001 follow up too, its completley different yet is also amazing!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I read all the reviews of this album and felt compelled to buy it to see what all the fuss was for.  Well, let me just say, that while it's every bit as good as these reviews suggested, I was genuinely surprised by its method of goodness.  There is in the album that I can point as specifically being brilliant.  Yet, when I had finished listening to the whole thing the first time through, I went back and started listening to some of the tracks that had been my favorites.  When I was done, I had listened to 20 of 22 tracks again, and it was then that I realized how truly excellent this cd was.  I even love the songs without words and that is basically a first for me.  Although it's tough to pick out highlights on a cd that is itself one long highlight, I feel compelled to point out the particular mastery in John Wayne Gacy Jr. and Decatur, A Round of Applause for Your Stepmother.
B00005B36H|5.0|Although not one of my top ten favorite albums, this terrific disc does contain my ABSOLUTE favorite song, the ferocious \\"The Grudge\\". \\"The Grudge\\" is so good, in fact, that the momentum from this singular masterpiece lasts until the beginning of \\"Ticks and Leeches\\". If \\"The Grudge\\" was not included on Lateralus, I doubt that the album would be even considered a positive experience in music listening. <br /> <br />This is a good listen indeed. If you're not into the whole intellectual conceptualizing of Tool albums, just keep in mind that Tool can rock pretty damn hard, and are incapable of delivering unoriginal riffs.
B00000JGEH|4.0|This is such a wonderful movie I can't even begin to describe it! The fights are absolutely superb(few are more intense)there is lots of funny stuff, such as the quotes \\"Yar clothes-Gib dem to me.\\" and \\"A'll be back.\\" There is love and fear in this movie, as well, and Ah-nold does a wonderful job. I especially liked the last fight, where we see the Terminator's real form. Oh, and there is plenty of suspense and blood, for you gore lovers. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the next two were even better. All laid out, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and if you like intense fighting and iron determination, this movie is for you.
B000001EYO|5.0|I just made that up but this is in my mind just that. A great soundtrack to an even greater movie. I think the first time I really got into the Cohen brothers (I didn't go for FARGO). These guys really go all out on this one and two others that I'm aware of. (Volume two is the award winning soundtrack to OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU and volume three is the soundtrack to THE LADYKILLERS which is a very nicely mixed collection of rap/hiphop/and gospel tunes.)<br /><br />Here though, we have a different animal. The DUDE was a rocker. He liked his Creedence (which sadly is nowhere to be found on this disc- no worries) he liked smoking J's and drinking white russians. He HATED the Eagles! He was just a cool dude. A film like this needs a cool soundtrack.<br /><br />We open with DYLANS MAN IN ME, great underated tune by the man and fits here perfectly. Next up we got offerings from CAPTAIN BEEFRHEART (you gotta experience this guy if you ain't already) and a fitting song from ELVIS COSTELLO.<br /><br />After that we get a whole slew of just oddball stuff. (I didn't say bad, I said oddball.) Its very smart music. THE GYPSY KINGS doing HOTEL CALIFORNIA will blow your mind. KENNY ROGERS psycedelic JUST DROPPED IN... is a killer tune. The rest you just gonna have to hear for yourself.<br /><br />If you liked the movie you will dig this soundtrack<br /><br />and if you didn't like the movie, then you didn't see it (and you STILL will dig this soundtrack.)<br /><br />THANK YOU
B00006HBB9|5.0|great item, better sound than european cd release. Only original japanese lp sounds a bit better. Recomended
B0002BO0AS|4.0|Opinions on my album vary upon when I'm listening to it. After a week of exploring some Nas and Common and AZ (all really good rappers in my opinion), Unearth seemed like a good remedy. And it was. The Oncoming Storm's sound seemed so magnificent, like a giant stadium. It rocks SO unbelievably hard (almost too hard) and has some of the most straight-up badass riffs I've ever heard. And Trevor Phipps screaming is coherent and positively invigorating. <br /> <br />However, after a week of listening to Black Dahlia Murder and Converge, Unearth seem like a cacophonous cloud of metalcore smoke. It seemed very blurry and boring and repetitive.  <br /> <br />So there it is for you. I recommend it nonetheless.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|We heard the Careless Love cd over a local restaurant's sound system. We were so enchanted with the music we came home and ordered the cd from Amazon.  Having listened to it a dozen or more times by now, we are still enchanted with the sound of Madeleine Peyroux's beautiful alto voice.  This cd needs to be added to anyone's music collection who remembers the old club singers of the past.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John mayer is undoubtedly one of the finest artists of today. His talented guitar playing and his pure genius at song writing help to make all of his albums ones to remember. The passion in his song lyrics help us to really feel the song! <br /> <br />This album in particluar is just brilliant. Favourite songs include neon and why georgia! Also try listening the brilliant duet he did with Brad Paisley on CMT Crossroads - 2 great artists collaborating together provide get entertainment. <br /> <br />Overall, this album plus all his others are brilliant and definately ones to buy and add to the CD collection. Definately one you will never get bored of!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I personally love Green Day. Notice the word PERSONALLY. Music has dozens of genres for a REASON. Not everybody is going to like everything. If you think it was wrong for them to make a \\"politacally charged\\" album, thats your opinion. If you actually BOTHERED to listen to the whole album, only two songs are really political, and \\"Holiday\\" has two interpretations. and theres a reason that Wake Me Up When September Ends and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are getting so much airplay- people are requesting it. and as much as i am getting tired of Boulevard of Broken Dreams, i am glad that at least some people still know good music when they hear it and the whole world has't been taken over by hip hip and gangster rap. So please, review only if you like Green Day. If you didnt before, you probably won't now. We promise, we wont bite your head off if you say you don't like Green Day, but we WILL if you make fun of us or make false accusations. Two Things I'd like to point out:  <br />1. If you listened to Boulevard of broken Dreams and your first thought was \\"wow that song sucks they said walk 25 times\\" thats just pathetic. You hate the song but you counted how many times they said WALK. okay then?? <br />2. The trio aren't \\"still\\" wearing eyeliner. They didnt wear eyeliner in Dookie days, and if you don't like it, well whatever, as i said before, you're entitled to your own opinion.  <br /> <br />and they HAVE matured, if you BOTHERED to listen to the music they're putting out now..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ROCK ON GREEN DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000CDWQ9|1.0|Alright, I'm not going to review each film as it wou take far to long. I'm rating this collection, the selection is fair at best and the the cost is WAY out of line. It nearly $13 each for this barebone disc is a waste. There is a big blue department store that you can get most of these for $5.50-$8.88. Not worth the price and if you like the collection it can be had much cheaper buying them one at a time. Save your money!
B000AM6MKU|4.0|This movie is simply AWESOME in every way. Ever since I saw it I've been eagerly awaiting its DVD release, and I was PRAYING for a gift set. Now that it's finally coming, I'm very dissapointed that the gift set will not include a bell  -red ribbon and all-  like the one The Boy gets at the end of the movie. Big bummer there, Warner. <br /> <br />I'm scratching a star for that alone. <br /> <br />R.V.
0060512806|3.0|The devotee of Athena can quite nearly craft a great novel. <br /> <br />It's so close to greatness.  So frustratingly close. <br /> <br />The thing is, most of his normal audience already know the coding theory and the discussions of science.  So, this stuff doesn't belong in conversational didaction.  It belongs in an afterword, or a footnote. <br /> <br />The style of writing is very sprawling and loose and conversational.  This is an exceptionally American male manner of writing.  Unlike King, however, Stephenson seems to be following not some small-town patience, but a deep intellects powerful mental ability to wander off topic and quickly return in real time, though the mind has gone off for pages.  Does that make sense?   <br /> <br />Basically, fans of Stephen King will be right at home.  Both authors have a lot in common.  They deal in an imaginative speculative genre, with lots of characters, and a strong grasp for said characters' personalities.  They have very strong stomachs.  They are \\"cool\\" in their own way. <br /> <br />Artistically, however, this also creates a problem.  I think a long flashback about dental work in the middle of a passionate reunion with the main character's girlfriend inside a brutal Phillipine prison is a little too much.  I don't care about the dentist!  I care about the girl! <br /> <br />It's so close.  I'd hate to edit it too much, especially in the beginning, but if he could've just taken a red pen over the last hundred-fifty pages and cut them in half... <br /> <br />Athena was the goddess of defensive war and invention, and she was the chosen muse for this epic.  I am reminded of the end of the Oddessey, when the story just keeps going and going and Oddesseus is in the middle of this field staring down his citizens in dress armor and we can't help but feel that the poem ended a few hundred lines ago yet the story still moves on.  This book ends the same way.  It just keeps going and going and the resolution doesn't feel like a resolution.  The real resolution was pages ago, in Goto Dengo's Japanese power tower. <br /> <br />So close.  So close.  Still, if you like a Stephen King tome now and then, you'll probably enjoy this author as well. <br /> <br />Many like to make Thomas Pynchon comparisons.  The Pynchon comparisons are more apt with The Baroque Cycle.  Comparing Pynchon's masterpiece Mason & Dixon to the Baroque Cycle reminds one of the strengths and weaknesses of both of these modern American masters.  Pynchon's too disciplined and stoned.  Stephenson's too sober and loose.  I'd love to see those two write the same short story from the same outline.  That's a book I'd buy, for sure.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|The show is one of the best spinoffs on television and is one reason why you need to buy this set. However do not fooled by the label of Columbia - Tristar this was produced by MGM, who own the rights like they do with SG-1.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I absolutely love this album and you will too if you love Irish music and Irish vocal styles. From a stunning acapella version of \\"Danny Boy\\" to the haunting \\"May It Be\\" to a searingly beautiful rendition of \\"You Raise Me Up\\", the vocals and arrangements are just perfect. Of all versions I have heard, \\"Ave Maria\\" is second (only just!) only to Jewel's version (on her Christmas album). Some of my other favourites are \\"Someday\\" and \\"Send Me a Song\\", but there is really nothing that can be faulted with this album and I look forward to listening to more of the work of these supremely talented performers. The DVD is also impressive and it is hard not to be stirred by the rousing finale of \\"You Raise Me Up\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I originally rented the first disc of this series and after the first episode \\"Serenity\\" I was in LOVE. So, of course, I immediately bought it from amazon 'cause I couldn't find it in any store near me @ the time. <br /> <br />This show was just too good and Fox apparently has something against good tv. They're infamous for cancelling their best shows before they ever get a chance. I'm so glad that the browncoats have risen from all that mess and were able to save this lovely gem from obscurity, so that late comers like myself could enjoy it, and then become one of them.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The best super hero movie of all time.  Better than all of the superhero movies combined.  Watch this and conquer your fears.
6304119046|5.0|Cinematography: Toland was at the top of his game, and Welles was lucky to have so experienced an eye behind the camera.  Think expressive, meaningful angles, shadows, deep-focus shots--they're all there, a veritable textbook of technique. <br /> <br />Music: Herrmann, like most on the set a newcomer to Hollywood, broke the mold of German Romanticism (Korngold, Steiner).  Arguably this is his best film score, although Vertigo's up there too.  Particularly great moments: the snow music that suddenly goes from gorgeous to sarcastic; the clever waltz variations underscoring the darkening mood of the breakfast scene; the aria (which has been recorded stupendously by Kiri Te Kanawa, although in the film it deliberately isn't put over so successfully); and the way the main theme is hurled at you at the climax--always gets me. <br /> <br />Editing: Such energy & innovation here, particularly in the newsreel (a brilliant parody) & the rapid segues leading from Susan's apartment to the campaign speech. <br /> <br />Acting: Most of the cast had plenty of stage experience which translated into fresh dramatic power on the screen.  Cotten & Moorehead turned in better performances later, but Sloane, Collins, & Comingore are at their best here, and Welles's own performace is simply towering. <br /> <br />Make Up: Poor Welles had to get started at 2 a.m. everytime he wanted to shoot an \\"old-age\\" scene, but what they achieved here still holds up against anything today. <br /> <br />Narrative Structure: Welles started out shooting Heart of Darkness, and when the funding for that project dried up the one thing he carried over to Kane was the flashback structure, which has influenced so many things since, from classic film noir to Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br />Themes: All the brilliant devices are there not for their own sake but to serve the subject matter, a tragic story that takes on some big themes about society & private life, and it's this matching of form & content that really makes the film so enduringly great. <br />
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I couldn't believe it once i got home with my new dvd.. <br /> <br />watching this new Leon Deluxe Edition I began to notice new scenes.. Scenes where Matilda starting killing people.. she got drunk, tried to kiss Leon.. asked him for sex.. it was pretty full on and totally unexpected.. and not in any of the other Leon dvds i've seen.. (i have 2 previous versions).. I'd say there is 20 minutes at least more on this disc. The other special features are interesting too..  <br /> <br />So if you want to see some more, uncomfortable yet watchable scenes, do buy this version.
1563523302|5.0|I rarely read self help books, but somebody gave this book to me as a birthday present. That was two years ago, and I have read the book three times since. Interestingly, it does not read like a self help book, promising miracles after following a few simple steps. It describes the millionaire population in America- who they are, what they do, and the characteristics and habits that they all share. The book does not explain how to make money, rather, you get an idea of what it takes to become a millionaire, even if you have an average income.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I read in Blender Magzine that Dave Grohl said he took a Shi* on their last album. He should probably do the same with this one. Dave's voice isn't that good. I suggest you skip this one.
B00008AWOD|3.0|I didn't think I would like this group but I do. I don't like all the tracks but I love the song sleeping with ghosts. The lead singers voice is annoying though.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|really liked plans, but wether or not i like it better than transatlanticism is a question to which i will never have an answer. I love them both for the differences they pocess. One thing that i've always like about trans is that you listen to the lyrics and you're still like wtf was that. Cause it's more like poetry than anything else. It's very plain to see the meaning of the songs at points and then other points you have no idea what gibbard is trying to get across so all that's left is for you to interpret it. With that interpretation comes the freedom to have it mean anything which is very priceless and limitless in possibilities.  <br /> <br />I also loved the lo fi sound that all of the dcfc cd's poscess i guess excepting plans. It's really a double edged sword because chris walla is amazing in production and with that very nice major label studio he can work wonders so i'm not sure what to make of this over produced discussion i keep hearing.  <br /> <br />I think that it's true that plans seems a lot more contained than trans. Trans was way out there and very beautiful and epic while plans is quite a bit more subdued, comfortable and decievingly simple. I think probably one of the biggest things that made me just fall in love with plans was the simple beauty it's lyrics poscess. You don't have to interpret them as much as the transatlanticism lyrics because they are very plain spoken and more of a narration.  You can appreciate ben gibbard for his thoughts and how he puts them into song. This album more than the last i thought was much more focased on human relationships, loss and loving, death and moving on. It's something we can all understand and relate to. It's comforting.  <br /> <br />Now for my last bit off spuaff about this album My favorite two songs are probably I will follow you into the dark and what sarah said. i love the idea that even if there is a \\"no on the vacancy signs of heaven and hell\\" someone would follow me into the dark. The eternal romanticism is embarrassing is it not. Ooo well sqeeg i don't care. What sarah said just gets me everytime. Even though i've listened to the album more times than i count if i just really listen to that song and take in it's meaning the lyrics the music everything... it can bring you to tears. It's so driven by the piano and you wait for it to build up and you want this explosion of feeling... yet it dosn't quite happen that way. It builds up and then... just mutes. And you t hink about everything he's been singing and you have the time to just go... no what wait. I'm not ready for it to end. I love that.  <br /> <br />Brothers on a hotel bed didn't necessarily shout out my name the first time i listened to this cd, but after awhile i just came to be quite fond of it. How two people can be so physically close yet emotionally at oppisite ends of the earth and this \\" Cause now we say goodnight from our own seperate sides like brothers on a hotel bed.\\" I think you can link that to any straight guys sharing a bed. It's not like girls where they just hop in together any odd feelings aside. Guys are so careful to stay on very polar oppisites and not get near each other at all costs. Just enjoyed that. <br /> <br />
B00005JNX0|1.0|The worst cartoon I ever seen in my whole life. I never walked out of a movie theater before but I did when I got through half of this movie.
0679892478|1.0|This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be.
B00005JNQS|1.0|The beginning is good, where the boy robots gets the girls parts and has to wear them but after that the movie goes downhill. Oh and Halle Berry only has like two lines! I felt ripped off!
B00005QIPH|2.0|Very much overhyped.  They wrote 1, maybe two songs.  Very good songs.  Every other track is a slight variation.  Same tempo, same vocal treatment, same reptitive guitar work.  After a couple of tracks, you'll find yourself checking the track sequence and asking yourself....\\"What the...didn't I just hear that song?\\"  To their credit, a lot of other bands now sound just like them...Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc.  Except those groups can play their instruments.  2nd album is a little better.  Instead of buying this, just download any song off the CD and listen to it about 12 times in a row.  Same listening experience.
B00005J6UP|1.0|Man what a dumb movie. I thought it would be good but it wasn't.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Haven't ever done a review before, so forgive me if it doesn't sound polished.... <br /> <br />INTRO <br />30 Seconds to Mars is one of those bands I was hooked on from the start. First song I heard was Echelon (from their first CD). When I heard that they where coming out with a second CD I was pumped for months waiting for it... listening to the first single Attack made me dance around the room with excitement. The day it came out my sister drove an hour and a half to the store to get it for me since I was at work and couldn't go myself. <br />The next day when I finally got the chance to pop it in the CD player and jack it up.... I was not disappointed in the sound that greated me. <br /> <br />THE TRACKS AS THEY ARE <br />Every track on the CD is brilliant in it's own way. There are faster songs and slower songs, though over all I'd call it a middle ground CD. Some of the songs make you want to get up and go wild such as the songs Attack and The Fantasy, well others bring emotions in a different way, making me personally ache with the emotion in Jareds voice... The Story and From Yesterday are two of them, and The Hunter (bonus track 12) is another. <br /> <br />THE MUSIC <br />In my opinion, 30 Seconds to Mars has grown and matured well making this CD. I thought the first CD was amazing, this one is that much and more. The guitars still have riffs and melodies that carry the songs, the bass - well the bass is my favourite instrument and theirs is in my opinion one of the top 10 best I've heard... very creative and easy to hear in most of the songs... the drums are extremely creative and unique, as they where on the first CD, and constantly moving... and the other instruments fill the whole thing out to make the songs catch your attention and hold it till the end. The voice? Well what can I say... Jared Leto is one of my top 5 favourite voices for good reason. He's got emotions and especially on this CD he proves again and again that he can control it to bring you on the journey of a world far from real. <br /> <br />SO WHAT DO I THINK? <br />This CD is deffinitley on my favourite CD's list. I love every track on it and though I've listened to the CD somewhere around 10 times already straight through, and different ones from it more then that, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. If you haven't bought it yet, do so immediatly! It's worth every penny and more!! <br />My only beef with it is the 8 1/2 minute pause on track 10 before the bonus 2 1/2 minute song.... for goodness sake, what's that for? Fast forward the pause and hear the song! Don't just change to the last 2 bonus tracks... and, thought The Hunter is one of my favourites, I don't really like the very ending of it... that was one thing I didn't like about their first CD was that a bunch of the songs had choppy endings. They just didn't feel right, though on this CD I love the endings on every track but 12. <br />So once again, go get the CD! I can't compare the band to anyone else since A: I'm not really that good at comparing most bands, and B: can you compaire them to anyone? They're to good to be compared in any way but on the same level or above... they deffinitley are not below anyone!!
0895260131|5.0|The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is a MASTERPIECE of common sence and logic.  My only negative comment about the book is something that cannot be blamed on the author, and that's the names of the people he quotes and talks about in the book.  I swear that sometimes I thought he was making up combinations of letters and calling it a name, but sure enough these people exist and a little research into the Quoran and Islamic theory turns up these people's history. <br /> <br />I liked the book so much that I'm buying several copies to loan out to family and friends so they can have a chance to see what it is that I've been telling them all along isn't so far from the truth afterall! <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough!  Five Stars!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I am a movie buff and I can honestly say this is one of my favorites of all time.  I've watched it five times since I received it and it just gets better each time.  My family loved it also!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Okay i'll admit I dont have the album but some songs are very good that I wish I had it!!! And i'll also admit I was WRONG about Speed of Sound which I thought wouldnt click with me BUT BELIVE ME, IT HAS!!!!! The song is definetly in one of my top 5 favourite Coldplay hits now! I'd still have to say that Yellow is my all time favourite song by Coldplay followed by The Scientist, then Speed of Sound, Clocks and finaly Fix You!! Even a die hard ColdplaY fan must admit that the rest are just basic songs with the same rythm too them! Them 5 mentioned are all different and must be their 5 best songs ever with Parachutes following closey behind for me!! I've been told not to get the album cause there is only a few good songs on it but I want it anyway cause I like to collect cds! ;D   Basically yet another good album from Coldplay which has some of their best singles on it and just songs that suit the cd only and will never be singles!! But I still like them I just think they should go for a slightly different angle of music and they'll be an even better band than they are today!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Admittedly, when this series first aired, I never really got into it. Either because it was sharing a timeslot with other shows that were already established, or because frankly at the time I just didn't understand it. Now however, with the imminent release of the feature length movie in theaters soon and the reairing in its entirety (in the order it was meant to be seen) on the Sci Fi channel, I must concede that this is quite probably one of the most intelligent and entertaining shows ever produced for television. The multi-talented ensemble really enjoyed their work and it shows as there are no half-acted, muddled-through scenes in any of the original 11 episodes. Not since Farscape have I been this completely enveloped by the magic of the writing, directing, and acting teams. A true masterpiece which should be admired and enjoyed by all.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Such a great album, track 12, \\"Pet Sounds,\\" makes me feel like I'm in Hawaii. You can feel that wall of sound people talk about. Extended liner notes are great, real extensive. Paul McCartney comments on Pet Sounds' influences, and Brian Wilson talks about his prayers before recording \\"God Only Knows,\\" and how he felt he had a halo over his head while he was singing, that blew me away.
076781326X|4.0|There is something magical about this film...anytime it is on television or passed in a video store, people will turn it on. Perhaps it is the catchy score or the endearing characters (Ron Moody will forever be Fagin!). Who cares if Oliver's voice is dubbed by a girl (and the advances in audio makes this terrible evident!) or that all of the women in the show have a decidedly 60's look to them (Heavy mascara!). <br /> <br />Limited extra materials is what made this DVD somewhat disappointng. COuldn't they find Mark Lester Or Jack WIld anywhere?
B00005RG6B|4.0|I LOVED IT!!!! <br />My husband was lucky enough to see them play LIVE. <br />He was telling me this DVD concert was actually SHORTER than the ones he saw. <br />They were 3 HOURS LONG and they performed all of Mindcrime and all of Empire!! <br />WOW!!  Great DVD though!  The CD is just as great!
0743454537|4.0|I could not put this book down.  There were so many thought-provoking moral questions posed that I really wanted to discuss it with someone.  And then the ending; what a letdown to see things tied up so neatly.  No details since I wouldn't want to spoil your read -- but not what would have happened in \\"real life\\"
0792164903|2.0|I was let down by this film, and given the fairly large number of low ratings here, it seems I'm not the only one.<br /><br />In my opinion Burton departs far too far from Irving's original concept, where the romance and colour (figuratively and literally) of colonial America are all but lost in the movie.  To be sure, a perfectly precise book-to-film facsimile of \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is pretty much impossible.  That said, a film version should not change the structure of the story wholesale, but rather only enhance the story's effect through visuals -- as much as possible painting on film what Irving paints with words and prose, while maintaining the original story's literary integrity.<br /><br />To me, the appeal in Irving's story is that he is able to capture the mood, humour, excitement, and even horror of the Headless Horsemen through a technique of building suspence and implying terror -- making us work for it, making us use our imagination -- as opposed to offering it up on a platter for us to merely gawk at the incessant computer generated spectacle.<br /><br />There appeared to be very little if any effort in the film to place us 'in' early colonial America.  I was yearning to see something with high emphasis on historical and technical accuracy -- something akin to a Michael Mann production (e.g., \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\").  Something to perpetuate the 'legend' as a 'legend', and not just somekind of completely unbeleivable, easily dismissable, comic-book style matinee picture.  For me, the most enjoyable of the thrilling/scary type movies, be they period pieces or set in the present day, are the ones that come so close to 'reality' that you think, \\"hey, this could almost really happen\\".  For me, that's when it gets you.  That's why Irving's story works so well -- centuries old or not.  Instead, Burton completely and totally indulges his 'gothism' inclination to the point where things become so fantastic (as in beyond reality) that you begin to really expect anything -- even UFO's with headless ET's flying out of the \\"death-tree\\" (or whatever it's called) and jumping into the batmobile.  Christopher Walkin's character for instance: great idea and great actor, but there was nothing believable about him from the beginning.  It could have been so much more.<br /><br />I would love to see Michael Mann do this story; with a degree of seriousness (which doesn't mean humourlessness) so sorely lacking in Burton's effort.  Think of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\" for instance (different style of story of course, but THAT was somehow 'beleivably' terrifying -- which is the point).  Or, think of Rob Reiner's \\"Stand by Me\\" adaptation of Stephen King's \\"The Body\\", now THAT was excellent in so many ways -- serious, humourous, touching, and scary (i.e., beleivable).  It resonated with your own fears; Burton's Sleepy Hollow however does not.  It does not make you not want to walk alone in the country on an autumn night.<br /><br />I never really got the feeling from Burton that his Sleepy Hollow village was even an isolated place.  It seemed to me that it was just some kind of deprived burrough of New York City.  I read Irving's book however, or even watch Disney's cartoon, and I get the feeling that Sleepy Hollow was almost a society unto itself, and not stark and desolate and grim.  Why did Burton show us, or even mention, New York City in the first place?  For Irving, Sleepy Hollow is rather bountiful and cultured.  And when the sun goes down - however - and the autumn leaves blow and the cold wind whistles through the trees and the moon casts eerie shadows, and the land is dark, that's when Sleepy Hollow really shows itself as the supernatural place it is.<br /><br />At the level of script in particular, all of a sudden, pretty much at the end of the movie, we just have Katrina's mother-in-law as the principle antagonist?  What was that all about?  Burton just tried to make it too complexand lost Irving's effective simplicity.  I wish he had of stuck to the story.<br /><br />The thing that probably bugs me most is that this movie was not terrible.  It had it's potential.  It really could have been great.  Burton just lost the plot somewhere along the line.  And I fear now that since Burton is a pretty big Hollywood name, no one is going to take this story on and do it justice; give it the time and attention it deserves.  Like who is going to re-do James Finimore Coopers \\"Last of the Mohican's\\" for instance, after Mann has done it?  I just don't see it happening anytime soon.  That's okay in this case though, because that movie was great.it too complex and lost Irving's effective simplicity.

0375713751|5.0|Allison Pearson, please write more books! I am just about through with this book and have enjoyed every minute of it.  It is funny and yet sad.  I hate to put it down.  I am about to be a mother of twins (any day now) and working full time.  This book gave me a peek into my life if I decide to go back to work. This was perfect timing.  I am sad I am almost through with this book! Write more! Thank you
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Takk...', the fourth album from Sigur Rs, was released by EMI Records last Monday. Written, performed and produced by the band (along with co-producer Ken Thomas) at their studio in lafoss, Iceland, `Takk...' is the record to justify every amazing claim ever laid at this exceptional band's door.  <br /> <br />Huge and intimate, orchestral and gossamer-light, rich layered and essentially simple, `Takk...' is a work of a band operating at the very top of their game. It accomplishes what maybe they haven't done since they first appeared, which is to make high-flown ideas appear to be straight ahead pop music, or, perhaps more accurately, invest pop music with a sense of magic long since lost in the mists of time and imagination (not that they sound anything like any music made back in any mythical musical heyday). <br /> <br />`Takk...' seems to operate so far outside the confines of what else is going on as to make comparison redundant. That the band were not going to be held by any narrow categorisation was apparent from the off. That they might be capable of creativity at this level of freedom and imagination was more than any of us might ever have hoped for. `Takk...' is an instant classic, and might well turn out to be Sigur Rs's masterpiece. <br /> <br />Flowing through 65 minutes of 11 linked pieces, `Takk...' came together relatively quickly (in Sigur Rs terms), with recording starting in earnest last December and mixing finishing this June. The running order more or less wrote itself by the spring, with several additional songs naturally falling by the wayside as the record took shape.  <br /> <br />That said, Sigur Rs can still take a breathtakingly long time to get to the point. The see-sawing strings and distant piano of `Milano' are like watching Omar Shariff appear on the horizon in Lawrence of Arabia, while, the orchestration towards the end of `Andvari' changes almost imperceptibly on its way towards its epiphany.  <br /> <br />Elsewhere, `Takk...'is literally packed with music, so much so, that you wonder how the band managed to keep the space, clarity and separation in the sound. The ascent of `Svo Hljott' is dizzying and disorientating, while `Glosoli' features the crump of no fewer than three bass drums, before taking us through the ceiling of the song with a guitar that keep climbing long after you think it must have reached its zenith. <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|Simply put, this album is a masterpiece.  If this exact album were put out by any of the critical darlings of today, like Ben Gibbard of Death Cab/Postal Service,  A.C. Newman with the New Pornographers, etc., it would be instantly declared a new standard.  Since it is ONLY Paul McCartney, is it instantly discounted by some listeners. <br /> <br />The fact is, Paul has made an amazing album.  At this point in his career, he could easily coast on his past.  Yet he chooses to explore new directions.  While he has definitely had some mediocre records in his catalog, this is definitely not one of them, and I think it continues the career renaissance he has experienced since Flaming Pie in 1997.  The sound is fresh, and unlike some of his albums, there is not one track of filler.  Right up there with McCartney, Band On The Run and Tug of War.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you want to make one special DVD collection YOU NEED to have this movie. Each frame of this movie are amazing, and the history... wow! don't have any sense, but you love it anyway.<br /><br />Gosh!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|DCFC's major label debut \\"Plans,\\" is simply a beautiful piece of art. This record takes the best of \\"Transatlanticism\\" and fuses it with the magic of The Postal Service's \\"Give Up,\\" to create the perfect evolution of DCFC's signature indie sound. Tracks such as \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room,\\" and the first single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" will simply grab you with their infectious melodies and some of front man Ben Gibbard's best lyrical work to date. \\"Plans\\" is one of the best albums of 2005 and is a highly recomended listen.
034544678X|5.0|This is a great book for all dog lovers and owners alike. I was able to learn a lot about my dogs with the help of this book. Some things I have known and used in the past, but others were new to me. This book not only explains a lot about what's going on in that little furry head, but if used correctly can take communication between you and your dog to a new level.
B000001Y2U|1.0|so yeah this cd was horrible theres like three huge dents in it it doesnt even play so yeah never buy anything from this guy
0783231202|5.0|The strength and integrity of the \\"slaves\\" of Amistad is remarkable. This movie is a tribute to the compassion and justice that transcends language and cultural barriers. I am encouraged by the message of hope and inspiration that is delivered in this movie.
0195102681|5.0|I must confess the first time I opened the book I was surprised by how mathematical this book is. But as you read on you find that you learn more from this book than from others because microeconomic principles are well stated and proved rather than defined with vague statements.
B00097DX3U|5.0|From the begining of the first track you get the feel that this is going to be one of the cd's that you will keep the rest of your life. Out of Exile is one of those cd's that you can let play through without skiping a track. A great piece of work in a time were Rock is begining to lose it's luster. <br />A definite must Have!
B00004RYZT|5.0|Hi, I am german and since the beginning a fan of Rammstein. When you know Rammstein better from some Interviews, you will see, that they make a show when they stand on the stage but in real life they are very funny guys and worlds apart of their life on stage. I love their music and that they have a very good sense of sarcasm and irony. In the music and on stage they create their own world - the dark cornors of life. <br /> <br />And know to the translations: <br /> <br />Du hast can mean both you hate and you have. It's the same word in german and so even germans doesn't know, what is meant. <br />Heirate Mich = Marry Me
0385338686|4.0|Another great Kinsella gem. About a quarter way through it was a bit far fetched for me, but it was an overall good story with a real nice message.
1881273156|5.0|1. Is this an in depth presentation? <br /> <br />This book discusses the five love languages and the variants of each.  The book serves primarily to introduce the reader to these languages and their \\"dialects\\".  There are also many examples in the book of how the different love languages operate in the lives of married couples.  I would say that the book is a very good and workable introduction to the topic, but not an in depth presentation. <br /> <br />2. To what extent does the author address current situations? <br /> <br />The five love languages are applicable to all people in all situations.  These love languages are as old as the human race itself and that makes the book very topical.  This book develops the theme of the five love languages around the covenant of marriage.  Couples where spouses are not fulfilling each other's emotional needs will find a new approach to their marriages in this book.  This book can also be applied to other relationships and the reader will learn to express his love to other people in a constructive manner.  The book will also sensitise the reader to his own love language making it easier to communicate his need for love to other people.  <br /> <br />3. Was there any new information? <br /> <br />The five love languages discussed were new information to me.  The love languages are: <br />* Words of affirmation - the love that is communicated by speaking words of edification to a person.  <br />* Quality time - the love that is communicated by setting aside specific time to spend with a person. <br />* Receiving gifts - the love that is communicated by giving gifts to a person.  The gift can also be the gift of self. <br />* Acts of service - the love that is communicated by being a servant to someone. <br />* Physical touch - the love that is communicated by physically touching someone. <br /> <br />4. What impact did the book have on me? <br /> <br />I did a bit of soul searching while reading this book.  My inability to receive love from my father suddenly became clear:  He did not love me in my primary love language.  I discovered that my primary love language is words of affirmation.  This explains why I find people being critical of me so wounding, especially people whom I love.  I have also started thinking on how I can love my friends better by focussing on their primary love language. <br /> <br />5. Other positive or negative perceptions? <br /> <br />In Chapter 14 the author makes mention of his rediscovery of a need for God when his marriage was in trouble.  In his search for God he found Jesus Christ and committed his life to Him.  He states how Jesus loved those who crucified him.  I believe the point that Mr Chapman is trying to make is that the power to love is rooted in the supernatural power of God at work in our lives.  In the context of the Five Love Languages that means that Jesus died so that marriages could flourish.
B000AL730O|4.0|Well, let's see, \\"Friends to Go\\" is, by far, one of the best songs on \\"Chaos.\\" If I'm not mistaken, Paul mentioned that he was thinking about George, or that he felt his presence when he was writing this song, and that makes the lyric \\"I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go\\" all the more intriguing.  <br /> <br />\\"This Never Happened Before\\" is a beautiful ballad, and would be a great choice for a single. Also, the background vocals on the intro and the middle section of \\"Promise to You Girl\\" are very Beatlesque. Very cool.  <br /> <br />\\"Fine Line\\" is somewhat of a subdued version of \\"Flaming Pie,\\" only not as interesting. Actually, I'm surprised it's the first single, and \\"At the Mercy\\" kind of puts me to sleep. That is, until the bridge section. It's \\"Wanderlust\\" all the way! <br /> <br />I didn't realize it at first, but there's a hidden instrumental track on \\"Anyway.\\" \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is a bit too trance-like for me. If you like \\"Spinning on an Axis,\\" \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" or \\"Riding into Jaipur,\\" you'll probably like \\"Riding to Vanity Fair.\\"  <br /> <br />Ever so often, Paul writes a song that makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. Why he kept it. You know? Well, \\"English Tea\\" is one of those songs. \\"Very gay, hip hooray?\\" I just don't get it. <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is unmistakably the return of \\"Blackbird,\\" but has an interesting instrumental section that sounds like an old Italian folk song. The lyrics are also compelling. <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" has a very uplifting message; that it's not fair that any one person should experience so much pain in a lifetime. All you can do is learn to laugh, and promise yourself you'll be happy again. I wonder who Paul was thinking of when he wrote this one.  <br /> <br />It's pretty good, but I don't think I'd agree that this is one of his finest solo albums. Paul plays most of the instruments on this album, but not a selling point for \\"Chaos.\\" In fact, Paul tends to benefit greatly from collaboration, whether it's John Lennon or Elvis Costello. You definitely won't find anything as fresh and energetic as \\"Run Devil Run,\\" and for what it's worth, I didn't pick up on the \\"genius of Nigel Godrich\\" vibe. The production's average, and the packaging and the artwork leave much to be desired.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I used to be the hugest fan of 50. Get Rich or Die Tryin was nothing below awesome. To tell the truth, i am completely off rap now. i dont know why he went down the path of such a bad 2nd coming.<br /><br />I'll to take 50 to the brain shop<br /><br />Something made his head go pop
B0009MAP90|5.0|The audio quality of this remastered CD is head and shoulders superior to the standard CD that we have endured for decades. <br /> <br />Do not be put off by the monophonic sound (not labeled as such on the CD package, probably for that reason). These recordings are the result of two sessions from November 1961, featuring Bob Dylan solo on vocal, guitar, and harmonica. The stereo version, on both LP and CD, had an idiotic arrangement of vocal and harmonica on one channel, and guitar on the other. Depending on how far apart your speakers are, you could have Dylan playing guitar 20 feet away from where he is singing and playing harmonica! <br /> <br />This is the case no more! Unless you are fortunate enough to have the mono LP of this debut album, you have never heard it the proper way until now, with this superb, newly remastered CD, with Bob Dylan--vocal, harmonica, and guitar--centered between your speakers. <br /> <br />This CD also contains a few previously unpublished photos from the recording sessions. <br /> <br />Although the booklet doesn't say so, I believe this was DSD mastered. Steve Berkowitz, also uncredited on this remaster, is in charge of the overall remastering of Dylan's catalog. He deserves a lot of thanks.  <br /> <br />The standout tracks are \\"Fixin' To Die,\\" \\"Gospel Plow,\\" and \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down.\\" For an excellent outtake from these sessions, \\"House Carpenter,\\" you need to buy \\"The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3.\\" <br /> <br />Trivia: This first album, \\"Bob Dylan,\\" was originally going to be released under the title \\"Free Wheeling.\\" A variation of the title survived for the second album.
B00001QEE2|5.0|Children of any age can be transported to an era of Gods and Heroes.  Great songs with a Gospel feel to them and great references to today's marketting (MCDonalds, American Express etc.).  Yet, what really steals the show is Hades.    <br /> <br />Not a classic like Pinnochio or Snow White, but a new classic fit for this generation.
B000AL730O|5.0|Ive been a paul mccartney fan for about 20 years plus. I love all of his work, but I dont think its all great. he seems to have hits, then some misses, then repeats. beatles, great, first solo stuff, some ok, some not ok, then great lps in band on the run and venus and mars....then lows..then tug of war! well \\"chaos and creation\\" is a return to the high notes of his career. Im going to the show in st pete this sat and I cant wait to hear some of these new songs!!! I didnt think Id say that after I got driving rain, and material off flaming pie grew on me. But this is the first lp since flowers in the dirt that Im listening to as soon as I bought it and im saying \\"these are good songs\\"instead of \\"this will grow on me. thank you paul for many years of listening material, and by far \\"jenny wren\\" is my fav song on the disk.
B0009IW88A|5.0|At first, my expectations for the soundtrack were extremely high. I expected the whole soundtrack to contain the two note adrenaline rush sequence in Vespertilio, but found it sparingly troughout the soundtrack. After my expectations resolved, I was able to appreciate the melody and theme from the other tracks. I also noticed the songs rarely have a closing, but quickly ends after climax; something I had to deal with and later found interesting. I can't wait for the sequal.

B000003TAR|5.0|For those who have explored Nirvana's body of work in an academic capacity, your understanding of the significance of this work of art might scratch the surface of how this album will be revered in the future.  The ages will attest...<br /><br />This era will be remembered for greed and excess.  With the republican party recruiting the christian right wing extremist, Kurt Cobain's stance will be seen as the tragic opposition.  You will see artists emulating his work for scores of years.  Yet, who could ever hope to have as much natural understanding of our social flaws while we are going through the tough times.  I feel Kurt had an unusual grasp of his environment.  What he saw made him sad.  I feel \\"smells like teen spirit \\"is a  song  written directly to the statue of liberty asking her what has become of her... read the lyrics with that interpretation and be prepared to be extremely moved.<br /><br />In Utero stands as the testament of a living man with incredible passion.  I invite you to hunt down an original copy of \\"Incesticide\\" to read the liner notes (these were removed from subsequent pressings).  Read his thoughts on women's rights and racial discrimination.  In Utero has all the  elements of a classic.  I encourage you to listen to the other songs recorded during those sessions (Sappy: aka Verse Chorus Verse and I hate myself and want to die).  Study his lyrics, there are clues as to what we've done wrong as a society.  There is hope for pulling ourselves out of our anti-earth global policies.  There is hope for people of the world understanding our country and how we need to learn to be a good neighbor.  We need more artists like Kurt Cobain to speak up when they see an atrocity in the works.  He was heavily censored and that is the message we need... the stuff they won't let us hear.<br /><br />Stand proud America, we have great artists.  Even though much of our youth are drunken morons, there are more enlightened people now than ever.  Keep reading, keep learning.<br /><br />If you want me to back up my statements, just read the lyrics for \\"Downer\\" (Bleach and Incesticide).  Bring a dictionary, as it's very verbose with it's vocabulary.  But rest assured that, from a young age, Kurt was dialed in like noone else.<br /><br />\\"Downer\\"<br /><br />\\"Portray sincerity,Act out of loyalty, Defend your free country<br /><br />Wish away the pain<br /><br />Hand out lobotomies<br /><br />To save little families<br /><br />Surrealistic fantasy<br /><br />Bland, boring plain!<br /><br />Holy now in restitution<br /><br />Living out our date with Fusion<br /><br />In our whole fleece shun in bastard<br /><br />Don't feel guilty, master writing<br /><br />Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can<br /><br />Make enough up the words as you go along, I sing then some<br /><br />Sickening pessimist hypocrite master<br /><br />Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard<br /><br />Thank you Dear God for putting me on this Earth<br /><br />I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!<br /><br />Holy now in restitution<br /><br />Living out our date with Fusion<br /><br />In our whole fleece shun in bastard<br /><br />Don't feel guilty, master writings<br /><br />Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can<br /><br />Make enough up the words as you go along, I sing this song\\"<br /><br />If you are a politician... I would study this guy.  Many think of him as a prophet. I just see him as a visionary.  But it holds clues to how people will begin to think.<br /><br />Now as far as In Utero is concerned, I am still attempting to decipher it's significance.  I lean toward the assumption that our country has been one of the greatest ever.  I believe Kurt Cobain to be a Great American.  I think In Utero was a call to a young government to not ignore it's people.  Just as Kurt wrote about an \\"umbilical noose\\" to climb back into the womb, I  believe the people of this country  feel a child-like neglect fromtheir patronizing government.  I hear the kicking and screaming for the liberties our ancestors fought so hard to guarantee.  I hear a cry for help that our government has turned a deaf ear.  I hear Cobain painting a picture of an American People that need hope.  I see In Utero as a beautiful and admittedly dirt-smeared and stinky statement that the American way of life is not doomed to a life sentence of boredom and consumerism.  (If you're rich, you know what I'm talking about... shopping and more shopping... pretty boring, huh?)<br /><br />Cobain was still a baby in many stretches of the imagination, but he had a carried a message; the weight of it ultimately killed  him.<br /><br />Dig into this album.  And it will challenge your brain to stay motivated.  This is the  perfect time of the year to appreciate this album... Fall.  The time where the old leaves die and fall off the tree... to make way for young buds next spring.  Stay motivated.  Steer yourself in a better direction.<br /><br />Humbly yours,<br /><br />Cortaming for the liberties our ancestors fought so hard to guarantee.

B000AL730O|5.0|I hate to compare any of his albums to Beatles. Just because it's still Paul McCartney for me. This album is excellent! That's out of the question. It's just great music. But I would say that it's the most sad album of his entire career. And it doesn't matter that you can put English Tea or whatever in any of Beatles's albums. This is a real masterpiece in the ocean of 50/50 music around us! <br />Waiting for next one Paul!!! <br />
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Having experience with people who have done the 28 days in rehab thing, I can say that this is pretty realistic.  Sandra does a great job.  One of her best.  The rest of the cast are good representatives of the cross section of people that suffer from addiction. Funny and sad, not everyone makes it.  That's real.  You feel for these people by the end of the movie.  This was an eye opener for me in many ways.

B00011D1RC|5.0|<br />Great movies and great stars remain ageless and immortal.  Edmund Goulding's GRAND HOTEL (1932, MGM) won a deserved Best Picture Oscar 72 years ago, yet remains fresh and dramatic.  This Grand Hotel is in Berlin between the world wars, and its fine cast is full of glittering names that a modern audience should become acquainted with.  We have Greta Garbo as a world-weary ballerina.  John Barrymore is a jewel thief who sneaks into her hotel room to rob her of jewels to pay off a gambling debt.  But he falls in love with her when she is about to attempt suicide.  John's brother Lionel is a hyperactive bookkeeper convinced he is in awful health.  His boss, Wallace Beery, is in the hotel for a big business merger.  Helping him is a very young and charming Joan Crawford as an American stenographer.  Jean Hersholt is a hotel porter.  And Lewis Stone, later Judge Hardy on the ANDY HARDY series, is the hotel doctor. <br /> <br />There is no real plot here.  Instead, we have engrossing character interaction with some of the finest actors of the era.  They make GRAND HOTEL a wonderfully entertaining and archetypal drama.  Is Lionel Barrymore dying?  What happens to him when he runs into boss Beery at the hotel bar?  Will John Barrymore really steal Garbo's jewels, even as he falls in love with her?  What happens to him with his criminal bosses if he cannot pay off gambling debts?  He steals money from poor Lionel during a gambling game, but shortly returns it when he gets a guilty conscience.  What happens when he breaks into Beery's room?  What happens to Beery's merger?  Hersholt's wife gives birth to a baby; we see his excitement in a phone call.  And through it all, Stone wanders through the lobby muttering, \\"Grand Hotel.  People coming and going, and nothing ever happens..\\"  Ah, but everything happens if you know where to look in this gorgeous hotel.  Everyone has an interesting story to tell in GRAND HOTEL, which inaugurated the \\"all-star drama in a confined setting\\" type of movie that is still in vogue with airplanes.  Even MGM did a decent remake called WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF (1945) with an all-American cast at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan.  GRAND HOTEL remains a supreme example of MGM gloss, dazzling star power, and solid writing after more than seven decades. <br /> <br />
0790731002|5.0|I dont know why this movie is being labeled \\"the worst of all Batman\\" movies, that honor belongs to the 4th movie, Batman and Robin. Jim Carrey delivers an amazing performance that only he can pull off as a criminally insane and demented, Riddler. Truly oscar worthy! Tommy Lee Jones transforms Two-Face into the diabolical villian that is only outdone by Nicholas' Joker and Devito's Penguin. A great movie for Batman lovers, great soundtrack (highlighted by U2 and Seal), the introduction of Robin does seem a bit \\"rushed\\" into the movie but with two villains, Batman, a sexy psychologist and now Robin the movie has to be high paced. Visually, this movie is matched by none. People forget that this movie is made in 1995, the age of apple computers and 16 bit video games, and to pull off the cinematic shots done in this film must be marveled at.  <br />Batman Forever should not be bashed but appreciated for its fine acting and riveting effects. Just excuse Val Kilmer's dull Batman performance and Kidman's somewhat slutty look in this film.
B00092ZL80|5.0|By far the best looking and sounding music concert dvd I have ever seen. I saw the concert live in Tampa, Fl and everytime I look at the DVD I remember how awesome it was seening them live and this is a DVD that you must have if you are a true fan of either of the bands.
B0000025FG|4.0|I am a huge ELO fan.  I have most of their albums.  Yes it's true that Discovery has a bit of a disco sound... however it is not fully disco.  Probably the only song on that album that I would consider being disco, would have to be \\"Shine A Little Love\\".  In the CD booklet Jeff Lynne even says this is a bit of a disco tune.  But, I believe that the rest of the album is not disco, it's totally ELO.  This is probably my least favorite album, but it's stiull pretty good.  If you like this album or any other ELO album, then you'll probably like the album that came after Discovery, entitled TIME.  I believe that Time is ELO's best album.  I know that a lot of people will disagree, but I think that album was a good concept.
B0002858YS|3.0|\\"Hot Fuss\\" is a three in a half star effort by a very promising band. I was extremely apprehensive to buy this because I felt like I've heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" over a millions times a day. Though with each listen, the song never lost it's catchiness. I finally bought the album because I heard \\"All these thing's that I've done\\". I really enjoyed that song a whole lot more than \\"Mr. Brightside\\" or \\"Somebody Told Me\\". \\"Hot Fuss\\" is NOT a bad album. It's pretty good and very listenable. The album shines from tracks 1-8. After \\"Change Your Mind, the album winds down tremendously and becomes sluggish. \\"Midight Show\\" is just OK in my book. The real standout for me was \\"On Top\\".  <br />The Killers may be around for a long time and hopefully they can come out with some stronger tunes that consist of better lyrics and better guitar play. Brandon Flowers has a great voice and I can't wait for their next release.
0316776963|5.0|I have never, ever read a funnier book.  An excellent collection of short stories.  For the first time in my life, I had to stop and read lines out loud to a friend so I had someone to share the hilarity with.  His other books are good but not as good so I would start with them and end with this one- that way you save the best for last.  You also get to know the character in Sedaris' life.
B00004VXF2|2.0|It's noise. It really, truly is. It's loud, annoying noise, and that's all there is to it. Yet, it is strangely intriguing. I won't attempt to pontificate on it (and any hidden genius, as there is none), but if you enjoy (?!) the samples Amazon offers, you wouldn't be dissatisfied if you bought it. I won't say it's a brilliant work of genius that makes the universe stand on its head, but it has some intrigue, if only to hear the godawful cacophony.     The fact that there's this many reviews praising it and giving it five-star ratings goes to show that there really is a market for anything and there is no such thing as \\"too avant-garde to be sold.\\" It also shows that people will give trash a try if a well-known name offers it to them.    I don't know whether the story about the album being a sixty-minute middle finger at RCA is true--he would've had to have a very loose contract to get the album out in spite of the fact that it wasn't going to be commercially viable.    Recommended to those who feel compelled to subject themselves to a lot of loud noise. Also recommended as a gift to the avant-garde (or metalhead) elitists in your life who believe that the more it hurts to listen to music, the more hip/hardcore they are for listening.     Otherwise, don't buy it.
B00003CXA6|1.0|Anyone, and I mean anyone, who has read much about Robert E Lee can see that the selection of Martin Sheen to portray Lee, and Sheen's inability to capture how most historians have described Lee are failures.  I also found that side of the movie dedicated to unstanding battlefield strategy and tactics was extremely poor.  There was an attempt to portray the poor intelligence both sides had to deal with, but I found the screen play was inferior in its treatment of what was happening all over the battlefield.  I give the film one star, and feel I'm being generous in doing so. <br />AC Falk <br />Aiken, SC
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I've heard many fans online say that this new album just isn't the 30 Seconds To Mars that they're used to. I've even heard some fans accuse the band of \\"selling out\\", believe it or not. That just is not true.  <br /> <br />Sure, the new album may sound a little different. It sounds a bit more real, it is not as synthesized as the last album. And it is fantastic! \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" has proven that you can explore and try new approaches without losing who you are as a band. Furthermore, this band has once again proven that good music does not come pre-packaged. Just because a sound is popular on the radio does not mean its good. 30 Seconds To Mars has proven that you can be who you are, you can be unique and have a unique sound, and still make great music. I highly recommend this album and this band to anyone who is sick of the same old cliched rock songs on the radio.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|don't bother. watch something else.  <br /> <br />i was surprised since several friends told me i had to watch it, but this movie is one of the lamest, uninspired and shallow movies i've seen in some time. its stupidity is only rivaled by \\"i heart huckabees.\\" oh yeah, and its not funny. not one bit. everything that's supposed to be funny is based on overused cliches and cheap \\"wacky\\" shock value.  <br /> <br />whatever happened to well-made high school movies that were actually funny and clever but also with some kind of underlying social commentary? \\"breakfast club\\" anyone?
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Old Boy was the first Korean film I have ever seen. I must say I am completely taken aback by the concept. I've lost count of the number of times in this film when I experienced EXTREME GOOSEBUMP SYNDROME.<br /><br />I know I will never watch a film like Old Boy again but I do know it will reflect in my future conversations. I am not even ashamed of downloading this film. Atleast I watched it.<br /><br />This film is about revenge and has more suspense filled raw staggering control over the viewer than I can possibly comprehend in my little review. The story is about as unique as the design of the wonders of the world. The movie covers a lot of aspects of a man's life. What value does time have? Do we really forget everything we know? Do elevators actually have passwords for the penthouse right on top? Do men actually have a remote control controlling their life support?<br /><br />Now now, I know how vague and random I might sound but Old Boy actually did this to me. It is the most potent display of human thought I have seen in a long time. I remember watching \\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\\" and being disappointed not by the story but by the frail enactment. \\"Old Boy\\" contains more thought and hardcore action than quite a few movies put together. It leaves most behind in terms of quantity of mind.<br /><br />I don't want to start with the actors and storylines because I do not want to ruin it for you.My favourite character in the film was the villain.The movie seems way ahead of it's time. At first, the subtitles didnt really help but soon I got used to it and by the end, they only helped more and more.<br /><br />Old Boy keeps becoming more interesting as it grows. When it ended, I had my hand on my mouth and my eyes just about as wide as to make me look uglier. Anyhow, watch it to feed that demon in you that wants to watch absolute trendsetting imaginative plots. Hope you know what I mean. You will.
0975991477|3.0|The doctor presents a very interesting and original view of cellular biology and the metaphor of cells as humans is cute, even if very common in any eastern philosophical model. It becomes less interesting however, when he wears off his knowledge path into fields he does not understand such as quantum physic, chaotic mathematic and fractal geometry. The conclusions he reaches are hurried and ungrounded, his supporting arguments simplistic and superficial. Throughout the book he makes many claims to finding happiness and well being only to discover at the end that alas, he has no advice for us, only a forwarding address...
1592400876|5.0|I've been laughing out loud at this book since I picked it up. It's like having tea with that rather fussy, old-fashioned, but extremely funny and irreverent maiden aunt of yours. <br /> <br />I found myself identifying with her on many counts. I, too, shudder whenever I see an \\"it's\\" that should be an \\"its\\", or a \\"your\\" that should be a \\"you're\\". Her idea of a violent uprising of \\"sticklers\\" sounds pretty reasonable to me at times. <br /> <br />To future readers and other reviewers: the books was not altered from its British version for an American audience. Read it if that doesn't bother you. Don't if it does. <br /> <br />The author has such personality and a great deal of inventiveness that makes the book really come to life. It seems odd that a book about proper punctuation would be so funny, but I think it works wonderfully. <br /> <br />Ms. Truss repeatedly informs us many people disagree on the rules of punctuation, often violently. I think that is evident in the other reviews here. Point proven. <br /> <br />To the reviewer that informs us that Webster's Dictionary is the true source of information for correct English usage: good heavens, man! What a thought! Webster's is an abomination, as all lovers of the English language should know. Please, buy yourself a proper dictionary.
B000AL730O|5.0|Very pleased with this album. Not as fantastic as Flaming Pie, but a large jump from Driving Rain. Very much looking forward to hearing some of these live.
B000050FEN|5.0|David Fincher is one of most respected film directors thanks to his works in the suspense genre, the noir and dark chills of THE GAME and the mysterious, scary, and atmospheric scares found in SEVEN, which happens to boast great performances, scary moments that will take the breath right out of you, and creepy visuals that only help to enhance the film's overall dark feel. The setting is used to great effect as well, as you'll find out for yourself while you're watching this movie.    The movie stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives from two different paths who happen to unite on a very chilling case. It begins with the death of a fat man who has ingested so much spaghetti that his killer hasn't necessarily done the deed, but has helped to create a morbid masterpiece of death that even boggles detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). The two seem to form a mutual respect and a unique bond as a result of eventually working on the cast together, and as the murders pile up, so does the suspense and the chills. The scariest moment of the film involves the discovery of a body in an apartment complex that looks like a corpse that, according to the evidence they find, has been there for over a year. When the body moves and wriggles around, you'll jump five feet out of your seat. They chase the killer down alleyways, cutting corners and getting hurt in the process. Again, the setting is incredibly strong, adding to the air of suspense present throughout the feature. As Somerset and Mills continue to compile evidence and theories to solve the mystery of the killer's \\"seven deadly sins\\" motive, he unwittingly shows up at the precinct and gives himself up...ah, but he's got a motive.     While on the car ride out to the open to find the last of the killer's victims, they unwittingly end up in a game that leads one of them to a fatal flaw: the last two deadly sins. Mills doesn't realize that his wife was murdered by the killer, and he decided to take a prize with him: her head. The tension and suspense builds to such tight levels at this point near the close of the film, you'll be biting your nails and waiting for the rope to snap. Indeed, the ending proves to be quite powerful, and after the credits are rolling, you'll be asking yourself many questions and be praising the movie's tight weave of suspense and dark comedy.    Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Leland Orser all make good impressions in this film, but without a doubt, Kevin Spacey nearly steals the show as the infamous killer who takes his work seriously and is so subdued and calm about his demeanor, you'll start to wonder whether the people you're around in your real life could be like him. Freeman and Pitt, again, are stellar in the lead roles, making you feel every bit of anguish, every laugh, every tear, every scare, every breath. You even start to feel the sweat and  the wounds like you've inherited them. The movie's cinematography is excellent, and the photography elements are perfectly set. No doubt this was Fincher's little masterpiece, and following it up with THE GAME only proved his importance in this genre.    So while their are some genuine chills to be had, the atmosphere and smart script keep you on your toes. Working from a premise of such style and uniqueness, SEVEN is one of the best thrillers committed to film and should be viewed at least once in your lifetime. Don't let this pass you up...it could be your one and only sin.
B00000IMTF|5.0|A quick look through all of these reviews will tell you this is a great album. In a world where so much fails to live up to hype - this album does and then some. It is almost ridiculously good. Stargazer, A Light In the Black and Tarot Woman are true epics with a enough musical invention to put most bands these days to shame. Stargazer and A Light In The Black couldn't be more different from each other and yet both make a strong case for being amongst the best metal/hard rock songs of all time. Making up the balance of the album are Run With The Wolf (great lyrics), and the more conventional rockers Starstruck and Do You Close your eyes.    It's a shame that so many people are only vaguely aware of this band. Ronnie James Dio has deservedly been recognized as one of hard rock's finest voices, and nowhere does he prove that better than on this album. His is simply a masterful and flawless performance. Ritchie Blackmore is every bit his equal, with superb riffs and incredibly musical solos. Few can place a tasteful solo into a song better than Blackmore. He is by far my favorite rock guitarist with unmatched tone, expression and musicality. His continued lack of recognition with the other \\"big name\\" rock guitarists is nothing short of criminal.    Don't hesitate: buy this album along with their first - Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, and their third - Long Live Rock 'n' Roll.
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray has done soemthing that even i didn't think possible.  He out-did himself.  \\"White Ladder\\" was a top album of the decade and he surpasses his biggest critical success with a more broad journey that is both musically and lyrically his best work to date.  Sometimes good things come to those who wait and David Gray fans have waited for almost 3 years before his newest album and what a worthwhile patience period.   <br /> <br />\\"Life in Slow Motion\\" has the feeling of being final and complete unlike his last effort, A New Day at Midnight.  Besides moments like \\"Be Mine\\", \\"Otherside\\", \\"Long Distance Call\\", and \\"Dead in the Water,\\" we are left with an array of mishits due to what felt like a rushed album.   <br /> <br />\\"Life in Slow Motion\\" starts of like a film score and erupts with a bit of what David has said be a \\"babylon part two\\" type of song with \\"Alibi.\\"  David's vocals are spine chilling in these deep ballads including \\"Lately,\\" \\"Ain't No Love,\\"  and \\"Slow Motion.\\"  the song \\"Disappearign World\\" has a an eery feeling when you hear it, which reminds me of \\"Mad World\\" by Gary Jules.  The light hearted moments that pick up the pace are simple and well produced.  \\"One I Love,\\"  is pure David Gray.  While David Gray msuic has been known for its more morose sound, \\"Hospital Food\\"  is a welcome journey of his quirky humor and along with \\"Lately,\\" are the most stand out moments on the album. <br /> <br />Making another \\"White Ladder\\" was impossible.  Making himself sound less like Coldplay to critics seems impossible, but David did them one better.  He showed us all that he writes lyrics better than Coldplay and that he has a Beatlesque quality in making love, sensitivity, pain and beauty more about depth and less about cheesy girlish pop songs
B00003CX5P|5.0|I like to give the classic movies to my children to enjoy. I have to say that my little boy and his friends has enjoyed this over and over.  Now the children dress up as the characters and play act all the time.
B000AA305M|5.0|This is definitely \\"one of those\\" albums, one that makes you thankful that certain musicians put out records.  [...]    Unlike many modern albums, this album doesn't stagger toward the end - Now and Always and Disappearing World, though two very different songs, are unquestionably some of the best tracks on the album.  Other highlights are: Lately, Slow Motion, and Ain't No Love.       I see this album as Lost Songs meets New Day at Midnight minus cheesy electronics (i.e. 'Caroline').  Perhaps fans from the very beginning won't find it enough of a return to his roots, but to anyone who's found David since/because of White Ladder, this will be a very treasured CD!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I love this, this is a great cd for songs like Down by the river <br />which is almost one of my top songs and Like a hurricane, and <br />Hey Hey My My, & the very great, Rockin' in the Freeworld which <br />both Down by the River, & Rocking In the Freeworld get played <br />on the radio sometimes are all great!!! Great cd from neil. <br />Recommended!!! Hugely recommended for Down by the river.
1563890410|4.0|Neil Gaiman, Sandman: A Season of Mists (DC Comics, 1992)<br /><br />There are many of my acquaintance, and many I've read (including Steve Erickson, who wrote the intro to the third Sandman volume), who believe that A Season of Mists is the crowning achievement in the Sandman series. I am not one of them; I think Dream Country is a tad better. A tad, mind you; A Season of Mists is a lovely thing as well, and like all of Gaiman's graphic-novel output, deserves to be read.<br /><br />This fourth book is where Gaiman really breaks Sandman away from its horror-comic roots and turns it into the kind of twisted-fantasy thing it is ultimately remembered as. A pretty odd statement for a book that deals with Morpheus going to hell to fight Lucifer for a soul he condemned ten thousand years before, but there you go. Here, for the first time, we meet most of the Endless (one is still elusive), we see a (temporary? We don't yet know) change of heart for Lucifer, learn more about some of the other pantheon's in Gaiman's universe (and are introduced to others), and get some interesting clues about the land of Dream itself.<br /><br />If you've followed the Sandman series this far, you will definitely enjoy this one. If you haven't, either start at the beginning or star with Dream Country, the third book in the series, but not related to the overall storyline (and thus it can stand alone). ****
B000AL730O|2.0|Let me first start by saying I am a huge Beatle and McCartney fan. So after reading some of the pre-reviews I was very much looking forward to Sir Paul's new CD. Well, it is a monster disappointment. Gone are the catchy hooks and inspiring craftsmanship we long ago have come to expect from Paul. The songs are drab, slow and dare I say? Boring. Not one upbeat rocker in the lot. Virtually all the songs come across as introspective meanderings that just fall flat.  I rate this LP right up there with McCartney II which was filler music from the first track to the last. This? John Lennon said it best; \\"the sound you make is muzak to my ears\\". Really folks this is elevator music.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|The Italian Job (F. Gary Gray, 2004)<br /><br />Gray (The Negotiator) once again takes a top-notch cast and does something good with them. Not great, mind you, but good. But then, how bad can a movie be when your cast list includes Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G, and two members of the Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E.?<br /><br />Very loosely based on the 1969 film of the same name (the writers of the new script watched the original only once before writing, in order to not be overly influenced by the original), The Italian Job opens with John Bridger (Sutherland) and hs crew of professional thieves doing a hefty job in Venice, making off with a fortune in distinctive gold bars. Without revealing any spoilers, after the heist, one of the group turns on the rest, and the remainder of the film is about the rest of the group's attempt to get the spiols from the job back. As that small synopsis should tell you, this is an action movie, and it's pretty much neverending action (much like Gray's last feature before this, A Man Apart). There's not much original here, and you'll see the movie's twists coming long before its actors, but lots of stuff blows up, the actors all play their roles to the hilt, and there are a lot of one-liners to throw around at work the next day. A good turn-your-brain-off kind of movie. ***
0060207051|5.0|I love this classic children's book.  It's about the wonderful patterns of life.  I bought this for my niece.  She loved it.  I was looking for a book called \\"I AM A TREE\\"  by R.A. Lupo and found this one.  She loved it.  [...]But it is classic children's book!
B000002U82|5.0|the best way to listen to this album is close the lights, sit down and dream while magic music takes you away. you cannot skip any track, just let it play all. <br />this ablum is a pure piece of magic.  <br />if i  could pick a couple of tracks id say \\"time\\" and \\"the great gig in the sky\\" are unbeatable, but this is not fair since all the other songs are the same beautiful, and all of them together create a fantastic art work. <br />a must for anyone who want a piece of classical music.

B000AL730Y|4.0|PmcC is undoubtedly warming up for greater things and I'm hoping or even suggesting that he will follow his 'McCartney'-era revisit with a revisit to his singles periods (Beatles, Wings) where he has been a master of the variety of forms that the smash single requires. Bono said recently that he listened to 'Wingspan' and was 'in awe' of the versatility and freshness there. Most of those were self-produced but what they had in common was a much greater focus on the craft of writing the big radio hit, and of taking advantage of time, place and location for inspiration (thinking here of the Philly influence and use of horns in some of the mid-seventies Wings singles). <br /> <br />Writing singles will allow him to mutate more and faster than the album-tour-home-album schedule. I read that a lot of the Beatles and Wings singles were inspired, recorded and released in double quick time. No sweating.  <br /> <br />Also would like to back up a few other people who have noted that when Paul gets a little black and gets in the breakbeats and horns and the R&B roots, he produces real magic. <br /> <br />As for \\"Chaos\\", I like to think of it as a promising debut. <br /> <br />:-)
B0007M22TI|5.0|I originally watched portions of this show on PBS, during a fund drive.  I enjoyed it and wanted to enjoy the entire show, so I bought the DVD.   <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and have watched it four times so far since receiving it.  I had also just purchased a large LCD TV  and since I do not have satelite or cabel and broadcast quality and content available thru the air is so bad, I have really enjoyed watching and listening to the dvd. <br /> <br />I believe I can afford and really enjoy purchased DVDs of programs vs watching what is available from the networks, cable, or satelite broadcasters, at a lower cost.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this disk to anyone who enjoys listening to quality performances of beautiful Irish women and may have also seen parts of the show on PBS. <br />
B0009XNUK0|4.0|...But it should be warned that if you already own \\"HIStory: Past, Present, and Future\\" then you're more or less paying for the same thing.  However, the good news is that if you don't, this is by far the best collection of Michael Jackson's greatest hits!<br /><br />Unlike HIStory, they actually have the goods.  Not just the same old stuff we've all heard thousands of times (i.e. we get more than just \\"Billie Jean\\" \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\").  Not only that, but we get to hear some classic Jackson 5 songs.  And of coure, \\"Ben\\" which was one of his greatest.<br /><br />If you take a look you'll notice that \\"Off the Wall\\" \\"P.Y.T. Pretty Young Thing\\" and \\"Human Nature\\" are here. And I was very impressed that this time, they remembered \\"Smooth Criminal\\" (the song everyone seems to think Alien Ant Farm did).  They also threw in \\"Dirty Diana\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\".<br /><br />Likewise, we can easily see that \\"Dangerous\\" was not a forgotten album.  This time spawning more than just three songs, but actually seven.  And what a fine seven they are, the ones we actually LIKED... well, maybe some of us could do without \\"Heal the World\\".  But luckily, \\"Man in the Mirror\\" will save you from that.<br /><br />Really, this is a great compilation.  We get to see Jackson before he became a total nutcase in the media.  Remember, it doesn't matter what he looks like now, or even how his music sounds now.  It's all a matter of what his music can still bring to you now.  You can't change the past, and the past was good!  So let's keep it and remember it when we buy this.<br /><br />Lastly, I still have to throw in that if you got HIStory and Number Ones, this might not perk you up right. However, for two CDs the list price isn't bad (HIStory debuted at about forty dollars).  So if you want the GOOD Jackson songs, get this album.  It's more than just his solo career, too.  It's his career with the Jackson 5 as well.
B000AL730O|2.0|I love Paul McCartney, and I have been a Beatles and a Wings fan since my early years, but this album is probably only something for hardcore Paul fans. It is dull, boring, self-indulgent, over-produced, at times overly simple, and definitely in my opinion, does not even come close to any Wings album or specifically the \\"Flaming Pie\\", with all these wonderful ballads. One word: no heart or soul. As a number of folks have already commented as to each individual song, there is no reason to chime in.  I regret having spent almost $10 for this album.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|the extra content for Aliens is great... some of the deleted scenes for aliens 3 is kind of junky, static, black and white with garbled audio... aliens 4 was a horrible movie anyway... but its 9 dvd's packed with all sorts of goodies, if your a fan of the series there is no doubt that you should buy this set...

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I just needed to let everyone know how absolutely amazing and incredible this album is.  The band is tight and solid and I was surprised at the talent in the vocals.  Not only is it the kind of songs that have an unstoppable beat to it, but the feelings and emotions behind the lyrics that can be felt through the lead vocals are what really sells it for me.  The rawness of the emotions really touched me and to me that is what music is all about.  Buy this album, you'll love it. <br /> <br />J
B00007L9EC|3.0|Ozzy's \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was originally released in early 1986, and it seems a bit like something that was cranked out merely to satisfy the record company's thirst for another album. Don't get me wrong though--this is not a BAD album at all.    Regardless of how much Ozzy hates the hit \\"Shot In The Dark\\" nowadays, it's quite a strong song: an engagingly melodic rock ballad with excellent guitarwork and atmospheric synth.    As for the remaining tracks... Well, this is one of the most average albums I've ever heard in my life. Again, this is not to say it's BAD, because it's not--track after track has moderately engaging melodicism, although none of the tunes are particularly catchy, and the lyrics tend to be on the weak side as well. Ozzy doesn't strike me as sounding particularly inspired vocally, but I think this goes hand-in-hand with the material being so-so. Ozzy aside, I don't have any bones to pick with the performances or the production, it's really just the material that's problematic. All that said, this is an album that you won't feel COMPELLED to turn off once it's playing, yet it never really makes you jump out of your seat either.    \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" is the second and last studio album from Ozzy featuring Jake E. Lee on guitar, and it certainly isn't as inspired as \\"Bark At The Moon\\", Lee's first with Ozzy. \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" isn't a must-miss, but it's best left for diehard Ozzy fans.

B000A3DFZE|1.0|Very disappointed in this effort by Clapton. Painful listening. I'll take his blues efforts anyday. This is as boring as it gets!
B000AL730O|5.0|I thought Flaming Pie was a great album but I also thought it marked the limit of what McCartney could achieve at this late point in his career. But Chaos and Creation really shows Paul breaking through to entirely new levels of seriousness and emotion. In a way, the whole album harkens back to a song like Waterfalls. It uses an intriguing sonic background to deepen the simple but rather dark lyrics. But the songs on Chaos also use unusual chord changes to further push the songs into fresh territory. And Paul's voice is remarkable full-bodied--as open as his lyrics here--and it's great to hear him sing that way after his indulgent old-man's rasping on Driving Rain. Some critics are saying this is Paul's best album, the only one that matters. And that's ridiculous. Paul has been amazingly prolific over the years. Some of his work is disposible, some downright awful and some extremely good. Chaos is certainly as good as anything he's ever done. The heights he hits on Chaos show that the ever-reaching Beatle spirit is still alive in him. Let's hope he signs producer Nigel Godrich for a follow-up album right away. He may have found his best collaborator since John Lennon.

B000641ZA4|5.0|Genesis - The Video Show is a fine package indeed. The \\"real\\" videos (big budget, storyboard, name director etc.) from the 80's and 90's are for the most part fun and engaging, and it's nice to have them all collected together in one place. They include everything released by the band during the MTV era, including the memorable Spitting Image inspired puppet video for Land of Confusion, which, on reflection, is every bit as entertaining, but quite a bit more politically charged, than I remembered as an eighteen year old back in '86. There are other highlights too, like the inclusion of the mimed performance of Paperlate on the British TV show Top of the Pops, and the '99 reunion with Peter Gabriel on a new rendition of The Carpet Crawlers. For many Genesis fans though, myself included, the stars of this DVD will prove to be the promo videos for some of the songs from A Trick of the Tail, And Then There Were Three, and Duke. Before the arrival of MTV, and the aforementioned \\"real\\" music videos, bands would often film promos on stage, simulating a live in-concert performance, and sometimes cut other imagery and scenes in with it. And these are what make this DVD so special - and so tantalizing! In watching the band on-stage, with all the correct instruments, stage set, lights and so on, playing such fabulous music as Ripples, Follow You Follow Me, and Turn It On Again, it only takes a small step in the mind to imagine watching real concert footage from the period - which, after all, is the stuff most visibly absent from the Genesis catalog, and that which most life-long Genesis fans would love to see released more than anything else. Oh, well. Until the band release a live video retrospective, along the lines of the fantastic Genesis Archive CD box sets of a few years back, Genesis - The Video Show, will suffice. It is a superb collection that you will want to play over and again...while dreaming of the day that Gabriel and Collins era 70's concert footage gets the same, stunning, DVD treatment.
0553213105|5.0|I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years. I can think of at least a dozzen books and movies made within the past couple of decades which attempt to rehash this untopable novel. I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book . I heartily recomend this work to the romantics in this world, and all others who just want a timeless storyin which love, honour and to some extent vulnerability trample the strictist rigitity of class, snobbery and aloofness.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I generally like Coldplay and X&Y is a solid edition to their catalogue, but there isn't much that's groundbreaking here. Most of the songs on the album are easy to listen to and create a nice atmosphere but are not that engaging. Those songs are: White Shadows, Talk, X&Y, Speed of Sound, Low, Swallowed in the Sea. To me these songs, half the album, are filler. On a truly great album NONE of the songs should be filler. Having said that, the other half of the album is quite good and in two cases transcendent. Given that the album as whole is easy to listen to that should be enough of a reason to add it to your collection.<br /><br />I'll give my favorite songs on the album a bit more of a detailed treatment:<br /><br />Square One and What If (7/10 each) are solid starters. Both are reminiscent of Coldplay's earlier work. Square One is up beat and What If is more mellow.<br /><br />Fix You (9/10) caught me by surprise. I didn't like it at first thinking that it was actually two songs side by side. The first part of the song is slow and is a bit sappy but it sets up the the second part of the song perfectly. The second part ROCKS and has one of the catchiest and coolest hooks on the entire album. Definitely one of my favorites!<br /><br />A Message (7/10 ) and The Hardest Part (8/10) are what I would call \\"journey\\" songs. They take you on a musical journey, and explore different atmospheric and emotional space. This is what I have come to expect from Coldplay and these songs are fine examples.<br /><br />Twisted Logic (7/10) is very textured and reminds me a bit of Radiohead (only a bit!). It's Sci-fi rock n' roll with a message (that is if you listen for it).<br /><br />And finally: Til Kingdom Come (10/10)! This is the hidden track and by far the best stand alone song on the album. It's a song about pure devotion and all that entails. Its style doesn't fit with the rest of the album and that's probably why its a hidden track, but it will definitely make it onto future best ofs...it onto future best ofs...
B000067CPX|4.0|So... <br /> <br />There is no Hollywood funk. That's okay. <br /> <br />Lots and lots of soaring melodies. That's okay too. <br /> <br />This is the Red Hot Chili Peppers? <br /> <br />WHAT!? <br /> <br /> <br />Yes yes, the California quartet of funk released By The Way three years ago and I have to say, there are some days I like it and there are some days I just down right hate it. Overall, I don't care too much for this album because after half an hour of listening to By The Way the first time I got it I went right back to their early days. Then again, this album is not for everyone. <br /> <br />If you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers for their musical talent then yes, you are going to drool over this album because they have never sounded better. You are going to love tracks such as \\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"This Is The Place\\", \\"Tear\\", \\"Minor Thing\\", and \\"Venice Queen\\".  <br /> <br />If you have been a longtime Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and you love the high energy, past paced funk, then you are going to be disappointed. The only funk tracks - the title track, \\"Can't Stop\\", and \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" are all flawed, nonetheless pretty good songs.  <br /> <br />John Frusciante does take the lead in the songwriting as he pretty much decided in what direction the songs went. It worked sometimes, then other times it did not. If I heard right, Flea and Anthony is back in control of most of the songwriting duties on their upcoming album that is supposed to come out soon.  <br /> <br />Nice album? Yes. Classic? Eh......
B000AL730Y|1.0|What happened? Did he finally dig into his millions/billions to \\"buy\\" all the reviewers too? C'mon, even snippets will tell you it is more syrupy junk from a true talent that no longer has Lennon to tell him \\"NO\\". Lennon, probably the the best that rock ever had to offer, served as a competition and a sounding board during the Beatle days, and McCartney  grew and basked in that true glory. Since the break-up he has surrounded himself with worshippers that will not tell the emperor that he has no clothes. What ever he once had(the Beatles), he no longer has and is a sad old man. Don't buy the hype OR the disk.
B000068OCS|5.0|Great DVD - I would recommend it for anyone!  We have seen and taped the VHS video since it came out and the tape has since seen its last days.  We just love the DVD!
B00009P1O2|5.0|The newest (2003) release of this show on DVD is extremely well done. The picture quality is a bit pixelated and grainy. Considering it came from an analog tape source that is nearly 20 years old it is still quite good. The sound quality is excellent even by today's standards. They have done a superb job remastering the sound. If you were going to see them in a large arena today this is probably how they would really sound.  <br /> <br />They advertise this is the complete concert, though I was not anywhere near London in 1986 to go to the show so I can't verify that. Most rock bands I have seen perform a bit over two hours so it sounds about right.  <br /> <br />The bonus disc is really neat. It shows footage of the other concert done the night before they taped the main one on the first disc, in pouring rain. Also very good interviews with still living band members and multi-angle goodies.  <br /> <br />The performance of \\"Under Pressure\\" is stellar, as are \\"Tear It Up\\" and \\"In the Lap of the Gods\\" which Brian May remarks on disc two as being their favorite tune to play live. Freddy's vocals on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" are so pure it just gives you chills to listen to it. Other reviews say his voice is not quite up to par in this show but I have to disagree, Freddy is clearly having no vocal issues that I can see.  <br /> <br />I became a Queen fan watching all of my other rock idols perform their songs at the 1992 Freddy Mercury Tribute Concert, which I am sad to say I am old enough to remember watching aired live on MTV, back when they actually played music all the time. Also worth checking out on DVD. I saw Def Leppard cover \\"Now I'm Here\\" and that was it, I was addicted to Queen and started getting their albums.  <br /> <br />Overall this DVD is a rare gem that's well worth the price, I highly recommend to any fan.  <br />
0385513755|5.0|I bought this book for a friends birthday gift, he called me the day he got it to thank me.  The next day he called to say he finished the book because he could not put it down.  He refered to it as a \\"pageturner\\".  The only book he has ever read that he did not put down once!  I think I might ask for it back!!!
B000077VPU|2.0|As a fan of both Queen and the bands that perform at this show I can honestly say this is the worst edition of the concert ever published.     I recorded it when it aired live on MTV, and I'd still have it if my dad hadn't taped over it! They did an absolutely horrid job compiling this show. So much is missing. Robert Plant's oustanding cover of \\"Innuendo\\" is missing, as is Def Leppard's cover of \\"Now I'm Here\\" and Extreme's 15 minute long Queen medley.     I also hate the menu design, it's very difficult to navigate.     On the positive side there are plenty of extra goodies, such as band interviews and all the videos they played on the big video screens in the stadium in between acts.     Overall this is not nearly worth the 20+ dollar price tag.
0375805621|4.0|I haven't been so disappointed in a sequel since I rushed to the Deerfield Multiplex 25 to see the not-so-seminal breakdancing film \\"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\\" And whereas this warmed-over story can only offer up Elmo for added enticement, at least the aforementioned film strove to add a completely unforseen element -- namely, boogaloo.
0345440900|5.0|I appreciated the step by step practical advice on wake up routines, diapering routines, bathing routines, body language guides, cry deciphering and expectation setting.  There is also good advice regarding recommended activities per developmental milestone.  The advice paints a realistic picture of the difficulties of being a new parent with statements like, \\"A first baby is the 'great equalizer'.  No matter how together or successful or in control you've been, newborns place you in the uncomfortable position of being a beginner.  All new parents feel insecure at first.\\" <br /> <br />The book reinforces most of the information I learned from classes at the hospital while also providing a balanced, loving approach to being a role model for your child's daily routine.  If you appreciate Baby Wise scheduling philosophies, this book presents a more loving, instinct focused approach to scheduling.  Tracy goes beyond Eat, Play, Sleep with acronyms like E.A.S.Y (Eat - Activity - Sleep - You Time).  She also discourages jumping in to \\"rescue a child\\" with S.L.O.W (Stop - Listen - Observe - What's Up).  As long as you can get over being called a \\"luv\\", a \\"mum\\" or other British slang, the book is a quick read and worth the time investment.   <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was totally caught up in the beauty and tragedy of the Phantom.  The time flew by and the movie was ending before I was ready.  While I love musicals, I was worried about the operatic setting of the film.  I needn't have worried, the cast was superb.
0142437611|4.0|The two main characters, the father and son, are drawn really well, tragic because they are very different and cant find any common ground. but Wilhelm comes off as the more sympathetic. whoever you are, you must be able to relate. Bellow captures something universal in the earnestness and desperation of this character. Four strars because it wandered in places for such a short book. A good, quick read.
0143034901|5.0|What a beautiful read! This is one of the best reads I have had in a long time. I read the book in two days..couldn't put it down! Not only is the story intriguing,funny,sad....you fall in love with many of the distinctive characters.It is both beautifully written and translated. Every book that I have read since reading this one pales in comparison...both in story line and writing style.....go for it...IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE!
B000AL730O|5.0|I actually thought that Driving rain was very underrated, this is better and I hope that it also sells better. I personally think that the stripped production enhances McCartney's songs and always has from the Beatles onwards. Some classic tunes here and the darker mood and self-depreciation are a welcome addition. It's the way forward for McCartney.
B000AL730O|5.0|Admittedly only on my fourth or fifth listen, this album could easily climb to ten stars on my rating scale by tonight. \\"Chaos and Creation\\" seems to come from a much deeper place in Paul's soul than most of his prior solo efforts. Although he has composed many a masterpiece song on recent efforts such as \\"Driving Rain\\" and \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Chaos\\" bears a continuity that almost suggests that all the songs were written in the same time and place. That is not to say there is redundancy here, the emotions displayed range from hopeful to melancholy, from wistful to angry (yes, angry). The opener, \\"Fine Line\\",  along with \\"Friends To Go\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" grab you pretty quickly with melodic hooks and tight vocal harmonies. In contrast, songs like \\"How Kind Of You\\" and \\"At The Mercy\\", although melodically beautiful, possess an intricacy that requires a few listens before they embed themselves in your mind, but once they do, they are particularly emotionally stirring. Producer Nigel Godrich's approach, at times both lavish and simplistic, has very effectively captured the heartfelt yearnings of this ingenius composer who has experienced such recent loss, and newfound love. There are no attempts to fit into mainstream pop here; McCartney clearly set out to create something true and honest to himself, and this extroversion is further expressed in the instrumental performances, most of which were tracked by Paul alone. Perhaps in an entirely new way, Paul has taken command of the listener's mood, by so expressively converying his own. In a contemporary music world comprised of prefabricated, plastic marionettes posing as artists and bands, churning out recycled carbon copies of the current MTV-approved pop flavor-of-the-week, this wonderful work will go largely ignored by the masses. But for what remains of the marketplace for great songwriting and genuine, original creativity and artistry, 'Chaos\\" is salvation. <br />
B00005QENZ|5.0|Great album not a bad track, but Flesh does sound very similar to Vanity Fares Hitchin a Ride.
B00003CXUM|5.0|\\"It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away.\\"<br /><br />-Opening Line<br /><br />An attractive, slender Asian woman with a striped, fitted 60's collared dress and upswept hair walks in slow motion holding a tiny Convertible-blue thermos by its thin chrome handles, down the street, down the stairs, near you, past you- without a single glance. The street sounds disappear and the only thing you hear is a repetitive, painfully sweet, tango-esque tune that saturates your imagination every time you think of her, every time you see her, every time she walks up and down that long and narrow flight of stone steps. You pass her again-this time it's within the narrow flight of stairs. Today she's wearing a green (but tinted with red) dress cut in the exact same oriental style and has the same blue thermos dangling off of her fingers. You turn towards her as she passes.<br /><br />Set in Hong Kong circa 1960, Wong Kar Wai's story depicts what happens after two individuals find out that their spouses are cheating on them. They engage in a game of role-playing to figure out what prior events could have led to their infidelities, with the intention of constraining physical interaction, but allowing their emotions to explore this intoxicatingly unconventional situation. Consider this one of the greatest movies of all time; if not for its innovative voyeuristic sophistication, at least for its mastery of making simple = more. The texture of this film is palpable for anyone who really knows what it is like to want what you shouldn't have, and purposely not taking what could so easily be yours. I couldn't find a better description than that which is detailed in the leaflet as a \\"claustrophobic romance.\\"<br /><br />On a technical note- its better not to see the deleted scenes in the special features. For anyone who has seen Terry Gilliam's Brazil and recognizes the impact of what an additional 5-second finale can do to the meaning of an entire movie, take my word for it.  In this case, it's desecrating. The less you know about how this movie could have been different, the better. For those of you who are skeptical and are more inclined to watch the special features now, think of Godfather III and try harder to dissuade yourself.  The other special features are good and include a short film tribute to great actors that have inspired Wong Kar Wai, using the \\"happy birthday\\" song from the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, I wanted to mention that there is a scene at the end (which I won't divulge) that is made immensely better if you have a bass speaker in your sound system. It makes a huge difference. It starts at exactly 1:30:00 and involves a great cello orchestral piece, but there is a deep, visceral, drum rhythm that can only be felt with a bass speaker. You won't forget this scene, as it is also a conceptual lead-in to his sequel \\"2046\\", but in particular, you won't forget how you felt while watching/listening to this scene. I don't want to describe it more because its one of those things you just have to try.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|For all of the crap floating around about this album being \\"a letdown\\", \\"disappointing\\", \\"copycat\\" or what have you, I say this.  Stop trying so hard to not like them just b/c of who they are. You don't want to like them because of their madhouse popularity and the fact that the little girlies go screaming over their looks. Suck it up and give these boys the credit they deserve. This album is fantastic and sounds, frankly, like nothing on mainstream radio at this time. The lyrics should be rated up there with Coldplay's, in my opinion. Very intuitive and moving. They hit you at your very core and strike a serious nerve.  Fellas in the band...keep on rocking.
B00005JODA|5.0|Justin Quale (Fiennes) is a mild-mannered British diplomat in the African country of Kenya.  His wife Tessa (Weisz), is an activist that is pushing peoples buttons.  When she turns up dead from an apparent accident, Justin suspects a cover-up.  And there are many questions surrounding Tessa's life that he has.  Was she having an affair with her sidekick Arnold Bluhm (Kound&eacute;)?  What was her obsession with a new TB drug?  And why are his superiors (Huston, Nighy) telling him to let it go?  Justin is determined though, and soon finds himself involved in a mystery that will change his life.<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a slow moving but highly engaging film.  The story is interesting and timely, and provides an insight in to modern day Africa and its politics.  Both Fiennes and Weisz are more than capable in the lead roles, and make the Quales real human beings.  The biggest drawback of the film is the hand-held camera shots that are very distracting from the story.  They almost make you feel more detatched from the story.  That is a shame in a movie that wants you to feel Justin's pain and confusion over the death of his wife.  Fortunately, that is one small aspect of an otherwise excellent movie.
B000AL730O|5.0|It really amazes me how This man...Who has been making music since the early 1960's......Is STILL BETTER than most of the artists out there today! At 63, Paul McCartney has still got it. <br /> <br />\\"Chaos\\" Is an Awesome album. Obviously not Better then \\"Ram\\" or \\"McCartney\\", but damnit, It is good! You'll love every song on this CD. If you're a fan of Paul's \\"White Album\\" Work, Then \\"Chaos\\" is for you.
0515125024|2.0|Lee Child is a good writer, a successful one as well. <br /> <br />That said, 'Die Trying' was an over-written bore. The desciptive passages are so thick  I nearly tripped over them: the weapons, the motivations, the scenery...you name it, Child describes it in detail. Again and again and again. <br /> <br />By the time I got towards the end, I lost all empathy for the characters. I just wanted to know how the pliot was resolved.  <br /> <br />All in all, Child has written more winners than losers. But 'Die Trying' is most certainly in the loser category.
0800177363|5.0|Awakenings is one of the most beautiful movies you will have ever seen. It is a must. Made by Penny Marshall in 1990 Awakenings is based on the acclaimed book and real-life story of neurologist Oliver Sacks. Back in the 1960s, Dr. Sacks preformed some extraordinary work with his patients, who were diagnosed with various mental disorders. In the movie, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (played by extraordinary Robin Williams) refuses to write off the consciousness and humanity of his patients in the mental hospital where he had recently been appointed. <br />Dr. Sayer, a lover of books and music, is an introverted and shy person who is \\"not very good with people\\" and even fears the friendly dog of his neighbor. However, he is an extremely compassionate human being who loves his patients and refuses to accept the previous diagnoses given over many decades to them by their various doctors. Thus, he keeps an open mind and tries new ways to get through to his patients. <br />One day, when he discovers that a new catatonic patient diagnosed with dementia catches up her glasses to prevent them from falling on the floor, he develops the theory that \\"they are alive inside\\". He tried to prove that theory by using a tennis ball to test similar patients who respond in the same way. When he shows his colleagues the patients' strange behavior saying that they were \\"borrowing the will of the ball\\", his colleagues make fun of him and walk away. Supported by his assistant, who shares his opinion, Dr. Sayer continues to follow his intuition and finds ways to get access to these patients through various means including music, a tennis ball, supported walking, stories, games, and patterns on the floor. He discovers that all of the patients with that same pattern of behavior suffer from the same disorder: encephalitis lethargica, which was caused by a virus about three decades earlier. <br />When he discovers that the brain waves of one of his patient Leonard (played by Robert de Niro) respond when hisown name is being called, Dr, Sayer feels his theory confirmed that his patients \\"are alive inside\\" regardless of what his colleagues say. He identifies L-Dopa as a possible new drug to be used in this case although it had been developed for Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, he pursues his boss to approve using the drug on Leonard and when Leonard's mother agrees, Dr. Sayer begins his healing experiment continuing to listen to his inner voice, which seems to dictate him the proper dosage for his patient. He succeeds and one night he wakes up to find Leonard sitting at a desk writing his name. Dr. Sayer continues his quest for healing and manages to bring back to life for one summer all of his patients. After falling in love with the daughter of one of the patients in the hospital, Leonard goes even so far to request his right to go alone for a walk when he wishes to. When his request is denied he becomes very upset and the drug almost stops to have its effect on him. Unfortunately, the drug ceases to work all together after a couple of months and all patients go back to they catatonic state. <br />After noticing that all the news in the newspaper are negative, Leonard calls Dr. Sayer at home late one night. He wants to \\"tell them\\" that they \\"got it all wrong\\", \\"remind them that life is good\\" and that \\"people have forgotten what it means to be alive\\". Leonard points out that those who consider themselves to be healthy live actually in a deep trance and are victims of their self made social hypnosis. Although he lives in a biologically impaired body, which is dependent upon the drug, Leonard displays all the signs of a healthy person and seems more alive than most normal people. He encourages Dr. Sayer to \\"remind them how good it is... People have forgotten about what life is all about\\". In fact, almost all awakened patients show a zest for life and remind the others of the gifts they have and don't seem to appreciate enough. They want to go dancing, be beautiful, eat their favorite meals and connect with each other. They teach the normal people what it really means to have the gift of life. <br />Dr. Sayer shows an incredible love of people especially his patients and remains undisturbed by the ironic remarks of his ignorant colleagues. He pursues his passion and manages to convince his manager and the patrons of the hospital to fund his new research. Dr. Sayer uses his intelligence and sensibility to access the souls of his very difficult patients. He doesn't give up until he succeeds. He is a very compassionate person, who plays the piano as a meditation and relaxation. He continues to grow and is in my view a self-actualizing person. Dr. Sayer believes in the human spirit that \\"is more powerful than any drug and that's what needs to be nourished\\".

B00092ZL80|5.0|These two icons of the last 3 decades have come together for a duo session that is not only great musically, but is produced par excellance. Bright, up front production makes this a totally live experience as if you are 5th row center. Horn sections are not too brassy, and the rythym sections rock with solid syncapation. Tris Imboden carries the Chicago team with power and style and the vocals from both bands meld and fit as if they have done this for years. No song details necessary, you can see the song list. If you love these bands, then this DVD is a MUST.

The impeccable and surprising musical arrangements make of Michael a true living legend, just a few artists know to keep the profile and originality through the time.<br /><br />From Jesus to a child to Careless whispers, there is great blend of known rhythms, and inspired themes that seem to reinvent themselves day after day.<br /><br />Like the Beatles four decades ago, this untiring capacity of self renovation  makes this set remains as true timelessness songs that will reward you by far today and for a long time.<br /><br />That quality that so many seek and just a few can find it is the symptom of genius.

B000050X31|3.0|i think we should all first remind ourselves that the magic flute is about splendor and fantasy; it was written in great part to showcase the spectacular effects of Schikaneder's theatre and the solemn, important rituals of masonry (which was under hard times with the censorship laws of the new emperor). also, any one who has problems with kathleen battle in the title role should put their prejudices aside. the magic flute was written for a *german* company, not for whites or blacks or greens. so certainly, there is no consideration that any singer, no matter what race, should certainly play any of the parts today.<br /><br />having said that, this met performance really falls short on the magic. the sparse staging is reminiscent of boulez's gottendamerung productions, and does not speak clearly to the (possibly) intended parallel of the solemnity of masonry and the starkness of initiation. the scene changes from the mystic fairy tale world where we begin to the temple in egypt, etc -- these changes are not clear from the production. the acting also is quite erratic; the queen does not portray the full dimensions of her character as a woman slighted and forgotten. pamina is not only youthful but childish and shows no strength of the future leader of mankind (remember pa was considered the egyptian deity over the soul, ta the deity over the heart).<br /><br />all in all, this is probably not the first flute you want to watch if you've never seen the opera before.

B00000DCHE|5.0|Billy Joel enjoyed a run of mega hit albums in the late 70's, that capped off with 1980's release Glass Houses (see my review). Songs from these albums; The Stranger, 52nd Street, and the aforementioned Glass Houses became concert staples, yet Billy always included a number of his earlier songs in concert, and as the liner notes state, these songs always enjoyed a great reception.  At this point in his career, Billy was also adament that he was not ready to release a greatest hits album.<br /><br />The solution?, a live disk that would showcase his songs, PRE Stranger album, and he selected songs appropriate for a live reading. As Billy also stated in this albums liner notes he did not inlcude songs that would not \\"translate\\" well in a live setting. This is why Piano Man is not featured here, yet Captain Jack is.<br /><br />The arena impact of Miami 2017, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, and The Ballad of Billy The Kid, balance the intimate environs set for Summer Highland Falls, She's Got A Way, and Your My Home.<br /><br />An added treat from this album was hearing 2 of the songs<br /><br />from the Cold Spring Harbor album (She's Got A Way, and Everybody Loves You Now), since at the point that this disk was released,  those of us lucky to have had a vinyl copy of Cold Spring Harbor had to \\"imagine\\" what these tracks sounded like for real since the pressings of Cold Spring Harbor were recorded too fast and thus Billy sounded in spots like one of the Chipmuncks.<br /><br />The final track is my favorite, and I Loved These Days, seemed to be foreshadowing on Billy's part, that his musical career would take new directions with is next studio album (which it did).
B00005AREQ|5.0|The word above and similar ( e.g. trendsetting, awesome!) has been overused and wasted on artists who lack inspiration/imagination. For me Jeff Beck is as instantly  identifiable as Django Reinhardt.(i understand that Reinhardt was one of Jeffs heroes)There are lots of things that he infact shares with Django e.g. his total nonchalance towards formal musical theory, which in itself makes him fearless and without boundaries.He knows of NO restrictions but also doesn't take his talent too seriously. Another thing he shares is his incredibly good ear for music and his complete unpredictability.   BECK TAKES CHANCES!!  Perhaps his lifelong fascination with fast cars and his near death misses have spilled over into his musical arena?? Whatever.   Whilst other guitarists try and play 30 notes a second Beck can hold one note, bend it, add sustain, feedback & harmonics and drive you to the edge of insanity.  Jeff does use the WHOLE guitar and  if there's one thing alone that really impresses me about Beck is that on every song he changes his guitar tone sometimes after every few bars. In this way his guitar takes on it's own personality and at times it's like six different people having a conversation with you at once. I can't stand it when guitarists use just one tone throughout their whole album(very boring and a waste of the instruments capabilities)   This is a rare aspect. I don't know of anyone else in the rock idiom who can accomplish this...not even Hendrix could go from pure tone to mid range to fuzz to reverb all on one song ( listen to \\"She's A Woman\\"). It's also like a painter using different textures and colours to create a masterpiece.In the early days Les Paul was the only other person to colour his songs with various tones but Jeff has taken it much further.   Personally i didn't know a Strat, Tele or Les Paul could acheive so many different sounds and nuances but Jeff can go from screaming psychosis to lyrically poignant beauty all in the space of seconds.(\\"Constipated Duck\\" is another example).   \\"Freeway Jam\\" became Jeffs anthem and Stevie Wonders song to Syreeta \\" Because We've Ended As Lovers\\" is very popular from this c.d.   There was one tune from this record that i skipped the stylus past when i was a youngster back in 1974 and that was the last track \\"Diamond Dust\\". I preferred to hear Jeff tear down walls with feedback.  Today, as i'm alot older, this song is my all time favourite of Jeffs.   It has to be one of the most haunting and mesmerizing songs ever written.Almost from another Planet. The chords cycle is augmented and  obtuse ..sort of   unresolved in a Stravinsky/George Russell fashion evoking the vision of a real diamond dust sheen across the Austrian Alps. The timing seems to be 6/8 and the song is so complicated harmonically that it would make Thelonius Monk shudder.  If you are looking for the all time best guitar c.d please don't look any further.  But also if you are a drummer you'd be astonished to know that the guy for this session was only 18 yrs old at the time (Richard Bailey). His overall contribution to this classic album is beyond words.   Is it any wonder why this album is still considered to be a landmark even after 34 years?
B000002BE9|4.0|It is a very memorable album filled with emotion and talent all wrapped into one and is done in a different fashion that is indeed Fiona. One thing that always drew me though above all else to Fiona was her voice, deep and so calm. She's someone that is not a dime a dozen in the music business like so many other female singers are, she has her own style, her own voice and I know that is why she is so popular, and that is why she will stay so popular. She is one of the most influential women in the music business and will I'm sure inspire many other women to get serious at music and make the piano their own as well. <br /> <br />This album itself holds many gems on it. But my favorite songs are Sleep to Dream, Shadowboxer, Criminal, Never is a Promise, and Pale September. They all have their own magic, and my ultimate favorite is Sullen Girl- I think the way Fiona sings it and the overall feel of the song makes it amazing. I recommend this album to people who want serious women making music- but if you are looking for talentless tramps like the Pussycat Dolls then go somewhere else.
0553565915|3.0|I recently lost my son and feel a need to read as much as I can on grief and the wonderful home we have to look forward too.  THere are times in this book that you naturally question if her experience happened. It left me skeptical at different points but then I realized the message she gives, the wisdom she gained is still a great piece of hope and encouragement for others. So, whether it happened the way she described is not for me to judge, I did value the nuggets of insight and hope throughout.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|\\"Guilty\\" <br /> <br />The music industry is gouging the public again.   <br /> <br />NOTE: This review has nothing to do with Ms. Streisand, whom I adore.  I don't blame her for these new issues.  In addition, I'll be addressing some issues I have with iTunes. <br /> <br />I'm a ticked about the re-release of \\"Guilty.\\"  Don't people in the music industry know that most people today play their music on their computers, or are they totally out to lunch?  This new disc forces people to buy the second rate recording of \\"Guilty\\" from iTunes - for another 10 bucks - when people such as me already have the new dual disc - and the original vinyl.  This new dual disc will just gather dust and never be played. I don't play my CD's on anything but my computer, just as I don't play my DVD's on anything but my computer.  I say this whole \\"Guilty\\" and \\"Guilty - Revisited\\" (whatever) is a rip.  It's this sort of thing that turns me off certain artists - no matter how much I like them.  I won't be deceived into buying doubles and triples of the same thing - it's insane and greedy - or should I say, \\"Guilty\\" of perpetrating a fraud on the public.  Do these people really need the money that bad?  Let them create an online list of those who own the CD's - with name, address, and phone number, using iTunes legitimate (and legal) customer base. Then give out a key number so customers can record the CD on to their computer, that way they can track the people who pirate.  Stupid maybe, but it could become a solution to ripping off law abiding citizens like me.  I don't want to pay out another 10 bucks to iTunes for a CD I already own - would you - would anyone?  I think not. <br /> <br />And why do they hide other work on iTunes? _  <br /> <br />_\\"Beau Soir\\" which is on \\"Sony Music 100 Years - Soundtrack for a Century\\" is \\"Barbra Streisand.\\"  Indeed, the one and only song from \\"Classical Barbra\\" on iTunes is \\"Beau Soir\\" but it's listed under \\"Various Artists\\" in the classical section.   It's one of my favorite \\"non-pop\\" Streisand albums.  Can iTunes get the complete project?  Probably not.  I have a terminal illness and it's just easier to download music from iTunes.  It's there at my fingertips, I don't have to wait for delivery that takes weeks, or, send someone else to get it and wait for them to come back with the wrong thing. <br /> <br />Why do they release partial albums only? _ <br /> <br />_ Who'd buy a partial audiobook?  Stupid?  You bet.   <br /> <br />Lastly, we should be able to purchase each song of a complete project on iTunes individually (if we chose) not an entire album.  For instance, if I want only \\"Rachmaninov\\" I should not have to buy \\"Beethoven\\" as well just because it's part of the recording.  Again, I'm tired of buying doubles and triples of everything just to get one piece of music to create a library for a certain artist or composer.   <br /> <br />The music industry is now in to gouging everyone - shame on them.  From now on, what I can't get at iTunes, I'm not buying.  If I can't record it to my computer, I'm not buying.  I abide by all laws - I'm not ripping you off, don't rip me off - and don't treat me like a criminal. <br /> <br />My suggestion, don't buy the \\"Dual Disc\\" of \\"Guilty,\\" if all you want is the music.  It'll only P--- you off if all your music is in one easy accessible place - your computer.  These discs even make \\"Windows Media Center\\" useless. <br /> <br />Otherwise, the re-mastered version of \\"Guilty\\" is flawless, but as I said, the disc will just gather dust because I can't record it to my computer - and I'm stuck with the not so great sounding version from iTunes, should I decide to buy it that is - which I probably won't.  I don't need it that badly. <br /> <br /> <br />Thanks for reading. <br /> <br />MusicLover
B0000019PA|4.0|I guess it's not bad. It's like if the devil came up to you and started talking all this jive bout some girl who fell off some burning building and you says \\"devil! What's this got to do with me??\\" And he says to you \\"I own her soul my son\\" and you are just stunned. You're floored at his gall and gumption and the audacity and supercillious manner in which all of Gods creatures love one another forever and ever amen.
B00008DDRX|5.0|The number of films about racing makes a very short list. This emphasizes the cars and not the dialog - an the incredible Porsche 917s at Le Mans. When this came out, it bumped Grand Prix as the best of the type. Also noteworthy is Winning and A Man and a Woman. The recent Driven is just drivel.
0060512806|2.0|I got 650 pages into this blimp and had the same feeling I have when I'm sitting on an airplane next to someone who 1) won't shut up and 2) won't get to the point.  This book is over 1100 pages long with about 400 pages worth of story.  I didn't bother finishing because life is too short to squander on this sort of logorhea.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Ok, I admit, I had some misgivings when I first heard some song samples from this album.  I wondered, \\"where's the guitar?\\" and \\"Has Eric gone soft?\\"  But after buying the album and listening to it more fully my answer would be definitely not!   <br /> <br />Now I'll admit, it's not 'Layla' or '461' or 'From the Cradle'.  But you know what?  It isn't supposed to be!!  Mr. Clapton is not an artist who rests on his laruels.  I'm sick of reading negative reviews from people who expect him to do nothing but play recycled blues standards or solo until his fingers fall off. <br /> <br />This album has a warm, relaxed feeling to it.  Some mistake this for being bland or lazy.  I dispute this on several songs: <br /> <br />1) So Tired-a toe tapping humorous look at family life <br />2) Love Don't Love Nobody-his singing on this song is ridiculous-the Spinners would be proud <br />3) One Day-have you heard the solos on this? <br />4) Run Home To Me-a powerful moving performance <br />5) Lost and Found-for the people who need the bluesy/guitar fix, great riffs <br />6) I'm Going Left-again, very upbeat, I got this one stuck in my head <br />7) Revolution-great groove, EC knows his way around a raggae beat <br /> <br />Has everything EC has tried worked?  No, but while the blues may be his base, he shows his versitility on this record.  He isn't stuck to playing 'Crossroads' or 'Hoochie Coochie Man' 900 times. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton is one of music's greatest contributions.  He continues to do what he feels, regardless of 'popular' opinion.  Stop sometime and listen
B0001AP14E|2.0|This is one awesome CD if you love high pitched vocal samples. He introduces, popularized, and simultaneously wears the ever loving fool out of that little bit of studio wizardry all on this one release.  What's left for the next album?  He could do a sweet chipmunks hip hop album.  I would trade this one for that anyday      But what is up with the SKITS and attempted COMEDY tracks?? Okay who is going to listen to those more than once? SO now you got to press skip 12 times anytime the CDs in.  TO me there is nothing more annoying that that stuff and having to search past it.        What is his message on some of these tracks? Don't go to college?? Okay...not sound advice.    From \\"Jesus Walks\\"  \\"They say you can rap-about-anything except for Jesus  That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes  But if I talk about God my record won't get played, Huh?\\"    --no you can put his name in there, as long as its trite, and MTV/radio will be fine with it considering the context of your body of work (they know its just a cultural nod, not a christian message). Actually they will be quite proud of themselves for giving it so much airtime.         I kept listening to some of the tracks for a while, but eventually I just was turned off by this guy, especially after his hateful attacks on Pres. Bush.  I wish i had not contributed the $12 or whatever to his cause, but it was an impulse buy and i tried to get some enjoyment out of it.    I will admit there are some nice beats and production on this album, \\"Family Business\\" is pretty enjoyable.  He may be more intelligent and insightful than Lil Jon, slightly.
0671027344|5.0|With all the hype about this book I know it may seem cliche to even read it but it's a MUST. This book is recommended by all of your friends for a reason! You'll follow Charlie's life and realize that many of his thoughts are familiar because you've experienced his feelings at one time or another. It also nips at such issues as sex, drugs, music, homosexuality, sexual abuse, friendship, love, and loneliness. This is a book anyone can relate to. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll BE Charlie.<br /><br />This is one of the only books I own (I'm cheap and get everything out of the library) so I obviously own it for a reason. I've read it three times and still counting.
B000AL730O|4.0|The end of the summer 2005 has shown three old legends releasing new albums. Three British greats came back, the 'Stones with a \\"Bigger Bang\\", Clapton with \\"Coming Home\\" and McCartney with \\"Chaos and Creation in The Backyard.\\" All three artists are up there in age and they need no explanation about how great they were in their prime. However, is this new album by Sir Paul worth picking up? Read on. <br /> <br />McCartney is known for his easy craftsmanship of \\"silly love songs\\" and whimsy pop. Fans hoping that Macca returned with a slew of new pop genius will be disappointed. This album is definitely much darker and subdued in tone compared to past albums. The positive, optimistic, romantic that McCartney is takes a backseat as he shows shadows of his former bandmate and friend John Lennon. That means the numbers are more cynical, dark, and introspective than typical of Paul. In his 60's and willing to try something different, it comes across that Paul is looking back at life in a mature fashion. How his analysis of the past comes across is so-so. On some songs, Sir Paul sounds preachy and overbearing. On other songs, the points sound on the money and wise. It's scattered though throughout the disc, and the times where McCartney falls short, he falls VERY short. To not disappoint fans too much, the trademark melodies of McCartney are throughout the disc. That might not make up for the lack of old style pop songs, but it makes it easier to get used to the new sound of this album. <br /> <br />Out of the three albums released from three legends, I'd rank this one at two. I would put The 'Stones new album at one and Claptons at three. Nostalgic music fans (which there are quite a few of on Amazon) will pick this up no doubt, as they will the other two albums. Don't expect legendary material from these legends, as their glory days are long gone, but to see McCartney taking an approach of his old songwriting partner Lennon shows he is still up for a challenge. That's commendable, but long time fans might just want some more pop songs to cleanse their palette.
B000077VT7|5.0|This is an excellent film, well written and acted by all concerned.  The video arrived in fine condition and was most enjoyable.  I would recommend this video and commend the shipping.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I, personally, have seen this particular film two times and found each of them to be highly amusing.  This movie appeals not only to one's Gothic side (as most of Tim Burton's movies do, such as \\"Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Corpse Bride,\\" \\"Beetlejuice\\" (this one especially) and \\"Edward Scissor Hands\\") but also to one's \\"inner child,\\" or (in a more simpler way to put it) his/her imaginative and creative side.   Though the film may not be suitable for children under the age of seven years, (for the naughty children's demises were much more intense and provocative than they were back in the 1971 musical version staring Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka)) it will appeal to all other ages, ranging anywhere from eight years to...  well...  however old you grow to be.  <br /> <br />While on the discussion of comparison between the films, might I point out that the 2005 version follows Roald Dahl's original storyline (with exact quotes and narrations from the book) much more than the 1971 version.  Roald Dahl actually wrote the screenplay for that film, and later confessed that he didn't particularly like how the movie came out.  It makes you wonder if he would be pleased with this later version of it.  Both movies, however, do stray a little bit from the book.  In the 1971 version, Slugworth (Gnter Meisner: Ruby Cairo) (who, in the book, was only mentioned two or three times) had a larger role (or so it seems: watch the 1971 version for more detail) and was actually somewhat of a villain in it as well.  In this newer film, (along side with Willy Wonka's flashbacks) Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore: Finding Neverland) at first declines Willy Wonka's offer because the eccentric factory owner wouldn't let his family come along with him.  In the book, there were absolutely no problems concerning family with either Charlie or Wonka.   Other than that, it proves to be much more suited to the literary audience than the musical version of 1971. <br /> <br />The only setback I can reallysee in this movie, is the mere fact that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp: \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\") plays a part that has great resemblance to music celebrity Michael Jackson, who, from recent course of events, has been deemed mentally unstable and even frightening.  Perhaps if the whole unpleasantness of that media-swarmed trial hadn't occurred, I would have most likely had seen his character as an immature adult who is more than bent on maintaining his childlike innocence and disposition.  Nevertheless, I cannot deny that Johnny Depp portrayed his role perfectly in that film (which, in my opinion, was his best movie (of this nature and genre) since \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl\\" which actaully has a sequel on its way) and you couldn't help but laugh at his various quotes, such as, \\"You, you're Mike Teavee.  You're the little devil who cracked the system.\\" and \\"Everything in this room is eatable. In fact, even I am eatable. But that, my dear children, is called CANNIBALISM, which is in fact frowned upon in most societies.\\" <br /> <br />Moreover, might I point out that I was very impressed with the performances of the new handful of young actors and actresses, who, up until now, had never taken part in an acting career in their lives.  Jordon Fry (Mike Teavee), Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop), and Julia Winter (Veruca Salt) were excellent in their roles as the rotten, bratty children and I am more than certain that we can expect great things from them in the future. In fact, Philip Wiegratz is currently working on two German films, including \\"Wilden Hhner, Die\\" and \\"Es ist ein Elch entsprungen\\" (don't ask for the life of me what those titles mean) and is well on his way to stardom.  <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is among one of Tim Burton's best (and I have seen movies of his that have turned out to be great disappointments, such as \\"Batman Returns\\" and \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" so this was a real eye-opener for me) and I highly recommend it.<br />
B0007Y08QA|4.0|After the disappointing \\"Secret Window\\" and the preposterous \\"Identity\\", I was wary that \\"The Machinist\\" was going to be another lame \\"Oh, it's all in his head\\" psychological thriller. Luckily, I didn't find that to be the case. \\"The Machinist\\" expertly portrays a character that, due to a year without sleep, lives in a world somewhere in between reality and la-la land. He's not so much insane as he is half asleep, and so he's constantly being bombarded with surreal symbols, clues and characters that are trying to push him towards coming to terms with what's causing his self-imposed sleep (and food) deprivation.<br /><br />Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale's weight loss for the role, and for good reason: he looks shockingly emaciated. Aside from his physical transformation, his performance is also pitch perfect. It's also interesting seeing Bale act alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh, who's made a career of doing excellent, chameleon-like work in mostly small films, a path that Bale seems to be following as well. She is also excellent, although it's the kind of role she's played often before and is really kind of wasted in.<br /><br />Is \\"The Machinist\\" the kind of film masterpiece that it would be worth risking your health and starving yourself for? No. But it is an intelligent, moody, creepy and effective film.
B0000027G6|5.0|I am a John Williams fan.  Nothing, in my opinion, beats John Williams.  That is, until I heard the soundtrack from this movie.  For the first time, my complete faith in John Williams was shaken.  There WERE other people out there that could outdo him!<br /><br />John Barry's haunting \\"John Dunbar's Theme\\" and majestic \\"Buffalo Hunt\\" are the main reasons for purchasing this soundtrack alone.  The spirit of the frontier comes magically to life in this wonderful, wonderful piece of work.<br /><br />When this was nominated for an Academy Award, I reluctantly turned away from John Williams' \\"Home Alone\\" and rooted for John Barry...and came away a wiser person.  Though Williams is still at the top of my list, I'll always remember the day that \\"John Dunbar\\" made me think twice.
B000AL730Y|1.0|Paul should stop making music, Its bland and Lifeless junk.<br /><br />This is the worst album i have heard from Paul McCartney
B000067J1Q|4.0|Had to wait for a while for product due to it being out of stock but it eventually came.  Was very happy with it.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Sure, the first two albums may have revolutionized music but where was the music? They had heavy riffery and eerie vocals, but there was a certain something missing. I got it! All-out gutsy rock n' roll. They needed an album with kick-@ss guitar! Each of these tracks are legend:<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1.Hole in the Sky: All-out four minute riffery with screaming Ozzy vocals! Adds a bit of a Zepplinistic atmosphere that makes Sabbath sound REAL LOUD! 10/10<br />2.Don't Start too late: a 50 sec instrumental, I don't rate instrumentals that are under a minute....<br /><br />3.Symptom of the Universe: Although a bit overrated this song is one of heavy metal's most influential riff beats. In fact one time I listened to a GNR song and the first thing I thought was, they got that from Symptom of the Universe. 10/10<br /><br />4.Megalomania: Simply put possibly the greatest f#$%ing Black Sabbath song ever made! Almost 10 min long, you wish it was almost 100 min because of the awesomeness of it all. Ozzy's crazed lyrics and Mad vocals along with Iommi's insane and I hate to say it \\"Jimi Paige is a pansy\\" type of soloing in this track would make the album worth purchasing even if it was $50.00! Rating: are you f#%#ing insane!? I just said it is the greatest f#%#ing Black Sabbath track ever!<br /><br />5.The Thrill of it All: While the intro is heavy midway through you get the feeling that it was leftover material from Sabbath Bloody Savage, which isn't bad I guess. The lyrics are insightful and well-thought out \\"Will you help me Mister Jesus?\\" AHAHAHAHAHA! Ozzy, you are funny! and the all out blues-inspired solo in the middle really creates a great transition after Megalomania. 10/10<br /><br />6.Supertzar: Finally, 3 years after Vol.4 we finally get a good instrumental! No offense but I thought Fluff from SBS was just pointless; but this track is complete with Russian chants, heavy bass, and even meanacing guitar stomps! 10/10<br /><br />7.Am I going Insane(Radio): THis song is making me go insane! In this track you can already see the beginnings of what would influence Ozzy's solo material(even though we know that Bob Daisley wrote most of it, which means he heard this and knows his history!). DO you know how much similarities there are between this track and Crazy Train? THis song is a little overated, but it's pretty good if you got the money. 9/10<br /><br />8.The Writ: Another epic! THis time its 8 min, about a minute and a half shorter than megalomania, this one has none of the gloom but instead has pure bad@ss bravado! The guitars sound like early Rush, which makes this sound amazingly awesome, and Ozzy's heartshaking lyrics and vocals about the nobulls#$t metal rockstar makes this one a Sabbath classic. Instead of Hole in the sky, Symptom or Am I going Insane, it should have been this and Megalomania to go on the most recent greatest hits.<br /><br />Although written in 1975, when problems between Ozzy and BS would not surface for another year, it does give us a view of the future with the instrumental background and Ozzy's lyrics, especially in tracks like Am I going Insane and The Writ. Definitely a best buy for any rock fan.<br />Also I have a ranking system for each album I review in comparison to other albums by the artist. Here is how Sabotage ranks in comparison to other Sabbath material:<br />Black Sabbath:1970-1978<br />1.Sabotage<br />2.Sabbath Bloody Sabbath<br />3.Live at Last<br />4.Past Lives<br />5.Volume 4<br />6.Technical Ecstacy<br />7.Never Say Die!<br />8.Master of Reality<br />9.Paranoid<br />10.Black Sabbathy see the beginnings of what would influence Ozzy's solo material(even though we know that Bob Daisley wrote most of it, which means he heard this and knows his history!).

630522577X|5.0|Great service and recieved product very quickly.  I'm very happy with this seller.
0140277447|3.0|The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang is a good book, containing seemingly well-researched information and raising questions which make you think hard about the planet we live on and the character of the people there - for better or worse. Given that, this book falls into a trap many books detailing tragic moments of history fall into. Namely, the pages begin to say the same thing over and over, each chapter telling the same sordid story the previous one did, sometimes in a slightly different light. <br /> <br />The book stands on it's own as a worthy element in forgotten history. Very reminiscent of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown, the core of this book is well-justified and well-researched, no matter how vehemently modern defenders of those past actions try to proclaim otherwise. The book lends a heavy perspective in one's attempt to try and understand the human mind and how deranged it can be. No matter how low you believe humanity can go, works like this serve to show that it really can get worse. Truly a forgotten holocaust, this book should be required reading for anyone interested in WWII history. <br /> <br />Chang sheds light on this tragedy in wide angles, showing what people during this time period had to endure. It also stands as a sad precursor to the Cultural Revolution that would fill the void of the Japanese after the war ended. Not only for the WWII buff, anyone interested in Chinese history should take the time to read this as well. The information here is well worth the read. <br /> <br />But the book fails to say anything new after the mid-way point. Chang paints a powerful picture in the first half of the book, then runs out of anything new to say. Again, very much like Dee Brown, the book trails on, telling the same story of the same people over and over. Nothing new comes of it, and the book suffers for it. I'm unsure what the point of this endeavor is, other than to drive home an already well-made point. The result is a slow-moving, redundant second half of text. <br /> <br />I don't think the book loses *too* much because of it, but there is an element lacking as the book fades to the end. After the charged beginning, the book soon brought me to a point where I wondered why I was reading any further. I had read and understood the message at the start. But I soon questioned why the same message was being proffered continuously in the following chapters. To boot, the text seemed to become more emotionally charged as the book wore on, and objectivity started to morph into subjectivity as no substantially new information was brought to light. <br /> <br />Those interested in a light read should certainly not pick this up. Those looking to learn something about Chinese History or WWII should. While this is not \\"sleepy afternoon\\" reading material, it's well written and not a heavy or thick book by any means. Chang is a writer who researches the subject very well, as opposed to a historian who wants to be a writer. There's a big difference, and her's is the easier book to read in terms of turning pages. Perhaps her lack of historical objectivity clouds the later part of the book, but overall it's worth the read.
B000AA305M|5.0|It is great to see David Gray back with such a powerful selection of songs especially after the somewhat disappointing A New Day at Midnight. This is a great CD.     Songs range form the ballad Lately to the rocker The One I Love. Now and Always is another stand out with its opening harmonica and piano segues into drums and then Mr. Gray singing in the background. My personal favorite track is Hospital Food. You'll start tapping your toe from the very first note of this one. Hospital Food is also featured on the opening screen for the DVD. And speaking of the DVD the sound quality is far superior to the CD version of the songs. Also the documentary is very interesting.    As to the copyright stuff, well I was concerned about that too but I had no problems uploading the CD to iTunes and then on to my iPod. The only thing I can think of that might be different is that I have a Mac and I assume those having all the problems are on PCs.    But back to the music which is what really matters. The final song is one of Mr. Gray's signature style tunes: somewhat somber, somewhat melancholy and completely haunting that sums up Disappearing World. As the final notes from the piano fade Mr. Gray, as all great artist do, leaves you wanting more. Life in Slow Motion ranks on a par with White Ladder and is a must for your CD collection.
B000002B2X|3.0|This Alice In Chains Album has my favorite Alice In Chains' song \\"Got Me Wrong\\". But, other than that the rest of the songs are average by AIC standards. There is only three other songs by the way one of which, Chris Cornell lends his vocals to. Well, there is actually 5 songs total if you count the ridiculous bonus track complete with fart noises and, other silly sound effects. If, you are a serious Fan of Alice In Chains you should buy this Album. If, you are looking to purchase your first Alice In Chains CD, buy either Jar Of Flies or, Dirt. But, if your looking to buy Sap chances are you already own those two albums.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Five years ago I watched Band of Brothers with a group of friends.  While they watched in rapt attention, eyes fixed upon the screen, I found my mind wandering and bordom setting in.  I was more than content with missing the remaining 9 episodes of the series, opting instead to read in the corner.  Just recently, I decided to revisit the men of Easy Company, this time the the form of Stephen Ambrose's book.  Immediatly I fell in love with the story and the characters, I breezed through the book, hardly able to put it down.  After rewatching the mini-series, I realized what I was to young to realize three years ago, the sheer brilliance of these DVD's.  Just as good as the book, amazing as so many adaptations fall far short of the mark, it is primarily an interesting and heartwrenching series, although very informative as well.  I cannot wait until I can make Band of Brothers part of my permanent collection.
B0000028MA|4.0|This could possibly be the best movie soundtrack ever. With multiple tracks from Chris Cornell and, Pearl Jam and, apperances from other artists like Alice In Chains and, Jimi Hendrix, How can you go wrong? Every SINGLES track is more than listenable.
B000AL730O|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but this is must.  Folks are saying this is Pauls best album since... fill in one of Paul's great albums here, but I disagree I have all of Paul's albums and this is Paul's best album period.  It fits right in with Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, and All Things Must Pass.  Paul is processing a lot of the same issues that John and George were back in the early 70's.  This is the music of Paul' soul.<br /><br />Folks always talk about which album is a bands \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  John had \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" George \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" Sting \\"Soul Cages,\\" U2 \\"Joshua Tree,\\" and Paul has this wonderful album!  This is the deepest we have ever gotten into Paul, and he uses all his vocal and musical skills to take us on a wonderful album long journey with each song adding to the cohesive whole of this gift of an album.<br /><br />Thank you Paul!
B000021XS0|5.0|I know that maybe youre too young or think by naming bands you will get a hardcore image but my advice is that you listen to the album and you will see that Dream Theater is a band that needs not have to growl or sing relentlestly in a violent manner to be good because this band is awesome. Hell, this band serves as a good reminder to all rock bands that can play each and every instrument and have a great singer and write good, top notch music. Buy or download them and see that metal has many faces and can have poor and greats at the same time.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|There were way too many pointless and utterly unrealistic action sequences and not enough plot development. It felt like it was just thrown together, as it hardly made any sense. The CG is very nice to look at, and the music was good, but that's about all AC has going for it. Save your money.
B00006CXSS|5.0|VERY WELL DONE!!! AS CLOSE TO REAL LIFE AS YOU ARE GOING TO GET!!!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I never saw this film in the theatre, but watching on the DVD player with a very good sound system is a blast. <br />The whole scenario is scripted for fun, and probably thats where the issue lays  for some critics... but they never seem to like the family fun movies anyway :-) <br />As for the hard to believe  parts... this is a film, its meant to be fun and a nice way to escape day to day things. However, one thing that makes the action sequences more believable is that the plot point that the guys are ex-Navy Seals is established virtually  immediately; thus the amazing physical action is easily justified. <br />Anyways, Just like the wonderful NATIONAL TREASURE, its a nice way to while away some time, and have some fun. It's an 'A' Grade ( or B Grade, depending on your view) piece of fun and action. It has just about every conceivable set piece in the action Lexicon without the gross out factor that some action films have. So if you have issues about what the Family can watch, well this is both very Family friendly, and enough to satisfy any action fiend. If McCounaghy[sp?] is trying to establish a Dirk franchise, well I hope he succeeds because this is a gem. <br />ENJOY
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Everything went as planned.  I paid, I got my stuff, and it was in good shape - end of story.  Quick and hassle-free.  Thanks!
B000AL730O|5.0|I am a huge Beatles-McCartney fan like so many hear and I'd like to respond to the repeated listening theory. <br /> <br />The first time I heard it, I wasn't blown away. And yes, these songs really grow on you after repeated listenings. <br /> <br />I somewhat agree with the idea that an album should only be heard the first time to know if it's worth anything. <br /> <br />There is a flip-side to that theory. Many artists, including Paul, have put out albums that NEVER sound good after repeated listenings. This album really does get better as you listen. <br /> <br />In typical Paul form, he has an unbelievable way of arranging his melodies that really grab you. English Tea, is a great song reminiscent of Paul's ability to write any type of music he wishes. Most would dismiss this song as quirky crap but that's Paul's style! Face it, many Beatle songs were quirky and childish but nonetheless, are classics. A good song is a good song no matter what category you place it in. <br /> <br />The 2-note chime in Riding to Vanity Fair haunts the crap out of me! I can't hear that song enough. <br /> <br />Fine Line is a good song. Even if it's all over those Lexus commercials. <br /> <br />Most of the album is very listenable but I do wish there were more rockers. Run Devil Run, mostly covers, really shows how great a rock voice McCartney has had for over 40 years. The man is unbelievable in that area. One of music's great \\"rock screamers\\". <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this album to any Beatles-Paul fan. If you're not a big fan, you may find this album somewhat boring.
0312965788|5.0|There's an irony in the fact that this book I always found so calming and happy, that made everything on earth seem perfectly all right to me whenever I read it during bad times or good, is actually set during an era when trouble was brewing in Europe and the Third Reich was on the rise, destined to end this wondrous little world forever. That fact aside, I love this book. It is plainly magical. The stories here about James Herriot and his life as a rural veterinarian in 1930's Yorkshire radiate joy. Herriot knows how to tell a heartwarming, funny tale, but he never lets us forget that a country animal doctor's life is hard, sometimes tinged with sadness, and that even in a lovely place like the farming midlands tragedy is never far away. He practices veterinary medicine in a small town and out on the little family farms that dot the dales. His boss Seigfried (later his partner) and Seigfried's jovial brother Tristan work beside James as they answer midnight calls to birth calves, stitch up injured sows, and partner with the local farmers to keep England's agricultural concerns feeding the nation. Around these duties, James has assorted adventures and is a time or two lead astray by the charming, well-meaning but definitely problem-prone Tristan, who with his skirt chasing and love of the odd pint is perpetually in danger of flunking out of vet school. These lovable men allow us to come along as they mingle with some of the most amazing characters ever seen in fiction. They work with farmers who live in such isolation they have in some cases never been five miles from their own homes, and Herriot's prose celebrates their glorious idiosyncrasies. The vets are also cared for by the stern no-nonsense Mrs. Hall, whose stoical outer features hide a heart of gold within her gray-haired workaholic frame. This novel, set over about two years at the very end of the 1930's always brightens my day. It makes me wish things were still like that somewhere in this world today. (And that I could go there.)d that I could go there.)
0060763280|2.0|A lot of mlm hype - certainly not the realities discussed in more thoughtful books like Millionaire next door and Millionaire Mind.
0571202284|3.0|First gripe is this book is only about cell animation, I suppose is an abstract way it would be help full to \\"Computer, Games, Stop Motion, and Internet Animators\\", but practically speaking there isn't much here that would help.<br /><br />Second, more of a tips and ideas book, calling it a 'survial kit' is melodramatic. It is a bigger, more expensive version of Prestion Blair's book 'Cartoon Animation' so if you have that one, you will be getting double of the same info.
0671027387|2.0|As an engineer currently working for NASA, and as a former Lockheed Martin engineer, I found parts of the book sadly laughable.  Dan Brown should stick to writing about historical things instead of trying to be the next Tom Clancy.  Even Clancy occassionally gets it right.  The editors should be fired for gross stupidity as well.
0786860707|4.0|if you are only interested in a how-to book, because that's not what its intended to be, especially now with cell animation being pushed out by CG. What it is a history of Disney even down to the everyday details of the process that created the movies we only know as the final production.   If you want a book, that will help you expand your 'creative thinking' and give ideas about building concepts, then you should find this book to be helpfull.
0735619670|5.0|This is the first non-programming-language book I have read during my career as a Programmer and I really lucked out. This is a book all beginning programmers should read to give them an expansive base of understanding about the full scope of code construction. Practices which I have learned and applied through journeyman-type education are fully explained and out-lined in this text. The text is well-written and easy to read, and possesses a wealth of other resources and references to allow you to continue studying any of the many topics discussed. For clarification, though, this is not a code-reference book, and while giving many excellent examples of the techniques applied, with not give you any language specific syntax or rules.
B000062YAZ|1.0|I hate to inform all of you Slayer fans out there, but you have been duped. I just went out and purchased Reign in Blood for the used price of $8.50 at a music store approximately 25 miles from my house, popped it into my car stereo, and by the time I had reached my home the entire 28 odd minutes of shat had already played through and I had already broken it and tossed it out the window. I don't usually write reviews unless I have found a band that is very, very good. But in this case, I will make an acception and write this review for a band that is very, very bad.  <br /> <br />First off, there is nothing that makes Slayer any different than bands of today like Slipknot, or Mushroomhead. I don't care if these guys are the inventors of thrash metal, or they are the \\"best thrash metal band\\" on the planet. This stuff blows. If these guys are the best thrash metal band on the planet, then what do you call bands like The Crown? Or even older Metallica, or Megadeth. I am not the largest fan of Metallica, but at least their stuff is bearable. And Megadeth has far superior musicians. Slayer is an image people, and you have bought it hook, line and sinker. The hype surrounding these guys is asinine. And what they deliver compared to what their hype would have you believe they are capable of is laughable. The one high-point is their drummer (Lombardo) who, for whatever reason, has decided to stay stuck with this group of talent-less losers. But the album is so repetetive, and short, that his drumming is overshadowed by the absolute garbage that permeates this album. In short, if you have heard one Slayer song, you have heard them all. Let me suggest something to you people. If you want good thrash metal, get Metallica, or Megadeth, or the Crown. If you want good metal period that literally blows this stuff out of the water, go get any of Opeth's albums other than Damnation. Slayer is for losers who think Satan, and the evil are cool, and will save them from their lives of unhappy meanderings in their trailor park homes.
0385338686|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it. As usual,Sophie Kinsella does a great job with this book. You won't be disappointed.
0670877050|1.0|I was so, so looking forward to reading \\"Little Women\\" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age.  I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.    Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).    That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book.  Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.      Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!    I feel completely conned.  It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition.
0393316041|5.0|Hilarious and trgaic. Feynman was a unique amalgam of geniuses: a genius of a physicist, a genius at amusing himself without regard to the restraints usually put on us, a genius at living and a genius at conveying the essence of joie de vivre. I could not read this book without feeling that I was a party to each of his joyous and each of his tragic episodes. In the end I took his death personally. What a man. What a read!
B000AL730O|1.0|Although apparently every PR flack will take his call, the Muses won't anymore. Good lord, all you Kool-Aid drinkers: we can listen to the samples here and tell how much this one stinks!! <br />Also, as a free clue as to whether to believe a McCartney album review here, look for the word \\"Macca.\\" Macca = written by a hack-a. If not straight from the record company, then the reviewer is badly addled by BM. (Beatlemania) Let's lick BM, and all avoid this further road apple produced by one of the greats.
0451169514|5.0|There are already a ton of reviews for this book here, so I don't think I'll waste your time with another plot summary.  This book made me cry.  It was humbling.  Humbling because of its sheer size, humbling because of the intensely moving humanity of the characters, and humbling because of the grace and eloquence of this coming-of-age tale.  Yes, IT is a horror novel.  It will keep you up at night, and you will perhaps be appalled by some of the atrocities committed during the course of the story.   <br /> <br />But IT is also a novel of deep truth and understanding.  In IT, King has crafted some of the most detailed and wonderful characters I have ever seen.  A blurb on the first page states that \\"It feels like you're reading about yourself,\\" and this is not far from the truth.  IT will draw you in and keep you captive to its believable and fantastic world.  The book is over 1000 pages, but you won't notice it.  And when it's over, you'll miss it and it will stay with you for a long time.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|There's a lot about this CD that reminds me of Brian Wilson's epic \\"SMiLE\\": it's an ambitious, lushly-produced project with Broadway-musical structure, intricate orchestration, gorgeous harmonies and choral vocals.  And it's at times either precious and child-like, or a bit overblown.  But that's part of its charm.  Sufjan Stevens has a knack for a beautiful melody and for clever, if offbeat, lyrics (a sympathetic portrait of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, for instance).  He also has probably the longest and strangest collection of song titles in pop music.  Listening to this concept album, the second in his series of state-themed projects (the first was \\"Michigan\\"), I also hear echoes of the quirkier songwriters of pop -  Frank Zappa, Rufus Wainwright, They Might Be Giants, and Brian Wilson's collaborator, Van Dyke Parks - good company, indeed.  His arrangements also evoke the influences of psychedelia and Philip Glass.  But out of all this comes a unique and original vision.  \\"Chicago\\" is probably the centerpiece of the album, but there are a lot of individual songs worth returning to, such as the beautiful opening track, \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting near Highland, Illinois\\", and the anthemic \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!\\" (I warned you about the titles.)  The songs relate incidents in the state's history, great and small, and native sons both famous (Abe Lincoln and Carl Sandburg) and infamous (Al Capone and Mr. Gacy). But I doubt you'll hear any of them performed at the Illinois State Fair.  The bottom line is, it's one of the most interesting and original musical offerings of the year, and though at over 78 minutes it seems a bit longish, it is worth your time and attention.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|Living through the 70s disco, 80s new wave and the 90s... well, the 90s weren't very memorable.... Damien Rice is a talent that comes through once a decade.  His music is pure and unadulterated.  Maybe it's because I'm a little older, and MAYBE a little wiser.  You sorta get tired of the empty shell songs that the mass-market, cookie cutter teen bands sing.    This is not a self absorbed, pretentious folksy album that some artists put out.  You cannot help but feel that angst.  Every track is personable, well written and beautiful.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I love this movie.  Each time I watch it, it brings tears to my eyes.  It touches my spirit, my soul, and my journey.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Michael Buble hits the big time with It's Time.  It's a strong mix of standards, rock and pop songs.  He shows he's equally as comfortable belting out a classic standard like \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" as he is singing the Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\".  Rather than giving the pop songs the lounge lizard treatment, they have tight and thoughtful arrangements and Mr. Buble sings them with a subtlety or flourish they call for.  \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\" & \\"How Sweet It Is\\" show this perfectly as he captures the soul of the songs but adds a big band feel.  \\"Song For You\\" has a vibe that feels if you are hearing it in a smoky jazz club.  The closer, Stevie Wonder's \\"You & I\\" is the best track on the album as Mr. Buble gets inside the track and gives an emotive performance.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|the second part in this story is about bourne getting mistaken for killing two men in berlin during a deal gone bad of sorts and his having to run from the bad guys wanting him dead.we also get to see bourne recovering some of his memory from the past,in which he hasn't been able to recover much in the 2 years spent in india with his girlfriend.although this isn't as good as the first one, it still is a good action film.made mostly quick pace thanks to quick cut editing and some of the best car chases put to film.damon of course reprises the role and franka potente reprises her role as marie,briefly.eventhough she is not in the movie for long,unfortunately,her role has alot to do with bournes character development and the story in general.but the story itself isn't as good nor as interesting as the first.the other big star in this is joan allen and she deserved a better acting role to showcase her talent.julia stiles also reprises her role but it is minimal.all in all this is still a good action packed film.
0895260131|5.0|Unlike some of the reviews here, Spencer doesn't shy away from some of the atrocities commited in the name of Christ, such as some of the Crusaders. Obviously, some of the reviewers here haven't read this book, nor have they read other Spencer books. Spencer also helps to distinguish between the two religious traditions, emphasizing that, while Just War is needed to protect Western culture, atrocities done in the name of Christ are in disobedience to Christ and his teachings, while atrocities down in the name of Islam are in complete obedience to Mohammed's teachings. Perhaps that is why the Crusades lasted 200 years, while jihad in the name of Allah has lasted approximately 1500 years. Perhaps Muslims need to keep this comparison in mind - 200 to 1500, I do believe that is 1300 more years of jihad than the Crusades - when pointing fingers. <br /> This book is loaded with facts, such as the fact that the mosques were built copying the style of the churches in Europe, although they are rounded. Other things are debunked when Islamic historians try to build up their culture as contributing to world progress. The last time I checked, women didn't have a whole lot of rights, so I'm impressed, but I didn't need Spencer to tell me that. <br /> Spencer chucks fact after fact after fact in this book. A must read, especially since everyone will be confronted with a belief system that is anathema to Western culture and is a threat to it. <br />
B000AADYYO|3.0|Now take that as you will, since Opeth is a band of extreme quality. I know a lot of us were a bit aprehensive about this album, with Opeth snowballing into this giant metal mammoth whom everyone who knows anything about metal has heard, and the signing to Roadrunner (same label as the plague known as Nickelback). Thankfully, nothing too drastic has happened because of this in terms of Opeth's songwriting.  <br /> <br />The album opens with Ghost Of Perdition, which is to my ears the most consistently good track on the album, and fits right alongside other later-day Opeth album openers such as The Moor, The Leper Affinity, and April Ethereal (well.. you know what i mean). With a strange \\"happy\\" jingle of a melody early on, a lot of people were eager to cry SELLOUT which is absolutely rediculous, as though Opeth was never allowed to have fun and lighten up the music from time to time. I like it. Reminds me of a Glad Clingwrap commercial, or the new Dirt Devil ON SALE NOW AS SEEN ON TV... ahh... anyway, from there comes one of my favorite \\"moments\\" of the album, and that's the cadence to the clean section of the song, with an absolutely gorgeous vocal melody backed with the acoustic Opeth sound we've grown to love. So good. Now on to the bad stuff...  <br /> <br />Besides this opening song, the album lacks the consistency of greatness typical of Opeth. The songs have \\"boring\\" sections, and the pieces don't seem to take you somewhere like they did (especially) on the first 3 albums. Too flat and samey throughout. Many fans felt a bit unstatisfied with the previous 2 Opeth albums, Deliverance & Damnation, and indeed something DID seem to be \\"missing\\", particularly with Deliverance. The riffing style changed from a multilayered, subtley dissonant and harmonized sound into a more straight forward power chord festival. Now i don't know about the rest of you, but i liked it more when Opeth's guitar parts sounded unique. I was also hoping they would leave behind this sound and go back to something that was more \\"them\\", akin to MAYH or Still Life. Unfortunately, this syncopated, chug-chug-chug riffing is back and nearly as prominent as on Deliverance. I guess some people like that sound, but i'd prefer to let the 45467678964 other bands doing it continue on, and Opeth do something not so \\"regular\\" with the guitarwork. Luckily, this isn't always the case, but they resort to the \\"chug chug\\" far more often than i would like. <br /> <br />Besides the opening track, there are other Highlights to the album. The middle section of Harlequin Forest is as beautiful as anything Opeth has done, though the song does drag in a lot of places. There's the closing track as well which is definitely a great \\"clean\\" song. There are other experiments on the album (Atonement, which is unlike anything they've ever done, almost middle eastern in feel, as well as Beneath The Mire's proggy carnival first half) and they come off rather well, but i still can't help but feel \\"unmoved\\". Opeth used to bring me to my knees with the beauty they could create. Now granted, my tastes have changed, and it may well be ME that is the problem, but it seems to me that this album was more going through the motions than creating something forever memorable and moving. <br /> <br />All in all, this isn't a bad album, and i'd say maybe a little better than Deliverance, but it ranks in the bottom half of the Opeth catalogue. It's definitely not a sellout album, and Opeth's integrity hasn't changed at all. The band is trying a few new things while keeping the sound they've essentially kept the same since MAYH. Unfortunately for me, it feels as though these little experiments didn't pay off when it comes down to it. I'll take my Ghost Of Perdition, but the rest... meh. I've got the first 5 Opeth albums to keep me happy. Honestly, i don't see Opeth ever reaching that level of brilliance again anyway, no matter what direction they take. <br /> <br />PS: All you new fans need to stop ignoring Orchid and Morningrise... easily among the best Opeth has ever done, just very different in approach.
B000AL730O|5.0|I think this is classic Paul.  Beautifully produced.  Songs are tight and melodic.  Excellent!!
B000002L9J|5.0|Hard to believe that it has been nearly 20 years since this was first released.  I remember buying the day it hit the shelves, rushing home with that big piece of vinyl(!) to give it a listen.  Several of my friends joined me and when the first play was over we KNEW that we had just been a part of something special.   <br /> <br />New to The Smiths?  This is the place to start.  If you don't like it, then simply put The Smiths are not for you. <br /> <br />Flawless.
B000AL730O|4.0|The new macca cd is just fine and reflects where he is in his life. I knew when I bought it, it wouldnt be rock n roll and the interviews with him indicated as such, its a mature, introspective pop album, maybe some of the songs arent genius, but they are well done and nigel godrich made him work hard for the sound on the cd.He demonstrates again how versatile he is playing most of the instruments on the cd and his voice is fine almost melancholy at times to fit the mood of the songs. Im not saying its his best cd, but its a nice change of pace for him and solid proof that he still can deliver a quality product and take chances musically by working with a different and current edge type of producer who wouldnt just be a yes man with him in the studio. The songs dont all jump out at you at first hearing but grow on you as time goes on. A great start for him before his big tour gets underway. willie.
B00009Z574|3.0|I have to agree with Wakeman on this one. It is by far the worst album Yes made in the seventies (only surpassed by \\"Onion\\" a few years later.) Yes has been my favorite band since the early 70's, but I rarely listen to this album. Get this after all the other great 70's Yes albums.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|I have had myriad grateful dead albums and live cds and tapes come through my possession over the years.  As an indie-rock fan and musician I'm supposed to be ashamed to say that. (!)  Listening to the dead was, however, years ago, my window into the world of country, folk and bluegrass.  Thankfully! <br /> <br />I also know a thing or two about Whiskeytown and have heard a smattering of Ryan Adams' solo stuff, accidentely saw him live a few years back in Texas... <br /> <br />Anyway.  I must say, I'm a bit baffled as to why the Dead-like artwork, the roses and dancing bears, the \\"Magnolia\\" reference.  So he likes the dead?  Good for him.  It makes me uncomfortable from the start, though, that he's appropriated bits of their iconography for \\"Cold Roses\\".  It makes me highly suspicious.  Yes, it gives me the creeps. <br /> <br />This is, however, clearly an \\"alt-country\\" album.  There are a few songs (soloing in \\"Easy Plateau\\", \\"Rosebud\\", some whole-band riffs in \\"Magnolia Mtn.\\", the \\"High Time\\" & \\"Wharf Rat\\" references in \\"Cold Roses\\" for instance) that seem to bear any MUSICAL resemblance to the dead, and it's strange because they seem grafted artificially onto Adams' alt-country sound, like, oh, i dunno, like a 12-year-old kid in 2005 trying to look casual wearing a Led Zeppelin 1972 tour t-shirt.  <br /> <br />LYRICALLY?  I'm not sure, I find it difficult to dip my toe into that pool when lyrics like  <br />\\"She rattles my cage like a thuderstorm\\"  <br />cloyingly jump out at me.  There may, conceivably, be some tributes to Robert Hunter in there but the water's too cold for me.  Why, I wonder.  Why? <br /> <br />Think about Elvis Costello's \\"King of America\\" album.  In it he paid tribute to all that was \\"Americana\\" in music to him.  \\"Costello does America\\" made a lot more sense than \\"Adams does The Dead.\\"  You're much better off not thinking too much with this record, though.  It seems to beg to be part of your cross-country car trip. <br /> <br />Looking through these reviews I was surprised how long it took before I saw that someone wrote this: <br />\\"It's like someone sucked all the spooky ethos out of Chris Isaac and shoved a lap steel player into the studio with him.\\" <br /> <br />Funny!  I was playing this album and my girlfriend walked into the room and, after listening for a spell, said \\"Is this Chris Isaak?\\"  And on at least half the songs, boy do I hear Isaak's voice!  Is that how Adams sounds on his other albums?  I hadn't noticed it before. <br /> <br />I want to like this album, and I'd agree with many that it should be a single-disc, ~12 song album.  It could be pretty strong.  The playing is solid and effective throughout.  I disagree with those who say it's overproduced.   <br /> <br />Is Ryan Adams one of those good-looking confident guys from high school who write terrible poetry but deliver it with such earnestness that all the girls swoon?  Discuss.
B00006X06U|5.0|This is a beautiful, lush, moving album - double CD -22 songs covering her whole career -orchestrial and jazzy simultaneously with Joni's vocals sounding warm and smoky. Her best record since Don Juans' Restless Daughter in my opinion. Beautifully packaged with separate lyric booklet and photos of Joni's artwork. <br /> <br />
B000005YZM|3.0|Penchons-nous sur le cas des Zombies, et de leur mythique Odessey & Oracle, dont la cote a atteint des sommets inous en ces pages, la plupart des commentaires se rsumant  d'excessifs pangyriques. <br />Tout d'abord, cet album et le groupe plus gnralement, ne sont pas rellement oublis. Leurs premiers singles ont connu de belles carrires dans les charts anglais et US, et Time Of The Season, que j'ai entendu sur la bande-son d'un pisode de Friends, s'est propuls n1 des classements en 1969 ( titre de comparaison, l'unique single des mythiques Rotary Connection s'est class 96me pendant 2 semaines... msaventure dont Free Design, Eternity's Children, Euphoria et beaucoup d'autres... ont galement t les victimes) <br />Et la musique dans tout a ? Soyons honntes et objectifs : c'est assez ingal. En fait, les Zombies, c'est gnial quand Colin Blunstone - un des plus dlicats falsettos de la pop music,  peine troubl par un voile d'une dlicieuse raucit - interprte les titres crits par Rod Argent. Care Of Cell 44, Rose For Emily et Hung Up On A Dream sont d'authentiques chefs-d'uvre servis par des mlodies indiscutables et des harmonies radieuses, et si l'on devine ici ou l les grosses ficelles (couplets en \\"question - rponses\\", refrains, ponts... qui se succdent de faon immuable, voire scolaire), on a affaire effectivement  quelques-unes des plus belles pices de pop orchestrale de l'poque. <br />Mais le talent de Chris White, le deuxime songwriter du groupe, est un peu plus alatoire : si This Will Be Our Year et Friends of Mine (avec son intro chipe au Wishyouawish des curieusement oublis Hollies) sont indniablement les meilleures contributions de ce dernier, Maybe After He's Gone, Beechwood Park, Brief Candles sont beaucoup moins convaincantes, avec leurs vocaux mal assurs et les mlodies qui se cherchent. Mais le \\"sommet\\" reste le trs laborieux Butcher's Tale (que la maison de disques, dcidment peu inspire, avait dcid de sortir en single !) o le pauvre Chris White chante presque faux, et manque littralement de s'touffer dans l'ascension du refrain !! <br />Et l'album se clt avec le tube Time Of The Season, qui en dpit de ses nombreuses qualits, me laisse malgr tout un got amer tant certains passages sonnent comme une relecture habilement dguise de Stand By Me de Ben E. King : ligne de basse, percussions organiques, mlodie, les ressemblances sont troublantes ! <br />Un album qui possde donc de trs bons moments, quoiqu'un peu surestim, et qui peut constituer une excellente introduction  la dcouverte de tous ces disques plus ou moins oublis de cette priode dore de la musique.
0312117337|4.0|Osho speaks in a clear voice both in the books of his teachings and in this special deck.  I've been a tarot reader for 20 years and this is the one deck I \\"Trust\\" with totality.

The spirit of the beloved Master Osho comes through these cards.  I have more responses from people I read for than any other deck I have worked with in my years of reading.  Other decks are nice, but with the spirit of Osho still being so fresh in the world today, and with his voice being so original and alive (compared to most cards of the past where the authors have already left the realm of spirit), well I now start out every reading with this deck and often only need this deck to amaze and delight the person I am reading for.
0694003611|5.0|When I first read this book I thought it was sort of dull, but my kids without fail have loved it and it has become their favorite (I have 4 children). Also as I have read it over and over, and over I have noticed some of the nice touches in the book like the little mouse that moves from place to place (kids like to find that as they get a bit older) and the fact that the bears on the chairs have a picture on the wall that is the same as.. well I won't give it away. Margaret Wise Brown created a treasure when she wrote this book. Start them off with books like this and then when they get older move them onto Roald Dahl, you won't go wrong.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I will begin this review backwards, beginning with my recommendations for purchasing the album: If you love ( ) or Agaetis Byrjun, or even Von, buy Takk now. You needn't waste your time reading this review, since Takk falls from the same tree as the other albums. However, if think you might need convincing, read on.<br /><br />Takk is, like any good artistic progression, a little bit of everything that came before it - and is, as a result, more than the sum of its parts. In it are traces of Agaetis Byrjun's grandoise theatrics, ( )'s minimalistic song structures, and Von's ambient washes of noise. Yet out of the general mish-mash of trademark Sigur Ros elements comes a unique energy.<br /><br />If nothing else, Takk is certainly the most positive Sigur Ros album to date, with lots of uplifting, innocent, feel-good melodies and sweet chords. Se Lest is a slow-building, refreshing walk in the park with a very well-adjusted vibraphonist. Milano is so uncharacteristically upbeat, it's almost in bad taste. However, Jonsi's voice still manages somehow to deliver without a hint of self-irony.<br /><br />To those who might miss the funeral dirges of ( ), all is not lost - Takk still retains a deep meloncholy edge, you just have to listen a little harder for it. Undertones of bands like Mum and Mogwai run through the veins of this album, and anyone who has listened to the Finally We Are No One album will be having flashbacks of the land between solar systems by the time Takk stops spinning. Glosoli is like Untitled 4 meets Svefn-G-englar, but also bears a striking resemblance to \\"Hurt\\" by Nine Inch Nails in many ways. Following that is the old-age nostalgia of Hoppipola, which shares vibrations with the eqaully haunting Vithrar Vel Til Loftarasa (also known as \\"good weather for an airstrike\\") from the Agaetis Byrjun album. Gong has a dark and oddly aggressive energy to it, possibly magnified by the frenetic drumwork... in fact, the drumming on this track is probably only matched in difficulty and intensity in the band's catalogue by Untitled 8 (or \\"popplagith\\" in case you'd like a handle to go by.)<br /><br />One distinguishing feature of Takk in Sigur Ros's discography is how seamlessly many of the songs run together; ( ) had this as well in many spots, but that was probably more due to the incredible length of the songs than anything. Here, it is very obviously deliberate, and it works for the album instead of against it in this case. Much of the first 4 tracks on the album go at the same tempo and even have the same drumbeat. Meth Blothnasir is basically a two and a half minute alternate ending for Hoppopolla, retaining many of the same harmonic and melodic principles of the previous song. From there the album seems to develop in specific directions from song to song, making Takk very much a single listening experiance.<br /><br />And from this very same praise comes the section of this review I was dreading... my criticisms. Yes, I can gush all I want but that doesn't make Takk a perfect album. On the individual song level, Takk is probably weaker than both Agaetis Byrjun and ( ). The songs are hugely satisfying but after repeated listens you might become irritated that, for instance, Milano is basically two very long intros and two very long outros. This doesn't go for every song on the album, of course, but in general these songs fare best in an album context.<br /><br />The album is also suspiciously devoid of many really impactful melodies. Jonsi's voice is incredible on this album, perhaps the best it has ever been on tape, but the directions his melodies take are pretty predictable in many cases (again, a generalization not meant to encompass the entire album.) This is a small complaint and is by no means a reason to even consider not buying this album, but just the same the melodic content of Takk is at least noticeably a bit weaker than on the last couple albums.<br /><br />And we come to the end of Gong, a song that beatsmy no-melody claim into the ground, drifting off on the last few songs, perhaps back to sleep where we came from. And in the end, that's really what this album is: a nostalgic dream of something you perhaps experianced as a child, or in another life; who knows for sure, but it feels just enough like home to make you happy and uncomfortable at the same time. But it's time to sleep now, thus bringing my verbose rantings to a close.last few songs, perhaps back to sleep where we came from.

B000002GFT|5.0|Fairport Convention was absolutely one of the best of the British folk/rock groups, and they had perhaps the best female vocalist you'll ever hear in the late and great Sandy Denny. Her voice was just so beautiful, and the \\"Liege & Lief\\" album is one classic from that late 60's/early 70's era. All the songs on this album are great, my favorite happens to be \\"Tam Lin,\\" which has a great rocking sound with excellent guitars by Richard Thompson. The fiddle work on this album is outstanding as well, and some say that this is not their best effort and work, but I would have to hear the other Fairport Convention albums to be the judge on whether or not this great album is the best of what they did, but all I have left to say is that this is a truly great album, and it's worth getting if you've never heard it, or you're just getting into the British folk rock music, and there's literally dozens of other outstanding groups similar to Fairport Convention, but they would have to be up their on the top of the list as the best, or one of the best for sure.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|There are albums you like, and then there are albums that you play so much that if anyone were around, they would beg you to play something different. This is likely to become one of those. Visceral, punishing rock and roll. Nobody has ever made an album like this one.<br />A few words about the Funhouse box set, since Amazon doesn't even list it. It is called 1970: The Funhouse Sessions. It is a seven disc set, containing everything the Stooges laid down for the Funhouse album. It was made by Rhino Handmade and is now ridiculously out-of-print. I managed to stumble across it used somewhere, so I'll provide a little low down. It is great, but it is truly only for the DEVOTED Stooges fan. Basically, every song's multiple takes fill up a single CD.  It is an amazing fly-on-the-wall experience to hear the Stooges work out each track. The little one-off ideas that they throw to the side would be genius on anyone else's album. Most people couldn't make it through a CD and a half of \\"Loose\\", but I'm just that mad. But it can be worth it (I'm listening to the \\"Loose\\" CD as I'm writing). You fall into this kind of trance. And by take 28 of \\"Loose\\" (yeah, 28), which was the keeper, the band have honed it down to an utterly savage track. Of particular interest also is the \\"TV Eye\\" disc. It is fascinating to listen to the band figure out what works in the track - thankfully the wrestling intro and the tambourine were dropped. Ron performs a genius solo on the first 8 takes of it, but it was unfortunately dropped on the last few takes. That is why it is a good thing takes 7 and 8 are put on the Funhouse reissue. But why were they combined? If you can include 3 Loose takes on disc 2, surely \\"TV Eye\\" deserves at least two takes? But that's just nitpicking.<br />The reissue is great. It sounds meaty, louder, and fuller. If you need a comparison, just play TV Eye on the old CD and then the new one. You will be convinced.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This album is not a comeback as it's been hyped, and especially not a return to the heavy guitar sound of Oasis' first three albums. \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is essentially a continuation of \\"Heathen Chemistry\\"'s laid-back, slightly psychedelic classic rock sound, just with much better songs. The only real new element is Noel's dead-on Kinks tribute \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" (imagine a precise musical and lyrical fusion of \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" and \\"Dead End Street\\" and you have this song). The fact that the other band members wrote a significant amount of the material has gotten a lot of press, but nothing here is a radical departure. In the end, this is an Oasis album, and just like most every Oasis album it's full of jangly guitars, gritty singing, peace-and-love lyrics, long instrumental codas, and songs that sound like outtakes from \\"Let It Be\\" or perhaps \\"Tommy.\\" In short, nothing here is going to \\"convert\\" people who just don't get Oasis. <br /> <br />All that said, however, if you do enjoy the Oasis formula this is an excellent listen, and certainly the band's best effort since 1997's classic, unjustly maligned \\"Be Here Now.\\" The whole album exhibits an energy, creativity, and coherence that was often missing from \\"Heathen Chemistry.\\" Liam's songwriting has evolved at light speed from the career-nadir \\"Little James\\" two albums ago to the flat-out awesome acoustic mod stomper \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" and best-song-Paul-McCartney-forgot-to-write \\"Love Like a Bomb.\\" Those songs are the strongest among universally solid material. Andy Bell has also come into his own-- his \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" is another highlight. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a significant improvement over \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" and suggests that Oasis could go on fruitfully mining this vein of Beatles-worshipping classic rock for a long time. They may not have another \\"Supersonic\\" or \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" in them, but their talents are far from spent. Highly recommended!

B0006A9FKA|1.0|I don't know why i'm even wasting time on such a piece of crap, i guess to set the record straight.  First off, if you think that this is or will be better than say the remake of the dawn of the dead, your either retard, insane or wanted to like shaun of the dead so much that, you had already made up your mind before even watching this film (i too wanted to like this film, being a person that loves zombie films, but also a person that even made one; which didn't turn out to well either) But i'm still man enough to admit it. I had heard from early on, that this will be the next great zombie movie. Even a director that put out one of the last good horror movies and a man i greatly respect, Eli Roth \\"Cabin Fever\\" loved this film. So when I got a chance to see this film, I was surpised in all respects, it was really bad, I even thought about turning it off.  I thought at least this film would showcase good fun zombie humor(evil dead movies, braindead aka dead alive) but it would be a insult to even think of them in the same ballpark, even further the same damn sport. I didn't go into the film because there were just to many issues that i had with it. So my friend watch it and determine for yourself. All i ask is judge it from your view, not someone else's and you'll see what i'm saying. But hell, in the end see the film, just don't buy it first...just rent the damn thing..
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as delusional high school student Donnie Darko in talented director Richard Kelly's thought provoking and stunningly creative award winning flick, which he also wrote.<br /><br />Donnie apparently a borderline schizophrenic who suffers from somnabulism has been having visions of a huge evil looking rabbit who has portended the end of the world in 28 days.  During a dream the rabbit named Frank summoned Donnie from his bed.  In a fortuitous twist of fate, inexplicably a jet engine crashes through the Darko house, specifically into Donnie's room.  Had he been there he surely would have perished.<br /><br />This incident set off more frequent delusions where Frank coaxed Donnie into destructive and bizarre acts.  Psychotherapy conducted by a concerned Dr. Thurman played by Katharine Ross was having little beneficial effect.  Donnie began becoming increasingly seduced by the concept of time travel somewhat fueled by science teacher Professor Monnitoff played by Noah Wylie.  Wylie introduced him to a revolutionary book on the subject penned by an aged and haggard local woman known as Grandma Death played eerily by Patience Cleveland.<br /><br />While this was happening Donnie became enamored with a high school girl Gretchen played by Jena Malone, whose influence would shape Donnie's future.<br /><br />Kelly concludes this extremely unique flick in terrific fashion, requiring rumination in it's interpretation.<br /><br />The musical score was haunting and enhanced the tenor of the flick especially in conjunction with the dream sequences.  The songs used throughout the film were also tastefully selected.  The acting requiring players to portray some very curious characters was very nicely done.  Kudos in particular should be given to Patrick Swayze as spiritualist Jim Cunningham and Beth Grant playing animated and motivated gym teacher Kitty Farmer.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Loved tyhe way it shot.  The black and white mixed with a dash of colors added to its great plot, and helped make this movie even better than it already was.
B0009MAO46|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\", the landmark movie that ushered animation into the computer age, is still a bona fide family classic- and funny as all get-out to boot. This superb package brings it all back, both the movie itself and an Al's Toy Barn full of bonuses. <br />       First things first- the movie looks and sounds fantastic! <br />I don't have one of those flashy home-theater outfits, but this digital print shows off some great color, with the various toy characters in pristine, bright glory. Sound master Gary Rydstrom upgraded the soundtrack to the point where you can hear the click of the tiny toy soldiers. Best of all, you don't need a 50-inch screen or ultra-Dolby amp to enjoy this newer-than-new view. <br />      The movie, of course, introduced a new, innovative animation outfit called Pixar to the world- and what a job they did on this first feature effort! Woody and Buzz Lightyear, of course, are icons to kids of all ages, but all the other members of the \\"Andy's Room\\" community were great- and funny. Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and even the little green Army sergeant (war-movie vet R. Lee Ermey) are just a few of these classic inanimate objects turned flesh-and-blood- well, almost- characters.  <br />        The storyline- a combination of buddy comedy, toy fair, sci-fi flick and domestic sitcom (to name a few elements) is, in its own way, as multi-layered and satisfying as the most mature adult dramas. From the moment all the toys come to life when Andy's away to a great exit line when the toys learn about his latest surprise gift, you're drawn in to this unusual world that's as striking now as it must have been a decade ago. <br />        Disc 1 has both the movie and a new feature with both the Pixar team and a few others (Chris \\"Robots\\" Wedge, George Lucas, Roy Disney) offering their views on what \\"Toy Story\\" did to transform the entire animation genre. It's Disc 2, however, that has the goods- a couple of dozen features, clips and art galleries that literally break down the walls and give both the kid/family core crowd and the animation scholar a remarkable look at how much effort goes into this sort of film. The fact that Pixar and the CGI form themselves were in their infancy at the time only enhances just what great craftsmen these people are. <br />       After an entertaining coffee-talk session involving Pixar's \\"four horsemen\\"- the core writer/artist/director/geeks who helmed every future project up to \\"The Incredibles\\"- we can check out everything from sequence development, sketch to full-on; galleries on characters like Woody and Buzz set to music; a multi-language sequence (from Finnish to Chinese to Turkish!); even Randy Newman's original piano-and-voice (and he's a fantastic piano player!) demo score. Nothing- I say, nothing- is out of place.  <br />        \\"Toy Story\\" is simple enough to be an ideal choice for a \\"child's first movie\\" yet sophisticated enough to give the serious cineaste plenty to study. It's as witty as the best literate comedies and as warm as an old-style family saga. It proved that top-drawer stars could also be great voice actors, and it entered a child's world with a fresh, not-so-\\"kiddie\\" angle. It balanced off sweet little Andy with mad-scientist Sid (his mutant monster-movie toy creations are a show in themselves) <br />in a great show of kids with personality. And it established Pixar as the flagship of animated features- again, it's incredible that this was their first!  <br />       \\"Toy Story\\", the super-deluxe edition, is a must for any animation buff, family with kids, or just about anyone who loves movies. I'm already on line for the upcoming (New Year's) \\"Toy Story 2\\" set, which will give its equally-great sequel (dare I say the \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Godfather II\\" of animation?) the format it deserves. With any luck, \\"Toy Story\\" will be one of the best-loved movies ever, to infinity...and beyond!
B00005NWM3|4.0|This album was basically the foundation for bigger things to come (The Long Road).  An excellent album which would be a great introduction to Nickelback for any new listener.  I think you'll find with Silver Side Up, like every other Nickelback album, the \\"hits\\" on the radio and MTV don't offer a complete representation of just how great this band is.  I full recommend this album.
1401301010|3.0|When I bought this book I was ecpecting to read one of the coolest autobigrapghys ever, I mean it's Anthony Keidis, the leads singer for one of the most original and biggest and greatest bands of all time, The Red Hot Chili Peppers. As I began to read this story I realized that it was going to be another one of excessive drug use, which is fine because that is usually what you get when you read a book about legendary rock stars, not that Keidis is legendary, well not yet anyway. As the goes on I realized that all this book is about is the drugs he did who he did them with, what they did and why he did them, and then he turns around and blames it all on his dad. Yeah his dad got him high when he was 7 but that doesnt give him the right to be addicted to everything under the sun, I mean come on. On ocasion you hear about one of the thousnds of girls that Keidis 'nails' during his life and how he slept with one of his fathers girlfriends when he was 13.<br /><br />What I wish this book would have had more of is storys of how he writes his songs and what inspired them and more about his interaction with The Chili Peppers. But that apears very little with in the book, little or no mention of the music apears in the chapters of this book.<br /><br />Another thing I really didnt like about this book is that when Hillel died it says very little about it and how it affected him and for someone who says that Hillel was his best friend he does little to pay tribute to the man.<br /><br />In conclusion this is a good read if you are a diehard fan of Anthony or The Chili Peppers but other then that just stear clear because this is too long and too boring for the money it costs. Not worth it!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|There new album has showed me why I like them so much.  When I heard a leaked copy of it on the way to San Francisco, I immediately thought that it was their most mainstream album to date and easily the most accessible.  However, I wasn't really sure if I liked it.  After listening to it continuously on MySpace and reading the description of the album on their website, I still couldn't get over this itch in the back of my head that was telling me to like the album.  Of course, on my first listening to the album, I did thoroughly enjoy Glosoli and Gong, and it's not that I didn't like the other songs or thought they were cheesy, it's just that I was missing something about the album that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  But now I see the light.....AND IT BURNS!!!!!  Well it doesn't burn, but I understand why I like them so much.  All this time I thought it was the Ambient nature of their music (that's what I first perceived when a friend introduced them to me).  But what I really like about them is that they are a \\"concept band\\". I've said this repeatedly yet it never sank in.  I'll show you what I mean via the following table: <br /> <br />Von --> an album whose concept was \\"sound collage\\" <br /> <br />Von Brigoi --> an album whose concept was \\"transformation/remix\\" <br /> <br />Agaetis Byrjun --> an album whose concept was \\"melody\\" <br /> <br />( ) --> an album whose concept was \\"lyricless atmosphere\\" <br /> <br />Takk --> an album whose concept was \\"storytelling\\" <br /> <br />Taking these things into consideration, it makes perfect sense for Takk to be as happy and upbeat as it is.  I mean, Jonsi himself said that the album was supposed to be a collection of little fairytales. How else do I validate my claim that they are a concept band?  Two ways: first, in ( ) they pushed the idea of a lyricless album by using a made up language, i.e. Hopelandic.  Sure you heard voices, but no one could understand them so they just became part of the atmosphere as a type of disembodied timbre; second, the album cover design does for Takk what Hopelandic did for ( ).  IT LOOKS LIKE A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES!  You can't really tell by the images on the net, but the album actually is shaped like a small book. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but I truly believe this is why I like the band so much.  They develop a concept for their albums, and they stick with it and push it to its limits.  Now I just have to figure out their strategy for their live/unreleased work :p
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|The Clash's London Calling is with out a doubt one of the all time best albums ever made, It's more then a punk, rock, regea, or ska album it's a melting pot for all that is good in those genras of music. Mick Jones' guitar work was never better then here on London Calling and Joe Strummers voice was never before or after a strong and a good as it is here. The whole band really came together in late 1979 to record what would go down in history as the greatest punk album of all time and one of the all time best all around albums ever, easily in the top ten of all time.<br /><br />The album opens up with the legendary title track, 'London Calling.' With it's legendary bass line and guitar riff it was sure to be a classic, long held as one of the all time best songs, and Strummers lyrics are nothing to be rivaled. 'Brand new Cadilac' is a 1950's cover song that features great guitar and is pulled off perfectly in ture rockabilly form. 'Jimmy Jazz' is a basic Jazz song with nice laid back feel to it. 'hateful' is one of the better songs on the album, with a killer chorus and awesome backing vocals from the band. 'Rudie cant Fail' is straight up punk rock all the way. It starts off slow and builds to a all out assualt. I like 'Spanish Bombs' because the chorus is in spanish which sounds really cool when sung by guys with british accents. 'The Right Profile' is a cool song but nothing too special. 'Lost In The Supermarket' is like nothing The Clash ever recorded and it is one of their all time best songs, easily one of my favorites, it sounds almost ahead of it's time, like something from the mid-1980's. 'Clampdown' is legendary Clash, a true classic in the bands archive. This song is considered one of the top three punk songs of all time and is easily The Clash's most famous. 'The Guns Of Brixton' and 'Wrong Em Boyo' are two very cool songs but they both sound pretty similar. 'Death Or Glory' is another punk classic that was recently covered by Social Distortion, but the original is by far better, as most are. 'Koka Kola' is my least favorite song on the album but it is still a good song. 'The Card Cheat' is a ballad, yes I said a ballad, and boy do the boys do it good, it's one of their better songs if you ask me. 'Lovers Rock' is just straight up rock and roll and it features one of Mick Jones' all time best guitar riffs of all time, no I take that back this is his best. 'Fourhorsemen' apart from having a really cool title is a really cool song. 'I'm Not Down' and 'Revolution Rock' and two songs that fit very well with each other and need to be heard to fully appreciate. The album comes to a close with it's best song, and my personal favorite Clash song, 'Train in Vein' is truly one of the all time best songs, it is just so perfect. Everything I could ever want is in this song and more, it is just so good you must hear it to understand what I mean, but now that I think about it you probabley have heard this song because it is one of The Clash's biggest songs ever.<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to get into punk this is it. If you are looking for a way to get into The Clash this is the way to go, and if you just want to buy one of the all time greatest album of all time you cant go wrong with London Calling. How many albums do you know that have 18 songs on them and dont get boring? Very few right? Well here is another long album that never gets boring only better as it plays. Highly, highly recomended!he original is by far better, as most are. 'Koka Kola' is my least favorite song on the album but it is still a good song.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash's London Calling is with out a doubt one of the all time best albums ever made, It's more then a punk, rock, regea, or ska album it's a melting pot for all that is good in those genras of music. Mick Jones' guitar work was never better then here on London Calling and Joe Strummers voice was never before or after a strong and a good as it is here. The whole band really came together in late 1979 to record what would go down in history as the greatest punk album of all time and one of the all time best all around albums ever, easily in the top ten of all time.<br /><br />The album opens up with the legendary title track, 'London Calling.' With it's legendary bass line and guitar riff it was sure to be a classic, long held as one of the all time best songs, and Strummers lyrics are nothing to be rivaled. 'Brand new Cadilac' is a 1950's cover song that features great guitar and is pulled off perfectly in ture rockabilly form. 'Jimmy Jazz' is a basic Jazz song with nice laid back feel to it.

B0009WFFS6|4.0|Well, I've actually seen a clip of this concert video on Apple's Quicktime site. [...]    It's the entire performance of \\"White Room\\" and it's excellent.  Jack's singing and playing are exquisite and Clapton's solo is one of the best I've heard him play for \\"White Room\\" over a number of concert videos and CDs the past 20 years. Ginger is, well, Ginger, meaning he does his thing and does it well.    They all look like grizzled veterans that have survived many wars and have lived to tell the tale.  The music is dynamite and what a pleasure to see one of rock's greatest groups reunite and not suck or embarass themselves, their legacy, and fans.    One song may not make a whole video, but I'd be shocked if the rest of the video quality and performances were not up to par with this clip.  The audio is great and the video production is very good.  You know Clapton would not have done live shows and allowed a video to be made if this was not going to be a top-shelf effort.  Do you think he needs the money and aggravation if this were something he was not passionate about?  I think not, baby puppy.
B000002GYR|5.0|With Tom Waits it is either hit or miss for me.  I either really like his stuff or I really don't like it.  This album I really like and \\"Closing Time\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  Waits' cover of \\"Ol' 55\\" is excellent and \\"Martha\\" is a greal ballad that really adds to the album.  My favorite Tom Waits album.
B000AL730Y|5.0|It's great to hear Paul put out a wealth of new material that I actually look forward to in a live performance.  There are quite a few keepers on this one.  By far, his best solo work and many tracks are as good some of the Beatles work.  Jenny Wren is beautiful with spectacular guitar work and vocals. Riding To Vanity Fair sounds like a bit of rejection from John perhaps? At The Mercy is another one of my favorites with the dark lyrics so perfectly matched with very unique instrumentation (vibrachimes and B3).  English Tea is really quite catchy and could have easily been on Magical Mystery Tour or even Abbey Road.  Reminds me of Penny Lane a bit too.  Haven't watched the DVD yet but plan to shortly.  Highly recommended CD.
B000002B30|5.0|This is Springsteens Greatest Hits, it is pretty much a no-brainer.  If you like the boss then you'll like this disc.
B000AARKOO|4.0|The movie got a bad rap in the box office, but I think this is definately worth watching especially for those interested in that era.  The characters are well thought out and enticing.  Definately worth your time.
0743201140|5.0|The follow up to \\"First, Break All The Rules\\" (another excellent book), \\"Now\\" focuses on discovering and unlocking your strengths so that ulitmate you are playing with your best foot forward.  Included when you buy this book, is a password that allows you to go on-line and take a test compossed by the same people who wrote the book, that will allow you to see what your top strenghts are.  Great for any business professional or anyone looking to see what career path they might want to take.
B000A3XYZA|5.0|It is a wonderful performance, much much more impressive then the austere Munich performance on the Farrao Classics DVD. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment plays brilliantly for William Christie. <br />  <br />Anna Caterina Antonacci is a glamorously beautiful woman with a hell of a stage charisma. Andreas Scholl is outstanding and fulfils his status as one of the two greatest countertenors today (the other one is of course David Daniels). His two arias in the beginning of the second act, when he meets his sister Eduige dressed like a blind vagabond is breathtaking! And as Grimoaldo, tenor Kurt Streit is outstanding too.  <br />  <br />This is for my taste a glorious DVD that no Handel fan should miss! <br />
0553213105|5.0|I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour.  Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as  chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class.
6304779607|3.0|Crime is a disease, he is the cure. Slyvester Stallone is Marion Cobretti AKA Cobra (nickname derived from his surname) He is a no nonsence cop that belongs to the Zombie squad unit. He takes no prisoners and can be as violent as the criminals he dispossess of. The movie starts with a gun wielding maniac who raids a store for no particular reason and starts shooting up innocent folks like Duke Nukem. The cops are called but they can't handle the situation and one of them utters the words -call the cobra-, u can't help but start to laugh at this point. Stallone rolls onto the scene looking like he just walked off a Giorgio Armani fashion shoot and does what he does best i.e kill the psycho. But thats just the beginning, theres more madness out there in the shape of a cult led by Brian Thompson who wants to establish a new world order. Their motto -we kill the weak so the strong survive- is evident as they mainly target women and only operate after sunset. They are extremely violent and use a variety of axes,chains,spikes and vicious looking knives to kill their prey. Brigitte Nielsen a model almost falls victim but escapes and calls the cops, who assign cobra to the case which includes protecting her as she is a valuable witness who recognizes Thompson aka -the night slasher-. A female member of the cult also works for the zombie squad and keeps the gang one step ahead of the impending investigations. This fact makes Cobra's job difficult as Brigitte is moved from place to place, the gang seem to follow as we witness extreme violent killings. This takes us to the very end when cobra delivers his own form of justice to Thompson in a violent scene where he ends up being impaled on a giant hook and is transported into a blast furnace as he yelps in pain like a baby. Other violent scenes include an innocent female being axed to pieces and a man gets rammed against a wall by a van at very high speed. This movie has some funny moments too but as a whole now seems a bit outdated. Its an o.k flick and should not be taken seriously. I give it 3 stars.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|Not a bad movie at all there is some really good action in this one. Also a pretty neat idea of the ironclad. It was a shade bit dull in the middle for about 15 min when they walk around the desert. But all in all I gave it 4 starts, maybe 4.25 on a good night. I would suggest it.
B00000294R|5.0|BIG L was the man he had skills that were comparable to well... NOBODY the production on this album smokes and is probably some of the best ive heard the beats have a strong mid 90s feel to them lyricaly L always brings it but I would not recomend this to people who are easily offended now Mrs. donna donna howard who the h-ll do you think you are wouldnt know talent if it bit you on the ---. Some 12 year old retard reviewing clay aiken and brittney spears and then trying to be an authority on HIPHOP ive got news for you HIPHOP is much more than just a bunch of players and thugs talking fast over a messy beat and yes it is a valid art form and if it wasnt for HIPHOP I would not be alive today thats right I would not have survived my college years if it were not for this messy noise. If you dont like Hiphop dont waste your time listening to/reviewing it. think before you speak up sista oh yeah the CD 5mics
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a show in a class of it's own.  Part sci-fi, part western.  Comedy, action, drama, naked Nathan Fillion.  Best writing ever!  Firefly had it all.     <br />Too big for tv, SERENITY will be gracing movie screens in just two weeks.  I've been lucky enough to see the unfinished version twice and it's amazing.  Firefly fans will love it.  If you haven't seen the series, catch it quick before seeing the movie.  Although you don't need the history, the emotional connection to the characters will really enhance the movie for you.
0143034901|5.0|Refreshingly different. The story is compelling and draws you into it immediately. It instantly became one of my favorite books.
0696204800|5.0|There is only one thing I don't like about this book: It is so much fun to look at and read, I'll NEVER get around to cutting and sewing. But if I ever do make any of the fabulous blocks in this book, I am going to come out with fabulous quilts, hangings, table runners, and anything else I want. There are a few projects in here too, and the instructions and photos and pictures are all clear, concise and fun. I love this book, for the blocks and for the inspiration.
B000AADYYO|2.0|Opeth usually doesn't disappoint, but this time they do.  It's really just a culmination of attempting to incorporate new ideas with old and not allowing enough time to refine what they're wanting to adjust.  The material on this release has potential but sorely lacks execution, the two main culprits being the clean vocal experimentations and the addition of the keyboardist.  I'd like to go down the tracklist pointing out several reasons why I believe this CD personally fails to manifest (feel free to compile this with other reviews). <br /> <br />1. Ghost Perdition <br /> It starts off on solid \\"Blackwater Park\\" riffing grounds but suddenly takes a sharp fall directly onto Tool \\"Aenima\\" grounds.  After Tool and Opeth jam for a few a bit, Mike breaks into a happy jingle verse \\"devil cracked the earth... you have to live before you can die young\\".  This is a very clashing vocal overtone and gives an awkward overall sound. <br /> Approximately 2:34, during a clean break, Mike superimposes George Michael's \\"Last Christmas\\" (during his stint with Whim) voice over the next vocal lines, making it difficult to recognize which CD I had put in. <br /> <br />2. The Baying of the Hounds <br /> The beginning of the song has a fusion that I've never heard before.  You have firmly rooted Opeth metal going on and then the keyboardist starts playing Blue-Grass right underneath it.  I mean it literally sounded like I was at the Tennessee Blue Grass Festival for a moment.   <br /> Once the vocals kick in, the keyboardist teams up again to prove his technical skills not only include blue-grass avenues but also gospel.  I went from the festival directly into a Southern Black Church.  <br /> To perk this up a bit, about 3:30 this great melody comes in where the band gels with a soft passage of aerial lift.  Around 7:45, a violin effect comes forth and the atmosphere created is truly nice, putting motion in the music that could easily have gone into a movie.  These situations show thepotential of the musicians' direction. <br /> <br />3. Beneath the Mire <br /> The intro is really nice and is a continuation of the motion-oriented music made for a movie.  It has this brilliant black-and-white, 1940s ballroom atmosphere.  But then it's destroyed by the rapid change in atmospheres when the keyboards are dropped and the metal tones are brought more into focus and drawn into a more simplistic rhythm.  The result is nullifyingly painful, as both the moods are torn down by each other. <br /> When the music slows down for a clean break, it's even more painful.  Mike pulls out his best Michael Bolton impression (from the earlier days) and then you can hear his voice actually crack right before the solo.  It's really disappointing and embarrassing. <br /> Around 3:45 the theme to L.A. Law kicks in, even if for an instance, it's definitely there.  I'm not saying this is bad, but if did feel as if I were watching a late-evening, court-drama television program.    <br /> But around 7:20 the drums and effects sound really good.  <br /> <br />4. Atonement <br /> Not bad until the keyboardist livens things up with Las Vegas Chapel Music from the 1970s.  It really is JUST that: chapel music.  And to ruin things more, Mike's voice has -- even through the effects -- this whining nasal presence.  He's had it before starting really with My Arms, Your Hearse (\\"Credence\\" and at times on the Damnation CD).  But usually it's tamed, whereas now it seems to be encouraged and even more vivid. <br /> The keyboardist also gets a little solo and during this break, I could've sworn I was in an elevator in Dillard's in 1985.  I reached back and, thankful, noticed that my mullet was gone. <br /> 5:22 the outro is nice. <br /> <br />5. Reverie/Harlequin Forest <br /> The opening belongs to one of the latest Mt. Dew commercials.  And in fact, the whole first couple of minutes sound as if they were written for Linkin Park (the name escapes me now but they have a song that starts the same way).  When Mike cleanly belted \\"trail of sickness\\", I was almost knocked flat by the out of key note in \\"sickness\\", which was flat itself.  The thing about singing distorted vocals is that the key invariably matters not.  It was surprising because he's not usually bad about missing notes.  He certainly has flatted notes before (\\"Credence\\" again), but this one sticks out badly. <br /> The acoustic passage in this song is a redo of \\"To Bid You Farewell\\", I was actually singing the lyrics to that song during this.   <br /> <br />6.  Hour of Wealth <br /> This is the worst song that I've heard, quite possibly, in my entire life.  I was unbelievably disappointed with this.  The music itself isn't so bad but when Michael busts in doing his Michael Bolton impression again, he does it as a careless endeavor: his voice cracks repeatedly.  And I can't help but laugh when I hear the way he sings, \\"Looking through my window, seem to recognize...\\" and then the worst \\"days are in darkness... give rise\\".  I'm actually laughing as I'm writing this review right now because it's so cheesy and can't be taken seriously.  And this is all in addition to his nasal, flatted notes. <br /> <br />7.  The Grand Conjuration <br /> Actually not bad.  The best song on the whole CD.  A little weak because it drones on too long, over-exercising the recyclable parts.    <br /> <br />8.  Isolation <br /> Nasal vocals but not as bad as the others, except for the first two notes.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|A cool popcorn flick for he hole family it has thrills chills and spills.Jamie Foxx hasn't been this great since Booty Call. There is this sweet part where a car flips over and Tom cruse shots a guy out a window onto Jamie foxx's car and he offer him 500 big ones to drive him around and thats about it is soo good it is plane,trains,and automobiles meets Jury Duty meets Rambo part 1 and 3. you must see this roller coaster ride like not other.
B000088DTS|5.0|A wonderful music cd.  Delta has a mature voice and outlook on life.  Her voice is unusual in it's wide range and she puts a lot of emotion into her songs.  I am very happy with this cd and also Mistaken Identity.  I am looking forward to a new release from her.  Delta's cd's are imported so they cost more and I think they are well worth the extra price.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater, the band that has never ceased to amuse me, they have created so perfect albums, like Awake, Scenes from a Memory, Images and Words, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, etc. <br />And now they release their 8th studio release, Octavarium. <br />I have read a lot of reviews concering Octavarium, naming it a change for bad, a worthless effort...I will show you the grand piece of art Dream Theater worked out... <br /> <br />1) The Root of All Evil: The albums starts with some drumming and a powerful guitar riff coming from Petrucci, this is the 3rd part in the alcohilism saga by Mike Portnoy, really heavy. I really like the chorus \\"Take all of me, the desires, that keep burning deep inside\\" The keyboarding and bass in this song are excelent, a great opener and a magnificient song, following footsteps of the other 2 \\"The Glass Prision\\" and \\"This Dying Soul\\" <br /> <br />2) The Answer Lies Within: It's the ballad in the album, starts with some nice piano melodies by Jordan Rudess. <br />LaBrie's vocals shine here, the lyrics are same as deep as Labrie's singing. Maybe for some this song is boring, but I find it a great song, maybe not as good as \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" but neverless, it's good. <br /> <br />3) These Walls: This is one of the new Dream Theater songs, I find the chorus very addictive \\"Tear down these walls for me\\" There are no crazy solos, but it has some nice moments, not the best, but not least. <br /> <br />4) I Walk Beside You: This is the song I've heard most negative reviews, I don't know why, Dream Theater is a band that likes to play with music, use distinct music genres, that's the reason they're what they're now. <br />I Walk Beside You is the poppiest song I've heard from Dream (Even more than \\"Solitary Shell\\") But it's a change for good, the song is very good. Although it IS very U2-influenced, I find it adequate. <br /> <br />5)Panic Attack: Oh god!! OH GOD!! Tranquil and lovely Dream Theater came and left with \\"I Walk Beside You\\"When I thought songs at \\"Train of Thought\\" My CD-Player changed to track 5 and a god-like bass line by Myung tells us that this song is for real... <br />This is the heaviest song in the album, but one of the best, I love it. <br />There is some doomful drumming by Portnoy, incredibly fast guitars, crazy keyboarding and bass. This song is very dark, at the likes of Train of Thought. The name tells it all \\"Panic Attack\\" <br /> <br />6) Never Enough: Not a song that I love, but it's not bad. There is some good guitar work by Petrucci and drumming by Portnoy. I like the chorus. This song is dark, but not as dark as \\"Panic Attack\\" <br /> <br />7) Sacrificed Sons: God, I love this song!! It talks about the 9/11 terrorist attack, and the lyrics are for real. <br />The song starts with some sad and melancholic singing and piano, but as the song develops it starts ganing speed and feeling the chorus \\"Who would wish this on our people!\\" Is really awe-inspiring. At the end there is this drum solo that tells us \\"Hey!! Mike Portnoy playing here!!\\" Like the one we heard in \\"Finally Free\\" A really epic ending, but it's just the beginning for the magum opus of the album, and I mean it. <br /> <br />8) OCTAVARIUM: Jesus...I don't know where to start, this epic starts with Jordan having a little fun with his new Continuum fingerboard...And after 5 minutes of an epic overture, the real thing starts with \\"Someone like him\\" <br />This song is played with acoustic guitar and piano. LaBrie's voice shines here as well, the lyrics are awe-inspiring, but they are only starting the great concept of what Octavarium is, after this beginning, the song starts to gain feeling \\"Awakening\\" <br />In Awakening, the song starts ganing a little speed, but it does not leave its slow and charming tempo, at the end of this part, a large instrumental passage, influenced by many prog rock bands, like Genesis, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Yes, etc. begins, nice keyboarding Jordan!! <br />In \\"Full Circle\\" the thing gets interesting, the lyrics are pure poetry, they only use proper names. This section requires lot of analizing. After this, the song keeps gaining speed and strength, until the climax, where it fets Dark, Heavy and Powerful, the \\"Intervals\\" <br />In Intervals, the song reaches its climax, while telling us about the \\"8\\" (Every part describes perfectly each song in the album) while the song gets heavier and heavier until LaBrie shrieks 4 masterful times... <br />TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM <br />That's the \\"tragedy\\" but Dream Theater never leaves an epic withour a masterful and epic grand finale, \\"Razor's Edge\\" appears. <br />In this song, a full orchestra joins the band, LaBrie's final words really marked me, especially the part \\"THIS STORY ENDS WHERE IT BEGAN!!!\\" <br />While ending this grand epic with a guitar solo by Petrucci full of feeling and excitement. <br />Well my friends, if you are wise, you will shut down your PCs right now, and go to the CD shop and get this album, Dream Theater has new music, that's their way, the Dream Theater way... <br />
B0006IF92U|5.0|Delta has a unique voice.  She has a wide vocal range and a very beautiful voice.  Her songs have meaning and are uplifting.  I am very happy I found out about her in a magazine ad.  The price to import her cd's are well worth the extra money.  I look forward to her next release.
0312323859|5.0|Something Blue is terrific! It's rare to find a follow-up book that is better than the first, but this book was truly amazing. It is a definite page-turner, and the main character, Darcy, lives a life of such drama and destruction that reading about her exploits, her personal agenda, and her conceited opinions of herself is like watching a very juicy soap opera. Like many, I disliked Darcy in the first book, and was wondering how the author was going to turn Darcy likeable. The good thing is... she didn't! At least for the first half of the book, Darcy is as bad as she ever was, and there was definitely a moment in the book (when she is talking to her former fianc Dex about her baby) that made my jaw drop in horror at Darcy all over again. But, despite how bad Darcy is, I kept reading. My recommendation is that you read Something Borrowed before this book; the characters in Something Blue all overlap from the first book and, although the author spends abut 5-6 chapters recapping the storyline form the first book, you definitely need the first story as a starting point for this one. Anyway, in this book, Darcy has managed to alienate all of her friends and family, with the exception of Ethan, her childhood friend that she really isn't close to anyway. So, when she is left high and dry by her baby's father and realizes her `stock is plummeting' as an attractive female, she takes off to Europe and asks to stay with Ethan. Both Ethan and Europe are the catalyst for change in Darcy, and little by little she begins to rebuild her life and view her own personality in a different way. The good thing is that Darcy doesn't completely change; she is still wicked at times, thoughtless, selfish, opinionated, and maintains the spunk and meanness you expect from her. But, it was entertaining to read about Darcy, and very rewarding to reach the end and find that the story had evolved into something so enjoyable and heartfelt. I would definitely recommend this book, and look forward to the next book in this series, or just by Giffin at all. She is a talented storyteller and took a very difficult character and made her the heroine.  <br />
B000B5XOYI|4.0|Batman Motion Picture Anthology has been in the works for over 5 years. Unlike Batman Legacy, a double dip worthless release of previous Batman DVDs, Anthology is all but an entirely new release.  <br /> <br />With new technology, the video and audio should be better. Enhanced features and interviews with some of the actors should also increase the collection's desireability. However, if one does not care about the special features, then there is very little reason to purchase this collection.  <br /> <br />This review is based more on special features, since most would agree the 89 movie is the best, Returns is next best, Forever is the beginning of the end, and the end is the beginning of 8 years of silence of Batman, for BM & Robin.  <br /> <br />The interviews are plentiful in each volume. Having some of the actors and the directors give a commentary is great. I expect they will give their opinions on the new Batman Begins movie, and reminisce over troubles and fun times while they worked on their movie. Hopefully, Schumacher will apologize for reinventing Batman, and ultimately sabotaging the series. I'm sure his intent was not to ruin the series; but, at the same time, since he obviously is not a Bat-fan, should have gracefully declined the job. He should explain, as he did in previous commentaries, such as The Making of Batman & Robin, how he felt that Batman had whined long enough (50 years) over the death of his parents. So, he should explain why he set out to create an all new Batman.  <br /> <br />There will be a few deleted scenes. However, this is where the company who actually puts the DVDs together, with their special features, ultimately lacks what it is the viewer really wants. Most special feature gurus want some commentaries, even a commentary over the movie is cool. But, 60000 hours of commentaries is excessive. A perfect special features disc will contain a voice over commentary during the movie; a commentary with the main actor, director and producer. Plentiful deleted scenes, and out-takes. In those movies that are high on special effects, a showing of how it was done is always interesting. Anthology focuses mostly on interviews and commentaries. Great; but, they lose major points by not offering enough deleted scenes, and out-takes.  <br /> <br />Anthology is grouped as a box set of the former Batman movie franchise, or, wisely released individually, for those who despise any particular title. Anthology will not and does not contain the new Batman franchise, featuring Batman Begins, as this is part of a complete overhaul of the Batman Franchise. Thus, the name, Batman Begins. As such, they are completely seperate, and to include it in Anthology, would be incorrect.  <br /> <br />Overall, Anthology should be what fans have been waiting for since the first Batman movie was released on DVD. I give it 4 of 5 stars, because it lacks the plentiful deleted scenes from each edition, but, packs in plenty of commentaries and interviews and other special features.
B00005JMCN|5.0|My eight year old loves horses, and I had originally rented this movie for her.  I wasn't completely sure she'd enjoy it, but she loved it so much we ended up purchasing the movie for her.  Its really a heartwarming tale that the entire family will enjoy.
0802130208|5.0|This is an excellent book.  There are so many levels on which it satisfies.  Without a doubt, it is one of the funniest books I have ever read.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that you either love or hate.  There is no middle ground on this one.  I wonder if part of that is the fact that comedy is not universal (Some people love Monty Python.  Some people hate Monty Python.).  The more I talk with people about this work, the more I'm convinced that there is a certain regional aspect that you have to \\"get\\" in order for it to be funny.  Maybe you have to be a Southern Catholic to \\"get\\" it.  Maybe you have to have a passing interest in medieval philosophy (or general western philosophy) in order for this to be funny.  More likely, it's none of the above as \\"funny\\" is so intangible.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think of Carmina Burana while reading this book.  Fortuna is the main character of this work.  Each of the minor characters are caught in their own wheel of Fortune from which they can't really escape.  The interesting thing is that, in Toole's novel, the wheels have teeth and act like gears.  The rising fortunes of one character precipitate a drop in fortunes in another.  A drop in fortune in Ignatius ends up raising the fortunes of everyone else (and, in the end, Ignatius too).<br /><br />In the end, the book is a love story, and Ignatius, like Boethius, ends up understanding happiness comes when Love rules the heart.  I would actually recommend that the prospective reader read \\"The Consolation of Philosophy\\" before reading this book.  It's not really necessary in order to enjoy the book, but I think it makes the book more enjoyable.  It certainly gives you an extra chuckle in a few places.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I remember as a kid looking at the incredible cover of the big face and tonsils staring back at you but not daring to buy the album.   When I did summon the courage to buy it I was not disappointed. Although the tracks are few and very long they are varied and of high quality.   '21st Century Schizoid Man': how prophetic. Here we are in the 21st century and we are indeed surrounded by schizoid men.   'I Talk to the Wind': beautiful, dreamy flute piece which ambles and soothes, wildly contrasting the opening track.  'Epitaph': lovely music and prophetic..'The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools'... How true!  'Moonchild': 2 or 3 movements of sheer bliss. A pity people today don't have the patience or time to just sit and LISTEN.  'In the Court of the Crimson King': Mellatron magic. 'The gardener plants an evergreen whilst trampling on a flower'...interesting juxtaposition.   4 and a half stars.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Most \\"best of\\" collections for most groups seem to lack something.  My expectations for \\"Echoes\\" were low; fortunately I was very, very wrong.  I have many \\"greatest hits\\" and many \\"best of,\\" and this one, for one of the greatest progressive rock groups, is an absolute gem.<br /><br />I am least familiar with Syd Barrett's work in early Pink Floyd.  The songs \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"See Emily Play,\\" \\"Arnold Layne,\\" \\"Jugband Blues,\\" and \\"Bike,\\" all written and sang by Syd Barrett, urge me to obtain Pink Floyd's early albums \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets.\\"  This music is psychedelic and imaginative, and now I know why there is a \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-7).\\"<br /><br />I think it is a nearly bizarre truth that there is almost no such thing as bad Pink Floyd music.  There is weak Pink Floyd music, and Pink Floyd music that is difficult to appreciate.  However, Pink Floyd at their worst is still musically a force.  When I listen to this music I remember the promise and potential of progressive rock through what many consider the glory years of progressive rock.  Music from \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" which set all sorts of longevity records on the charts, is of course represented.  However, Pink Floyd in the post-Barrett years has always been more than one album.  There was the wonderful \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the epic \\"The Wall,\\" and the bizarre and complex \\"Animals.\\"  Then there is the sonically pleasing \\"The Division Bell,\\" and the often derided \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\"  Then there are the albums \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Meddle.\\"  This album also includes one song from the movie \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />Listening to these songs in the order chosen is almost surreal as the album cuts back and forth between decades and band lineups.  As I listen to this music I remember all that I love about rock, particularly progressive rock, and what I love about life and Pink Floyd, and then I wonder how we got here, and why David Gilmour thought Pink Floyd had run its course when it really had not.  There is still time, and we can only hope that one day the members of Pink Floyd realize that they were always greater than the sum of their parts.  Until that time, cherish all the music from Pink Floyd you can get, because Pink Floyd is one of the few groups that managed to find the middle ground between art and entertainment.  This music will always be diamonds in my collection, and it will carry me forward and backward in time, until there is no time left.hought Pink Floyd had run its course when it really had not.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|The first CD encourages unprotected sex, but the second goes much further at relaying complex tenticles of thought through whimsical fasting (noneating for days.....DAYS!!!!).  So, I kinda like it before endangering others (i.e, poor driving, irresponsible handling of Hydrochloric acid).  David Grohl does have courage and skill, which really rears itself on the second disk....he even sings with Aaron Neville and YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.  I think one song is actually about Kurt Cobain of the Meat Puppets.  BUT, beware of XXX pictures inside the disk...sneaky devils.  Anything to make $$$. Oh, I don't want to make like the album is, its good, just don't eat it.  That's stupid.  I hate people who do that....Oh.  ANyways, worth getting, just don't listen while awake.  Bye.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is going to be a very simple review.  However, I have to give my two-cents on this one.<br /><br />I just purchased this album on 13 September. It is wonderful!!  I am a HUGE Beatles fan (especially the collaboration of McCartney/Lennon songwriting) and this album contains a heart and soul that I have not heard out of Paul since John died.<br /><br />If you are a Paul McCartney fan, there is no doubt that this is the album for you.  If you're a Beatles fan, there is no doubt that you will appreciate this album and will add it to your CD changer.  It's worth every penny and more.<br /><br />I do not regret this purchase at all.  I hope that you will feel the same way.<br /><br />Cheers!
6305079811|5.0|The science fiction, fantasy, and action/adventure films of the early 80's were some of the most memorable ever conceived. They remain cult classics with fan bases spread all over the globe, and Flash Gordon is no different. <br /> <br />Don't take it too seriuosly, just sit back and enjoy the campy sci-fi fun and adventure. Granted, the acting is horrible and the SFX leave alot to be desired, but Flash Gordon remains a classic glimpse into 80's sci-fi film-making. Did you know, Flash Gordon was filmed at the famed Elstree Studios in London? It began set construction during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back, and some of Britain's top film crews helped bring the film to life. And the original score by the rock band Queen is different from the big orchestra sound of other sci-fi films. Just have fun with it, or laugh at it if you want to. Either way, Flash Gordon is a film with tremendous staying power; over 20 years and it's still a fan favorite.
0393035158|5.0|This book is by far the most well reasoned contemporary piece of literature on the topic of faith and religion I have read. <br /> <br />Sadly, the most talked about and controversial parts of the book when taken out of context can easily convince potential readers that Harris's work is no more than a polemic against the evils of religion.  This is simply not the case.  In context, the analogies Harris uses to spotlight the degree to which people believe (and behave) absurdly are both compelling and apt.  It is the power of these analogies that most strongly makes his case for danger of establishing one's life in principles of faith rather than those that are reasoned.  The most controversial point Harris makes (that even religious moderation is dangerous) is defended with a strong and compelling argument; but even if one disagrees with it, there is still much to be gained from reading this book. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Harris's thoughts on mysticism, spirituality, and the concept of self were both novel and, in some ways, profound.  As a result, the part of the book that Amazon's review inexplicably describes as the latter chapters which \\"Harris' heart is not as much in\\" have the compacity to truly influence even a well developed (and rational) conception of the world around us.  There are only a handful of pieces of literature that have the potential to impact their readers in this way, and this is one of them. <br /> <br />Even if you think you disagree with Sam Harris now (in fact, even if you still disagree with him after reading the book), you are depriving yourself of a great opportunity if you do not read this cover to cover.  You may not be converted, but you will exposed to an undeniably important, consistent, and surprisingly selfless worldview -- one that will cause you, at the very least, to consider your own more deeply.
B00003CXE7|4.0|\\"Hail Caesar! Those who are about to die salute you!\\" And Ridley Scott's brilliant skills as a director certainly brought vivid imagery to the pageantries and spectacles of the Roman Empire. The film is more a historical fantasy epic as opposed to strictly a historical epic.  In addition to a fantasy context, the film is also plagued by various historical/anthropological errors.    As a fantasy, the film's historical license makes the story historically absurd. It would be somewhat akin to having George Washington being an officer to a tyrannical George III and who flees from him after he's accused of plotting against the crown.  In the mean time, George III has Washington's entire family executed.  Washington finds refuge in the Americas and returns to London for revenge.  He fights George III mano-a-mano in front of a full Parliament and kills him.  Washington returns to the colonies and announces their independence.  Hurrah! And even that would be less of a stretch than this film's story.  Maximus is not a real figure but rather a composite of several Maximi. The film also makes it seem as if Commodus died in a short time after he began his reign which was not the case. Although Commodus did personally participate in gladiatorial spectacles, he was not killed in the arena but instead killed in his chambers 13 years into his reign.  Although the film's end leaves the question open whether the Republic was restored: it was not and the notion of republicanism in Rome at that time is equally erroneous.  In terms of a popular republican movement, the last time the Senate seriously contemplated restoring the Republic was upon the death of Nero over 120 years before. Such sentiments were long dead when Commodus ruled and people had become both dependent and accustomed to imperial despotism.  A well developed imperial bureaucracy provided many peoples with prominent positions and considerable influence to keep the imperial institution fixed as a permanent one. The scenewith senators Gaius and Falco tempting Maximus with thoughts of a Republic within earshot of Commodus and Marcus Aurelius is therefore absurd.  Even the 'benevolent' Marcus Aurelius would probably have had them immediately executed for entertaining such dangerous ideas.    In addition to factual errors, many of the sets and costumes were historically incorrect.  The unpaved dirt roads leading into Rome probably the most amusing. The battle was well done and most of the armor accurate except for the Praetorian guard who look more like they came from a galaxy far far away than from Imperial Rome.   The armor was over polished and the helmets completely out of place aesthetically.  The same is true for some of the scenes in the gladiatorial shows such as the crossbows which didn't exist at the time. Finally, Commodus' triumphal procession through the Sacra Via in a pitch black chariot with white blinding marble walls and statues everywhere is not an accurate depiction of what a Roman triumph would have been like.  Marble statues and reliefs were painted which would have made Rome a more colorful place than depicted in the film. The clothing and their colors don't reflect the fashion of that period at all either. The costumes and furnitures actually looked Napoleanic more than anything else. The soundtrack was the biggest disappointment. Although the incidental music was authentic, the wailing new-aged Persian singing for the main title was completely out-of-tune with the context of the movie: What were they thinking?  Is this a movie about Maximus or Mohammed? The music for the Commodus' procession was also such a cheap steal of Richard Wagner's \\"The Ring\\" trilogy they might as well have stuck to the original. Placing such divergent compisitions as the title track and the processionary one in the same film is more a cacophony than a symphony.  No creativity whatsoever in that department.    Despite these draw backs,the acting by Crowe and Reed was decent.  Russel Crowefit the role very well as a humble general (those were also very rare in Rome except perhaps for Lucullus and Belisarius.) An entertaining historical fantasy!  The star of the film is definitely J. Phoenix as the demented Commodus.  The combat scenes were a little too quick in sequence but certainly captured the mood of the fury and excitement the crowds expressed at these spectacles. Definitely worth owning.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys, the singer's second album, is not what I expected.  I had to listen to it a second time to appreciate the CD for what it was.  This album is like an urban beat mix with vocal fillers.<br /><br />Songs in A Minor had funky, exuberant, joyful lyrics that were personal and poetic.  The songs spoke about the female heart and about female independence.  They were also a lot of fun.<br /><br />The Diary of Alicia Keys lacks such soulful lyrics.  In A Minor, Keys' voice was always singing.  In Diary, much of the tracks are beat filler.  Entire songs sound like a song does when it is winding down.  You feel like Keys used up all the poetry she had ever written in the first album, and had writer's block with her second album.<br /><br />An exception is the fantastic song Dragon Days.  I cannot get enough of this song.  It has an intoxicating rhythm, and lovely lyrics.  Track 7, titled \\"Diary,\\" has a lovely notion of someone being so trustworthy that you can think of them as \\"pages in your diary.\\"  Wouldn't we all love someone like that with whom to share our secrets?  Track 5, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" is a cute song about a waitress having the courage to call a customer she has a crush on.
B000056VIY|4.0|Well, I found myself forced to make a good note of this record, it's really worthy! I'm not a fan of Jennifer Lopez, but I must admit J.Lo is very catchy. I've listened also to On The 6 and to This Is Me...Then and they were rubbish, but this one rocks! My fav songs are Ain't It Funny, Love Don't Cost a Thing and That's Not Me, and I think That's Not Me is the best song in this cd!! Well, I personally think Jennifer could have chosen it as single but evidently she did differently...doesn't matter, it remains my fav song aswell!! The reason why this is her only good album for me is that the songs are different from each other, there aren't only slow boooooooring tracks! Some songs are very r&b, others have a latin mark, others are almost dance. Of course there are some slow songs and they are the only ones I don't like. Nothing against slow songs, but they are toooo slow!! They get boring, even annoying! By the way if you're looking 4 something of Jennifer absolutely buy this, it's great!!
B00079FUI6|1.0|I don' like these women at all. <br /> They make me feel sick. <br /> They are so desperete. <br />
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I have to admit it, this record is cool! Almost all the songs (well, they aren't so many)are enjoyable. My fav are All The Things She Said and Stars, but I liked also the remake of How Soon Is Now. Good music, their voices ain't bad...their cd could have been worse, really! Anyway the fact remains, they are 2 simple craps. They have found a great way to get famous immediately, they know that being [...] is a bit \\"fashion\\" nowadays. They could have shown to the world their musical talent without being fake lesbians! They don't like singing but making scandalous things (and I'm not referring to their [...] but to the fact that they wanted to kiss in the videoclips just to make world talk of them...I hate these kind of things! Nothing against [...] people!). Apart from this, 200 km/h in the wrong lane remains an appreciable album.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Okay, I remember writing a review about this album last Xmas, and I didn't think it was good AT ALL. BUT I WAS WRONG!<br /><br />I guess the fact that I also got a Green Day and a HIM album kind of overshadowed a fantastic album. And that's what this album is. F*****G fantastic! The best songs are \\"The Ghost Of You\\", \\"Cemetery Drive\\", \\"Give 'Em Hell Kid\\" and \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\". Buy it, damn you!
0679428895|4.0|\\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris is a fictional account of the four days leading up to the erution of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. that buried the city of Pompeii and killed many people.  This is a fast-paced, easy-to-read novel, and I found it very interesting and entertaining. The description of the eruption in itself makes the book worth reading.  I think this book would make a terrific movie.
B00005N8JG|4.0|Good collection of ambient tunes that you can enjoying listening to over and over.
B000005GYI|5.0|As a Belo Horizonte's citizen I have seen Milton Nascimento sometimes at the cafes, walking in the streets or at the \\"Palacio das Artes\\" (yes, Palace of Arts), a very famous local theatre.     Milton, here, in Minas Gerais (state) is known as an icon of Brazilian Music and he is very simple and sympathetic man.    Clube da Esquina (Corner's Club) is a real place. It was a point of reunion of that musicians.    One single comment about Belo Horizonte city. Recent reviwer says B.H. is far away from brazilian coast. It's ok. But there is a much more important detail: Belo Horizonte is one of the brazilian highlands. We have mountains around us and Milton music reflects this state of mind. Sounds like a message from a brazilian highlander introspective heart to the people. IMHO Milton music will sound more clear through these glasses.
0553573403|4.0|This was one of the most engaging books I've read recently. There are a lot of characters, and it takes a while to introduce them, but once they're introduced, things move along at a fast clip. This book is no Lord of the Rings rip-off. There's court intrigue, political machinations, sex, violence, brutality and warfare. It is one of the most realistic fantasy novels I've read in a while, with wonderfully drawn characters and a plot with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading. Be warned, though, it's not a short, light read, and it took me over 200 pages to truly get into it, hence its not being marked a 5 star book.
B000099T2L|1.0|I don't like this record. The first single was a promise but the album really really disappointed me. Fortunately I didn't buy it, a friend of mine gave it to me and he didn't like it too (I guess he liked only the girl, *lol*). All the songs are slow and soooo boring, they never change. When I put this cd on the player I feel like I wanna skeep EVERYTHING! The only songs I would save are the singles (Crazy in Love which I LOVE, Baby Boy, Nasty Girl) and maybe Hip Hop Star. It's not so good but has got a good \\"hip hoppy\\" rhythm, which I really like. If you don't wanna feel disappointed like me don't buy this album! Of course if u don't love slowtempo r&b songs...if u expect upbeat songs, better to buy Destiny's Child!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay has done it again with this CD. Each song has a unique sound and potential hit quality. If you liked the last you will love this one.
B000005RSW|4.0|If you are a true fan of Manowar and their 'true metal' style, you would do yourself a great injustice by passing this album over. Yes, it is the rarest of all of the titles to find in the stores. No, it does not have that 'explosive' production sound that all of the releases after would have (or even the remasters for that matter). I would agree that this is like a Manowar \\"unplugged\\" type album. Very stripped down and basic. The interesting thing to note here is that with the exception of the title song, this entire album was recorded at the same time as \\"Hail to England\\". The differences between the two have more to do, I think, with a change of labels and post production than anything else. However, this is a fine album that even I, an extreme Manowar fan, am guilty of overlooking from time to time. <br />Much faster paced than the two previous records, \\"Sign of the Hammer\\" starts out with the obligatory metal anthem that is trademark Manowar. Some have accused these songs as being \\"cheesey\\" as others have made the comment about this being the last of their \\"old sound\\". In all honesty, there is no \\"old sound\\". Manowar always has and always will progress intheir abilities while still remaining true to where they began. Few, if any, bands can honestly lay claim to that. As far as cheesey lyrics, well come on! This is 1984 and yet their FOURTH album since their 1982 debut. If you are old enough to reme,ber what 1984 was really like in terms of music, EVERYTHING was cheesey. Even heavy metal, with sparse exceptions. 'Mountains' is an excelent track. This is one of those Manowar inspirational/strength songs that they have come to be masters of. Unfortunately, knuckle-dragging musical nit-wits lose patience on these kind of songs that Manowar does. As they would prefer the talentless speed smashings of, say, Slayer than to listen to heavy metal that need not always be fast because the people playing it are actual musicians who know how to read, write, compose, and play music with a singer who can actually sing. Which brings me to 'Thunderpick', the Joey DeMaio bass solo that, once again, carries the tradition started in the first album. As one reveiwer stated, \\"might be impressive from a musicians point of view, but as a listener, well, it's just random noise.\\" To that I have this to say: If it's just random noise you hear, you need to educate yourself in music more. This bass solo is OBVIOUSLY set in a Spanish Flamenco guitar style. If you know anything about Flamenco, it is a very difficult style to master as it goes all around the fretboard. Once again, this proves that Joey has some very serious abilties to back up his words about Manowar being the best. I know this is going to sound lame, but, even my mother who grew up on classical music, classical guitar, and opera was impressed years ago when she heard this and the following song 'Guyana(cult of the damned)' coming through my bedroom wall when I was a kid. She recognized the styles and background of the music. It is because I grew up being exposed and educated in all forms of music, particularly the centuries tested classics, that I am able to recognize Manowar for what they are. True musicians who know how to play well. And they do it hard and LOUD!!!! So it is written in the book of world records.
B000001EC1|2.0|I have always had a soft-spot for 80s rock. I grew up on Van Halen, Motley Crue, Poison, Def Leopard, RATT, Skid Row, etc. So you'd think I'd love Bon Jovi, right? Wrong! I have always hated Bon Jovi.<br /><br />I actually think they are a talented band. Ritchie Sambora is a talented player and can definitely write catchy riffs and solo. The rest of the band is competent enough. I think Bon Jovi had the potential to be a good band. So, what is my main problem with them?<br /><br />First, although the band has written some catchy songs-the band, along with Desmond Child (who is the kiss of death to anything cool) finds a way to ruin it; by making it overly glossy, radio-friendly and assessable. Bon Jovi's music is completely wimpy and lightweight and lacks any real substance.<br /><br />Second, I utterly hate Jon Bon Jovi. He has a good voice, I'll give him that. But he is a lightweight, candy-ass who isn't a tenth as good as Diamond David Lee Roth or Axl Rose, or even Vince Neil or Brett Michaels.<br /><br />Bon Jovi's music is corporate pap aimed at 12 year-old girls. If you want to get into some good 80s rock-pick up Guns N' Roses \\"Appetite For Destruction,\\" Van Halen's \\"1984\\" or Motley Crue's \\"Shout at the Devil.\\" If you must buy a Bon Jovi album (and stink up your collection) then buy this.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album has some many styles, so many themes, that it takes a couple listens to truely appreciate it. I definitely would say that it is the greatest album I have ever heard. It is not a cd for just hard-core music lovers, it is called a punk cd but it has a little bit of everything. I recommend this for everyone but Britney Spears fans.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I purchased this title after buying \\"Cold Roses\\"  It is a good cd but \\"Cold Roses\\" is definitely my personal preference.
B00005R2M3|4.0|A few words are enough to describe this record: very good! Some songs ain't that special, but some others are very original. Of course I love Whenever Wherever (this single immediately captured me as I had never heard of Shakira before....when I saw her for the first time I just thought she was a good copy of Britney Spears!), but there are also other songs which worth a listen!! Sometimes Shakira's voice, which is really powerful, annoyes me. It's cute but maybe I don't like the way she sings, but that's ok. If u have the occasion to, buy this cd!! U won't be disappointed!!
B000002J1Y|5.0|If you only know the one or two songs by Yes that made it to the top ten and got on the radio way back when, or if you only know one of their studio albums or their later work after the classic period, you don't know a lot about Yes.  Comparing one of those top ten bits to some of the live Yes classics on this CD set, is like comparing a little Shakespeare sonnet to one of Shakespeare's great plays.  Also, the live concert work that fills this album is far superior to Yes' studio work.  This CD set captures Yes at their peak, when for a few years they reached pure genius.<br /><br />With Yes, however, it is good to be advised: they are not for everyone.  But if you have the patience to listen two or three times to a piece, there is a good chance you will find yourself falling very deeply in love.<br /><br />This is especially true of the gorgeous, wild and sometimes extensive instrumental stretches that go on between the often lovely vocal parts of the songs.  At first you might not hear anything much in all this instrumental work.  But once your ear is caught, there is nothing else like Yes.  If you like the guitar work of classic Creme's Eric Clapton, or of Jimi Hendrix, you ain't heard nothing yet.  Yes's Steve Howe, as a guitarist, once you really listen, is arguably a full quantum leap or two above anyone you've heard before.  It's not just that he's capable of playing a lightning fast series of notes.  It's not just that he can play more intricate rhythms and textures at that incredible speed than other great guitarists can play at one-quarter of that speed; it's that with technical virtuosity the equal and superior of anyone out there, Howe combined imaginative genius and the most beautiful, furiously driving, guitar lines.<br /><br />To get an idea of the miraculous cascade of guitar notes that precedes the first vocals (themselves beautiful) on \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", a flood of guitar notes that just might be the most glorious thing ever done with a guitar, for example, you'd have to fuse images of the greatest and most furious chase or action film you ever viewed, together with an image of the awesome richness and subtlety of the greatest impressionist paintings (when those paintings are seen in person).<br /><br />Into his overarching rock genius, Howe fused both classical and country to produce a highly disciplined, yet incomparably wild, driving, furious and dynamic sound.  I am speaking of Yes back in the 70s, classic Yes.  The later stuff is sometimes good, but not GREAT in the sense in which classic, 70s Yes hit the stratosphere.<br /><br />It is not just Howe that makes this band.  Wakemen plays a rather miraculous rock and roll keyboard that is imbued with his classical virtuosity, and Squire plays what should be called a brilliant 'lead bass'.  Anderson writes and sings some gorgeous melodies, with lovely vocal harmonies added by Squire and Howe.<br /><br />Howe's guitar work during the first minute or so of \\"Close to the Edge\\", is to me a miracle that grows on me the more I listen to it, and to me was alone more than worth the price of this CD set.  There is also an amazingly gorgeous and wild duet between Howe and Yes' genius bass player, Chris Squire, in the middle of \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\".<br /><br />The rhythms of Yes' songs are often very complex, and way beyond the capacity of most rock bands.  This stuff is light-years beyond the old 'three-chord' rock and roll.<br /><br />A lot of music is included in this album -- the equivalent of three LPs' worth (three long-playing records' worth).
B000002IPZ|5.0|This is a very underrated album I think, I think it's even better than The Legacy, don't get me wrong, I love The Legacy, but I think they got better each album, this was released in 1990 after the awesome \\"Practice What You Preach\\", pretty much the same formula, but it is effective, the production isn't as good as on Practice What You Preach, because the fans back then wanted it to sound like \\"The New Order\\" but it fits the music well, Chuck Billy is a great vocalist, and really shines on this album, the vocals are echoed, but like I said, it's the production, and it fits, the drums are pushed back, but you can still hear them well, Skolnick and Peterson work together great, just listen to Skolnicks solo on \\"Face in the Sky\\" you will find yourself air-guitaring, and again, Testament pull off another great ballad \\"The Legacy\\" which is nothing short of killer, Billys vocals REALLY shine on this one, and the music is great also, just listen to the intro, great solo too, other standout tracks \\"Falling Fast\\" \\"Seven Days of May\\" \\"Souls of Black\\" they are all good, but I've named the best in my opinion, I'd buy the album, I don't think you'll be dissappointed, THRASH!!!
B0009S4IHY|4.0|When I saw the foreign language DVD from Hong kong when the movie itself wasn't even in theaters, I knew I had to see in the big screen and luckily Netflix invited to a free advance screening.<br />I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie. It is a good mix of action-fantasy, comedy, mysticism and crime caper. I have seen a lot of foreign films from asia and I have to say this film is among my favorites.<br />The movie is not just a action wacky comedy, at times it shows its soul, and delivers a good message to audiences: Everyone deserves a second chance, and do not underestimate your own true potential. Stephen Chow really does have a profound respect for KUNG-FU. It has the humor of looney tunes and the dark humor of Quintin Tarantino films. The movie reveals the hidden mysticism of Kung-Fu, I for one do not like movies with too much wire work, with exaggerated fight scenes but this was done decently, YUEN WOO-PING(KILL BILL, THE MATRIX, HERO) is an excellent fight choreographer. Those fighting styles really does exist in Martial arts, however a bit exaggerated. I've seen SHAOLIN MONKS do perform the Buddhist Palm, the toad technique, the five shaolin kicks etc. The movie does praise the Chinese Martial Arts at the same time adapted it to a very entertaining screenplay.<br />The story is about people who live in the poorest part of the city, who unintentionally gets mixed up with the foremost crime gang at the time, the Axe gang. The criminals got more than they bargained for when they had to deal with 5 Masters who only wanted to live in peace. There is also death and despair but I don't want to spoil it for anyone else. To sum it up, near the end, a true KUNG-FU master was revealed.<br />The fight scenes were humorously great and the last battle with the ultimate killer was short but awesome. Yeh-Baby!! The CGI effects was also pretty good and fits the atmosphere of the movie.<br />The bottom line is: ENJOY THE MOVIE, you are in for quite a RIDE. This is not a movie for people who think they can only appreciate intelligent movies. I saw it 5 times and I haven't gotten tired of it.<br />The dvd quality is great. It contains bothe subtitled and Dubbed versions. However, I prefer the movie with subtitles. The script is much more effective than the Dubbed version. Picture and sound quality are outstanding!!eople who think they can only appreciate intelligent movies. I saw it 5 times and I haven't gotten tired of it.  The dvd quality is great.

038073186X|3.0|I hate to be the skunk but if you figure out the gimmick early, this one is torture. Every fiction writer will guess it well before halfway. About that same point, the quality of Lehane's writing declines steeply. I suspect that he doubted he had pulled it off.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest book from a very good writer.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is supreme!! That's all!! I've always liked Christina Aguilera (apart from her bitchness), at least she has got a wonderful voice, one of the best ever!! I'll tell you the songs I don't like, which are the minority: Keep On Singing My Song, Loving Me For Me and Underappreciated. I don't listen very gladly to Impossible and Walk Away, but they're not bad, they show Christina's amazing voice. My fav ones are I'm ok (very sad and touching, also coz the lyrics are real), Soar, The Voice Within and Infatuation, but it's difficult to choose coz I would say also Beautiful, Cruz, Can't Hold Us Down and so I would name all the songs apart from those I don't like! You may hate Christina Aguilera for her slutty behaviour but she's talented, I hope that if she'll give up being a bitch and she'll start singing SERIOUSLY it won't be too late.
6305076995|4.0|My love of classic Yes -- particularly the live performances of \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Yours Is No Disgrace,\\" on the old Yessongs album, led me to purchase this visual DVD, in part because I needed to actually see Steve Howe's fingers moving over the frets during my favorite parts.<br /><br />The opening minute or so of \\"Close to the Edge\\" on the old live audio album, Yessongs, for example, is, to me, an absolute miracle of guitar playing by Steve Howe -- someone who at his peak in the 1970s combined phenomenal intricacy of rhythm and texture with phenomenal speed, and a sense of unbeatable wildness with classical discipline, and beauty.  He was a wonderful fusion of the classic and romantic, the formal and the informal, Vivaldi, Country and the most lovely Rock.  So I was disappointed to find that those who filmed the performance rather foolishly filmed, not Steve's fingers on the frets during those moments of incomparable genius during the first minute of so of \\"Close to the Edge\\" -- instead, unbelievably, the DVD shows a half minute of images of amoebas bifurcating and so on, as one hears the music unfolding in the background.  How could they fail to put this man's fingers and face on film at the moment of his remarkable peak?<br /><br />Similarly, during \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" when Howe is playing the longish, brilliant rapid cascading run of intricately shaped notes that precedes the first vocals of the song -- to me, perhaps the most glorious guitar run in the history of music -- truly a full quantum leap above all the other great guitar players I've heard -- a run I can only picture to you by asking you to combine an image of the delicacy and sense of vastness of the greatest impressionist paintings (seen in person), together with an image of the greatest, fastest action or chase sequences you ever saw in any Hollywood blockbuster.  Unbelievable drama, brilliantly adept dynamism, indeed heroism, fused with ethereal sublimity.  Sometimes, to listen to classic Howe playing guitar, sounds a bit like a classically trained humming bird's invisibly fast wings must be playing the notes, or perhaps it's that time slowed down for Howe, so that despite the incredible speed of the notes, he was able to shape them, and establish remarkably complex rythmic patterns in the midst of that dramatic speed.  And above all, so pleasing to the ear (though one might have to listen a couple of times before the beauty of it begins to dawn).  And despite all the synthesizers and electronic gizmos available to him and, as I understand, innovated by him, he usually chose a wonderfully raw, pure rock guitar sound.<br /><br />And what were the filmakers doing during this mighty run of notes by Howe?  Incredibly, they were filming not Steve Howe's miraculous fingers working the frets, but Chris Squire, bless him, who was not even doing anything much at that moment.  Sheesh.<br /><br />For those who know the old Yessongs live album/CD, I should note that the performance of Yours Is No Disgrace on that album is not the same as the performance on this DVD.  The great longish sort of duet in the middle of the song between Howe and Squire --where Squire interjects every few seconds or so some bass note or other that wonderfully accents Howe's gorgeous lead -- that section, I would say, is not as well done in the concert that was recorded on this DVD -- but it is still great to see Howe on the DVD working out another version (earlier inchoate version?) of the themes worked out so brilliantly on the classic audio recording Yessongs.<br /><br />For those who really love Yes, this DVD is definitely worth it, despite any downsides.  There are other live performances on DVD, but I haven't got those yet.
B000002ITM|4.0|In my opinion, this is Testament's version of Metallica's \\"The Black Album\\", it's slow compared to the prior Testament releases, very sludgy, though not a bad CD at all, it's just sludgy Thrash for the most part, Skolnicks last album with the band, James Murphy joined on \\"Low\\", the production is top quality, better production than Souls of Black, but the music isn't quite as good, I like all Testament, but this is my least favorite, but by no means do I hate it, it's experimental, like I said above, it is Testament's version of The Black Album, but this album has something that The Black Album doesn't, heaviness, yes it's slow, but it's heavy in the slow way, Chuck Billys vocals rule of course, shines even more on this album, it was Skolnicks idea to go slower, but his work on it is quite good, and Peterson has some nice heavy riffs, it is kind of mainstream, but they deserved a little attention, for being such a great band, fans of old Testament, not sure if you'll like it, if you have an openmind, you should like it, I did, but if you're looking for FastThrash, get the earlier albums, released in 1992, a year after The Black Album, and again, Testament do another ballad \\"Return to Serenity\\" it's the only Testament ballad I don't care for, it's just something is missing from it, I don't skip over it though, it's just not that great, best tracks \\"Electric Crown\\" \\"The Ritual\\" \\"Deadline\\", there are alot of fillers on it, but some of them aren't bad like \\"Let Go Of My World\\" or \\"As The Seasons Grey\\" \\"So Many Lies\\", the other ones are ok, but those are the best, if you have an openmind, you should like it, if you don't, don't get it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I'd like to think \\"Sin City\\" is one of those movies you either love or hate. I happen to be on the demographic that loved the movie. While not perfect in any sense of the word, \\"Sin City\\" is a truly visually engaging experience, and a wonderful adaptation of Frank Miller's namesake novel series.<br /><br />Prior to the release of the movie, I read the books, and what I later saw on the screen was practically a carbon copy. Sure, that means I wasn't truly surprised by the end, but really, it's rare that you get to see sure a great adaptation from the page to the screen. Atop that, I honestly think that \\"Sin City\\" is a fabulously shot film, almost every shot and angle is perfect, no flaws. Sure, I think there are some roles that could be better cast, but the people in the film, they did their best, and it paid off - creating what will probably be one of the best films of 2005.
1573223026|1.0|This book was surprisingly bad--a real disappointment for me as I enjoyed two of his earlier novels, High Fidelity and About a Boy.  As I neared the end of this novel I got the sense that it must have been an earlier work re-shuffled to meet a contractual obligation.  In fact it seemed more like a low-budget writing class assignment:  \\"What would happen if four really dissimilar people found themselves together on a ledge, considering suicide?  Explore and expand.\\"  Not worth your time.
0316172324|4.0|This book was very interesting to me, though I will admit it got boring at parts.  Some sections were just very repetitive and seemed to be overkill, but the overall message the book sent was intriguing.  It helped me understand the way the mind works and how people use this knowledge of their minds for good or evil.  No, I wouldn't read this book if I didn't have a good understanding of the English language.  And no, I most likely will never use the information I gained from this book for anything other than answers to Jeopardy questions or a means to impress someone.  However, if you're interesting in the way that the mind works, I suggest this book.  It's not as overly confusing as many other books about the same topic and it uses real-life experiences to help you understand what is trying to be conveyed.
B000A78Z82|5.0|Devendra Banhart has had five releases in the past three years. He has been a force in what has been called \\"New Weird America\\" along with Joanna Newsom and Antony and the Johnsons. While he has become a sensation in England, he is still very underground in America. They love quirky people over there. His music has been used in a commercial in the UK. On his first three albums, you felt he had used up all his material. Cripple Crow is like a brand new start. It's like \\"Now we accept you Devendra, what can you do for us?\\" He has also broken off from Young God Records and become part of the system. A little of this new music was presaged last fall when Banhart toured with a full band. Andy Cabic and Noah Georgeson were in this band. They took a bunch of his intimate numbers and made them more rocking. They were a party band. There are some songs that recall past greatest like \\"Now That I Know,\\" \\"Long Haired Child,\\" and \\"Chinese Children.\\" These songs have a big sense of humor about them. \\"Santa Maria Da Feira\\" is one of the songs sung in Spanish. One wonders why Banhart doesn't do a whole album in that language. Even some of his previous songs could be done in a new language. \\"Heard Some Say\\" is his most anti-war political song, which has the phrase \\"We don't want to kill.\\" Songs about animals populate this album like \\"Lazy Butterfly,\\" Dragonflies,\\" and Mama Wolf.\\" There is an overall mellowness on this record. It's a very relaxed feeling that permeates the sound. There is a bunch of knee slapping moments. It's a good time band feeling. It could be party music, to dance to. Banhart gives us a lot of songs here. It has a distinction of being the most together album he has ever made. He is very consistent.
B00005JNTX|3.0|This film's over the top violence reminded me of \\"Natural Born Killers\\", but this film was infinitely better directed and had a much better story line.  I can certainly see how many people can love this film and find it terribly exciting.  I can likewise see how others will rate the film 1 star, based on the fact that the three interesting stories may soon be forgotten but that the graphic, horrible images may stick around for much longer. <br /> <br />I don't think it can be overstated that this film is not for children.  In fact, anyone who would let someone under 12 watch this should literally be charged with child abuse.  The director appears to revel in graphic human torture; even the \\"heroes\\" in the story prefer torture to accomplishing a mission (or maybe torturing an adversary IS the mission).  This is the kind of film, even more than the name implies, is about the dark side of mankind.  Some will say that some characters are heroic, but even Bruce Willis brings much pain to the world by not finishing off a killer, prefering instead to torture him.  The writer really went after police and the clergy, ranking them well below prostitutes who tend to have a heart of gold. <br /> <br />All that aside, the story lines are good and the film is extremely creative and well made.  Given the level of violence, I would normally turn a film like this off, but this film's creativity, storylines, and film quality keep me watching.  It was an enjoyable film, but I didn't think it was great. <br /> <br />One of the attractions of the film was the all star cast.  Here's how the actors fared: <br />Bruce Willis - Great job.  He IS his character. Wow. A+ <br />Benicio Del Toro - Also excellent.  A+ performance as expected from someone of his caliber. <br />Micky Rourke - The most overated actor in Hollywood finally hits a Home Run. - A+. <br />Clive Owen - Shows much more here than in \\"Closer\\" - A <br />Jessica Alba - Although very attrative, doesn't bring more than looks to the film. B- <br />Elijah Wood - I keep looking for Gandalf when he was on screen - C, but not really his fault. <br />Brittany Murphy - Better than expected performance - B+ <br />Rosario Dawson - Miscast in her role - C <br />Nick Stahl - He fits his character - A <br /> <br />The others, such as Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, and Josh Hartnett do well in their brief performances.  Devon Aoki gets noticed. <br /> <br />Overall, this film is not for everyone, but if you're not too offended by wallowing in violence and discussions of raping and torturing children, you'll probably find you enjoy the film and possibly even love it.  Although there is a lot of violence, there is also a lot to like about the film. <br />
0345475674|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this trip back in time.  Not knowing alot about history I don't know how accurate it is but who cares!!!  What a great story to get lost in.  It's hard for me to let go and flow with books and tv/movies, but I slid right into this one!!  Sit back and enjoy.  A must read
B00001U0DP|5.0|This moving was so touching. It's so heartwarming how a parent will do anything to spare their child pain. I cried, laughed, cried, laughed, and cried again. I definitely recommend it.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|If you are a fan of Dragonball GT, Inuyasha or Gigantor, you'd love this movie. It's anime in celluloid form. The charcters are rich and well developed, the special effects are hilarious, and the overall action is great.
B0002OERI0|4.0|American Idioit is the newest cd from mega group Green Day. This Cd is fantastic. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because \\"Boulivard of Broken Dreams\\" other than that this cd is great.
B000002B7U|4.0|Let me not offend anyone with this, Ok? A couple years back me and a couple of friends were making a movie called HIROSHIMA: THE MUSICAL. The theme song to our movie was THANK GOD FOR THE BOMB by OZZY \\"nuke ya nuke ya\\" get it?<br /><br />Ok anyway before I go to far I will just continue on saying that, as a kid, I hated this album. I no doubt called it Ozzy's worst, but now I realize that I really go for this 80's product. Some of the sound is very cheesy, but thats what the 80's were all about. Granted Ozzy should have been on hilt with Guns or Crue or Metallica, but he wasn't. Between 86 and 90 Ozzy was a clown. (Make sure you've seen the video for SHOT IN THE DARK before arguing that point.)<br /><br />BUT, as I was saying ULTIMATE SIN has many plusses and little minuses. Its just not BLIZZ or DIARY, its SECRET LOSER and KILLER OF GIANTS. YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT! GO GET IT!
B000002IQW|5.0|Like a lot of people said around this changing are when Nirvana whacked all the \\"guys playing guitars several hours a day trying to be faster than Van Halen\\" (Lars Ulrich), Skid Row arrived with a very bad market timing on the general Hard Rock Scene. <br />However who listens so much Dinosaur Junior, first Pearl Jam albums (First 2 are the best in my opinion), Pavement, Soundgarden ? Hard Rock is still there and quality songwriting, catchy tune, heavy sound are still the recipe for success... at least for longlasting fans. <br /> <br />This album is a really heavy one in a lot of aspects, it has some creative songs like Monkey Business, Quicksand Jesus and in a Darkened Room as well as some really fast and rockin' one : Riot Act, Mudkicker, Get the f*ck out.... <br /> <br />And for these who don't know Bach : listen to his voice! I find him even better than W AXEL ROSE
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|First, I'll say that I got exactly what I expected out of it, which was a fairly neat, albeit brainless, action flick.  By brainless, I mean exactly that.  The entire movie is a blatant deus ex machina designed to bring back Sephiroth for one last fight, so there's absolutely no new character development.  In the end, Advent Children is nothing but a glorified side story because none of the plot threads left hanging in the game are resolved.    The CG is impressive, but the detail on the characters is a noticable step back from what was seen in The Spirits Within, although their movements are much cleaner.  The biggest problem with the movie is the direction of the fight scenes.  Camera angles change horrendously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but it winds up just making certain scenes jumbled and confusing and detracts heavily from the overall experience.    Basically, the tone of it is exactly what you'd expect from a Final Fantasy movie and it's precisely what fans have been clamoring for.  It's fast-paced and very fantasy-oriented, even going so far as to include summons and limit breaks from the game.  However, as a serious film, it falls very flat compared to The Spirits Within, which does stand on its own as a fairly engaging piece of filmmaking, even if it wasn't to the liking of Final Fantasy fans.    Also, don't think that giving me Not Useful ratings is hurting my feelings in any way.  All it does is prove my superiority over fanboys/fangirls who don't realize that the point here isn't to praise the thing, but to share our thoughts on it.  If my objective opinion threatens you so much, you're barking up the wrong tree in your attempt at revenge.
B00006AW2G|4.0|Being a Brian Jones Rolling Stones fan, this one is bitter-sweet because I enjoy the songs which are all wonderful but it marks the time when Brian was fired from the band, and died on July 3rd 1969 at the age of 27, the day the electric version of Honky Tonk Women was released as a single. He is credited only with \\"playing\\" on 2 songs, \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You got the Silver\\", which I i don't hear where any \\"percussion\\" or autoharp stands out. Were they humoring him? Not a respectful way to honor the founding Stone. This is also the beginning of the Mick Taylor era. The Stones career can be broken down in to three parts, one for each of the three different lead guitar players the band has had. Brian Jones representing the first, Mick Taylor the middle, and Ronnie Wood the last up until the present.  <br />Having said that, this was the second in a consecutive series of four of the best Rolling Stones albums . The first being Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972) <br /> <br />It's a great classic rock album that everyone should own. <br /> <br />It SOUNDS like the 60's from the first track \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" which has desperation in the music that you can feel, along the lines of the Four Tops \\"Reach out/I'll be There\\", and other groups who captured the mood and feeling of the time.   <br /> <br />I very much enjoy the \\"unplugged\\" Country Tonk (Honky tonk Women) Sometimes the Stones songs run on and on too long, for example Midnight Rambler. Check out Robert Johnson for the real Love in Vain. I really like The Rolling Stones Rock 'n roll songs that they wrote like Satisfaction and prefer to hear the real artist when it comes to the blues and R&B. That goes for Zeppelin and Clapton and the rest. They owe the delta a lot of thanks, but at the same time they turned a lot of people on to Howlin Wolf and Elmore James etc. and helped bring blues to the mainstream which was Brian Jones' initial vision for the band.<br /> <br />\\"Greatest Rock'n Roll band in the World\\"? Absolutely!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is crazy, classic, and eminems best. I dont have much to say but JUST GO PICK IT UP.
B000063DFS|5.0|I tried to do this song with my band at a Church Talent contest called MR TINKERTRAIN. We would have done it to if we could have gotten it perfected in time. We decided to do N.I.B instead (It still got us banned from the show so all was well)<br /><br />This was a hand me down from an uncle of mine. I was a SABBATH fan for years before I even knew of OZZY solo stuff. This was my first OZZ record, I was ten years old. The next day I had officially turned into a maniac. Now I had things to whisper to the girls in school \\"would you like some sweeeties little girl, come a little closer....\\"<br /><br />And of course the other songs on this disc ROCK TOO. THEY all are very excellent but my recommendations are:<br /><br />DESIRE: (starts off a four song BLITZ)<br /><br />NO MORE TEARS: (continues this craze)<br /><br />S.I.N: (SO F'IN GOOD I CANT STAND IT!)<br /><br />HELLRAISER: (THATS MOTORHEAD IN THE BACKGROUND DUDE!!!!!)<br /><br />ROAD TO NOWHERE: (very good ballad)<br /><br />FOR a few years at the end of the eighties it looked bad for OZZY and Co. It looked as if he was truly going crazy.<br /><br />Maybe he did, but 1991 found him more sophisticated than ever and he looked like it was his show again. NO MORE TEARS is withoubt a doubt in my favorite OZZY pile. Worthy to be seated at the same table with BLIZZ and DIARY.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I have read literally dozens of reviews below where people laud Kill Bill 2 and praise Tarantino for the work he has done in 'elevating genres', 'recreating lost arts' and many other phrases that people have written to feel part of the Tarantino club. Yet I write this to defy all of that. Just because people TELL you a movie is good, doesn't mean it actually is. <br /> <br />Kill Bill volume 2 is one of history's worst movies. There, I've said it. At the very least, certainly one of the worst movies to receive hype on a large scale. Tarantino has created the Kill Bill movies as a way to showcase and pay homage to old genres that he so greatly revered, but in the process he managed to convince many people that this is actually a good movie as well. It's not. The story is dull and plodding, with two-and-a-half hours of nothing to sit through. <br /> <br />The characters sit at both ends of the talent spectrum. Characters such as The Bride, Elle Driver and Pai Mei are wonderfully crafted and should be enjoyed as such, but unfortunately Bill and Bud are just wastes of time. Boring performances are delivered from seemingly boring and under-talented actors. I understand the very Tarantino-esque idea of using a guy like David Carradine to portray Bill, but he should have got someone who can act instead. <br /> <br />As usual the music and cinematography are amazing, but Tarantino's tendency to change cinematography styles purely because he feels like it - rather than because it would be better for the scene - makes too many scenes worse than they should have been. However, one thing I will never fault Tarantino on is his selection of music. Both Kill Bill soundtracks are fantastic, with (I believe) Kill Bill 1's being slightly better. But that's mostly for Santa Esmerelda's mesmerising 'Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' playing during the memorable fight scene with Lucy Liu in the snow. <br /> <br />But of course, the main point and main detraction is that the story itself is an utter yawn-fest. If you can sit through 150 minutes of a 20 minute storyline and claim to enjoy it, then you probably deserve to watch it again. I personally found Kill Bill volume 1 too gory until the Bride came to Japan, where it became a spectacularly entertaining movie, but I can understand if others thought differently. Kill Bill 2 is not like that. The action is limited at best, the story plods along at a snail's pace and the cinematography and any plot twists are ruined by Tarantino's slavish homage to masters of genres that died long ago for good reason. <br /> <br />If you are a student of film, or someone who actively works in the industry than I apologise for your sake. I can completely understand why you would like this movie and be intrigued by it. It is a fascinating blend of genres and an intricate look at how Tarantino's mind works, creating a fusion of concepts and ideas. However, this does not detract from the fact that this is a very bad movie for the average viewer. Slow story, self-indulgent cinematography and some very poor acting in parts. <br /> <br />I don't pretend to be someone in the industry but I am someone who loves movies of all genres and embraces new ideas and visions. You will get no argument from me that Tarantino is a brilliant man. But this simply is not a good movie.
B00005JNTX|3.0|this was an incredibly well-made film. robert rodriguez, veteran of the \\"el mariachi\\" series, and guest director tarantino do a fine job of directing an excellent cast. rourke, willis, wood, dawson, and alba all turn in brilliant performances. and the look of the film is truly breath-taking. despite the fact that all the scenery is pretty obviously cgi generated, it's still spot on, corresponding almost exactly to miller's unique illustration style. the city is dirty, gritty, sexy, dangerous.<br /><br />however, the underlying message of the movie is one that i find infuriating, which is probably more of a problem with frank miller than with the cast and crew. despite the fact that the film features strong, independent female characters, like gail, the gun-toting dominatrix of old town fame, these powerful women still are forced to go running to men for protection when the going gets really tough.in order to communicate the message that violence and exploitation of women is wrong, miller creates a world of violence and exploitation. the series is clearly an attempt by a man to integrate himself into modern feminist canon. it tells us that girls do indeed kick ass, but they still need men to defend them. that women are strong, but men will always be stronger. while i don't agree with the other side of this argument either, that a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle, i still feel as if miller's intentions are hypocritical at best.<br /><br />so definitely watch this film. it's worth a viewing. it's visually stunning, violent, exciting, and perverse. just try not to think about it too much, because it's bound to leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth, particularly if you happen to be female.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|I know a lot of punk rockers, man. I know a lot of punk rock, though I've never really dug on much of it but the classics. By this I mean the stuff that is called \\"punk\\" now, but was around before punk was even any kind of label.<br /><br />The way I see it, punk innovators (much like the metal innovators) never followed a formula. A lot of the times they experimented with a bunch of sounds before they realized what it was all about for them.<br /><br />THE STOOGES on their 1970 album FUNHOUSE were still experimenting with different sounds and techniques. Its not as PUNK as RAW POWER perhaps (its actually got a lot of slow burning, jazz type jams) its more of a free style session.<br /><br />While my punk rock friends were spiking their mohawks and skating to RAW POWER I was getting baked to FUNHOUSE.<br /><br />I've noticed that the new release has an entire disc of outakes. I am definatley looking into this immediatley. Early outakes from the STOOGES don't dissapoint.<br /><br />Punk rockers, I say open your ears to some of these extended jam type tracks. there are quite a few in the early Stooges belt and most are worth a listen.<br /><br />Just let this one play through and smoke a J. Lay back and soak it in. Calming of chaos.
B000002A33|4.0|This is an awesome album BUT:<br /><br />The first three songs on this album pretty much start off where Sweet Oblivion left off.. Start of with a rocker \\"Halo of Ashes\\", insert an absolute classic \\"All I know\\". throw in a ballad \\"Look at You\\" and you have the makings of another classic... Then...<br /><br />The album just seems to bog down.. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding album, but it is not as diverse as Sweet Oblivion. Mark Lanegan never sounded as good as he did on Dust, and the quality of the musicianship is great, but the song writing isn't as good as Sweet Oblivion. You would think that after a four year hiatus (a hiatus that pretty much killed the band) there would be a more diverse collection of songs.<br /><br />Probably the most striking song on the album is Dime Western.  For anyone who has ever seen Jesus Christ Superstar, if you remember the part where Judas is running to hang himself, the guitar riff in this song sounds almost exactly like the music that is playing in the backround.  Throw in an \\"Iron Butterly\\"esque melotron and it is freaky.. Then to go into a song called \\"Gospel Plow\\"...<br /><br />Do I recommend this album? Heck yeah, it's just a shame that this was their swan song, they really had more to offer.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|ugh. i'm a huge south park fan and i love matt stone and trey parker, but i hated this movie. it was funny, certainly; in fact it was laugh-out-loud funny at many points. but it was also just plain dumb. i much prefer it when parker and stone restrict themselves to zaniness and gross-out humor than when they attempt to editorialize about our nation's foreign policy. because politics isn't funny. not even with puppets. south park episodes like \\"bin laden has farty pants\\" met with an equal lack of enthusiasm from me. it seems like our nation was in crisis and parker and stone just had to put their two cents in, but they mask their political message with a healthy slathering of fart and penis jokes. i think they need to go one way or the other: either satire, or madcap ridiculousness, not both at the same time.<br /><br />on the upside, the movie features lots of puppet violence, explosions, and a sort of graphic marionette sex scene (i mean, it's as graphic as a sex scene can be when it features dolls with no genitalia). and kim jong il's solo \\"i'm so ronery\\" is hilarious. overall, though, watching this movie made me feel embarrassed on behalf of stone and parker. if you want to watch a movie by the talented creators of south park, rent orgazmo. orgazmo is awesome.
B00005JNTX|5.0|The actors seem to actually look like the charactors.  The dialog fit the format perfectly.  Sin City is now one of my top ten favorite movies.
0440238609|2.0|When I think of the top tier of fantasy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia come to mind.  These are complex books that work on many levels, tell mulitple stories and are suitable for kids of all ages.  Adults will especially enjoy rereading them (I know I did) years after having read them as a child.  In short, they stand at the top of the fanasty world. <br /> <br />Below them on the second tier you have books like Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever, Hobb's Farseer Trilogy or Williams's War of the Flowers.  All excellent works that have detailed, believable characters, rich plots, imaginative worlds and a wonderful sense of mythos.  However, these authors aren't quite as talented as your first tier authors nor do their stories work on as many levels.  Still they are all worth a place on your book shelf. <br /> <br />Now we get to the third tier books.  It is here that Rowling and Pullman belong.  And before you get too angry hear me out.  The Harry Potter books are interesting and a fun read, but that is it.  There really isn't much of a deeper meaning to them.  Additionally, some of the characters seem one dimensional at times and the plot can be predictable at points.  Not the details mind you but the story line, i.e. the hero is in trouble, the hero must make a choice, the hero narrowly saves the day, etc.  The Harry Potter books are very good reads but they lack depth.  I enjoy them but they don't move me the way something by Donaldson does.  I explained all of that to help you understand my reasoning behind my ratings. <br /> <br />Now we get to Pullman.  I thought his first book, The Golden Compass, was excellent.  Good plotline, diverse characters and a marvellous world fully sucks the reader in.  The main characters aren't very believable for 12 year olds but you tend to ignore that and just go with the flow of the novel.  However, by the time you get to the end of the first book you still really have no idea what is going on.  In fact, the first book doesn't really prepare you at all for the second book, The Subtle Knife.   <br /> <br />In the second book you realize that a main character is trying to make war on Heaven and challenge God.  That is a little out of left field isn't it?  My response when I found out was \\"wow, didn't see that coming\\" and I have a feeling I am not alone in those sentiments.  Now, for an adult who already has an informed opinion about the issues of hell, heaven, angles, demons, God and the like this book might be an interesting and stimulating read.  For a 13 year old kid this book is a bit much.  And it is even more annoying because no real hint of this was given in the first book.   <br /> <br />Yet in spite of all of that the second book is still fairly good.  Not as good as the first but that is due to the author's personal beliefs beginning to shine through a bit more than is needed.  Some people might feel that I am being hypocritical in praising Tolkien for incorporating his Christian beliefs but criticizing Pullman for his atheistic beliefs.  Let me try and explain the difference between the two authors.  Tolkien creates figures and events that look similar to Biblical ideas.  Things such as a Christ-like figure or God's creation of the earth and man.  In reading Tolkien you can see the parallels but they don't distract from the story.  Pullman however seems to be preaching his ideas to us, especially by the third book.  Tolkien never mentions anything about Christianity directly and as a result even atheists can enjoy his book.  Not so with Pullman.  By the time you have gotten to the Amber Spyglass most Christians will be highly offended.  Yet you feed the need to push on so you can at last figure out how everything ends.  As a result you finsih the book with a bad taste in your mouth.  This series would have been excellent if Pullman had left out the anti-religous dogma and focused on the characters instead.  Sadly for us he didn't, choosing rather to hammer Christianity to pieces by the trilogy's end. <br /> <br />Conclusion <br />If you are a devout Christian or one who is offended when overt religous material makes its way into a book then this trilogy isn't for you.  If, however, you appreciate the writing without being too annoyed with the author then I would mildly recomend this book to you.  Also, this is NOT a book for young children.  The main characters may be children but after the first book this becomes a series strictly for adults.
B00005JNTX|5.0|SIN CITY WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING FILM. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS FILMED. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY STRONG AND ARE EXCELLENT IN THEIR PARTS. IT NEEDS TO BE REMEMBERED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOVIE IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK.
0671027387|5.0|Great book.  Good character development some surprises in stock.  I had a hard time putting this one down.  Prefer \\"Angels and Demons\\", but find it is totally different. I am finding Dan Brown to be one of my favorite authors.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey is an idiot. People who like her are obviously pleased with mediocrity since Mariah Carey has long since sunk into obscurity, from which she will never return. It is hilarious to see people go crazy over her new singles and write about how much they love her when it is apparent that she is a fat egotisitcal lunatic who does not possess an intelligent bone in her body. Well, maybe that is a little harsh. She was able to brilliantly re-invent herself as Mimi, right? I think \\"Mimi\\" is a showcase of Mariah's grip with reality. In essence, for those fans whose critcal analysis skills have degenerated from listening to \\"We Belong Together\\" one too many times, she has none. If Mariah Carey embodies the \\"artisic\\" qualities that you find satisfying, then that just goes to show what horrible taste you have. I wouldn't suggest listening to something substantial, it might just be too much for you to handle since Mimi sets the standards so low. So I hope those of you who buy her CD's are happy, because that makes you just as \\"intelligent\\" as she is.
B000002KIE|2.0|I was fifteen when this album was released. I loved the attitude; so \\"in your face\\" and antagonistic that it felt like an act of revolution to play it loud enough for your parents to hear. I think that some of the reviewers here are giving five stars because of what the band and record MEAN to them, instead of rating it as music. Because any honest assessment of this band would reveal thier total lack of musicianship and the fact that the lyrics are juvenile at best, and that the recording quality stinks. Some will say that this is all a part of the punk attitude and that stripped down, bare-bones sound without studio fluff is what they were after. If you admire them for setting out to make a crappy sounding record, that's fine, but don't try to pass it off years later as some sort of masterpiece just because it's old. It's still just as crappy as the day it was released.
0786714875|5.0|Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda during the 1994 Genocide there, wrote \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\".  It consists of a day-by-day account of Dallaire's ill-fated UN mission to oversee an end to the civil war that had been eviscerating Rwanda since 1990.   Shortly after the initial U.N. deployment, the President's of Rwanda and neigboring Burundi were assassinated when their aircraft was shot down.  This event triggered a resurgence in the ethnic fighting that provided cover for government and ethnic Hutu militias to ethnically cleanse, by systematic slaughter, the country's Tutsi ethnic minority.  In 100 days, some 800,000 were slaughtered, as the U.N. and the rest of the world idly looked on.  I have travelled throughout much of Rwanda on several trips, and Dallaire's account tracks precisely with my own observations.   <br /> <br />Both the U.N. and the United States political leadership failed monumentally in their assessment and subsequent inaction in Rwanda.  The French government and military, who seem to have gotten away relatively unscathed in the arena of public opinion, actually served to aid and abet the genocidaires; a crime for which they will likely never be held to account.  On the other side, there is heroism as well, as Africans eventually succeeded on their own, to stop the killing.  <br />  <br />Dallaire impresses me as a consummate professional who was placed in command of a mission that never had a chance of success.  He was profoundly effected, has attempted suicide, and suffers from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Nevertheless his prose is direct, powerful, his account powerful because of the events that happened, not so much because of his opinions about it.  From this reading, as a former soldier, I would fight to serve under such an officer.   <br /> <br />If you read nothing else about Rwanda, read this book.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Warning: This movie contains graphic violence from front to back. Cant wait for the Special Edition, as well as parts 2 and 3.
B000244FDW|5.0|I can watch this film over and over and enjoy it every time. It's not just that the acting is excellent and the casting perfect, but much of the dialogue is taken directly from the book, and the wit of Jane Austen is clearly evident. It doesn't hurt that Elizabeth Garvie is so charming and David Rintoul so gallant. Although the sets are not as lush and beautiful as in the A&E version, they don't distract from the story, and they'll satisfy those who appreciate live theater. This is one of my favorite films.

B000AL730Y|5.0|I'm a huge McCartney fan and I must admit that I wasn't that impressed after listening to this album the first 2-3 times.  After the 4th or 5th time though it becomes much more interesting and enjoyable.  Now I love it - it's much more complex than his usual albums.  The DVD is well worth the extra cost too.

B000AL730O|5.0|McCartney's made some fine records (Ram, Band on the Run, Flaming Pie) but this one may very well be the best of the lot.  Everybody's making a big deal of the production but the thing I noticed about it was the decision to leave the voice alone without resort to the usual Beatly tricks.  And interestingly the singing is probably the weakest part of the record.  But what makes a good record of original songs are the songs, and this time McCartney's rediscovered his old knack for melodies.  And the lyrics are solid, very much in the usual McCartney vein with a slightly darker hue.  Really not a weak track in the set.
B000002TLX|4.0|Imagine Richard Marx, singing back up vocals for Lionel Richie! This day, September 16, 1963, Richard Marx was born to live up this day and fascinate many of his great fans with his dreamy ballads and rock style music. His 'Right here Waiting for you' has ever been on top of my charts followed by Should've known better than to fall in love with you, Don't mean Nothing, Now and forever, Satisfied, Hold on to the nights,etc. A very talented singer, Richard Marx 'Paid Vacation' is yet another great pick that might be One more try - a number which is a smooth sail of his voice and another I like is 'Soul Motion' and 'The way she loves me'. Though, if you not an ardent fan of RM, this 'Richard Marx-Greatest Hits' is the best pick and great Listening. Enjoy.<br /><br />-ilaxi
B000AADYUI|5.0|First of all, acknowlegements for the use of part of a line from Starship written by Kantner, Slick, Balin and Blackman. In the liner notes, Paul Kantner tells of how he wrote to Robert Heinlein to ask permission to use some of his ideas in the project to which Heinlein replied with some astonishment that his ideas had been used many times before but only Kantner had written for permission.<br /><br />Secondly, Amazon has the tracklist wrong to the extent that the radio slots for the album are at the end and not the beginning.<br /><br />Thirdly, I do not want to duplicate my review of the first CD release of this album which can be found on Amazon's pages and which I pretty much stand by today.<br /><br />Fourthly, I think that this remastering is truly excellent. I say this first and foremost because of the sound. The first time around sounds dark and murky in comparison but here the sound is pristine revealing much more in the process and giving the vocals a lot nore clarity in particular. And, if you never knew why Paul Kantner appreciated Grace Slick's vocals so much you sure do here. Listen to the bonus track of her demo version of Sunrise it is astounding. The Garcia contributions also benefit enormously from the remastering and it makes one wonder how awesome he would have become as a pedal steel guitar player if he had chosen that particular route had he not preferred to go back to the regular (sic) guitar. All of the instruments and vocals are greatly improved.<br /><br />Next the bonus tracks. Although they do not add per se to the original album as new songs they certainly elaborate on their development. Let's Go Together is presented with alternative lyrics but after several plays I must confess to preferring the original album. I could be getting old and conservative I guess which may account for that. The two demos, Sunrise and Hijack show how the album versions evolved and the remaining two SFX and  Starship are valubale too but in different ways. I can only speculate as to whether Garcia and Hart actually called the track SFX but the first thing that came to mind was San Francisco International as in airport or perhaps Space Station. Regardless the effects are great and particularly so on headphones. Finally the live version of Starship is particularly welcome if only because it is an official live version very reminiscent to my ears, of the sound on Bless It's Pointed Little Head. It certainly is a positive indication of what the sound might be if the whole thing were performed live. There are two secret tracks, which Amazon had listed as the first two tracks of Radio Spots for the album which i find cute but also a liitle sad as reminders of the gestation of the Starship from the Airplane but otherwise do not detract from the overall excellence.<br /><br />Finally the packagaging. Reproducing the original booklet is a nice plus although at my age and with glasses it is a little hard to read. Thank the deity it is not a mini-disc version. But again it is really nice to have and also I really enjoyed the liner notes. Not to do down Jeff Tamarkin, who did a sterling job on the other albums, these liner notes are a little more in keeping with the times in which the album was recorded. More like a insider orientation with subjective aspects, they are a little more rebellious and open and esoteric.<br /><br />All in all I really really think that this album has stood the test of time even though popular music has changed so much. Releasing it at this time with it's conjunction of the second major diaster of the Bush presidency (three if you count Iraq) may be accidental but it does draw on some parallels with it's original release during the closing years of the Vietnam war. However, the anti-war movement is more divided and muted now than it was then. I was struck by the irony of the line Amerika hates her crazies as I dropped my teenage daughter off at school this morning (what sort of music do you call this sheasked as she got into the car)when conformity is the order of the day in the new millenium.<br /><br />Finally I have to mention the artwork which always impresses me.<br /><br />FIVE STARS PLUS (please Amazon - just this once can I give it 6 stars.is the order of the day in the new millenium.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie is great for so many reasons.  Let me name a few. <br /> <br />1) Historical accuracy - at least to a non-historian like myself. <br />2) Prudent and sparing use of CGI, which when it is used (i.e. in the storm scene) is done brilliantly.  The movie never looks like a cartoon. <br />3) The story is believable yet engaging, well-paced and never boring. <br />4) Superbly done fight scenes that look real (no John Woo slo-mo bull**** and no Sam Peckinpah blood fountains) <br />5) The characters are like real people (they get drunk, act petty, get scared sometimes, accidentally shoot shipmates in the gut when aiming at a bird, even the captain loses his cool occasionally) <br />6) It's great to see a Hollywood film where tho story isn't weakened by any mushy, clicheed, romantic phony-baloney <br />7) World-class music played by world-class musicians <br />8) The acting rocks <br />9) The whole synthesis of high-seas adventure, extreme warfare, classical music, and ecology is very appealing: a true \\"Renaissance movie\\" <br /> <br />And for those thought it lacked \\"emotional clout\\" (ahem), if you can watch the kid cut his best friend loose and set him adrift in the frigid Magellanic Strait in order to save the ship, set to \\"Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis,\\" and not get a little misty, you are made of harder stuff than I. <br /> <br />Just writing about this movie makes me want to watch it right now.
0792839730|5.0|In a film of beautiful nuance, Richard Attenborough captures the horrors or war and the dignity of those who must endure, soldiers and civilians alike.  The stellar cast of \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" (a veritable who's who of acting greats) sets this film apart.  Sean Connery leaves behind the cool assuredness of Bond and faces futility with a mug of tea while Anthony Hopkins, a proper Englishman in Hell, surrenders with dignity, only reluctantly accepting chocolate from the enemy.  James Caan is a particular standout.  With true American grit, he bends all the rules and makes good on a pledge.  The scale of the film could have wrought disasters on par with the campaign it portrays.  Fortunately, the immensity of the Market-Garden campaign, which historically met its Waterloo at Arnhem, doesn't swallow up the stories of individual characters, of the Brit with umbrella for instance or the Dutch resisters who spy for the Allies.<br /><br />Few World War II flicks showcase the absolute beauty of the European countryside.  In \\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" the landscape, made all the more picturesque in its contrast to the gore and destruction, is certainly an additional star and supports the wisdom of shooting this expensive epic in the Netherlands.  The wide-angle approach, as well as the moving score, give balm to eyes and ears now accustomed to the tortorous naturalism of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Attenborough pulls back, thankfully.  In its final scene, \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" achieves poignance without dialogue, without bluster, and without the common contrivance of summoning tears with half-baked, insipid bathos.  Sir Lawrence Olivier and Liv Ullman stare straight ahead, the fresh graves of British paratroopers lining their path from an elegance destroyed, from an order and faith utterly shattered.  The scene is perfection.  And the film itself is close to it.

B0002YLC24|3.0|Except for the fact the script writer found it relevant to incorporate liberal philosophy and agenda into an otherwise decent movie. When the two were discussing politics and essentially \\" dumping \\" on the U.S. you felt as if you were watching a political add on tv. This was distractng and quite annoying to my sensiblities because it didn't need to be there. Sadly, many directors take upon the occassion to incorporate their political agenda via the script as if the audience is too dumb or indifferent to take notice of such an obvious short-coming. As a resuly i immediately felt alienated from the movie and despite my best efforts to focus on this love between the two I was side tracked with politics. I needed to deduct three stars from an otherwise 5 star movie. In the future i should hope the script writer and director appreciate the fact that good movies don't need to feel like a commercial, albeit 80 minutes at that.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I believe this to be a great movie that went far beyond my expectations.  I thought it was gonna be just an action movie, but the story was actually quite engrossing, this may just be because I love the Final Fantasy series, with VII being my favorite.  The story will most definitely lose people that don't know the story of the game at all.  The 3d was incredible and keeps the characters extremely close to their playstation game counterparts while still being very realistic.  I personally think it was much better than TSW and that the action scenes were well done.  Don't get me wrong, I found TSW to be a very good movie.  This movie may not be for the fans, but for ANYONE that has played even a portion of the game, this movie is a must-see.
B0000E6XKF|5.0|This is God.  Yes, I know.  Jeffry Babb, you are incorrect, the other reviewer is right.  Latest Disgrace by Fugazi is played by the Funky Monk, John F before Parallel Universe.
B000002AD0|4.0|As others have said there is only a drummer and a conga player, so for Santana standards, it is weak on the percussion level, but if you are a fan on the band, especially the first three albums, I think you will enjoy this album a lot.  For me it is worth just for the long version of \\"Treat\\" and \\"Fried Neckbones\\" which sounds so much better than those on the bootlegs.  To me this is \\"hippie rock\\" at its best, better than any Dead or Airplane I ever heard.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|With the recent Live-8 concert attracting so much attention (and I certainly do hope that you've been paying attention), I figured it would be as good a time as any to dig up the time capsule that I buried in the backyard twenty years ago. There, among the day-glo spandex pants, headbands, and Ronald Reagan campaign buttons, I expected to find my cherished video recording of the Live Aid concerts from July 1985. But, alas, the world had changed beyond my ability to predict, rendering my poor Beta-tape copy of the MTV coverage as obsolete as my 1985 Thompson Twins album collection. So, forlorn, but not beaten, I decided to search out a video copy of this historic event, and - what do you know? - right there at 'Amazon' was a brand-spanking new, four-disk DVD copy of the entire event! Now, in perfectly contemporary and digitally accurate video and audio, you (or I) can watch now-classic performances by U2, Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Tina Turner, and Queen.<br /><br /> All of the above have lived up to the expectations of my decades-old memories. Unfortunately, though, I cannot always say that for much of the rest. The Who reunited (again) for this event, but it seems unlikely that they rehearsed beforehand. Roger Daltrey must have sung \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" 5,000 times before this event, but apparently, that still wasn't enough. He messes up the song structure so badly that poor Pete Townshend and John Entwhistle have to regroup to figure out where the hell they ought to be. At least nobody punched anyone, though, and the spirit of the day carried them through. Eric Clapton performs with an inappropriately heavy-handed Phil Collins on drums, and the Beach Boys performance made me grateful that Brian Wilson is now touring without the perennially annoying Mike Love to muck things up. These moments may be less than awesome, but it is still incredible to see these once-in-a-lifetime events exactly as they took place.<br /><br /> One of the most fun things to do while watching this video is to count the unbelievably disastrous fashion faux pas that parades before your eyes. Ultravox and Spandau Ballet look as though they exchanged costumes backstage, while Adam Ant, Boy George, and especially Duran Duran prove that their careers were based more on fashion than talent, and their fashion sense was abominable. In my opinion, Duran Duran's performance here proves once and for all that they are truly the worst band of the past thirty-five years. As for the Thompson Twins (yes, they were there, too, with Madonna as a backup singer, no less! Can you believe that?), you have to see them to believe them. God, who invented those `80s haircuts, and what prison is he/she rotting in? Watching this band maul their way through John Lennon's \\"Revolution\\" made me wonder what diner the band is working in these days.<br /><br /> As for the rest, it's all great fun. Neil Young confounds the crowd by playing an unreleased song with an excellent Nashville/country outfit, Judas Priest prove that yes, they really ARE hell-bent for leather, and Ozzy Osbourne actually performs a version of \\"Paranoid\\". In addition, a playful Pete Townshend gooses Paul McCartney during \\"Let It Be\\", and I get to vaguely recall mediocre acts from the `US' decade like R.E.O. Speedwagon, Wham!, and Nik Kershaw. All in all, a good time was had by all, and the event raised nearly $150 million for famine relief. Best of all, it's not finished; All proceeds from this four-CD set (or the companion `Best Of' collection on one DVD disk) still goes toward the Band Aid Trust in Africa. That alone justifies the entire experience, and this time, I'm not going to bury the DVD in my backyard.

B00005JNTX|4.0|This movie is dark and surreal, the way I like it.  Without a doubt the best thing about it though, is Jessica Alba in her leather chaps doing her stripping routine.  This movie is worth buying for that alone!
B00003CWN3|5.0|This movie was very real.  I not really sure how to describe it but it was really good.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|System of a Down, has always been known for pushing the limits time and time again, with their different type of music. System of a Down, has got to be one of the most innovative bands of all time. When I first heard their hit single \\"Chop Suey!\\" on the radio, It had to be one of the most exciting day of my young life being 9 years old at the time. Instead of your every day generic rock, I heard gold. I ended up buying \\"Toxicity\\", and must say that is has to be one of the best Cd's I own in my vast collection of Cd's.  <br /> <br /> I also ended up buying their self titled album \\"System of a Down\\", which I never even heard about, and must say that was just as good as \\"Toxicity\\". \\"Toxicity\\" is what brought SOAD to fame with about 2 or 3 smash hit singles and triple platinum sales to prove it. The band took a bit of a dive when they released \\"Steal This Album\\", which was a major disappointment.  <br /> <br /> \\"Mezmerize\\" is a pretty nice recovery from \\"Steal This Album\\". No, \\"Mezmerize\\" is no \\"Toxicity\\", but it is very unique showing a different side of SOAD in a way. \\"Mezmerize\\" overall was a little bit of a disappointment, but I myself didn't regret buying it. I heard the song \\"B.Y.O.B\\", I was really pshyed about the album. I was hoping for the album like \\"Toxicity\\". I immediately listened to \\"B.Y.O.B\\" a few times and started giving the whole album a try. In my opinion it was average, a little light for my taste but, a must have for any SOAD fan hungry for more!!! <br /> <br /> In, \\"Mezmerize\\" I have noticed that they gave their guitarist Daron( which kind of goes good with Serj's voice), more vocal time and stamped a strong anti war message in songs like B.Y.O.B- (Bring Your Own Bomb) with shrieks \\"Why Do You Always Send The Poor\\"!!! Sad Statue with quotes such as \\"The Generation That didn't agree\\"!!! The intro \\"Soldier Side\\" resembles basically the same meaning in my opinion. Overall, System has seem to kept their unique style in tact and as great as ever!!! Alongwith a little comedy such as \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\", both good songs I must add.  <br /> <br /> The album starts off with \\"Solider Side which kicks off the album kicks off the album that sets up for \\"B.Y.O.B\\" <br /> <br /> I was impressed with \\"B.Y.O.B\\"- the 1st hit single from album, I was obsessed with this song for a long time very fast and aggressive, with an anti war meaning speaking out against injustice!!! I have gotten a little tired of it now, since it was overplayed on MTV and the radio!!! Great song used to be my favorite now my second favorite!!! (4.5)  <br /> <br /> When I first listened to \\"Revengda\\" I didn't like it but, it kind of grew on me with the chorus \\"My revenge will be yours for the taking!!!\\"  It a little lighter and weirder than the other songs, but it works!!! A catchy song (3) <br /> <br /> \\"Cigaro\\" was a very unique song , sounding more like a metal song with the guitar, but kind of funny and hilarious at the same time. When Daron yells out..... \\"my c**k is bigger than yours !!!..... \\"And with a feeling so pure!!!\\" Weird, but still great could have been longer though!!! (4) <br /> <br />\\"Radio/Video\\" is the weirdest song on the album in my opinion. The chorus \\"Hey man look I'm on the radio(or video on some parts), which sounded awesome with kind of a punk feel to it. They added more of a middle Eastern theme to the song which was cool, but a little odder and weaker for my taste....... Still pretty good not the best!!! (3) <br /> <br />\\"This Cocaine Feels Like I'm On This Song\\" which is a good song toward the beginning, but ends very weak, I liked the chorus though that kept my interest. The weakest song on the album. I will give this a (2.5) <br /> <br />\\"Violent Pornography\\" which is the main reason for the Parental Advisory label on the album. This song is a little perverted,  but it is one of the best songs on the album, kinda funny an all around good song. (4) <br /> <br />\\"Question!\\" Is the favorite song on the album atthe moment, I'm pretty much switching between \\"B.Y.O.B\\" and \\"Question!\\" as my absolute favorite, both are great 2nd single. It is kind of hard to explain this song, but in my opinion it is a absolute masterpiece!!!! This song has kind of a creepier mellower side to it, and switches into a little bit of a metalish ballad!!! (5) Personal favorite at the moment!!! I liked Serj's psycho screams!!! <br /> <br />\\"Sad Statue\\" Is an all around strong song that goes back to the anti war message of \\"B.Y.O.B\\"!!! The bass playing is especially awesome in this song mixed with the guitar, towards the end the song gets a little weaker, still good listening!!! (3.5) <br /> <br />\\"Old School Hollywood\\" Starts off with a bit of techno metalish feel, and plays smoothly. Also funny in my opinion, with lines like \\"Tony Danza cuts in line\\" and \\"Old school Hollywood, ....... Washed  up Hollywood !!!!\\" A very catchy song in my opinion!!! (4) <br /> <br />\\"Lost in Hollywood\\" A great way to end the album, a very strong and moving song in my opinion, Serj should have done more of the vocal work on this song though, and it still can't compare to the rest of the album. (3.5) <br /> <br /> In, conclusion I will say that this is a great album, no not the best but still good listening. If your a fan of SOAD check this out ASAP, if your a new fan check out this and \\"Toxicity\\". SOAD is back and is on fire I can't wait for their new album \\"Hypnotize\\" whihc will be coming out in the near future.  <br /> <br />Overall, I will give this a 4/5,.... I suggest you pick this up if you like SOAD. <br />
B00006HAZG|5.0|Not the for tiny tots, but definately a family movie. Children 10 and older will get a lot of good lessons from watching this. The cast is top-notch and the acting is superb. A young Daniel Radcliff (of 'Harry Potter' fame), plays the younger David Copperfield. Bob Hoskins is in purhaps his finest role ever.<br /><br /> Dickens stories are filled with life's lessons, and (aside from 'Nicholas Nickleby'), this one is just about the best. Highly recommended.<br /><br />***** Stars!
B0002S94OS|5.0|<br />REVIEW: <br /> <br /> Lamb of God is a true all American Death Metal Band, that has really impressed me, especially with \\"Ashes of the Wake\\"!!! This band is truly talented, and has now scored a major record deal with Epic. They are on fire as a band better than ever!!! When most underground \\"metal\\" bands get a record deal they will usally be pressured by the record companies to make their music more radio friendly and changing their music in general. This practice is called selling out, which has destroyed bands like Metallica, and is furthering corrupting music along with MTV.  <br /> <br /> I am very impressed that \\"Lamb of God\\" has kept their music just the way it is. They haven't sold out even signing with a company like Epic, most impressive!!! They now sound better than ever; the bands and the way they play and write music has matured!!! THis album shows what this band is capable of. When I see posuers like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit making money and getting all the fame; while these guys remain underground really pisses me off and shows that MTV is plainly biased to rap/pop so avoid that phony channel at all costs.  <br /> <br /> The album was very strong through and through and really impressed me, and I must say this is one of the best cd's that I own in my vast collection. I must say over the past 5 days I have probably listened to it about 100-200 times before it started to get old. Lamb of God has to be the greatest band since \\"Shadows Fall\\" or \\"Fear Factory\\"!!! Kudos to the band especially the gutartist Mark Morton and his phemional guitar playing along Wille Alder, machine gun drumming!!!  <br /> <br /> Blythe sounds a lot better in this album and you are able to understand him better and they basically worked out all the sound problems; examples being the rest of the band overshadowing Blythe or Blythe drowing out the rest of the band. Blythe has improved as a frontman this time around being more expeienced with better equipment and funding towork with.   <br /> <br /> I've also noticed that they have put a bit of an anti war message along with anti injustice putting down President Bush and such in this album with songs like \\"Now You Got Something to Die For\\" and the instrumental \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" that sounds like a new report and turns into two phemonial guitar Solos from guest guitarists Megadeth's Chris Poland and Testament's Alex Skolnick!!!Lamb of God in my opinion could be considered \\"The Rage Against the Machines\\" of metal in a way. <br /> <br /> In general this is a must have for any true metal fan, now I will tell you how the album played out. This has to be their best album yet, I hope their is more of this to come from th band. <br /> <br />\\"Laid to Rest\\"- Probably one of the best songs on the album, very rough and agressive, with Blythe's riffs and scream, mixed with Morton's kick ass guitar playing, and Alder's awesome drumming, which equals one hell of a song. (Featuered at Ozzfest) <br />(5) <br /> <br />\\"Hourglass\\"- Begins great with some nice guitar solos, and then gets better and more agressive with Alder's machine gun drumming and Blythe's vocal power. It falls a part towards the end going on a stop start rythm, still a great song. (4) <br /> <br />\\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\"- Has that anti war theme to it very agressive, Blythe did a good job vocally on this song but the drumming really made this song shine. The guitar playing was just as awesome too though!!! Could have been better, but some hell of a song!!! (4.5) <br /> <br />\\"The Faded Line\\"- The most unique song on the album, that shows hoe Lamb of God can mix all the elements of their music into one kick ass song. This song shifts and is in constant change with the agressive guitar playing and drumming to back that up, a masterpiece!!! (5) <br /> <br />\\"Omerta\\"- A pretty great song, that made laid a few blows to Bush's policy, which really doesn't matter to me, because the song is kick ass and really gets me jump started. Nice Job...!!! (4) <br /> <br />\\"Laid to Rest\\"- Very great song, great tempo mixes , especially when Blythe screams \\"Laid to Rest\\", not my personal favorite, still great. (4) <br /> <br />\\"One Gun\\"- Very agressive song that seems to shift a lot, a very creative song, in my opinion great guitar playing and drumming. Not much to really say about this song.(4) <br /> <br />\\"Break You\\"- One of my personal favorites as well, kina similar to 'One Gun\\" and then turns into it's own unique song shifting in tempo lot's of time with great vocal work by Blythe as he  along with the masterful guitar playing. A better version of \\"One Gun\\" you could say. (4.5) <br /> <br />\\"What I've Become\\"- Starts off with the a great guitar playing by Morton then kicks off with Blythe's crazy shrieks and Alder's materful drumming. Bythe especially does a great job he manages to hold a 10 second riff whihc was amazing. Great Job!!! (4.5)  <br /> <br />\\"Ashes of the Wake\\"- Some nice guitar solos by Chris Porland and Alex Skolnick, two guest apperances, awesome instrumental song!!!! (5) <br /> <br />\\"Remorse From The Dead\\"-Starts off slow than turns into a morbid moshpit, kind of like Metallica's \\"End of Sanity\\"!!! Morton and Alder make a fine combination in this song, and basically the entire album, great way to close the album!!! (4.5) <br /> <br /> If you like death metal this is a must buy!!! I will give this materpiece a 5/5,.... Lamb of God's best and certainly not last, Lamb of God has a bright future!!! <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|3.0|I am a real Mc Cartney Fan ;I always was on Paul side beginning <br />70s when war was raging between the Paulistas and lennonitos. <br />The proof: i bought in 72 the single ''Mary had a little lamb'' <br />You can't be more of a mccartney fan than that,you agree! <br />Since tuesday, i am reading here there and everywhere that the <br />second coming of the ''white album'', ''Ram'' or ''band on the <br />run'' has just arrived; So i went to buy this famous new cd with <br />great expectations and what a letdown. Actually, it starts <br />perfectly with ''fine line''-catchy little tune that would not <br />have disgraced any landmark album from Paul and friends; but <br />after that!!First i told myself, maybe it needs a few listenings <br />to grow on you, but that did'nt happen. <br />There is no energy, The melodies (or lack of) most of the time <br />are going nowhere. ''Jenny Wren\\"\\" the second coming of Blackbird? <br />there is only one blackbird; Even ''put it there'' is a great tune, but ''Jenny wren''?  <br />''English tea'' is cute, real mccartney; but ''vanity fair''or <br />''too much rain'' or the second song:what a suffering. <br />Moreover, there is another angle of this album that struck me, that hasn't been reported yet; THE VOICE. there is serious wear and tear in it; this is no teddy boy anymore. <br />Sorry, i was ready to embrace the album, but i can't. <br />''RAM'' will remain on top of my list .No ''back seatof my car'' <br />or ''too many people''here, not even ''Mary had a li....''
B000069HJL|5.0|What Manny from Orlando said pretty much sums up the way I feel about this recording.  Perhaps, one of the best live recordings ever.  My advice is load this on your player, sit in a dark room, close your eyes and recall the last time you saw them live.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have LOVED this music since I first heard it on CBS Sunday Morning almost four years ago (when the show was just in rehearsals).  Now that I own it I play it constantly and listening to this recording makes me want to be \\"popular\\" so I too can defy gravity and fly.
0060763280|5.0|Great Book. Summarizes and powerfully presents many amazing tools in a concise manner. His ideas are shared by many other success mentors but he does a remarkable job at making it clear and showing what steps to take TODAY while making you want to ACT NOW.
B0009YA37W|5.0|One of the best albums I have bought in a long time, and it just goes to show that the UK, once again, has produced another great rock 'n' roll band.  <br /> <br />The album is energetic and solid all the way through, and a treat to the \\"The Back Room\\" import is that the disc is accompanied by an equally wonderful collection of B-sides called \\"Cuttings\\". <br /> <br />I recommend this album  to anyone who loves bands such as Joy Division, Interpol, and Nick Cave.
B00005JOHU|4.0|Nicolas Cage portrays Yuri Orlav, a worldwide arms dealer who shows no sign of stopping anytime soon because \\"I'm good at it.\\". He wears a gold bullet on a necklace around his neck like a cross. He feels that he's not breaking the 'Thou shalt not kill' commandment since he only sells the weapon and doesn't pull the trigger.  <br /> <br />Bridget Moynahan plays his supermodel wife with supermodel brain matter, i.e. as long as there's a lot of money and presents, I won't ask questions. Her acting ability HAS improved a bit since The Scout starring the drunken chain-smoking sexaholic and Al Pacino. <br /> <br />Jared Leto does an awesome job as Yuri's alcoholic drug addicted brother and 'brother in arms' partner in the business.  <br />Both Jared's and Bridget's characters start developing a conscience later on in the movie but by then it's too late.  <br /> <br />For the eye-opening message about the world of arms trading that the movie tries to send, it's a very good movie. You can tell however that the producer is trying to turn this (Not Rated) movie into a PG-13 instead of an R rating, which would be a HUGE mistake. The nude scenes have been trimmed quite a bit so they almost but not quite show something. The violence scenes are the same way where you see people being attacked and shot but you don't see splatter coming out the exit wound. <br />  <br />The only problem that I had with this movie was the overuse of cliches, asimiles, and metaphors that make the film a little too philosophical.  <br /> <br />This is NOT a movie for kids or teens, even for this so-called not rated version.  <br /> <br />Movie warnings: profanity, violence, bloodshed, drug abuse, partial nudity, weapons spokesmodel stripping, prostitute stripping, and cargo plane stripping.  <br /> <br />Is it worth the matinee and night time prices to see?  <br />Definitely!  <br /> <br />Enjoy!  <br />
6302238331|5.0|One of the best car chase scenes of all time, no special effects.  Filmed on 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn.  Movie from 1971, listen to the dialogue in the movie and see how police described people (not politically correct today) and all their code words.  Gene Hackman and Roy Schneider at their best (even though each had much bigger roles latter on in life).  Filmed on location in New York City, trains, hotels, police stations, very few hollywood sets if any.  Taking the car carrying drugs apart was fantastic.  I have a copy of the movie and whenever plays on cable also watch it.  How hard work really breaks a case, dectectives had no computers, lasers, cell phones, just their own smarts and very very hard work in breaking a case.  Their own street smarts breaks the case, very very exciting movie, how it really happened.
0671449028|4.0|This book is not one of the best by this author, but it is good. The best one that I have found by Sandra Boynton is Barnyard Dance for &lt; 1 year and the others are starting to interest my little one more now after she is over a year.  <br />
0767827716|5.0|I am a huge car lover, and this movie took my enthusiasm to the next level of loving cars and car movies. This movie kept me on the edge of my chair. The first time I saw this movie, I got chills. This 1958 Plymoth Fury was one of the best cars to pick for this movie. Each time I watch Christine come alive I just feel like i going to just 'freeze' with  exitement.I give \\"CHRISTINE\\" 5 stars because I feel that it was the BEST movie I have EVER seen. And thats the truth.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|What a great way to spend an evening! As a long time fan of \\"The Eagles\\" it's fun to enjoy the music from the past as well as the newest songs. We have played it several times and we never get tired of it. Many evenings before going to bed we play several songs which is a good way to relax and release the stresses of the day!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Come on people! You have so many Anti-Moore folks saying that he twisted facts and shed little light on his \\"half-truths\\" You have actual footage of the Bush administration saying one thing about Iraq, Terrorism, etc and then turning right around and saying another. Do you think Moore doctored that evidence? He didn't have to doctor anything to show Bush and his cronies lying right to your face and you still support him, why? He clearly says in the film, \\"I'm a WAR president, I make foreign policy with War on my mind!\\" That is our country's fearless leader? You have got to be kidding me. Anyone who supports Bush should be banished to live in Iraq, see how you like that.
1565117700|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.<br /><br />The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.<br /><br />Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.<br /><br />The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.<br /><br />It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.<br /><br />Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" leave off.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

B000AARKOO|4.0|UPDATE: I originally wrote the following because of the notice that there would be an eventual extended edition of the movie.  The update is that Amazon.com now has a listing for said extended edition that comes in at 191 minutes and is to be released on 23 May 2006.      I wrote a review for the theatrical release of this film which I will post below if you are curious what I think.  I really wanted to just point out that if you enjoyed this film, you might not want to purchase this version.  Back when the movie was first released in theatres, Ridley Scott was interviewed and stated that there was almost an hour taken from the movie.  He also said there would be a director's cut that would have that material restored.  Its not being released now, presumably, so that the studios can get their double dip.  Look at Sin City (the \\"longer extended cut\\" comes out in December 3 months from its original release date) or Saw which is coming unrated this month to support the sequel.  It happens all the time.      Overall, I think the film is decent and I am curious to see what was cut out.  I just don't want people who are interested to waste their hard-earned dollars because the studio wants to double dip.  Take what I'm saying as a grain of salt because things can change and I'm no \\"insider\\" so I can't say for absolute certainty that they will release the director's cut, but there is an interview out there with Scott about the director's cut.  So, my recommendation (take it for what you will)?  If you enjoyed the movie but wanted more, wait for the inevitable directors cut  :)      For those interested, my original review for the theatrical release is pasted below:    When epic films come out, people usually fall into two categories without even seeing the movie: they are excited to see it or they roll their eyes and yawn. I happen to fall into the first category. Epic historical war films like Gladiator, Troy and now Kingdom of Heaven (just to name a few) are a lot of funto me. There's nothing like seeing boulders of flames lighting the night sky as they explode into castle towers, etc.     From what I've gathered through the media and through friends of mine who are history buffs, the film is pretty accurate as far as movie epics goes; I am not a history buff so I couldn't tell you. Ridley Scott does a good job of mixing fictional (Orlando Bloom's Balian) and historical (The leper king, played by Edward Norton in an excellently subdued role). Complimenting the battle sequences is a rousing score by Harry Gregson-Williams who has done everything from the video game Metal Gear Solid 2 to Shrek. They also sample a song from the Prayer Cycle by Johnathan Elias which is achingly beautiful. Overall the sound fits the theme and the time period admirably well.     The story is pretty standard epic film stuff. You have the unwitting hero, the possible love interest, the possible love interest's evil husband, all engulfed in the massive Crusades that are tearing apart Jerusalem. One thing I am glad for is that I feel Ridley Scott and screenwriter William Monahan did a more accurate portrayal of the Crusades by showing not only the religious side of events but also the socio-political and economical themes that pushed the war forward.     I think Orlando Bloom has been criticized perhaps too strongly in this movie. Most professional reviews comment that he is too \\"pretty boy\\" for the role. It's almost as if critics are trying to pigeon hole him and type cast him into that role. I'm not trying to defend Orlando Bloom, but it never really struck me as the \\"fish out of water\\" character casting that professional critics are demanding it is. Sure, he relied on the look of a puppy dog who's lost his best friend a little much, and yeah he has that \\"pretty boy\\" look I suppose but come on, if you don't allow someone to do something different, you're just reinforcing his type cast which leads to a vicious cycle.     You might feel that even though themovie is a good 2 hours and 25 minutes that it felt like something was missing. And, that's probably because something was missing, about 80 more minutes. In an interview with Ridley Scott, he mentioned that the theatrical cut is not his cut and that he was planning on releasing a directors cut on DVD that encompasses an amazing 220 minutes. I suppose the production company decided they didn't want to have an almost 4 hour movie in the theatres right now and so decided to chop sometime off, but according to reports with Ridley Scott that's not what he wanted to happen exactly.     Going with the cuts and the story, I think part of what was left out might have been more of Saladin's point of view. It seemed as if the movie wanted to show both sides as there were moments were we saw dissent on the Arab side as well as a hint of some motives. I'm hoping that this was something we'll see more of in the DVD cut because it creates a better picture of just what was going on.     I would like to say that it would be better to catch this on DVD so one could see the movie in its entirety, but fans of this genre know that the best place to see these movies is in the theatre. Just know that when it comes out on DVD it will be more complete. It's a pretty good epic film. There were some nice fighting sequences and the final siege of Jerusalem leading up to the climax was stunning. Personally I enjoyed it much more than Troy and Alexander of last year. It might not live up to Ridley Scott's Gladiator right now, but come DVD it has a chance I think.
0790734850|5.0|(m)ay be the view of James Cromwell's character, but it was one of the best roles Hollywood offered in 1997:  Exeley also gets a martini in the face from Lana Turner. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL was easily 1997's best film on all counts.  Proving once again that those on the other side of the pond truely understand American film better than her native sons, Englishman Curtis Hanson, pulls together an accurately masterful vision of early 1950's corrupt Los Angeles, known well to historians, but blinded to middle America east of the Los Angeles River Basin.  This is an incredible epic boasting some of the decades best performances by Kevin Spacey (Sgt. Jack Vincennes), Guy Pearce (Lt. Edmund Exley) and Russell Crowe (Officer Bud White). None were nominated at Oscar time. Fortunately, the AMPAS rewarded Kim Bassinger with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and the film earned the prize for Best Adapted Screenplay.    Otherwise, some of the best work of 1997 might have gone the way of that steamship in the year's other big film.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's been almost four years since I first saw Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and wrote my review for Amazon.com.  After seeing the new complete version on Blu-Ray, I thought I'd come back and offer my thoughts only to discover that my original review was transferred over from the DVD edition.  That review was written at a different time, before the DVD was even released in the States.  I thought about going back and revising it, but that'd be changing the past.  What I will add are my thoughts on the new Blu-Ray edition.    Firstly, if you're looking at the Blu-Ray edition, wondering if it's a worthy purchase, it definitely is.  It's a much superior version to the original, both in content and clarity.  Obviously, with the Blu-Ray the picture quality and sound quality have been considerably increased.  There's a few little nitpicks, such as a shimmering, aliasing problem that pops up every now and then (The Resident Evil: Degeneration Blu-Ray had a similar problem) and it can be distracting.  But the details are so much clearer now that it looks like a new movie.      Additionally, new content has been added to this release.  A lot of times, \\"director's cuts\\" can be detrimental to the film and the pacing, but in the case of Advent Children, I appreciated the new content.  I believe there's an additional 26 minutes added and these parts delve into the Geostigma and the origins of some of the characters as well as an extended fight between Cloud and Sephiroth.  Overall, I think the additions are useful and help make the movie more of a movie and less an extended cut scene.  It's just too bad that it didn't come with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII like it did in Japan...    On to my original review as it was back in 2005:    Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Marlene, Barret, Vincent. The names could go on. This series reigns in many Final Fantasy fans' minds as being the best. Though in recent years a lot of people roll their eyes and say its over-rated (and it mightbe), for me, and for a lot of fans, Final Fantasy was a turning point in the genre not only in terms of graphics and presentation but also in story. I have been playing video games and RPGs since the very first NES. Final Fantasy VII was the first game that made me stop and go, wait when did a video game become something more than just pushing buttons?     Now we have the official sequel, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Advent Children is basically a love note written for the fans of VII. Those who did not invest 40, 50, 60+ hours into the game will probably have no interest in it. But those who were shocked when (should I even say spoiler?) Sephiroth murders Aeris, who have a deep connection to the characters, and over the 40-60+ hours grew so attached to them that to this day they still draw fan art or look for that elusive way to get Aeris back in game(it doesn't exist, by the way), this movie will mean something.     AC is a beautiful CG movie taking place two years after the events of FFVII. While the ending of VII was climactic and exhilarating, providing a resolution of sorts to the people of Midgar, it did not provide a resolution, happy or not, for Cloud. In fact, it left him empty and hurt as we find in the beginning of Advent Children. What AC does is finish Cloud's story. Another reviewer here made a comment that he liked FFVII's ending. I do too, don't get me wrong. But the one thing it didn't do was end Cloud's story.  For the length of the game, you have a deeply personal story surrounded by the world story and while the world got its ending, the people involved did no, unhappy or not. As I said, AC ends Cloud's story with a bang. And it is damn well worth the wait.     I don't think it would be right of me to talk about what happens in AC. Part of the fun and surprise is to see how well it fits together, brings memories of the video game and works to create an emotional core. I will keep the review as spoiler free as possible because I know I'm tired of reading reviews where people stick in something that can ruin the whole movie.     For those who didn't play or watch FFVII, this movie will not have much resonance since it's basically for the fans, both die-hard and casual. Those who loved FFVII will more than likely love this movie. AC is basically an action movie and the action is spectacular although the slow motion was used (while effectively) a little much. The sword play, the battles and the action is all directed with style oozing everywhere. The characters are all animated exceedingly well and the animators did a great job in making PS1 characters into spectacular CG. The musical score varies for me from being excellent to just okay. By far, the best moments are ones I can't talk about aurally for fear of spoiling surprises. Needless to say, the music is at its greatest when it brings in hints of FFVII, the video game.     There are a lot of connections to both VII and the Final Fantasy series as a whole. From moogle dolls to The Turks, the game oozes both FFVII and FF; although I was disappointed in not seeing any chocobos, there are a few moments that made up for it. One in particular revolves around the games End Battle Theme. Hilarious, laugh out loud scene. There are some minor annoyances. A couple of the scenes felt episodic and not connected. Some scenes were directed very well and lead into each other or intercut between each other. But there are a couple scenes that stand out because they didn't feel attached to what was going on. In fact, it felt as if they were cut scenes from a video game. Did this detract from the movie? Not in the least, but its there nonetheless.     What surprised me the most with this movie is that it wasn't done to milk the saga. I mean, of course its there to make money, and FFVII is a great way to do it because of fans' love for it. Anything in the business world is made around making money. But what I mean exactly is best represented in FFX-2. I am one who didnot find FFX-2 at all interesting. In fact it is the only FF game I gave up on. It felt like it was a way of milking FFX for a little more money while the wait for FFXII kept getting longer and longer. However, AC is so intrinsically related to VII that it has a heart and emotion that I haven't seen in many movies released this year. I felt chills from the very opening moments as the narrator explained some of the events from VII and we see a flashback of Sephiroth standing in front of flames. And that was just the start of the thrills; there are scenes both emotional and thrilling to be found throughout the 1 hour 40 minutes of the film. And what satisfied me above all else was that Cloud's story finally received a perfect resolution.     I think most fans have been hoping and wishing that Aeris would return and I think the creators give a great answer to this in this movie. I won't spoil the ending, I won't tell you who does and doesn't return. But I will tell you the resolution is damn well awesome and probably the most satisfying ending to what is by far many people's favorite (if clichéd) choice for the Final Fantasy series. I do need to make a plea and I apologize for it, but if you downloaded this movie (like a certain reviewer did *cough*) please support it when it comes out here in the States and buy it. We need to show support to Square-Enix that this is the kind of sequel we want to see. They spent a long time and a lot of money making a movie that is direct to DVD here in the states. We need to return the favor and support it.     Square-Enix, my hats off to you for handling this with flair, tenderness and sympathy for the characters.
B0009RJPC8|2.0|Well!  We all thought Leo had faded away back in the early eighties, after a string of albums and hits over almost ten years.  (Go ahead, sing to yourself a few bars of \\"When I Need You\\" . . .)  But here he is, back and sounding exactly the same as if it's 1974 all over again.  Except . . . . . I remember him as a waif-like short fellow with wiry hair, whose plaintive voice and songs matched his appearance.  Somehow, in the intervening years he's managed to completely change his appearance, turning into a ruggedly handsome guy with cool long hair!  (Plastic surgery?  Even to make him taller?!!)  And apparently he's spent those years as a British soldier in the Balkans, and as a guard for the British royal family - or something like that.  Amazing!  How did li'l Leo do it?  (Was it some kind of community service sentence for some ill-doing?  Say it ain't so, L-e-o!) Well, who cares?  Since he's returned to what's apparently his first love -- singing emotive, drippingly romantic soft-rock in that virtually timeless style that he perfected back in the seventies - and still with that quavering, almost off-key falsetto.  So what's next, Leo - err, I mean \\"James\\" (nudge, wink)?  A duet with Mariah?  Breaking into a rap, or better yet, having a rap star guest on one of his songs?  Will this album come out in a new version, remixed for the dance clubs by today's hottest DJ's?  Or will it come out later, in a more expensive version, repackaged to include a DVD of Leo/James's videos?  Ah, soft-rock fluff-pop . . . . forever bubbling under the trendy styles, never quite making a comeback, but always threatening to . . . and always, always, \\"Giving It All Away\\".
B000002H6C|5.0|I don't get why an album like this couldn't be used to make a movie. It has so many images, and is so dense in content and meaning, it blows Pink Floyd's the wall right out of the water. In fact The Wall or any other CD on the planet completely sucks compared to any of metallica's first five albums.  <br />There will be a day when Metallica's genius is realized and accepted; they are true musicians not head-bangers. When this day comes I will surely laugh in the faces of disbelievers. You cannot classify and label Metallica as simply 'heavy-metal.' If you don't have the ear or the eye for the beauty that encompasses this Album and the three proceeding it, I feel sorry for you! I feel sorry for anyone missing out on the brilliance of Metallica; a band that can truly play their instruments and can really write their songs. Examples? Listen to the intro of ...And Justice for All (the song), listen to how it starts quietly and gradually evolves into a fast, kick-your-ass symphony. It has its peaks and valleys; the tempo slows down and almost restarts at one point, and gradually builds up again. It's amazing that two people are playing the guitar for that long. It's amazing that a band has created these riffs and melodies that extend usually over 6-7 minutes and almost never become boring! It's brilliance and you're a fool not to see it. In fact, for now on, I hate anyone who has not given Metallica a chance. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder; and in the words of Anton Lavey: aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of one's own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied.  <br /> Listen to a song like And justice for all and then switch to a song by Linkin Park, or Blink 182. If you have ears you'll notice immediately the lack of complexity and skill in the latter two! There's a huge degradation in the quality, and you can conclude the superiority rests with Metallica and without doubt. Go ahead, try it.Try the guitar solo of the song Ride the Lightning to any rock song you ever heard. Please, try it and you'll see I'm not even fing kidding in the slightest.  That's why songs today are shorter and full of ranting and whining; it's too cover the fact today's bands can't play their instruments. Metallica is the greatest band of all time and it doesn't have to do with preference. Even today - the so-called sell-out's - generate Platinum Albums (quicker than any Rap or Country singer I might add). Even if the general opinion is that Metallica 'sucks' now, they still have respect as people who can play their instruments incredibly well. They are true musicians. <br />
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|For the record, Sia is one of several female vocalists featured prominently on Zero 7's two albums, \\"Simple Things\\" and \\"When It Falls\\". In fact, I purchased this solely on the strength of her singing on the tracks \\"Destiny\\" (Simple Things) and \\"Somersault\\" (When It Falls). \\"Colour The Small One\\" does not disappoint, and Sia's uniquely raspy mezzo-soprano vox shimmers throughout the downtempo mood shifts on the record. It's hard to believe this gal's an Aussie; her vocal stylings are more towards trip-hop and ambient, soulfull R&B. <br /> <br />Like co-conspirator supporting vocalist Sophie Barker, Sia's solo work is somewhat darker and less emphasis is placed on the instrumentals. The pace is somber but picks up a little on \\"Sweet Potato\\" and \\"Where I Belong\\"; incidentally, these two tracks are the least cohesive. Where she truly shines is with stark minimalism, as is the case with \\"Breathe Me\\" and \\"Rewrite\\"--songs that would fit nicely on the next Zero 7 collaboration. <br /> <br />\\"Colour The Small One\\" proves that Sia has no problem making it on her own mettle; I can't wait to see what she does next.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|First of all let it be known that I had to be dragged by my best friend to watch this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm Not a fan of this genre its just that I hate Michelle Trachtenberg because of her oh-Gawd-so-annoying-role-that-I-wanna-rip-out-her-hair as Dawn in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I know a lot of you out there will agree with me on this one. But anyway, I did went and watch it (blame it on boredom) and to say at the very least, I do not want to rip anyone's hair at the end of the movie.<br /><br /> The movie was hilarious, and Trachtenberg wasn't annoying at all. She was surprisingly likeable as the only female in the group (will wonder ever cease?). This movie has all the premises of a teenager movie. Nudity, abundance of boobs, catchy one-liners (Jenny:\\"Heard bout Fiona.She'a a whore.Sotty:Aww thanks,thats sweet.\\")<br /><br />drugs,booze and everything else in between. The main song `Scotty doesn't know' is catchy as hell. I especially found the part with the Creepy Italian Guy \\"Mi scusi,mi scusi\\"<br /><br />on the train as the best part of the movie with the Robot Mime (something totally original by the way) as a close second. The whole idea of Cooper's `Crazy European Sex' is very amusing...and close to home *wink wink, hint hint*<br /><br /> All in all this movie should be on the look out for all those that's into these kind of movies. If `Road Trip' was more leaning towards the guys then `Euro Trip' is both for the guys and girls.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|A great old Musical with great stars.  A must see for music lovers!
B000002ADT|5.0|Those who wonder why jazz is a big deal should listen to this album. It contains a lot of what made and makes jazz a great and totally American form of music. The mellow and \\"cool\\" ambience of jazz fills even the moments of silence on this album. All the solos make profound personal statements and the tunes cling to neurons for a lifetime. Here stands one of the lasting monuments of jazz and one of the best displays of musical ingenuity around. And here's what throwing Miles Davis, \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley, and John Coltrane together makes: one of the best jazz albums ever recorded, and one of the genre's indispensable albums. This 1959 recording sounds fresh even today; even after the fusion revolution and the sad decline of jazz in the popular mainstream.<br /><br />Jazz is a deeply personal, deeply spontaneous form of music. As this CD's liner notes point out, spontaneity pervades this album. They also include this startling passage: \\"The group had never played these pieces prior to the recordings and I think without exception the first complete performance of each was a 'take'\\". Say no more.<br /><br />Overall the album feels mellow, reflective, and introspective, and now and then melancholy or lonely. And it never really breaks out of this feeling. Nor does it want to. Even the title \\"Kind of Blue\\" is evocative. At times the horns all come in at once and produce a knock-down sonic wall. But even this doesn't alter the mood. In \\"Blue and Green\\" the drums sit out altogether, leaving the piano as the backbone of the piece as horns vaporously float over the sparse arrangement. Relaxing sad beauty. \\"So What\\" remains one of Miles Davis' best songs. From the opening piano rolls, swinging horns, and poignant solos the song never lets the listener's attention stray. Coltrane's solo is especially incredible here. No duds. And only the best of human all too human flaws. Something great happened here.<br /><br />So why is jazz a big deal? Just listen.
B000A5044C|5.0|'Dare mo shiranai' (NOBODY KNOWS) is a gleaming little film by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda that offers a version of a true story so simply and eloquently that by the end of the film the audience is powerfully moved - without gimmicks, without imitation emotional devices, without major stars. It just simply works.  Though the film is long at 2 1/2 hours the journey is well worth it and indeed the prolonged length seems necessary to convey the plight of these touching children's plight.<br /><br />The film opens (during the titles) on public transportation where a youthful mother Keiko (the pop star You) and her young son Akira (Yûya Yagira) sit guarding an ugly pink suitcase and other bags. Keira and Keiko have rented a poor little apartment promising the landlord that Keiko will make no noise. Once inside their new home the ugly bags are open and two additional children emerge and a trip to the bus station adds yet a third child!  Thus, 'unknown' to the landlord, the apartment contains a family of five!  Soon Keiko leaves on a trip to 'make money', leaving some cash with Akira who is placed in charge of his brother and sisters.  Of course, Keiko doesn't return except for one brief visit months later, and leaving the children to fend for themselves.<br /><br />Akira manages to make friends outside, gaining food and money for good deeds and good will, keeping his little 'family' afloat.  Gradually Akira realizes that Keiko will never return and through his friendship with a young girl still manages to eek out an existence: the manner in which he keeps his family happy is food for the soul!  But despite his constant good intentions to maintain a life for his family, one of his sisters dies and he and his girl friend bury her where she can 'watch the airplanes'.  And life goes on. There is no ending depicted, just continuum.<br /><br />With the subtlest technique Koreeda creates a story so real  that it pulsates.  The child actors (especially Yûya Yagira) are  so natural and fine that they grab our hearts tenaciously. The only music in this film is a few notes form a toy piano and quiet harp music that enhances the feeling of isolation of the children.  This is a film of rare beauty, one that could have been edited a bit, but even that criticism is overshadowed by the impact of  Hirokazu Koreeda's overall achievement.  Very Highly Recommended.

B000002KDO|5.0|If their first two albums, \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Paranoid,\\" weren't so darn good, the third time would definitely be the charm for this band. \\"Masters of Reality\\" is one of Black Sabbath's best albums ever recorded, and probably one of the best heavy metal albums of all time.<br /><br />This album, which is Sabbath's heaviest recording, is also considered by some to be their most influential. I, personally, think their first two albums were more influential. But with \\"Masters of Reality,\\" Black Sabbath gave birth to doom/gloom/sludge metal. With its sludgy guitar riffs and dark, controversial lyrics (about such things as drug use) paved the way for early `90's bands, like Helmet and Smashing Pumpkins, but also other, super-heavy bands, like Crowbar, Eyehategod, and My Dying Bride.<br /><br />But, even though this was Black Sabbath's heaviest album, it also is their first album to have some acoustic guitar work. And track seven, \\"Solitude,\\" even has a flute solo!<br /><br />\\"Sweet Leaf\\" has a repetitive but catchy and groovey riff, some good bass lines, and heavy drums. Meanwhile, Ozzy sings lines like \\"I love you\\" and \\"my life was empty\\" about his favorite leaf (the \\"sweet leaf,\\" which is what he calls marijuana).<br />\\"After Forever\\" opens with some more catchy, beeping bass notes and an almost surging guitar riff. This riff bobs in places, and a guitar solo also crops up.<br />\\"Embryo\\" is a 25 second instrument solo (by an instrument which sounds like a violin).<br />\\"Children Of the Grave\\" has a very famous and catchy, almost running, guitar lead. There's a nice, classical sounding guitar solo, here, too.<br />\\"Orchid\\" is where an acoustic guitar makes an entrance. It plays a twinkling, dwindling solo over (what sounds like) a piano (or a really low bass).<br />\\"Lord Of This World\\" begins with a lurching, stop-start riff that you'll be dying to hum along to. Two more guitar solos are included here, as well.<br />\\"Solitude\\" is a power ballad, of sorts. It has some chimes, light guitar strums, a gluey, humming bass line, the aforementioned flute (which is played by Tony Iommi and almost sounds like it's Native American), depressing lyrics, and some super slow vocals by Ozzy.<br />\\"Into The Void\\" has another grooving, temporarily chugging riff. And I enjoy how the guitars and rhythm speed up around the middle of the song.<br /><br />This is definitely essential listening for all metalheads, because, as previously mentioned, this is one of Sabbath's best albums (thus making it also one of the best metal albums of all-time.) With \\"Masters of Reality,\\" Black Sabbath proved they were the Masters of Heavy Metal.bass line, the aforementioned flute (which is played by Tony Iommi and almost sounds like it's Native American), depressing lyrics, and some super slow vocals by Ozzy.  \\"Into The Void\\" has another grooving, temporarily chugging riff.

B000AL730O|5.0|After reading and laughing at the negative reviews,   I have a few questions to those people.   Did you have your Amps on?   Have your hearing checked in the past week?   Do you like good  music?     Do you just hate Paul because he's the most successful Songwriter ever?      Giving it 1 star for being technically unable to put it on your Ipod is Laughable.    The worst you can give this album is 3 stars and you would of had to have a really bad day before hearing it.     Please don't listen to the negative reviews it could be because its a different musical direction for Paul much like The Beatle's change in Musical Style from Revolver to Sgt Pepper.     They might of been expecting Band on the Run,Hi Hi Hi or Silly love songs.   Thats not the case and rightly so its already been done.    They might have better luck selling Snow shovels in Florida then trying to making one believe this albums a stinker.      Ok enough of my objections to their dislike for this Great album.    My Take on it    Brilliant!     The only reason repeated Listenings make you like it more is because its complex you can miss certain sounds and Instruments the 1st time around.    The production is excellent. Sound is of the highest quailty  I had thought that his voice was beginning to go but on this album it is Strong and Melodic.    He takes himself in new directions on this Album, comparison to his other solo albums is unnecessary this is his finest solo work.  It has no filler. Like in the Days of the Beatles singles  sides A&B are both Great.  I would compare some songs to His days with the Beatles.    Jenny Wren Goes in the direction of Blackbird and Mother Natures Son And is good enough to be included on the white album    At the Mercy Sounds like Abbey Road Material. The Harmonys get Tranced in your Mind.    Engish Tea Also sounds like its on the  White Album intentionally corny but it works, at first I thought what a mistake, but its sort of like Monthy Pyton Meets the White Album.How kind of you makes you feel thankful for the good people in this world that really do care.     Too much rain reminds me of my wonderful wife who in spite of very poor health is  helpful and caring of others. Its a Sad and hopeful song in one.    Fine Line is very upbeat and inspirational ( some say preaching I say inspirational) The youth of today should take a listen to it and learn from it.    A certain softness is Beautiful and moving    Riding to vanity Fair Is slow and moving with a good beat, with somewhat dark lyrics but still does not sound negative.    Before this Album came out I was Listening to The Stones a Bigger bang which it too is a Great album but since Chaos And Creation came out I haven't gone back to it.     I keep listening to the Creations of a 21 century Beatle  The songs come in and out of my Head while at work.     McCartney  has Made a album the we can whistle to  hum or sing along with, not many albums these days can Claim that.    In fact most Albums come with 2 maybe 3 songs that are just ok then the rest filler.   Here is an album thats good from begining to end. reminiscent of a Beatles album.      This Album I expect to Go to number 1.  I sure hope it does, it will boost Paul's confidence and the end result will be more Great Music.  I highly recommend it Go buy it and enjoy.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|You've got to give Clutch credit.  Despite being one of the most revered and underrated bands in the hard rock/metal genre, they continue to pump out excellent albums one after another, and \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\" is no exception.  Taking a step back with the more metal aspects of their sound and fusing an almost funk sound with blues and classic rock, Clutch's diversity can be seen to full effect.  The driving rhythms that fuel the opening \\"Incomparable Mr. Flannery\\", \\"Burning Beard\\", \\"Gullah\\", and \\"Never Be Moved\\" are must listens, but the band really shows their stuff on \\"10001110101\\" and \\"10,000 Witnesses\\".  The previously mentioned tracks are standouts, but make no mistake that there is not one track on this album that you'll want to skip through.  \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\" is one of those few albums that come along every once in a while that will leave you in awe, and it's a modern day Clutch masterpiece.  It's a perfect place to start for new fans, and it's definitely one of, if not the, best albums of the year in ANY musical genre.
B000AL730O|5.0|As a Paul Mccartney fan for 40 years I see this as his best solo effort yet. From my days as a 9 year old fan in 1965 until now, I am enjoying this immensely. What I most appreciate are the clever touches that make the songs shimmer and glide.
B000002H70|5.0|There aren't words to describe this album actually there is one magical.I've been listening to the cure for about 2 years now.I recently bought Disintegration its an awesome album the songs are all magical they capture and take you to a land of your own where its just you and Robert Smith's voice leading you.Some of the best songs on the album are Lullaby,Love Song,Pictures of you,Fascination Street, and the self titled track Disintegration.Basically what I'm trying to say is if you're thinking of buying a Cure album or just listen to The Cure go hurry and buy this album like what my title says This is the best Cure album ever.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|Jackie Gleason was asked, why The Honeymooners has stood the test of time.  A bit peeved, he replied, \\"Because it's funny.\\"<br /><br />The same with Lover Come Back. Almost every line is a joke, and when it's supposed to be funny, it is. And what was funny then is still funny now. The script is tight and never insults our intelligence with implausible plot points.  And the stars, Rock hudson, Doris Day and Tony Randall, are at their peak.  And the feature roles are filled with great character players (Anne B. Davis, Joe Flynn and the great Jack Oakie).  You'd almost think it was the golden age of the Studio System.<br /><br />It's difficult to summarize the plot, because it would be like explaining the punch line of a great joke.  Trust me on this: Lover Come Back will go down as one of the great comedies in movie history.<br /><br />There's a scene at the Aquarium, where Jerry Webster seduces Carol Templeton.  It takes place in front of a tank with an anglerfish and a minnow.  Need I say more?
B0002S947K|5.0|I heard Ray's \\"Trouble\\" on the radio when it was first released and kept thinking to myself, \\"Man, is this a man or a woman singing?\\" Either way, it was pretty damn good. I heard this song a lot on the same station and everytime, I was always impressed by it and finally got the artist's name. I was surprised to hear that it was a guy because he sort of sounded like Tracy Chapman but I came onto Amazon to purchase this CD since this seemed to be the only place that sold it at the time and was so excited to get it to see what he was all about. I definitely was not disappointed. As I listened on, his voice seemed to fit so perfectly with his guitar playing and lyrics. It is so soulful and full of emotion that I couldn't stop listening to this CD for weeks. The standouts on the CD are definitely the first 3 songs which are \\"Trouble\\", \\"Shelter\\" and \\"Hold You in My Arms\\" and the song \\"Jolene\\". I was able to catch him live twice at the House of Blues in San Diego and I just have to say that the man almost brought me to tears when he sang. His voice was that powerful. I recommend all to buy this album and definitely to see him live. Enjoy!!!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I ordered the Japanese DVD and am glad for it.    This movie takes place a few years after the FFVII game, with Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Cid, Red XII, Cait, Yuffie, and Vincent in the cast.      After the fight in the end of Final Fantasy VII, some of the children around Midgar have become infected with cells of Jenova.  But then the three silver haired men show up in search for their \\"mother\\" Jenova, with the cast of Final Fantasy standing in their way.  It's up to Cloud and the gang to stop more battles from breaking out.    The graphics of this movie are purely beautiful that any one would enjoy.  They're not the cartoony type from Disney, nor anime, but something that people would expect from SquareEnix.  I highly recommend this movie, even though those who haven't played the game might just like the graphics.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is the best that I have heard in years.  I love it.
B00028HBKM|1.0|You people are joking, right?  You cried tears of joy from seeing this film?  Don't get me wrong, I like gratuitous violence just as much as the next guy, but there should be some plot, especially when there is an entire religion devoted to the subject.   <br /> <br />I watched this movie with my devoutly Catholic grandmother and when it finished, we kind of stared blankly at each other  wondering if there was something missing from the DVD version of the film or if the people who saw it in the theatres were really stupid enough to think that this is a ground-breaking, beautiful masterpiece. <br /> <br />If you want to see a beautiful, ground-breaking masterpiece of the same artistic quality as this film, I hear Debbie Does Dallas was re-released.  At least the smut in that film would feign to be enjoyable.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth just keep getting better!!!  I drove quite a distance so I could pick this up at a store the Friday b4 the release date. What can I say even with gas prices it was well worth the trip! My buddies, wife and I were in total awe of the musicianship, songwriting, singing, and sound of this cd!!!!  This cd runs the whole gamut of the many styles of Opeth.  The keyboards add an excellent touch sounding like JPJ at age 20!!  This is a Prog rock giant of a release and for many years real music lovers and especially us musicians will rave about this one!  What is so cool about the mighty Opeth is they never sound like they are working so hard to sound so technically proficient like D.T.  Now I do like DT a lot but this is clearly better  material.  The voice it just keeps getting better.  I could go on about how every song on this cd smokes and how perfect the drumming is (this coming from a guitarist)and so on but enough people have done that already and I think you know where I stand this is again a Prog rock lovers dream come true!!!!!  Opeth in Philly 10-31-05, YES!!!!!
B000AJJNOK|4.0|I usally don't take the time to do things like write reviews  for albums on the net but I had to show love for this album. I know a lot of people think 50 sells records based on him dissin other rappers, but if you really listen to this album it is really good. I fell in love with it just recently. I loved Get Rich or Die Tryin' and now The Massacre has become a favorite. People may say 50 criticized Ja Rule for singing on records/making \\"club\\" type records, and then turned around and did the same thing but I don't think you can compare 50 to Ja Rule. 50 is very clever. He knows how to sell records but he still makes quality music. 50 gives variety. On the Massacre he has songs that represent that \\"gangsta\\" music reminiscent of \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" such as track 4 'I'm Supposed To Die Tonight', which is one of my favorites. Then there is track 11 'A Baltimore Love Thing' which is a clever track on which 50 raps about drug addiction in the form of a love relationship where he is rapping to an addict from the drug's perspective (heroin). Then of course he has club bangers like 'Disco Inferno' and track 14 'Just a Lil Bit', another favorite of mine. Other favorite tracks= track 5 'Piggy Bank', track 8 'Outta Control remix'(real smooth track), and track 17 'Position of Power'. This is a well rounded album so take the time to really listen. Oh, and check out the DVD w/ the video's. The video for 'Piggy Bank' is hilarious. 50 will keep shining because he's making big moves w/ the G-unit and all the haters haven't stopped him yet. I can't wait for Buck's next album!
1591391105|5.0|Very insightful and informative for any new leader, regardless of the position.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I watched this movie (after watching many old horror movies when i was younger), and felt that it was fun, popcorn entertainment.  This movie actually brought back memories of when i was younger and watched the old dracula or wearwolf movies.  If you want realism go see a movie with crowe or gibson, if you want to watch a movie that will flat out entertain....this is it.  Too many people these days over-analyze the movies that they watch in hopes that they will be the next ebert or siskel.  I go see movies to have fun, and that is what this movie is.

038073186X|5.0|After reading the first 85% of this book, I was thinking I knew how it was going to turn out, and that the plot and ending, though well-crafted, would be somewhat predictable and thus unusual for Lehane.  I should have known better!  The last 15% got my heart rate up to a dangerous level, and the ending -- both frightening and poignant -- left me unsettled for days.  This powerful story will remind the thoughtful reader of Kafka (Lehane must have been reading 'In the Penal Colony' before starting this one).  A fantastic read!
0385335989|4.0|The Outlander series has been one of the most interesting and riveting reading investments I have made this year.  I have loved all of the novels I've read thus far, especially Voyager.  Now that I have read Drums of Autumn, the fourth book of what will apparently be a six-book series, it appears that the wonderful reading investments will continue, although I wasn't as riveted with this one as I was with its three predecessors.  Drums of Autumn takes a bit of a break from Claire and Jamie Fraser and focuses more on their offspring Brianna and her significant other Roger.  Brianna and Roger discover an old newspaper clipping in which states that Jamie and Claire die in a fire, so Brianna decides to visit the old stone circle that transports her to pre-Revolutionary America without telling Roger.  Her intention is to attempt to change the course of history and save her parents' lives.  Jamie and Claire are living normal lives in North Carolina after deciding to abandon the chaotic Scotland and all of the casualties that occurred during the Jacobite Rising.  Brianna is happy to be with her parents and spending time with them, but will she be able to return to 20th Century?  And will she ever see Roger again?  There are various twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Once again, Gabaldon regales the reader with a historically rich tale that makes you feel as though you had been around during that time frame.  The backdrop of North Carolina in the 18th Century sounds beautiful.  The Colonial times have always fascinated me and reading about that period, especially before the Revolution, was very insightful and enjoyable.  And I loved reading about how Jamie and Claire got there and built their lives away from Scotland.  In fact, all of the chapters centered on Jamie and Claire were wonderful and riveting as usual.  But I agree with the reviewer who stated that their relationship is a little too perfect now.  I like them when they are facing adversities and conquering dilemmas with a love that transcends time, war and all sorts of obstacles.  I enjoyed their love story of old, especially in Voyager.  And I have to add that Brianna and Roger aren't quite as memorable or as interesting as Jamie and Claire.  Brianna is somewhat one-dimensional and doesn't bring anything new to the story.  As for Roger, I like that he's a descendant from one of the members of the MacKenzie clan who happens to be one of Jamie's cousins, and he does have a spark to him that I like.  However, he is not Jamie, and reading about him and Brianna has left me cold.  Perhaps I am being biased because I love Jamie and Claire so much, but Brianna and Roger don't transmit the same sort of passion and fire that their older counterparts do.  As for the other characters, there are some new ones that are colorful and wonderful to read, which keeps the story from lagging too much.  But, as I already said, the new couple doesn't quite do it for me.  And that is why Drums of Autumn isn't quite as unputdownable (not a real word, I know) as the previous three and that is why I take away a star.  I felt the impatience of reading the 800-plus pages of the trade paperback book this time, unlike with the other books. I nevertheless loved it and cannot wait to pick up The Fiery Cross.lemmas with a love that transcends time, war and all sorts of obstacles.  I enjoyed their love story of old, especially in Voyager.

B000008L90|4.0|Many of my favorite Donna Summer albums are the ones where she had a good amount of crative freedom to develop what she wanted.<br /><br />As the liner notes state, David Geffen stayed \\"out of the kitchen\\" (for the most part), and he let Donna cook!<br /><br />Produced by Michael Omartian, a man that Donna stated was as easy to work with as Giorgio, Cats has a decidedly 80's edge, with some tinges of Disco thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Like the She Works Hard For The Money album (also produced by Omartian), Cats contains a number of \\"message\\" songs that reflected Donna's embrachment of her faith, I'm Free, It's Not The Way, Suzanna amoung them. However Donna's approach to these songs and the one of a kind diversity of her voice lead them to have a Pop sensibility, and on many ways laid the groundwork for Amy Gran't venture into secular music.<br /><br />Supernatural Love, Oh Billy Please, and Eyes were great up to the minute 80's Pop/Dance songs, that frankly should have been the single picks for this release.  her update to the Drifter's Classic There Goes My Baby, was OK, and in fact became a Top 30 song for her, but this cover can not hold a candle to her original songs on this record. Rumor was that There Goes My Baby was Mr. Geffen's idea, enough said.<br /><br />Maybe It's Over was the ballad here, and considering that Donna and Bruce almost called it quits early in '83, I can see where her pastionate delivery came from. For the flip side to this story, Love Has A Mind Of It's Own, from the She Works hard...album, was written by Bruce as a lets stay together song.<br /><br />An interesting side note is that Cats continued the Geffen era \\"policy\\" of having an unreleased track as a 'B\\" side single. In this case it's the great Dance Song, Face The Music. Why this track is not on the album is beyond me, but it was featured as the \\"B\\" side to the single of Supernatural Love.<br /><br />Finally the beautiful spiritual song, Forgive Me, rounds out the album (and gave Donna her 4th Grammy). This song was part of her 1983 Tour, and was a pasionate highlight.<br /><br />Why did Cats..not become a mega seller?, I think there were a few reasons inlcuding the continued backlash against Disco Artists, at the time of it's release Madonna was just starting to hit her stride, and the idiotic rumor that Donna has endured since 1983 kept her most pasionate fan base (Gay Men) from fully trumpeting this great album.<br /><br />The time is now for Universal to release a remastered version of this opus, with Face The Music, included.out the album (and gave Donna her 4th Grammy).

B000AL730O|4.0|Paul continues to age gracefully while still showing some youthful chops and charm.  This album is a first-rate solo outing if for no other reason than Paul practically built it piece by piece entirely by himself.  Only on a handful of tracks is he accompanied by other musicians.  In that regard, it recalls his first solo album.  This album is more sophisticated than that effort, both musically and lyrically.  Played back-to-back it demonstrates the evolution he's taken as an artist.  This album isn't as distinctive as his previous outing, \\"Driving Rain\\", but has its own individuality.  The lyrics are more thoughtful and full of ideas and maturity.  The arrangements include coloratura instruments unusual to his sound.  These are the reflections of a person whose life has been lived fully but not regretfully.  Paul's music has become increasingly personal over the last decade or so, which makes up for all the flashy shallowness and missteps of his earlier solo work.  There are two groups of Macca fans--those who don't feel he's done anything good since \\"Band on the Run\\" (when they were in high school) and the rest of us, who continue to follow his career and take it for what it is with honesty and humility.  His genius and artistry cannot be denied.  This is probably his most consistently pleasing effort since \\"Tug of War\\"
B000002VCT|5.0|I had this album on tape, then on vinyl then finally on the remastered cd. My journey with this album gives me memories. the songs are catchy and can be sung easily but with strong prog elements. Thanks Mr. Parsons for making this album.
B0000257O9|4.0|There is a lot going on in this album than the one-off novelty of \\"Video\\" suggests -- this is a complex sci-fi ode to a discomforting, sometimes optimistic, occasionally joyful future.  It's rendered in an engaging, deft mix of \\"new-wave\\" synth sounds, sterile guitar and drums, and washes of sound that manage to capture the tone and feel of this near-future dystopia quite effectively.<br /><br />To me, it's a bit like The Cars' Panorama or Todd Rundgren's The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect, both recorded at the same time, in that what is created here is an insular world, a bit cold and distant, providing a glimpse at the future that, to my ears today, ironically sounds quaint, inviting, and comforting.  To be honest, as the headlines today blare continuing bad news, I'm going to keep going back to this future as it's often preferable to our present....
B000000I02|4.0|This cd would require more active listening but generally the results are very rewarding. I've listened to this more than 20 times and I still discover new sounds and new twists. Dave and crew must've been into some kind mind enhancing potion to create such complex music.
B000A2T1T4|5.0|With Ozzy out of the band, soon to start his solo career, Ronnie James Dio came on board. Released in 1980, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is Dio's first album with Black Sabbath, and it's a stunner.<br /><br />The album proves that Dio was a hell of a hard rock vocalist at this point--he sounds great throughout. However, he also brought more to the band than just a new voice. Dio wrote all the lyrics here, and he brought his already patented \\"dungeons and dragons\\"-style lyrics to the Sabbath mix. Although some folks seem to find the lyrics vomit-inducing, I really don't see the big problem. Admittedly, he does get a little carried away at times as on \\"Die Young\\" or the chants of \\"fool fool\\" on the title track, but it's not a major gripe. He brings a certain theatricality to the album, and his vocals are arrestingly passionate and forceful.<br /><br />Musically, it's very much a straightforward hard rock album, and that's a positive thing, because the songs are pretty much all great, with infectious guitar riffs piling up along the way--the driving \\"Neon Knights\\" opens the album with exciting surge of energy; the infectious \\"Wishing Well\\" is a hook-fest with irresistible drum rolls throughout from Bill Ward; and the title track is an excellently-sequenced multi-part epic with Tony Iommi laying down a stately opening riff that is simply masterful. \\"Children of the Sea\\" starts off mellow with nice ringing guitar before transforming into a slow-paced rocker with a crunching riff. \\"Lady Evil\\" is a highly catchy mid-tempo rocker with cool wah-wahed lead guitar. The fast-paced \\"Die Young\\" has an effectively atmospheric intro and is really catchy, despite the pomposity of its airy bridge section and Dio's non-stop repetition of the title. \\"Lonely Is The Word\\" is a powerful album-closing epic with excellent, emotional soloing from Iommi. \\"Walk Away\\" reeks a little of filler compared to all of the greatness that the album offers, but it's still a solid, fun rocker in its own right.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" clearly demonstrates that bringing in Ronnie James Dio to join Iommi, Butler, and Ward was a great idea that worked big time--this is an awe-inspiring, must-have album.

B00000I8BX|4.0|As always, I am going to compare this to demanufacture, and say this; Demanufacture is an amazing album, and no album has had ever beat it, and I highly doubt any album will. Obsolete still won't, as good as it is! Unfortunatly, for Obsolete, it is very watered down basically playing the same guitar riffs when it gets heavy, just in a different way and on different frets of the guitar. That's the MAJOR disappointment.  <br /> <br />This is a concept album, and I will say this much, A GREAT story. I personally will say that this album is obsolete to the fear factory society if you will. Still, some of the greatest fear factory songs are on this album. I am only reviewing the part of the album that actually tells the story of edgecrusher destroying all of mankind. <br /> <br />the songs I LOVE in order that I love them in: <br />1)Timelessness - this is the MOST beautiful song by the band on this album, and it is my second all time favorite fear factory song, because it has melody, its emotional, and beautiful, still it is VERY painful. Bourton shows us his melodic side of his vocals on this track and does an AMAZING job, which is why he is my second favorite vocalist, first being Matt Barlow from Iced Earth.  <br />2)Resurrection - Probably the best song to most fear factory fans on this album. I can understand why. <br />3)Smasher/Devourer - WOW!!!!! WHOLY JEEZ! What a HEAVY song, even though it is simple, it's VERY sinister and makes you want to rage <br />4)High-Tech Hate - If anybody remember's the band's old website, they had the introduction of the song playing on the site. This is probably the most sinister riff, because unlike many other songs on the album, it's actually pretty creative! <br /> <br />Songs I liked, but didn't LOVE: <br />1)Obsolete - not bad <br />2)Freedom Of Fire - Good, but still, not THAT good <br />3)Shock - Good way to start the album, but I am not as fond of it as the other songs that I loved on the album <br />4)Securitron - Not bad;meh! <br /> <br />Songs I didn't like TOO much, songs that were MEH, Meh for Meh-dee-Oh-Ker (mediocre): <br />1)Edgecrusher - HIGHLY over-rated song, and I HATED how they had a cello in there (or it at least SOUNDED like one, which pissed me off) <br />2)Decent - not TOO fond of it, like was said again, HIGHLY over-rated. I didn't even like Bourton's vocals in it, and especially at the begining <br /> <br />Besides the negative songs, and other songs that include very little creativity, The album is still VERY good. Just not as good as demanufacture, because that album is not loaded with throw-aways like this. The songs I love I would say are the best songs of the album (no doubt). The album did NEED improvement, but I still, HIGHLY recommend it, especially over Digimortal and maybe transgression/archetype.  <br />
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I love this movie.  I first saw it on a cable station and just got pulled into it.  Might be because of Hugh Grant...*SIGH*  anyways!  It is very comical in several aspects of the story line and sad as well. <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil but just a bit of an overview, a guy that has nothing to do b/c he's so rich invents a kid to meet women, and then meets a kid that has a mom that's a loon.  The kid thinks, \\"RIGHT ON!  He can help me with my mum!\\"  The truth comes out about the made up kid and then Hugh Grant's character makes up to be the father of the kid with the looney mum to impress another woman.  That doesn't work out very well but in the end everybody is really happy!  WAHOO!! <br /> <br />There are lots of spots that are funny because it's where the truth has to be told and they just don't know how to tell it without repercusions.  Love those parts!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Best movie ever made, best actors, best script... The best of Fincher, Pitt, Norton.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This film will definitely appeal to anyone who has played through ff7. I never made it through the first portion of final fantasy 7 and I'm probably never going to. The story isn't near as complicated as some people have made it out to be, it's really easy to follow as long as you pay attention. The problem is the story really isn't that good, and I really never cared what was going to happen to the characters it's trite good vs evil b.s.  It's obvious who is going to come out on top.  <br />  <br />On the plus side the animation was excellent, a realistic stylized cg film. The fight scenes which encompass a good 2/3s of the film were well done, some times the quick camera movements worked for the film but there were a few moments where they over did it.  <br /> <br />The film isn't on par with cg greats like Toy Story or The Incredibles, which had the total story/style package working with them. It offers a few laughs for fans of the games and some eeewwwws and aaahhhs to people who understand what goes into animating a feature. I guess that's really all you can ask for in a direct to video film. <br /> <br /> In the end it's forgettable and after 2 or 3 viewings it will probably end up collecting dust on your shelf. They should have given Cloud a beard, because when asexy girly heros fight, we lose.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Being a drum'n'bassist by nature, i found this album to be an landmark in hip hop. DO NOT listen to one Scott I. Sosin \\"scosos\\" (detailed review on first page) for he is, from what i can view on his profile, a complete rocker, and his collection is, er, real varied! This album IS varied, and a drum'n'bassing, hip-hop mixer like me knows better. You cannot beat the pumping'lets get retarded', groovy 'smells like funk', sexy bosso-nova drenched 'Latin Girls, 'Boogie' and the classic 'where is the love'. Hasn't left my cd player, the only thing that may shift that is 'monkey business'-but that would defo be another review!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"Watch it man, there's a beverage involved here\\" or \\"Two Oat Sodas, Gary\\"!,  Classic one liners like that and the dialogue of the entire movie make it an instant success. People need to listen as well as watch this movie. Check it out, cant wait until the collectors edition come out.
0804115613|5.0|If you're trying to decide between seeing the movie or reading the book first, definitely go for the book. There's something about Flagg's writing that makes it leap off the pages with Southern charm.  Being overly familiar with the excellent movie of the same name, I felt like I was reading the screenplay when I read the book, and I wished I could enjoy this literature on its own, without imagining Kathy Bates and Mary Stuart Masterson in their big screen portrayals.<br /><br />That said, this is an excellent piece of Southern literature, interweaving years and generations of colorful characters. The stories about family, relationships, love, community ties, and more are beautiful and important with their life lessons.
B00006RU5B|5.0|After Soundgarden disbanded, Chris Cornell moved out of the limelight to work on a solo career. But, by the time Rage Against The Machine broke up in 2001, Cornell was back on his feet with some of the most exciting musicians of the day, particularly the creative  Tom Morello. Cornell's voice is back on Audioslave, while Morello covers all the guitars, Tim Commerford is the pounding, groove-controlling bass player, and Brad Wilk is the drummer. This band was never really taken seriously at its inception, but proved itself with some awesome tracks and an album that has sold over 5 million copies to date. <br /> <br />TRACKS: <br /> <br />Cochise- 5/5 <br />The rocker of the album, and the first single. Truly an awesome tune. <br /> <br />Show Me How To Live- 5/5 <br />The groove track on the album. Morello drops to D, and rocks out like no other. Almost too good to be true, particularly after the powerful Cochise. <br /> <br />Gasoline- 5/5 <br />This track shows that the party is just getting started, as Morello drops even lower to B and the rock comes pouring down, heavily as can be. A highlight to be sure. <br /> <br />What You Are- 4/5 <br />This is a step down, but still a nice track. This would be a three if not for the outstanding solo in the middle. <br /> <br />Like A Stone- 5/5 <br />The song that really brought attention to Audioslave, this song is truly beautiful- Cornell's voice isn't strained, Morello plays beautiful melodies, and Tim and Brad keep the whole thing together. Best solo I have heard in years. <br /> <br />Set It Off- 5/5 <br />The best opener to any Audioslave tune, this track is nothing out of the ordinary, and contains no guitar solo, but really gets things heated up. Truly a great track. <br /> <br />Shadow On The Sun- 5/5 <br />Best cut on the album. Morello is in B, but teases us with a bone-chilling opening line on the higher notes up his fretboard. the song really cranks, and is the centerpiece of the record. <br /> <br />I Am The Highway- 5/5 <br />After the mind-blowing Shadow On The Sun, this song slows things down, and is perfect to drive to. Morello's guitar work feels like moving wheels, with a hint of Spaghetti Western. Fun, fun track. <br /> <br />Exploder- 5/5 <br />This shows the album starting to repeat itself, but still a fiery track with an explosive (no pun intended) chorus. <br /> <br />Hypnotize- 5/5 <br />The most \\"out there\\" song on the album, this is a highlight. Dig in. <br /> <br />Bring Em Back Alive- 4/5 <br />The solo on this song is outstanding, but its still a weaker tune, as its almost too grungy for this very rock-orientated album. The chorus is good, but the verses just slow the progress of the album down. Still a great track nonetheless. <br /> <br />Light My Way- 5/5 <br />By this point, Audioslave has run out of ideas, but is still trying to fill album space. I love this song, but I can recognise the fact that Audioslave are really straining here. <br /> <br />Getaway Car- 4/5 <br />Almost like a weaker I Am The Highway, Getaway Car is just too slow to be at the end of the album, and slows down the progress to much- similar to much of the latter half of the album. <br /> <br />The Last Remaining Light- 4/5 <br />Instead of an explosive finish, we get this, a song that has a great chorus, but suffers from being too uninspired to really end the album triumphantly. The album farts out, but no matter; it has done its job, showing us the listeners that Audioslave is capable, and that much better is to come, if we can be patient. <br /> <br />Truly a masterpiece of an album, this was reviewed song by song in the context of the album, but since I love every song, I give it what it deserves: 5/5. Buy Out Of Exile, its fantastic.
0060987464|5.0|This book is co-authored with Neil Strauss, who is a master of the biography genre.  I picked it up solely on the strength of Strauss's name and not because I am a Manson fan.  This is a masterpiece of an autobiography and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes reading about life in the fastlane and unusual characters.  Hearing Manson's story behind the music made me want to explore his music more, but you definitely don't have to be a fan to appreciate this fine piece of literature.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the book is reading about the Antichrist Superstar tour through Manson's tour diary.  This was the tour that was constantly in the media for supposed crime and disgrace and violence.  During the tour and the media frenzy, I always thought Manson was out to make headlines and shock, but to hear the story in his own words, he didn't have to do a heck of a lot to provoke the American Family Association.  They invented enough on their own to make Manson into a scarier caricature of who he already was.<br /><br />Manson is depraved and twisted, and reading some of his narrative definitely has a gruesome allure.  There's also a softer side here, that of a confused boy who first heard heavy metal music when it was played backwards over his Christian school's PA system to show the students the depraved Satanic messages it carried.  Who wouldn't want to get into heavy metal after that?  Manson was also repeatedly wounded by women and lacked healthy relationships.<br /><br />In this book, Manson disputs some of the rumors surrounding him, via a list of fake information posted by \\"fans\\" on the internet.  I certainly had my eyes opened as some of the Manson myth was dispelled.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any music fan, pop culture fan, or fans of the memoirs of interesting people.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album is truly fantastic. The first album really caught my interest, but I wasn't sure I liked the whole supergroup vibe I was getting, and decided to let their second album help me decide whether or not I was a fan. When I saw them live, a month before the release, I was so psyched I could barely contain myself. By this point, the first album was being played everyday. <br />When this album finally came out, I came home from school and and practically leapt on it, I was so excited. <br />I put it in the player, listened intently, and read the lyrics. <br />My opinion was this, and still is this: <br />The album doesn't have songs that immdeiately blow you away, but you tend to notice that this album is special, it just requires more listening and searching. The first thing I loved about it wa that it sounded real- it wasn't overprocessed like the first album, and showed that the guys were much more laid back than back in 2002. Secondly, after quitting smoking, Cornell sounds a million times better, and Morello sounds better than ever. On future listens, I would come to appreciate every single song, as it is a concept album musically, and the lyrics help this description of it. While some tracks, such as your time has come, feel like they've been done before (the aforementioned song has an unmistakenable resemblance to cochise and their cover version of super stupid), you come to see their differences, and appreciate the songs that sound fresh. All the songs here show that the band have matured, and will offer nothing but good things in the future. <br /> <br />Review of the indivual tracks: <br /> <br />Your Time Has Come- The second single off the album, this song feels like it was done to offer the record company something to go with. Do not judge the album strictly by this song; Audioslave have changed, and for the better, and this song was just a little blast to the past. Still a fun ride 5/5 <br /> <br />Out Of Exile- Awesome track, should have been a single, but wasn't for unclear reasons. Look to this song for the new Audioslave at its best. 5/5 <br /> <br />Be Yourself- The first and strongest single off of Out Of Exile, this particular version has been mixed differently from the single version, and is a bit quieter and delicate than its counterpart. A stunning track, and certainly a grand step in a new direction for Audioslave. 5/5 <br /> <br />Doesn't Remind Me- The third single, and most recent, from the album, this song is a singalong three-chord track that seems, on first sight, to be almost too simple for Morello's guitar technique. However, songs like this make Audioslave special, because they show that Audioslave will do anything that sounds good, no matter how simplistic. Enjoyable tune, but weaker than the rest of the album IMO. 4/5 <br /> <br />Drown Me Slowly- Anyone order Audioslave's Bulls On Parade? Here ya go. Kicking verses, even stronger chorus, and Morello-scratch/digitech solo adds to the mix to make a stunning track. Cornell's voice is particularly grand on this track. 5/5 <br /> <br />Heaven's Dead- This song is highly underrated, and is extremely beautiful. Listen to this song, and understand why Cornell is the man for conveying emotion. Getaway Car, but loads better. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Worm- HEAVY. This song kicks, in low B. Play it LOUD. Very LOUD. Outstanding track. <br /> <br />Man Or Animal- A song that feels old by the time you get to it, sort of like by the time you got to Exploder on the first record- loved it, but been there, done that. Still, quite the tune, and a super chorus. 5/5 <br /> <br />Yesterday To Tomorrow- Not sure about this track. It's very different from anything Audioslave has ever done before, and is a realy good tune. Still not as strong as other tracks, but fantastic nonetheless. 4/5 <br /> <br />Dandelion- This, Be Yourself, Out Of Exile and Drown Me Slowly should have been singles. Dandelion is so light, you can almost feel yourself floating while listening to it. Cornell's voice is soooooo delicate here, and Morello's guitar is lazy with summertime bliss. Just a great song. 5/5 <br /> <br />#1 Zero- Really different for Audioslave, but unlike the sometimes sketchy Yesterday to Tomorrow, this song really gives it to you. Almost sounds like a crescendo-ing revenge song, and is creepy in a way. Look out for this as the surprise song off of the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Curse- Best title, but by the time this track comes, so many other songs have totally outclassed it, that it appears to be almost dry. The solo is the best on the album, but even that won't save you from feeling doubtful about this track. Gotta give it like it is...5/5. That's right, the track takes a while to grab ya, but once you start singing along, you're in for a treat. Don't give up on the last track, its great. <br /> <br />Anyhow, buy the album, its ten bucks at most places, and is a steal for such a price. Really a fun album; a flat-out rock album at its best.
B000AL730O|5.0|Take 5 or 6 of these songs, add 5 or 6 from Lennon, 1-2 from George and maybe a Ringo tune. Mix it up and you've music as good as the Fab 4 ever put together. I think Paul does his best work when challanged. Nigel may have been his John Lennon or George Martin on this one, squeezing Paul on every cut. Get the special edition with DVD, you won't be disappointed.
0783233477|5.0|Meet Joe Black does an excellent job exploring what an amazing gift and experience it is to be alive.  Brad Pitt's performance is wonderful as Death learning to inhabit a human body and experience human emotions.  The writing is poignant, funny, insightful, and simply excellent.  Don't miss this film.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|For the most part, the music I enjoy are by artists who don't release much material these days - people like Pink Floyd, Roxy Music, Queen, Yes, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, etc.  However, there are very few artists performing on a regular basis today that I get excited about when I hear they are releasing a new album.  Radiohead is one of those as is Wilco and Beck.  But it is this album by Iceland's Sigur Ros that had me excited for well over a month (and would have been longer if I had known about it sooner!). <br /> <br />And I am happy to say that I am not disappointed by \\"Takk\\".  I have to admit that I didn't like \\"(  )\\" aka Untitled as much as \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" but Untitled has grown on me.  I think the reason for that is Untitled is more bleak and sadder compared to \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\".  \\"Takk\\" is a more upbeat album for sure compared to Untitled and the song lengths seem to have gotten shorter.  But you know after hearing the first 15 seconds of the album's instrumental title track, that this is a Sigur Ros album.  After the opener, Sigur Ros goes for the throat immediately with the outstanding \\"Glosoli\\", one of their all-time best songs, IMO.  After hearing this song, it is very apparent to me that My Bloody Valentine is a huge influence on Jonsi and the rest of the band.  Track #3 is a very joyous song and reminds me of a shorter version of some of the tracks on \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\".  The next 2 tracks were alright, but nothing outstanding.  That all changed with track #6, \\"Saeglopur\\" - this one song by itself makes buying this album essential.  It is like they took the best parts of \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" and Untitled and mixed in some My Bloody Valentine and came up with this monster.  Words cannot describe this song - it is a just phenomenal song. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, with such a mindblowing song in the middle of the album, it was inevitable the rest of the album would pale in comparison.  Track #7 is okay but meanders a little too much and then we have \\"Gong\\" (Track #8) - one of the few songs on the album that the band had played live in concerts.  It is one of the best songs on the album with some phenomenal drumming.  The last 3 tracks are solid but nothing special. <br /> <br />The end result is that \\"Takk\\" is a very solid album that weakens just a little bit near the end.  Not as great as \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" but an album that is just as good or better than Untitled, IMO.  Buy it simply for track #6 and prepare to have your jaw drop in amazement.
B00001OH7P|5.0|At the moment this is probably my favorite album. <br />You'll notice in most albums that there's at least one song that sticks out a bit funny.  In this one there isn't, although i do prefer the live version of Rock 'n' Roll suicide better than the one on this album.  <br />the entire album just comes together so nicely.   <br />When I run through this album at the end I usually have to go back to the beginning. It's so good that I just don't want it to be over. <br /> <br />this is  a good album for any person to have.  I would rate it as an essential item in any ones collection.
B000005RNQ|4.0|After two phenomenal albums in 1980, Saxon put out -Denim & Leather- in 1981 and countiued their streak of exellent albums. <br /> <br />A reviewer could be easily fooled here, there are a mixed bag of postive and negative postings on this NWOBHM classic but don't be decived by those. True, this isn't as good as say -Wheels of Steel-,-Stong Arm of the Law- or even -Power and Glory-, you have to consider the fact that this album was predominantly written on the road. This is still a very good Saxon CD though, i find it to be my personal favorite mainly because of the \\"heavy metal rules, screw everything else\\" atmosphere that exudes from it. <br /> <br />The production is pretty clear for a early 80's rock album, so it's got pretty good sound qaulity wise for a metal record. I find that even thought there are a couple fillers on this one, it's still pretty solid in material. \\"Princess of the Night\\", \\"Play It Loud\\", \\"And The Bands Played On\\", \\"Midnight Rider\\" and \\"Denim & Leather\\" are the best songs. <br /> <br />I really love the song \\"Denim & Leather\\", it is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever written. It is a tribute to the fans basically, which i like because shows how these guys loved and appreciated their fans.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Spin recently named Radiohead's OK Computer the most important album of the last 20 years.  This is a strong bid to claim that title for the next score of years.  The packaging, however, is not worthy of the product.  It is an odd size, and the disk is not easy to get at.
1590710037|4.0|I enjoyed the very practical approach Steven Pressfield takes towards creating art. He makes it doable - it's just a matter of showing up everyday, whatever form your creativity takes. This book  is a quick read, I don't want to say easy, because it takes effort to make the practice happen. I took pause when he talks about the source of inspiration - a point of view I do not agree with, but to each their own.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First off I'd like to thank Square/Enix for answering to the millions of Final Fantasy VII fans(still after 8 years) with a superb film with all the bang. Dont approach this as a \\"movie\\" or rate it really as one. It's an hour and twenty minutes of Nostalgia for hardcore FF7 fans. This film brought the world of FF7 into the new age of technology showing off the beauty that it truly should of been. The way the beginning starts off from the ending, to the tons of easter egg references that make any core FF7 lover chuckle. But like all videogame movies you have to have prior knowlege to understand, and this movie requires you to know every detail to appreciate its value.   <br /> <br />Try AC out anyway for its fast pace action and overall eye candy visuals. But try not to downgrade something if you dont fully understand it. <br />Visuals A + <br />Sound  A  <br />Story  B <br />Voice acting (only watched it subbed) B <br />Final Fantasy VII addict rating A+  <br />
B000BCKFWK|1.0|No more buying DVD's for me... this double dipping crap is just unbelieveable... it's bad enough that come next year or so when I can actually afford to get a nice spanking new HDTV, I'm going to have to either buy an HDMI compat. DVD player, or re-buy most of the films in my current dvd collection on BLU-Ray, or whatever the newest new format comes out... this is pathetic, from here on out, my dvd budget is going to the nearest rental chain...
B0001CLGFK|5.0|Eraserhead is the most disturbing, warped, and surreal films possibly ever made. The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i.e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder \\"Is that thing real?\\" The baby is so hideous, it's slight off pitch cry is the only thing that is even remotely human about it.Would I recommend this movie? It depends. To most, I would strongy encourage them NOT to watch, it's too bizarre, it's too weird. But then, to some who can take it, I would highly recommend it. In terms of bizarreness, Pi is the only other movie that even comes close, but even that looks like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood in comparison to Eraserhead.
B000002X2B|5.0|Blows Agains the Empire was, from my understanding, the intended followup to the Airplane's Volunteers, but by 1970, of course, that band was starting to face some serious problems, specifically the departure of Specer Dryden and Marty Balin. So Paul Kantner intended this album to be sort of a solo project, but he gave it a band name, in this case, Jefferson Starship. Although this band does have many musicians in common with the later, hitmaking incarnation (although Pete Sears or Craig Chaquico aren't here), musically it has much more in common with the Jefferson Airplane sound circa Volunteers than say, Red Octopus or the mid '80s post-Kantner incarnation when they were known simply as Starship who gave us such dreaded hits as \\"We Built This City\\" and \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\". So that means if you're an Airplane fan, but don't care much for the Starship, you won't have that problem with Blows Against the Empire. <br /> <br />This album features many familiar musicians, aside from Kantner, you have Grace Slick, Jack Casady, Peter Kaukonen (brother of Jorma), three Grateful Dead members, Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart, plus David Crosby and Graham Nash, not to mention Joey Covington (who replaced Spencer Dryden in the Airplane and appeared on the album Bark, which came after Blows Against the Empire), plus a couple of names I'm not familiar with. <br /> <br />This album is a concept album about a bunch of hippies who hijack a starship to take off in to outer space, because they don't feel welcomed here on Earth. The album was nominated for a science fiction Hugo Award, rather unusual for recorded music, but the album didn't win the award. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is one of the last great West Coast psychedelic albums, to me the last hurrah before the California rock scene would be replaced by such groups as the Eagles and the Doobie Brothers, not to mention the Jefferson Starship as we all know them starting in 1974 (although of course,the Airplane did release two more albums after Volunteers with lineup changes, Bark and Long John Silver). <br /> <br />Some of my favorite cuts include \\"Let's Go Together\\" (which bears more than a passing resemblance to Volunteers), \\"Hijack\\", and \\"Starship\\". On the second half of the album is a couple of short pieces that consists of sound effects that simulate the sound of a spaceship taking off, while at the same time, they remind me of those Krautrock groups that existed around the same time like Ash Ra Tempel or early Tangerine Dream. \\"Starship\\" sounds like what would happen if the Dead teamed up with the Airplane, because Jerry Garcia gives some of his trademark lead guitars. \\"Have You Seen the Stars Tonight\\" bears a slight resemblance to Crosby, Stills, and Nash, mainly because Crosby did write the song, but there's space electronic effects that would be alien on a CSNY album. \\"Baby Tree\\" is a cover of a song by some folk artist, which has rather silly lyrics about babies growing from trees. Musically this sounds like something you might hear in some hippie fest. In my opinion, Blows Against the Empire is a rather underrated album. Rock critics were rather divided over it, and Robert Cristgau wasn't all that keen on it, giving it a C+. The vocals do tend to be rather constant throughtout the album, but there's still plenty interesting use of instruments. <br /> <br />I very much recommend this album, including those in which the name Jefferson Starship might cause you to run with all your might.
