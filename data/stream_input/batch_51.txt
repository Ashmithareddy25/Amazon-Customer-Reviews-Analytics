B007IXWL2C|5|Loved this series!  Could not put it down!  Very entertaining.  I would recommend for a light hearted read.  A quick page turner too!
B004SIIBGU|4|It's a good application.  Easy to use.  I don't buy a lot on EBay but I love to look around on the site.
B000S8SXL2|3|This DVD doesn't have portuguese subtitles. The back cover inform that are the portuguese subtitles, but it's not true!
B00HFFD230|5|Great movie!
B00NM7K7NI|3|My buddy absolutely loved it.  I loved the plot since I actually worked at Bikini Atoll where the US conducted nuclear tests after WWII, but the plot failed to really draw me in to the characters as much as I would have liked.  Still a pretty fun movie.
B0037RDPEG|5|Well written and narrated. Really made me feel like following the journey.
B00CO8D3G4|4|James Altucher teaches the essential Daily Practices which empower people to grow and to Choose Themselves.  In teaching the lessons, Altucher calls upon the F. Scott Fitzgerald - like life that he has led to both draw inspiration; teach lessons learned; and make the reader smile.  Going forward, I intend to choose myself and to implement my. Own version of the Daily Practices.  I will also recommend this book and James Altucher's podcasts (Ask Altucher and The James Altucher Show) to friends who are interested in growing personally and integrating their values and their lives into a coherent whole.
B00CS74W0C|4|I enjoyed the trilogy.  It was edgier and more raw than 50 Shades and a quick read. The ending was a disappointment, leaving the reader hanging.  Good beach reading.
B0002Z1EG2|5|Hey, what's up??  Man, do I feel like a woman!!!  I love this C-dee!!!  I love Shania, too!!  Her songs are so spiritful and full of joy and life...man, I feel like a woman!!!  She has an udderly fantastik voise and she knows how to shake her groove thang!!  Hah, hah.  But seriously, when me and my girlfriendz hit the beach or the mall, we always bring along our burned copy of this Shania Twain Greatest Hitz C-dee...we love it!!   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Mutt messed up the Hq frequency on a few of the tracks; it would have been much better left at a lower-pitched treble.  Also, I take issue with Lange's use of chorus overdubs that often drown out the bass and even overshadow Shania's voice on a few songs.  Then again, with the drums so loud at almost all times, I guess that a lack of bass sound can be forgiven, despite the lack of an authentic swing.  The mixing job on some of the early stuff is adequate at best, but that's okay.  Mutt Lange is a wizard at the control board, and his expertise definitely shows on Twain's later work.     <br /> <br />Well, I'm off to the mall... <br /> <br />YOU GO, GIRL...AND MUTT, TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1591840562|5|Excellent information and interesting read.
B0019M06JS|5|Elaine Elias is a proficient master of the keyboard as well as a sultry  vocalist. I can never get enough of her great soft singing style. This is a great tribute to the Bossa Nova sound that can only be done by someone   like Elaine that knows the language. Wonderful album.
B00F52YOPA|5|I loved it
B0067R0APK|4|I have alerts turned off and the notifications turned on. I live in an area that has constant &amp;#34;Small Craft Advisory&amp;#34;. I dismiss the cautionary alert, but my temp notification is still red. What can I do to keep a constant white temperature notification?

B00CPZ7DBW|5|Cute little game my kids love to play.
B008Y5Q7SW|5|Awsome movie! Christian Bale is the man... Twisted movie with a great ending. Of your into crazy movies this is one to watch.
B005DJRD80|1|This programming is so bad I am writing the shortest review I have ever written in my life.<br /><br />Who This Program is NOT for:<br />- Those with basic codes of ethic<br />- Those with personal goals and standards<br />- Those who are over 20 yrs old or have a maturity (before the 21st century anyway) above 14 years-old<br /><br />Who This Program IS for:<br />- People/Kids who at this point in life \\"Just don't get it\\"<br />- People who think acting shocking is acting funny when it is just plain stupid<br />- People who aspire to little in life<br /><br />It is a very sad day to see such trash is voted 4 stars...then again, I am sure most who did not like or approve of this program did not even bother to write a review or knew not to watch this program to begin with...its just that bad and that much of a waste of time.
B00ARHAAZ6|5|What if all superheroes were evil? Steelheart.
B00GY0HJ4K|2|After every level it tells me jelly splash has stop responding and asks if I wish to wait or quit but even though I press wait it still kicks me out. When I go back in one of my lives are gone even though I never entered a level. It is a fun concept but there are too many bugs in it. It is not worth the aggravation.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This novel was expected to be heart rippingly sad but it wasn't. It was just the right amount of tears. It was a love story in its truest form. I enjoyed reading this book every time I picked it up. Thank you for your beautiful work.
B00AF6MF9I|4|it wont stop crashing after I check to see my battle reports (sometimes) other than that really cool. please fix the crashes----- then I'll rate it five stars
B000QRIGLC|5|A story that I will remember for a long time. Even though the Seals are a team, Marcus certainly was  was a courageous individual.  Looking to see the movie.
B00CLF80O0|4|good
B00PSLQGX6|5|Loved it
B000FC12ZU|5|I fell in love with Hercule Poirot watching Death on the Nile with Mia Farrow, and this book only made me commit further. When Mr Poirot puts all the pieces together I am always astounded at how by just being observant he always solves the crime. I enjoy reading Agatha Christie, because you must be creative in your thinking to put the pieces together, and I like a challenge.
B008220DGE|1|Save your money and your time and watch anything else but this. Whatever movies are supposed to do, they must not bore the viewer. Nothing saves this movie from boredom, although the production design is excellent and the mid-twentieth century of America is well evoked, and although the actors deliver fine performances. Unfortunately, all of them are trapped in a narrative that is tedious and directionless.<br /><br />In 1964, Andy Warhol mounted a movie camera on a tripod, pointed it at the Empire State Building, and let the camera roll for eight hours of slow motion footage. Watch that instead. The story is more compelling.
B000022TSW|5|It is as funny as it is dirty. If you enjoy dark sarcasm, this movie will suit you well. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a lot more creative than most people give them credit for. \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" does more than entertain us with blatant mockery and fart jokes. It has personality (... a crappy personality, but great none-the-less). It is entertaining time and time again not only because we can associate the situations and characters in this movie to people we know and events that happen in the world, but because one of the countless implications that are made in this movie may have new meaning each time the movie is seen. I give this movie 5 stars for creativity and personality (Aside from the fact I find it more and more hilarious the more I watch it). Some say you have to turn your brain off for this movie, and for many people I can see why that might be a good approach to this movie, however I prefer to read between the lines. In a movie that is this blunt and tactless, it is easy to be wildly entertained.
030746363X|1|A lot of rubbish not applicable to average people. Should be taken off your list of available books. Very dissapointed.
B0086700CM|5|i think this game is verg addictive and you can get better the more you play.  ilove it so much
B00846WWVM|4|If you ever dreamed of becoming a firefighter and controlling a strong hose of water this is your chance. You are given several puzzles where you must put out the fire before it consumes everything in site, you are armed with a very strong water hose that you can control and angle any which way you want.
B00GFHFRNM|5|A wonderful ending to the trilogy.  Fast paced, I was unable to put it down and read it neglecting all else
B00D3LA5WG|5|This was just plain good from the opening scene through the final scene.  Oscar competition looks strong this year, but I'm  hoping for this to be up there with the other nominees.  If you like the classic STAND BY ME, you'll love this one.
B0008ENICU|5|1939 - Black&White.<br />If you're into old movies, this one is a must have for your collection.<br />I loved \\"The Women\\".  It has an aray of stars including Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Rosalind Russell just to name a few.  Gossip, back stabbing, snitching, and just plain bitchiness are a few of the things that make this movie a hit.
B00B769XB8|5|As one would expect, there is lots of blood and gore. Good action and 3D effects so it was well worth the purchase. Looking forward to a sequel.
B0064X7FVE|5|Great app. Easy to use and provides a lot of good information ..Would highly recommend it to anyone who needs to keep track of weather conditions.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Chromecast is easy to set up, and the quality of the picture streaming from my Nexus 5 is absolutely unbelievable - better than streaming from my PC with an HDMI cable.  Once more apps start to support it - Watch ESPN, NHL / NFL / NBA apps, etc - it will be bar none the best $35 you can spend for entertainment.
B00632HWOG|2|I used to love this app, until the update a week or so ago. Now, it freezes constantly, forgets to notify me, and looks ugly. Also, I have deleted the same messages 3 times, just to find them back in my inbox! Please fix this soon! I'm missing important emails because of these fails.
B009KS4XRO|5|Love bb very much
B00V4JKT52|5|I don't love musicals, but I LOVE this movie. Meryl Streep is brilliant, Johnny Depp is deliciously creepy, and everyone's voice is just magical. The number by the 2 princes was super corny, it was supposed to be corny, so I loved it the first time (in the theater)..the second time when I watched it online, I skipped the scene.... they must have laughed their arses off doing that. the only bit that baffled me was why the slipper was gold instead of glass... I will be buying this DVD.
B004LROUNG|4|It's hard to be a 10 I don't think I ever saw one but if you like legal maneuvering this is the book to read.
B005FISBTO|5|I was very pleased with the shipping and the DVD! This was an awesome season and hilighly reccomend it to all the Dexter fans out there!

B00TXC4YVW|5|As usual, Jonathan provides excellent tournament poker strategy advice.  In this book, he helps you to identify the different types of players in small stakes tournaments and most importantly, how to exploit their weaknesses.  For example, how do you beat those players who tend to like to limp a lot into pots pre-flop and see a flop cheap? Or, those opponents who play a &#34;tight is right&#34; strategy?  Buy this book and find out.  Of course, Jonathan also review the importance of your own table image; an image based on the plays you make when your opponents see your hole cards, and how your image can differ based on each opponent.  Overall, when it comes to winning at tournament poker you need to know when you can get out-of-line; it is rare you are going to get enough premium cards to win an event.  So, by reading this book, if you know your opponents, you will know when to exploit their weaknesses, get out-of-line to build your chip stack and improve the chance of taking down a win.
1934356557|5|\\"SQL Antipatterns\\" by Bill Karwin is a collection of 4~7 page chapters, each neatly organized into:  1) Here's something people often need to do  2) Here's the stupid solution they often come up with  3) Here's why that's a bad idea  4) Here's what you should do instead    The nice, bite-sized chapters along with the \\"standalone\\" nature of each are reminiscent of \\"Effective Java,\\" another favorite.    Among other cuteness, the author refers to foreign keys that relate to multiple tables as \\"promiscuous\\"... I give extra points to anyone who can weave a little innuendo into an SQL text.
B005OCFGTO|5|Great Christmas gift for friend grand daughters
B0000X2EOW|5|Labyrinth will always been one of my favorite movies. Although I didn't actually &#34;need&#34; the collectors addition, I loved learning more about the characters and how they were created. Awesome buy!
B00475AYJQ|3|It is a good book and I love his writing but you have to be really dedicated to get over the slow section right before page 600.
B00P42WROG|5|What will Bill Hodges and crew be challenged with next? And what about Brady Hartsfield? How does he do the things he does? Will he once again become the nemesis of the Det-ret and company? I can hardly wait to read book 3 of the trilogy!
B000UX6THK|5|I give this gold box set a five star rating for content, packaging and extras.  I would highly recommend to any person interested in this series to acquire this Edition..

1476715904|5|Loved it! Beautiful story!
0307269981|5|I agree with the other reviewers who suggest reading his prior novel \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" will enhance your enjoyment of this book. There are more than enough other reviews that provide you a detailed review of the book, the plot, the characters, etc.  I will simply say I could not put this thriller down.
B00AB0AR2U|1|The suck level of this movie is apparent after the first five minutes. I don't have to explain why...for god sakes run away, run away fast. I would compare this film to any that Ewe Boll has made, and really might choose Ewe's. Someone one tell Anderson the cow didn't run out of milk, he just shot it, let it get hit by a semi truck, and well we are all just a little more stupid for enduring that sucky movie.
B005P06AAO|5|I followed the first season on MTV and wanted to watch it again and get one of my friends to watch it as well. Good quality. I have nothing bad to say about the DVD for the series.
B000002AGY|5|I owned the LP of this and now own the CD. This group of all-stars led by Jim Hall with arrangements by Don Sebesky play so beautiful and moving that it is hard to imagine being without this recording. The centerpiece is of course &quot;Concierto.&quot; It is impossible to fully describe the inter-play and virtuosity displayed on this piece. One of the most thrilling moments in music for me is Paul Desmond's entrance into this piece. If you can't hear that moment without feeling so totally happy that you are alive and able to enjoy such sublime sounds, then check your pulse because you are probably not among the living anymore.
0451196716|4|This is a good read, remminisant of his early work, very dark.
B004UJTG6Q|2|It won't let me read the book so I have nothing to put as a review for this hopefully after this I can read it
B001U3ZMHW|5|purchased for sons 9th birthday. arrived on time and in store shelf condition. very happy with purchase.  He is very happy with the numerous minifigures included in kit.
B00009V7RF|4|this is a good bep album. i like the fergie addition.<br />the only song on the album i don't like is 'latin girls' <br />luckily i dont need to worry about it, but parents should know that this is not a clean radio edit album.
B00SXK8R6S|5|I am so in love with this show. Can't wait for April to get here!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this game. It's just like flappy bird and its good for people who weren't able to download flappy bird before it got taken down. I do have to admit it gets pretty addicting but I love it and I could play all day!
B00QW8TYWO|5|So addictive take my advice
B007TMON8M|5|I loved this game. PHYSICS SIMULATIONS!!!!<br />How bout a pendulum game next???<br /> Foucault would approve I hope.<br />The Earth turns, yet we don't know why...<br />Does gravity exert anisotropic force<br />like stones in a riverbed??? Foucault would know
B008673ZAQ|4|Same as Entwined with you.  I could not wait for these books to come out.  It was okay.  I really thought it would be better reading.
B00I1XYDUQ|5|Awesome!  Finally Nathan East ventures out of his comfort zone.  You will not be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4|I would have given it a 5, but I was disappointed with the ending!  Loved the book... kept me on my toes at every turn of the page.
B00CH26TL8|2|This is fun, but when play the higher levels. You have to spend money to beat the higher levels. Just a waste of time of playing it.
B000OVLIQU|4|I'm giving this 4 stars because I like reading stuff about the Beatles from someone's point of view who was there at the time.  Also because it was easy to read and kept my interest.<br /><br />However, there were some negative things.  There was a lot of emphasis on the negative qualities (from Emerick's perception) of the people he didn't get along with.  Emerick seemed to think that Paul was the most wonderful person on the face of the earth, John was a moody SOB, George was not very nice and not a very good guitar player (almost inept) until the final days of the Beatles, Ringo was not very nice either and had virtually no personality, and George Martin was interested in protecting/saving his own hide.  It's possible Emerick really thinks these things.  I just think it's interesting that a lot of people have said that Paul was very sneaky (I'd go so far as to say back stabbing), and George and Ringo were nice and interesting people.  John's another story but we'll leave that at that!  I don't know much about George Martin but I've never heard about the selfish side that Emerick speaks of.<br /><br />A couple of observations and this is all speculation on my part.  First, he said Ringo would be kind of standoffish and just when he seemed ready to really talk or confide in Emerick, he'd back off in a very abrupt manner.  Well maybe that's because just when he was going to actually talk with Emerick he'd remember that he was talking with Paul's good buddy.  I could imagine how that could stop Ringo in his tracks for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Second, Emerick says that he didn't click with Klaus Voormann when they were going to work on a project together.  Emerick says he begged off the project because of this.  Well, Voormann thought the world of George Harrison so who knows what was really going on during the initial stages of that project!  Geoff, maybe Klaus didn't like you because of the way you treated George!  Funny how Voormann and so many others thought so highly of George but Emerick did not see George that way at all.<br /><br />So anyway, if you like reading about the Beatles from the perspective of someone who spent time with them, and you can make allowances for the negativity towards some of the participants, you may like this book.
B008CPZNL6|4|Flipboard is the first thing I tap when I pick up mt Kindle and the app that I use most.  Love the Pocket and social network integration!  It does freeze abit more than Im comfortable with on my Fire HD 8.9. hope that stability improves in future releases.  THEN 5 stars.
B0000042MY|5|When I watched the film and listened to the music I was struck by how well the music fit the film, and at the same time that the music was obviously so Celtic (confirmed by one of the tracks being performed by Clannad).  I have pondered why the Celtic music of the film fits so perfectly with a 1992 film (done in 1930s style, i.e. no sex, bad language, etc.) from a story of early 19th century classic American literature.  The reason the music works is that Celtic music is Western music of struggle, much as Russian music is.  Having been oppressed by the English for hundreds of years, the Scots and the Irish had music that reflected their difficulties.  The minor keys of the music in this film not only heighten the sense of passion between Hawkeye and Cora far more than any nude or sex scene could, but also the sense of doomed romance between them.  The main them of the film successfully conveys the sense of epic scope of the story, as the film itself is one of the very best ever made, and certainly the triump of director Michael Mann's career.<br /><br />Ignore Jerry McCulley's amazon.com review of the soundtrack.  He obviously didn't understand the film, or the period of time and place that generated the story behind it.  His lack of comprehension of the film translates into a lack of appreciation for the soundtrack.
0140067477|5|This was a book recommended to me and I am very much in the tao; the way the truth and the life. This was a simple read a simple meaning and a book to always look at when guidance is needed.
B005G4TJI4|5|I bought this as a preorder from Amazon and you couldn't be the price for a 3 disc set!  Movie is very good and if you like the other Transformers movies it's a must have.
0812513509|5|Speaker for the Dead has made Orson Scott Card the first author ever to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in consecutive years...Card more than deserves the honor.  Due to the effects of relativity, Speaker for the Dead takes place 3,000 years after Ender's Game.  Speaker for the Dead's main plot device is the interaction between human colonists on the planet Lusitania and the planet's indigenous, sentient but primitive, species the Pequininos...more commonly referred to as the Piggies.  Card's depiction of the Piggies and the human colonists is equally deep...it doesn't take very long for the reader to develop strong emotional ties to the characters...in my view that's the mark of a great writer.  Of course, the book has to have a hook to keep the reader going...in this case it is that the Piggies harbor a very unusual secret that is, of course, not revealed until the end of the book.  But like it's predecessor (and indeed all Card books...at least the ones I've read...and I've read about half of the novels he's written) Speaker for the Dead does not rely so much on the plot hook to keep the readers going...but relies more on the incredibly strong character development of which Card seems to have a knack which no other author I've yet discovered has.
0385349947|5|Sheryl Sandberg's message provides hope to a new generation as well as those of us inspired by Betty Friedan's &#34;Feminine Mystique.&#34;  While still recognizing the inequalities women face at work and at home, she moves the conversation up a level, and supports women to take responsibility for their inner blocks to having power -- since our only control is of ourselves, after all.
B00866H7SS|4|Enjoyable, light reading, but it hasn't made me race to read book 2 yet.  A good light read for time out.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is a very fun little game that I purchased from Amazon.  A series of fowl, animals, fishes and even people are guided across busy roads, waterways and train tracks.  You must get them safely across as may streets as you can with out getting hit by a  car or a train, or falling in  the water.  I don't know how high the numbers go for successful crossing.  The more structures your pawn crosses safely, the higher the number you get for a score.  I am not very good at guiding the poor creatures.  The fun is in trying again, to see how far you can get your little pawn, and to see if you can't beat your last high score.  It is so addictive!  And the graphics are great!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love the costumes and the era that is portrayed in this program. I was hooked from the first show
B002RXMG00|5|Great film
B00005QGAZ|3|good
B00005QDW1|5|This CD is one of the best CDs I own because it's by the best band the world has ever produced!<br />Intro- I sort of like it.  It's a unique way to start off a unique album. 4/5<br />Hella Good- One of my favorites on the CD!  Very punk-rock.  It has a great tune and whenever I hear it I feel like dancing. 5/5<br />Hey Baby- One of their poppier songs.  It's very weird to hear this song come from them.  It's sort of a Britney Spears type song. 5/5<br />Making Out- Not one of their best songs, but I love the tune!  It sort of makes no sense.  Oh well, still good. 4/5<br />Underneath It All- A great, relaxing song.  One of their slow songs on the CD.  I love this song. 5/5<br />Detective- Sort of weird, but a good song.  The chorus is sort of stupid.  I like the song, though.  Just...weird. 4/5<br />Don't Let Me Down- The Upbeat melody makes it fun!  It's really a great song and I like it a lot. 5/5<br />Start The Fire- I don't like the tune.  The bagpipes are weird, but No Doubt sort of has a theme for each song. 3/5<br />Running- A song to think about.  Very good.  It's another slow song. 5/5<br />In My Head- One of my least favorites. 2/5<br />Platinum Blonde Life- A great tune.  Strange words. 5/5<br />Waiting Room- Another Least Favorite. 2/5<br />Rock Steady- Too slow.  Not one I like alot. 3/5

B00GQQ75QO|3|While browsing movies on Amazon, I found this four-star rated sci-fi film and dove in.  While the premise was nothing original - people being assigned to a certain class (or faction) based on their naturally-occurring characteristics and talents - the movie kept my attention for the first 20-minutes or so.  However, as characters failed to develop, different factions demonstrated over-the-top stereotypical behavior, and young love blossomed, I started to think to myself, &#34;Is this a teen movie?&#34;  After the conclusion of the film I googled &#34;Divergent&#34; and learned that, sure enough, it is.<br /><br />I can't fault the film for being oriented towards teens.  However, when compared to the other recent big Sci-Fi teen film - The Hunger Games - Divergent doesn't compare.  Hunger Games takes the concept of pre-determined destiny in an original direction with the Districts, while Divergent seems like something out of an old Twilight Zone.  As an adult, the originality of the The Hunger Games, the uniqueness of the universe, and the quality of the acting has intrigued me enough to return to the movies several times; once is enough for Divergent.<br /><br />Though I have never watched any of the Twilight films, I suspect that Divergent is closer to these than The Hunger Games.  In summary, I imagine the movie appeals to many teens, but if you are an adult looking for something to keep your attention for 2 hours, you'll want to look elsewhere.
B0001AP12G|5|In &quot;Never Let You Down&quot;, Kanye expresses a need for better music - mentioning that the stuff that's out now just doesn't really do it anymore. Thanks be to God that Kanye's CD is out - and it's incredibly refreshing. The skits are hilarious, the songs are applicable and relevant, and yes, the beats are still tight. My favorites are &quot;Never Let You Down&quot;, &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. I truly admire West's ability to still get through to this generation and still talk about his God - something that is a rarity nowadays in the hip-hop world. His rhymes have so much passion, but still have a light-hearted humor to them, and it makes this &quot;College Dropout&quot; completely irresistible.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love the varying levels. The backstory draws you in; the in-game rewards are great. 4 Stars instead of 5  because there doesn't seem to be a backup for game progress if you need to reinstall the game.
B000002OX7|5|This is easily my favorite Who album, and one of my all- time favorites, period. For being one of their earlier releases, it shows a great maturity which generally occurs just before a band's demise (probably due to the pressures of a follow-up.) Thankfully, this wasn't the case with The Who. They had several other great releases and hung around for a long time afterward, with the exception of Keith Moon and John Entwistle (God rest their souls!) Every song on this disc is a winner, Pete Townshend pumping- out some of his best writing ever and each musician contributing to the utmost- Moon's smashing, bashing, but always exciting drumming, the OX tearing- up the fretboard on his bass as only he could,Daltrey belting- out some of his (or anyone's) best vocals and Pete's guitar playing at it's best. This recording can't be beat as far as stylistic changes, ear- pleasing melodies, catchy lyrics and teriffic songwriting. Even Pete's vocal interludes (which aren't always my favorite,) really add a touch of emotion to each song he appears on. I love every Who recording I've heard, but I think this one really captures them at the top of their game. I really enjoy the bonus tracks. Very good tunes instead of filler to take up space on a CD!
B001GAPC1K|5|Cool movie-
1401323820|5|Originally intending to purchase this book from Amazon.co.uk but going to Amazon.com because of the time delay, I wanted to own HEAT WAVE because of its tie-in with the abc television series, CASTLE.  The book, purported to be written by the main character in that series, and mentioned on many occasions, is about Nikki Heat, a New York Police Department detective, whose skill is untangling murders, and who has baggage of her own.  Following her around is Jameson Rook, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who is intending to write an article on the NYPD and Heat in particular.  Just like Richard Castle is following around Kate Beckett, and using her as the model for Nikki Heat.  Complicated?  Somewhat, maybe, but the initial chapters were uploaded onto the abc website over the summer to keep the audience's appetite whetted.  Nobody (apart from abc) knows who the actual author is, but they've done a great job of evoking New York in the middle of a hot spell, and it's fun to see bits of dialogue and business come up from the TV series.  All in all, a book that you can read in an afternoon - if you're like me - or take your time over a weekend, then go and watch the TV series again.  Recommended.
B000OZ0NXA|4|I liked everything about this book except I felt it bogged down at times and became boring.  I cannot believe who they casted to play Jack Reacher  in the movie. I will continue the Reacher novels as I enjoyed the plot and how everything came together.

B00475AYJQ|5|Really holds your interest. Very story oriented so if you are looking for lots of action not the book for you.
B00NERRBBW|5|Love One Direction so it's bound to be good anyway.
B00008PW2D|2|Yes, this is the worse of the seasons on DVD so far -- primarily due to the lack of good writing, attempted (but failed) character growth, and the deeply curtailed number of episodes (count them, eight). Now I LOVE Samantha's character's quick-witted sayings: \\"Vagina weights?\\" Sam: \\"Honey, my vagina waits for no man.\\"  It's obvious that Season 5 really strives to be funny, but falls short; jocular arguments with Charlotte over the \\"f\\" word just aren't funny. I admit the characters have gone through a lot of growth: a baby, broken engagement, Sam's love, broken marriage.  But dammit, lame themes and horrible dialog screw up good episodes! Don't pay more than $... unless you're a dedicated fan.
B008L1PYQU|3|It sounds great that's for sure.  I'm just not sure that there;s enough of a difference from the original to justify the cost.
B0000CFW87|5|Josh Groban has scored again with another collections of songs that just move you.  That is how you know a cd is great and not average when you are able to feel the emotion of the song, not the work behind it.  Josh has certainly been given and amazing gift and I am sure he will be considered one of the all time great when his career is compared to the other singers of his generation.
B006LSZECO|4|I hate books with this kind of ending. But other than that LOVED it.
B0027MJU00|4|I didn't like the main character at first but I quickly got hooked on the story line and couldn't put my kindle down. Great plot. I will definitively check out her other books. dark storyline but it was just what I was looking for.
1451629184|3|Some would say that it was repeatitive, unpolished, with spelling errors; however my heart went out to her and her family. I was so angry at those monsters.  I hope they spend their future is prison with no reprieve.  Please read this book and educate your children not to be the perfect victim.  Hold your head up,and know your surroundings. SCREAM YELL fIGHT!!!!!
B000002KBU|1|I have no idea how this album EVER got such positive reviews.  Joni Mitchell is perhaps the most pretentious, talentless artist of all time, and this album is one big snore.<br />I grew up with this album (my sister  played it nonstop), so I can confidently state that Blue is pompous,  self-important, self-obsessed, me, me, me, and therefore BORING.<br />Most  people who say they like this album do so because they're supposed to.  Stop the madness!  Do not buy this album if you have not done so.  Cheap  Trick forever.
B003R0MF1C|5|I too am looking forward to the release of Season 7.  I understand this entire program is based on a real person's life.  I do hope she is still alive so we can be surprised to find more \\"seasons\\" coming and this cancellations being just another advertising ploy.  So many of us are quiet followers but do loyaly LOVE this story line!
B00B7Y0206|5|This is so great and helpful I learned a lot just can't stop getting on it is just like the regular YouTube is only Bettermann Dejas Asmar someone's Nodlings is just awesome so thanks for making time
B000NA2776|5|Excellent product and seller.
B002RV01QI|5|I recently retired after 43 years of teaching. For the last 15 years or classroom teaching, I (for reasons I can't remember) started playing Enya's music in the background while the students were working on a task. Almost instantaneously, I noticed that their concentration and performance improved substantially. I didn't know why but recent studies of brain functioning have seemed to confirm that cognitive areas of the brain are enhanced, particularly when playing Enya or Enya-like music. In addition, even more recent brain studies seem to show that listening to music can enhance athletic performance. No Child Left Behind and now, the Common Core Curriculum, may ultimately prove to be less effective in enhancing student performance as simply listening to the soothing background music of Enya.

B00992CF6W|5|I love this game there are creative and survival. On survival there mobs or another way to say it is monsters. On creative you just have to be creative. Also on creative there's a clock,compasses, but it has every thing there is on minecraft PE but not everything. Buy this awesome and coolest game EVER!!!!
B00IMZ2PNK|5|Quality was HD. No problems.
B00M7D824O|5|Why this movie wasn't a huge hit, I will never know. Why are you reading this? Watch the movie
B0036S4CTS|1|I received this book for free from a friend whos work gave it to him before the movie came out. I love reading and it was free and it had that great sticker on it saying New York Times best seller so I was happy. Right off the back I wasnt a fan. I love to read so I kept reading hoping that the author would pull something and keep me engaged. The plot was terrible, some jerk who thinks hes too good for anyone and the school girl who yerns for him. Every \\"year\\" in the book was the same, he was still a jerk and she was still the school girl. Then when he finally comes to reality the stupid twist comes. I was so angry to read the book at that point I was beyond words. I still had hope though... When the movie came out I made someone take me...I wasnt going to waste my own money and see the movie adaptation. Hoping that Anne Hathaway could bring something to the book but no, still terrible. Dont waist your time, I have no idea how this ended up on best sellers, I am assuming the authors book before this was better and his followers read it being hopeful. Afterall just because it was a \\"best seller\\" doesnt mean the people that read it liked it.
B0062KJ1Q6|4|Very entertaining. Well-written and acted out. Not too shabby guys. I gave this 4 stars because it's an awesome movie. Lot os action, good acting, humurous activity, and the plot is original, fresh and good to have soemthing new on the market. i wanted to give this a 4.5 but they don't have that and i dno't think it's worthy of 5 syars just because it did not have that something extra to put it over the top in the matter of a classic excellent film, but this by no means is a bad movie. I put this on my recommended list and most won't be let down in springing for the $4 to watch it. Thanks . merry Christmas and Godbless.Praise Jesus<br /><br />~Shaun's movie review!
B006BGZJJ4|5|It worked wnderful.  the combination of the usb cable and usb charger are much better for  charging my Kindle than with just the computer cable.  Thank you.  I absolutely love my Kindle!!
B004K6HA8K|4|i loved the movie, but the movie quality and buffering was really a drag! I was expecting it to work fast but I was wrong.
B00QW8TYWO|5|it is like the funnest game ever (and there is a poopy pigeon)<br />also buy five nights at freddys 2
B006LSZECO|3|it is ok...she is a sick bitch.  it goes back and forth, him, her, him, her...even the cops are lame.
0345525558|5|This book follows the story of a young girl who has been stumbling through life. I was not able to put this book down so it did not take me long. Even though the story is not always a happy one it satisfied the reader and was more dynamic filled with surprises and unexpected moments. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone!
B000BCE918|5|Great boxed set with all three movies.  This would make the perfect gift for the Jurassic Park fan.  My daughter was thrilled.
B00PRXDUE8|5|Fantastic movie, that shows the reality of the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; in the life of music. Miles Teller does a phenomenal job, portraying an up and coming jazz drummer, and JK Simmons does even more, portraying the extreme end of the spectrum; and the ultimate antagonist. Superb role for both of them.
B00KNOVIAE|5|This is really, really good movie.  You get to see and feel the other side of the story and how things can turn around for the better.  I have recommended this one to all my friends and family, even my 10 year old loved it.
B0064MPXFA|4|Missed the first season when it was on, but happy to catch up and see the beginning of the show.
B009VIZDLI|5|What a delightful book. Made me laugh out loud several times and I know I was grinning widely the rest of the time whilst evading this book. Well written with humour and insight.
B00DJFIMW6|4|This game is awesome! The minions are sooo cute. I think you should get this game if you are thinking about it. You probably will LOVE this game. And it's free.  (:

B00IN3XF76|5|This game is my new addiction. Wonderfully deep and simple gameplay, fantastic use of the Doctor Who license, and a developer who is both ethical about free-to-play and in-app purchases AND extraordinarily responsive to the players' feedback. Highest possible recommendation, whether you're a Whovian or just enjoy puzzle games.
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Great visual effects. Good story lines.
B003UESJFG|5|My children love this movie.  They play it at least once a week and laugh every single time.  Some people underestimate Dreamworks production but this is a fun movie.
0449241424|5|This book has a lot to be learned off.  I think that everyone should read this book.  If you haven't you better start now.

B00IUBXPEY|2|I will never order another amazon movie every again!!! I could only watch 1-2 at a time then the movie would load fo about 2-3 minutes. We watched 50 min of the movie and it took us about 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie was getting really good but it was so hard to watch since it couldnt load!
B00005M989|2|If this is what record companies think are Prince's &quot;best&quot; no wonder why artists are always holding press conferences, demanding more control of their work. No wonder why most music on the radio seems like it was created on an assembly line. Of course, these are all classic songs, but they're not the BEST. For Time-Warner, they have essentially confined Prince's best to what made them the most money and when he was still with the company. (For example, his independently released single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl In the World&quot; is missing, which was one of his biggest hits ever, a single which reached number 1 even in countries where he never had number 1's before, like Spain. It later appeared on an album released by this company called &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;.) What they should have called this is &quot;Some Of Prince's Hit Singles&quot; and not the best of Prince. The best of Prince would probably encompass too many cds to be affordable since he has recorded and released more material than almost anyone. Besides, everyone knows that Prince's &quot;best&quot; is LIVE, where the studio recordings function as a rough blueprint for additional creating and where the songs really come alive and change form. But studio recordings is what this company owns, not live material. (They own the master recordings for all his output with Warner Bros.) This is not a release the artist in question approved of anyway. There have already been two &quot;Hits&quot; cds (sold seperately) released by Warner Bros. which Prince was involved with compiling, as well as a &quot;Hits&quot; 3 cd set which also contains most of his rare b-sides. They have great liner notes written by Alan Leeds, Prince's tour manager from way back, and features material this disc doesn't cover. This is just a quick way for the company to make an extra buck. And the only reason anyone would give it a kinda-sorta favorable review with noncommital critisism is because they have money to make from it when you order it. Don't buy it unless you just like making donations to companies that are in no danger of going out of business any time soon.
B009361C5O|5|Great product.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Very fun game and I play this game all the time

B000LPQ6DE|5|Item as described, item received earlier than expected.
B00H1UK3UO|4|I enjoyed this book but found the opening confusing, once I got past that and really got into the story though it flowed a lot better. It's a combination to me of mystery, a little supernatural feel, and historical fiction all rolled into one. It did feel very unique to me compared to anything else I have read recently and I did enjoy that aspect of the book. The story kept me thinking and trying to put everything together.
B00COGZ8FU|5|Loved this movie, Tom is real good in this... Must watch
B00KNWYDU8|5|It's great. Especially for younger kids
B00H3NPO6M|5|Nightwish has been one of my all time favorite bands for years, and now, with the addition of Floor Jansen as their singer, it looks like they will stay near the top of my list for many for years.

B0085Z8F4A|5|I attended the opening night of Prometheus at an IMAX 3D theater. The movie will undoubtedly receive Academy Award nominations in all categories. The IMAX 3D presentation was the finest use of IMAX 3D technology that I have ever experienced. The 3D was so excellent that it was literally like sitting in the middle of the action! The filmmakers know how to manipulate 3D and make it look good! I get a tingling sensation even thinking about it! That is why I pre-ordered Prometheus in the Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy version without hesitation. This will become a treasured work of timeless cinematic art in my movie collection.<br /><br />Beyond the existential components of this film, Prometheus is a true prequel that fully explains the Alien Anthology (also out in Blu-ray and part of my collection). You will understand how it all began, and if you view the 2003 alternate endings for the films up to the finale, Alien Resurrection (the final movie of the Alien saga) replaced with a \\"feel good ending\\" in theaters, you will understand WHY that ultimate ending was inevitable. Although the Alien saga is a dark journey into the depths of hell, so to speak -- in essence an anthology of humanity's evolution through extinction and rebirth into a new quasi-human species over the course of centuries -- it is existentially worth the dark journey. How would YOU like to have acid for blood?<br /><br />I found many epiphanies about this universe and our existence as its intelligent observers. Perhaps parallel universes are God's proving grounds for intelligent life to decide if they truly want the burden and anguish of becoming \\"like\\" God, \\"knowing good and bad\\"? Atheists, theists and agnostics will each find a different interpretation, no doubt, because it is debatable as to the true implications of Prometheus and the Alien movies that chronologically follow.<br /><br />However, theists will find solace in the unstoppable faith of Dr. Shaw. Perhaps one epiphany and take awayfrom Prometheus is life may exist beyond this tiny blue planet -- the ancient holy texts may be allegories and not literal. Dr. Shaw believed God still exists and shall receive her beyond the great veil of reality when her temporal life ends. When her tests are over, however long that takes, God will deliver her from this great void. Atheists can pay no mind to these implications because Prometheus offers plenty of grist for the mill to argue that Shaw's faith is noble at best. That is the beauty of this film. Prometheus challenges both sides to think carefully about any preconceived fanciful illusions about God's existence as allegorically taught by the Church, or as dogmatically denied by hardcore nihilists.
B00C6F624K|5|This is one of my go to movies that can really make you smile and be glad to be alive.
B000F4RHB6|5|Great music.
B000002UAO|5|Rubber Soul's one of the very first records that started challenging  artists to make proper, full length statements that helped usher in the  album era. And it did so because the songs were all of a higher caliber  (aside for What Goes On) compared to everyone else's regular album tracks.  Six tracks even wound up on the Red Album, and the 11th track (In My Life)  was just voted the greatest song of all time in Mojo magazine. One of the  people that put it at #1 was Brian Wilson, someone who adored this album.  That should account for something.<br />So is this essential? Easily. This is  not only an essential Beatle album, but an essential rock and roll album.  <br />Although I will say this, the Beatles' run of classics (Revolver through  Abbey Road) all trounce this. This is a classic album, and it is deserving  of a 5 star mark, but this is not a run away classic like the other Beatle  albums. So don't expect that. <br />It might be a good starting point for a  Beatles collection, it's got a lot of the sophisticated music of their  later years (Nowhere Man, In My Life) while still harking back to their  Beatlemania (The Word, Run For Your Life) days.
B000SFJWLU|5|The Way Of The Fist by the band Five Finger Death Punch truely lives up to it's namesake. An album of kickass metal from 5 talented musicians who all hail from previous bands really hits you hard and gets you hooked instantly. The stage performance these guys bring is out of this world. They're all very humble and personal with their fans and don't forget them in the least. The lyrics and vocals from Ivan Moody are raw, powerful and beautiful in their own ways. Definitely recommended to everyone with a good taste of music that loves metal. The best album to hit the shelves in quite some time. It takes 5 fingers to make a fist.
B00136NVH4|5|One of the greatest all-time rock albums.
B00992CF6W|5|It was really good exept for a few bugs like the water because it would not go away when I blocked<br />it off.The other thing that needs to be fixed is there should be options like fire spreads and tnt<br />explodes and other stuff. But otherwise it is the best game ever
0192804782|2|I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover.
0060974176|4|The Machine That Changed the World; The Story of Lean Production <BR>    A great book that although becoming a little outdated portrays the ongoing trends in the automobile production industry in three major cultural areas.  <BR>The three areas are;the Asian lean production (Toyota) v.s. the American system,(mass production) v.s. the European craftsman system.  On a larger scale it will and is affecting manufacturing everywhere.<BR> Henry Ford was the founder of the American mass production system, and Ford was very successful adopting it to the aircraft and steel industries. American companies adopted this system and it is one of the main reasons for American pre-eminence in many industries worldwide.  Toyota has become the founder of the Lean system of manufacturing.   Most of the<BR>early adherents to this system were other large Japanese companies, and responsible for the Japanese manufacturing miracle since the 1960's, as it was adapted from automotive to all manner of industries.<BR>     The book is well written and interesting even though it is based on an MIT study of global trends in the auto industry.   I would like to see an update to this book.  The one anomaly I see is the German Automobile industry.  If Japan and Korea have some of the most efficient auto manufacturing plants in the world and<BR>North America is becoming more competitive, what is happening in Europe comes as no surprise.  Many European automakers have yet to fully embrace American mass production techniques and are now faced with the greater efficiencies of Lean <BR>production.  The book does not explain in my mind the success of the German Auto industry.  It seems to be the one exception to the rule.
B002XTBEDI|3|Many of the interesting characters from the main series were not there anymore.  It was very sad.  While I very highly recommend &#34;Cranford&#34; I regret that I cannot do the same for &#34;The Return.&#34;
B006IND5M8|4|You get pretty much exactly what you expect with this movie.  There are cowboys and there are aliens.  And explosions.  Not exactly a masterpiece, but it's a fun action movie.
B008602KQI|5|I love this movie! Jennifer Lawrence was/is the perfect Katniss and this is so great for those who are fans of the books. I recommend this to people who are fans of YA fiction, action movies and dystopian fiction.
B0017R5UA0|5|I can honestly say that Fleet Foxes/Fleet Foxes was and is the best album of all time from one of the best bands of all time (may it rest in peace).  I'm really upset that Fleet Foxes broke up and the individual members started doing their own things.  Don't get me wrong, Father John Misty is one of my favorite bands now, but none of their individual acts compare to the power that is Fleet Foxes.  I love both this album and Helplessness Blues, though this one takes the cake.  It has more songs that I will constantly listen to, no matter what mood I'm in, without skipping over them.  It's amazing that it also comes with the Sun Giant EP!
B00BAXFACO|4|Fast paced. After reading the previous books in the series<br />I feel like the characters are old friends.  Good courtroom drama.

B00005JKHP|5|I'll be honest, this is the Greatest of the Trek films in my opinion. I own them all and have seen them all at least 50 times, i know the dialoge by heart for them all and i qoute them regularly. I love the vger cloud effects i guess either people and critics cant apreciate hard work or artistic skill or they have a short attention span.  <br />I think the Musical score is the best of any Star trek film, 8's score only comes close to equal. It is the thought provoking Film in the series. It is Star Trek in its greatest form. The thinking and thought provoking stories are what seperates it from Star Wars.  If you like flexing your mind and thinking occasionaly then watch this film. I admit that it does drag on, but im actually a litlled depressed when the end credits roll. It has a superb musicl score from the late Jerry Goldsmith and the visuals are stunning for back in 1979. Watch it and decide for yourself.
B008Y7EYSK|4|Good movie.
0142405809|5|LOVE this book!  Great pictures, easy reading, not too long... keeps my 2 (almost 3) year olds attention.  In fact, he asks me to read it every night, it's become one of his favs :)
B00FJU1HLC|4|This isn't a Disney Princess movie by any stretch of the imagination. The characters are abrasive but quickly grow on you.  Much like most animated movies now, there are several questionable innuendos aimed at the adults watching rather than the children.
B000001IQH|5|this cd is excellent- you can listen to it straight through and it's got a lot of variety. buy it!
B005IZLPKQ|4|For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of naïve idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.<br /><br />From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.<br /><br />At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as \\"somewhat bittersweet\\" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.anting for yet another viewing.

B007J4T2G8|1|I purchased Fifty Shades of Grey for my Kindle from the Amazon site, my credit card was charged, but to date this book has not appeared on my Kindle.  Every prior purchase that I made on Amazon was valid/delivered.  I guess I need to figure out how to make contact with the seller to find out what happened.  I see this as a hassle, I wish I had received what I paid for, but to date, I paid, but got nothing! I'm still waiting!
B00EIL7IKW|3|It was based on a mediocre story that was funny at times,  but should never be a prize winner.<br />HBO picked it up and made it somewhat better, but they also fell short.<br />All in all I like the actors, the acting and the vampires,but it wasn't a great show!
B00000IAU3|2|Dido's name is familiar to us since that fabulous collaboration with Eminem, &quot;Stan&quot;. It's pretty obvious she got all attention of the world after the success of &quot;Stan&quot; since she doesn't only sing her part in it but also adds to its flavour. Dido's debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; went multi-platin and suddenly she became a superstar. So what's the reason why we like her so much?<br />&quot;No Angel&quot; doesn't exactly stand for easy listening. In each song Dido seems to complain about something , she sounds depressed, yet certain of better future. That's what we like about Dido: she's the typical handsome girl next door giving vent to her feelings. She wins in accessibility what she loses in admirability, I defy everyone not to sympathize with her.<br />Dido provides us with a certain intimeness but does that say anything about the music? Apparently not. The opener &quot;Here With Me&quot;  starts with an intriguing tune that ties you to the song but it's a shame what it turns to. As far as I'm concerned the chorus is supposed to be the climax of a song , here it's nothing but a huge let-down.The song kind of loses its appeal after the chorus. Sadly  it's the same with almost all other songs on &quot;No Angel&quot;. Remember those brilliant, sweet, dramatic lyrics which made Dido famous? &quot;My tea's gone cold I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all/ The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all&quot;. These lyrics are from the song &quot;Thank You&quot; which was sampled in Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot;. The way Dido sings them makes a stone heart melt but the chorus should win the award for &quot;the most boring chorus ever&quot;. Further examples are &quot;Don't Think Of Me&quot;, &quot;Slide&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot;.<br />Well, seems like Dido has the talent of turning  brilliant songs to soothing filler but there are 2 nice exceptions which prove she's capable of more. &quot;Honestly OK&quot; is experimental and trippy with some beautiful harmonica a la Ennio Morricone. And of course, the bonus track &quot;Take My Hand&quot;. It combines different styles, Dido's singing really comes along very well, I love these 6 minutes in the land of dreams!<br />Anyway, I heard some of Dido's work with Faithless and it's better than the better part of &quot;No Angel&quot;. It's just my opinion but I think she should stick with them.<br />I conclude that Dido has quite a lot of things to work on but otherwise, she's an interesting artist.

0786838655|5|\\"The Lightning Thief\\" was a great book.  I got so absorbed in it, that I found myself awake in the middle of the night reading it.  The story involves Percy Jackson (main character/Son of Poseidon), and his two best friends, Grover, the satyr, and Annabeth, Daughter of Athena.  The three of them are sent on a quest to go retrieve Zeus's \\"Master Bolt\\", by the Summer Solstice. If they don't return it by then, Zeus will go to war with Poseidon, which would be really, REALLY bad.

B00H3JHE0K|5|I have listened to songs on the radio and have purchased several records, tapes and albums not realizing they were recorded in Muscle Shoals.  This is a definitive review of the story of the Muscle Shoals sound.  I highly recommend it to anyone that is a rock & roll, blues or soul music fan.  The stories of the artists and musicians are fascinating.  The story paints a picture of the incredible amount of music produced in the two studios at muscle shoals and how it is tied back to the Tennessee river, but I came away realizing it was due to the hard work by Rick Hall, the studio musicians and artists that came there to record.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.

B00000JTB2|5|Long, fascinating, satisfying, thrilling, explosive Blues jams with both players &quot;in a zone&quot; artistically. I never get tired of listening  to it. It rocks. It kicks. It's full of life and energy. The backing is  tight, the recording seemingly flawless, and the feel of the whole  recording effortless, natural and unhurried, with ample time for each man  to strut his best stuff. The snippets of talk between the two men only add  authenticity to this album. It's a gem. Buy it.
B00FMQILBC|5|Bought these for my three year old daughter's bedroom.  We were able to find all the other princesses at a local store however have never seen Frozen, which is of course her favorite.  We actually did an entire Frozen wall in her room then placed the other princesses around the rest of the room.  There is actually a lot of these in the package which she loved.  I love that I can remove these without damaging the walls when she moves on to her next phase.  :)

B002VPE1WK|5|I bought my first DSLR camera and didn't realize how many different lenses it would need.  I originally bought a smaller bag and it was great with just the original kit lense, but after buying a larger lense, I needed more room. This bag has room for my two lenses, it could hold more lenses easily, plus lots of different pockets - more than I need now, but I'm sure I will find a need for them as my interest in cameras grow. It seems sturdy - there aren't any issues with the strap sewing. I think it will be comfortable to wear over one shoulder for easy access.  My tripod easily fits into the straps on the side.  I could put my keys and phone into any of the many pockets and go from there without my purse. It's not too obvious that it's a camera bag, nothing but the Amazon brand name on any tags.  Highly recommend.

B000002MTR|4|I bought this cd 2 months ago and I also bought BSSM (their BEST CD!) But this cd is also very good I'm listening to it right now. There are some  songs on here which are very good and you can sing  to and some which are  worth a listen but not anything like some of the other songs on this cd  .Like Aeroplane which is the best song by the Chili's. It one of song that  make this cd memorable . Also this cd has some language in it but not  enough to get a Explicit Lyrics Label. If you are looking to start your  Chili Peppers Cd start with Mother's Milk then buy BloodSugarSexMagic then  OneHotMinute and finally there new cd Californication .Finally go see them  live they're great!

B00C8S9W0G|5|Another excellent book from Diana Gabaldon!  The saga of Jamie and Claire is an adventure in story telling. The characters have developed from the first books to feel as though they may have existed in history.  Enjoyed the read and hopefully we will see another book in the series.
1846551455|5|I have wanted to read Jo Nesbo first novel for years. I am a big fan of his books and finally this book got published. What a fantastic first novel! Harry Hole goes to Australia to help out with the case of a Norwegian girl murdered in Sidney, and gets more than his share of grief when friends began to die and he has to rethink the case.  I have all his books in Kindle and in print. I cannot wait for the second novel that has not yet arrived to USA.

1594744769|3|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a uniquely creative book based around a series of antique photographs. The quirky paranormal/time-travel tale will appeal to many fantasy and science fiction fans, but the sheer strangeness of the story will put others off.<br /><br />I loved the pictures and the way the story was obviously built around them. What's truly impressive is that these pictures aren't edited. They're authentic, vintage photographs and most are completely weird. They're pictures that are begging to have their stories told and Ransom Riggs puts forth a fine effort in making them more than a bunch of strange images.<br /><br />I couldn't get into this story, no matter how much the premise and photos appealed to me. It's an odd story about odd children in an odd place. I enjoy quirky, but it went beyond that into something too out there and jumbled for me. The story was darker than I expected and I found it to be sort of depressing. The characters were fascinating, but some of them didn't quite mesh with the sideshow freak thing the book already had going for it. Levitation, super-strength and even invisibly fit the story, but I quickly lost interest once we moved onto shapeshifters with time travel abilities and people who ate with the back of their heads.<br /><br />I didn't love Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, but I didn't hate it either. I wouldn't read it again, but I would recommend it to certain people. The book wasn't quite my thing, which sort of surprised me, but I can totally appreciate it's appeal to others. Fox has the movie rights already and I'm wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those novels that works better for me on the big screen than in print.

B00VFTD43A|5|this was an outstanding movie and even though some parts may have been fictional, it was by most far a very enlightening  and educational movie. I have learned a lot about how computers first came across. and just  how much Turing played a most important role in cracking the Germans codes. Must see movie.
0670022411|5|This is a wonderful mix of history, suspense, romance, fantasy and fun.  Characters for the most part are very richly drawn and the plot has some interesting and unexpected twists.  It is a wonderful story with good writing and I am begging for the next book!!!!

B00GQQ77IU|5|I had to wait so long to see this movie but I finally saw it. I watched this a few weeks after I finished the first book which I thought was awesome. I thought this movie, for the most part, was an excellent adaption of the book and the movie itself I thought was very good. The acting was good to great and I especially liked Woodley's performance as Tris and Winslet's performance as Jeanine Matthews. My only complaints are that they didn't include the scene where Peter stabs Edward in the eye which was in the book and that Al's character didn't get as much attention. In the book there was much more focus on Al's character and the build-up to his suicide which they did include in the movie. And Jeanine getting attacked and knocked out by Tris didn't happen at all in the book and that's what happened near the end of the movie. I know it seems like I'm criticizing it a lot but those are really just minor complaints. Other than that I thought the movie was great and I totally do not agree with all the Critics' review on this. Yes Divergent has a few similarities but they are really two completely different stories and personally I think I enjoyed divergent more than Hunger Games. 5 stars.

1933952806|5|I have the Kindle version of this book, and although I think it's a great version for quick reference, I plan on buying the hard copy version.  I have read other \\"Mastering\\" books by this author, and he is one of the best and most knowledgable authors about Nikon cameras.  The Nikon D7000 DSLR is a very complex camera and Darrell Young writes in \\"plain English\\" and explains all the tools available for this camera very well.  If you don't have this book, and you want to know how to use the many functions of your D7000 camera, you should get this book.
B005GSZZ1A|4|Not as good as &#34;Nothing to Envy&#34; by Demick. Great information about Camp 14, but the scope of this book is relatively narrow, and eventually the story becomes dull, especially about his poor behavior after reaching freedom in S.Korea and America. For the second half of the book I did not enjoy reading about all his whining, although again this is excellent information about the psychological damage that somewhat can be interpolated to N.Koreans generally.<br />Near the end of the book, it was interesting and pleasant to read how even he realized he was a whiner and then took positive action to improve himself.<br /><br />If Demick's book did not exist I would have given this book all 5 stars.

B000002I2I|5|Morrison Hotel (1970) was the fifth Doors studio album, following the jazzy Soft Parade that saw the band break out an orchestra, horns, and due what all bands eventually do: try to over engineer rock tunes.  I think The Soft Parade is a great album, an example of how far a band could go and still pull it off admirably.<br />Morrison Hotel, on the other hand, is a return to good old rock and blues with less on the production and a bit more emotion.  It opens with Roadhouse Blues, one of the best bar songs of all time.  It has a rhythm that can go forever and Morrison does a kind of rock scat man bit (even better live) in the middle.  It also contains the immortal line, `Well, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer'.<br />Waiting for the Sun is, not surprisingly, a holdover from the album of the same title.  It doesn't sound like it belongs on Morrison Hotel but it's still a good number, with some strong, early Moog work that produces a buzzing rumble.<br />The entire album is diverse, as it goes from the fun, bluesy You Make Me Real, with Ray on electric piano, to the beautiful, somber Indian Summer, a pure Doors song that sounds like it was resurrected from the earliest days.  Peace Frog has a classic riff (one of the few Doors samples in hip hop I could note was when 3rd Bass used the breakdown part in one of their tracks) and Jim's lyrics are spot-on ('Blood on the streets...')  Blue Sunday sounds like a bit of Sinatra in Doors uniform (in a good way).<br />Maggie McGill is a down and dirty bluesy rock number with a playful lyric.  The back to back Ship of Fools and Land Ho! are fun as well.  Ship of Fools made a great live song with Ray's keyboard solo.  The Spy is very cool piano number; Jim's voice lends the lyrics that extra menace ('I know your deepest secret fear').  The entire album is a return to rock, to blues, and it sounds like a strong effort, though it came when the band was trying to put the Miami incident and the aberrations of the Soft Parade behind them and just continue.  It's a stronger effort from Jim Morrison, whose song writing credits made up only half of The Soft Parade.<br />I don't think the Doors made a 'bad' album, but if I had to pick, this is easily one of the best.  Recommended for Doors fans of course (dig deeper than the multiple Greatest Hits packages they have) and classic rock fans.rade behind them and just continue.

B000002534|5|What an uplifting, hope-inspiring marvel this album, this man, this Santana band, is!<br />I'm so overjoyed to discover how many others seem to  share these sentiments when listening to this amazing, incomparable,  awe-inspiring album. 'Borboletta' is more than merely a Santana album, it  is akin to a religious awakening, I sincerely believe that the band's music  is inhabited by a supernatural essence which is more than just the sum of  its parts. 'Borboletta' is the REAL 'Supernatural'! <br />That said, don't  disdain  Carlos's latest offering as just a commercial album. On  'Supernatural', his spiritual and musical integrity shines through as  clearly as ever.
B009PJXY3M|5|Great music. I didn't know she could rap like that. Hurricane is the best song on the album. I like all the aongs

B00000IBDY|4|Tomorrow was a better-than-average sixties psychedelic band who had some inkling of how to use the recording studio to make interesting records. &quot;My White Bicycle&quot; remains a classic, with its dazzling use of backwards guitar and drum sounds. &quot;Revolution&quot; (not the same as the Beatles song of the same name) is also a fun one, with its many surprising tape edits (a la &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; on speed!). Speaking of the Beatles, Tomorrow's rocked-up version of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is actually quite listenable, and not the travesty one might expect. Their overall sound of luscious fender guitar slurps, crazy stereo panning, and whimsical lyrics with front-and-center vocals make this a good period piece. What the album lacks are memorable melodies; if there were some, this would be a great album indeed.
B005LAIHYU|4|This is a really good movie and damn fun to watch.  No, haters, it's not accurate history (twilight is just a movie, vampires do not exist!)  Sit back, watch and enjoy!  However, there is actual history woven throughout the movie, see how much you can catch for yourselves.  ( Harriet Tubman, underground railway, names of Lincolns staff....)

B0065GC0BA|4|To be honest I thought this was going to be some light romance (just another contemporary beauty and the beast style summer read) but when I started reading I quickly found out what and how serious and real the main issues were. The issues that were brought up were extremely contentious and current and while I'm not familiar with them myself, the story was easy to follow and taught me a lot.<br />The great thing about this book is it puts your own life into perspective and gives you a lot to think about even days after finishing. For that reason alone I would recommend this book but the love story between Will and Lou is another draw. The way they slowly begin to open up to each other had me smiling to myself and wondering if they would still have been together under different circumstances.<br />My take home message would be therefore to read this book and learn about a whole new world that we sometimes don't see within our own society.
B0033AI4PM|5|Love it

B00004ZAV3|5|Ok, yes it's another compilation and serious Beatles fans have all these songs, but this album is still worth buying simply because it's the Beatles. The number one hits are placed in chronological order so it gives a very nice review of the vast growth of their music over time, the digital remastering is also phenomenally well done.

B00HB62MC0|5|I have heard so much about this book and I finally got to read it and I am so glad I did.  It is about a girl named Tate and a guy named Miles.  Tate moves in with her brother Corbin, who is an airline pilot and she meets Miles, who at first she didn't care for.  He was drunk and didn't know what he was doing.  She soon finds out that Miles lives across the hall from Corbin and he is also an airline pilot.  She ends up really liking him and he likes her back but doesn't want a relationship. He just wants sex. They spend a lot of time together and Tate ends up falling in love with him, even though he told her he doesn't want love or a relationship.  You find out why Miles doesn't want any type of love and why they just won't work out unless he gets rid of the past.  It is a great love story that will make you laugh, smile and cry.  I totally recommend this book!

B004XVMCMQ|5|So many movies nowadays have a hard time standing alone -- if you don't read the book you \\"miss out\\" on a lot of what's going on. I liked this movie a lot (and I like many of the Jane Austen adaptations) because you can get into it easily without having read the book, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies set in this era (or is needing something similar to a Downton Abbey fix.)
B000SZNET6|5|Best Christmas movie ever. Watch it every year. Yell along with the prime quotes. Yippee ki yay ... you know the drill.
B00P7PBD2C|4|I love it when Disney takes chances on darker material like this! Compelling fantasy and great re-imagination of the original story-line! You can tell when actors are enjoying a role and Angelina Jolie's absolute mirth shines through brilliantly in this one! You gotta love the way that she continues to re-define the boundaries of what women actors are capable of doing! Adding this one to my collection! A solid B-Plus.....

B00FMQINEM|3|A little pricey for the size, but 2 year old girls love anything Frozen, so I still would recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4|It had been a while since I read a real page-turner.  As much as I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I'm somewhat glad it's over so I can get some work done around here (that's a compliment)!<br />I especially enjoyed the creative writing style(s).
0385508417|5|I have seen many mixed reviews for this book, mostly by people who took the concept of skipping Christmas to heart.  But I thought it was a wonderful bok with some valuable lessons.  First, it is simply a satire about how crazy the ppressures of the holidays can be.  And I think that is how we are meant to read it.  But there is also the theme of learning what it means to put our selfish desires aside at this special time of year and be a community, as the community helped the Kranks for Blair in this story even thoough Luther was so selfish.  I definitely think Grisham is making the point about looking outside of ourselves and remembering the true spirit of Christmas.  Sure, most of us would not harass someone who decided to go on a vacation for Christmas rather than spend it at home, but it was a device that made this story work.  While this is nothing to be compared to Dickens, you definitely see the Scrooge influence here in Luthor's character.  At any rate, no matter how you take it, this is a great, fun holiday read.  The movie is wonderful, too.  My suggestion is read and enjoy the truths about how out of hand things can get at Christmas.  Then go tell your loved ones Merry Christmas!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|it was a really good game I love it there are complicated maps but if your looking for an easy game this game is not for you
B008HK3XOU|4|Cover provides good protection and is not bulky. Does fit in almost any purse for travel. However, it sometimes slips when used to prop the Kindle.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Couldn't put it down.  Definately a page turner.
B004P1JDJO|4|I think everyone who manages people should read this.  My favorite aspect of the book is that the author draws from quality, peer-reviewed, academic research to support his argument.  This sets it apart from most management books.  In addition, it is well written and enjoyable to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5|this is a great way to pass time and addicting at the same time. it would be great to earn levels or easier ways to get more bonuses
B000A0GP0Y|4|When you think of remakes you think of movies that don't strike you the way the original did. Most remakes are so bad that they disgrace the original. Others are just average. This is the exception. I've seen the original so I'm not just basing it off the remake. The original is okay. I didn't really like it all that much. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie but it just doesn't appeal to me being from a younger generation. That's why we have remakes. To appeal to younger audiences. The remake has most of the same dialogue in it with more jokes. The characters are funnier and I believe the actual football game is longer. The remake shows more practicing than the original also. The characters are all there but they either have more dialogue or are funnier. Overall this is a great remake.
B000GWE44U|4|I'd like to give this movie the best compliment I can by comparing it to an Alfred Hitchcock film in 1979/1980. Mostly based on the apprehension and the tension that builds over the course of the movie. Actually, the first hour and a half which, for most movies, is when the credits are rolling.<br /><br />Yes, it's a slow building, suspenseful type of movie that are never made anymore. Today everyone wants two main stream themes. An action packed 90 minutes from start to stop and/or a &#34;family friendly&#34; because that's the only way people go to a movie theatre and pay 4 dollars for a Kit Kat ontop of the 10 dollars or more for a ticket. Then sit and listen to people/kids talk to each other or the screen through the entire thing. Just fyi, when you buy popcorn at the theatre, it costs less than the paper container it comes in.<br /><br />Not typical in Hitchcock films,the cursing, the (fully) naked woman, the gore, I can't believe that this only got a R rating. Keeping in mind this was 1980.
B001DJ7PR8|5|GREAT movie!  Loved it from the first time I saw it.  Not real fond of Woody Allen but I must commend him on this movie.
B0082Z447U|5|It has been a while since I have read this style of writing.  Even so I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this book and had a difficult time putting it down. It has stirred a desire to read more classics even ones I have read many years before.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Works great. Needs more ability to sling from ipad. Works better with android. Streem is good. Nice if had a port for ethernet
B0007TKNL0|5|My favourite movie for the past 20+ years has been Ladyhawke and I never thought another movie would ever replace it.  Was I wrong.  Phantom of the Opera is the most amazing movie I've ever seen.  I saw the stage version 12 years ago and loved it but the movie is so much better, I think due to the fact that there is so much more that can be portrayed on film as opposed to on the stage.  I only wish I had seen it in the theatre. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler-what can I say except the man is one of the most amazingly talented actors around.  The emotion he portrays in Phantom is heart-wrenching-he made me feel everything he was feeling.  His singing voice is incredible considering he's not a trained singer. I love the rock and roll edge he brings to it. And mercy, he's so handsome and utterly sexy. Perfect in every way. <br /> <br />I thought Emmy Rossum was wonderful.  So much talent for someone so young. I'm sooo envious. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson is also good but I must admit there is NO WAY I would have picked him over Gerard Butler. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Minnie Driver's performance.  She's wonderful as Carlotta and injects humour into her role. <br /> <br />The entire cast, music, settings are everything that is good in a movie. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that it was over way to soon to suit me.  I was totally enthralled.
B00499NHLC|5|I really enjoy the 'current time period' aspect of the Sherlock series. I had hoped there would be more than just three episodes to a season! Looking forward to season 3!
B0086900TI|5|You know how they say \\"Teachers have the hardest job in the world?\\"  Well this movie proves that's exactly 100% true.  The teachers that have to deal with students in the city are *especially* the ones who have the hardest job due to the aggressive  environment each and every day.  They have to find a way to get through to a group of students that are not only destructive but refuse to listen to reason concerning *anything* no matter how hard things are explained to them.  Not only that, but teenagers naturally want to test the patience of their parents and teachers because they feel like they've reached that terrible point in their lives when they've become big and bad enough that they think they *can*.  Test ones authority so to speak.<br /><br />I'm curious if some city public schools really *are* as graphic as the one portrayed here.  I imagine some of these incidents (that I won't spoil) are a bit exaggerated, but others -such as the one student who walks up to the front of the classroom where Adrien Brody is standing on the first day of the job and threatens to beat him up- are real.  I'd like to know if city kids are really THAT bad.  I spent all my years going to a public school out in the country that was significantly tamer than this school.<br /><br />Adrien Brody proves he's quickly becoming one of the best actors out of Hollywood since he can easily nail any role he's given, and his role as a substitute teacher here is downright terrific.  That's not all- he has to deal with an incredibly heart-breaking situation with his father in a retirement home and about to pass away that will leave many viewers in tears (especially me since I worry I might be in this exact situation some day in the future) in addition to meeting and taking in an underage prostitute on the streets that results in a *fantastic* ending (that I won't spoil, sorry!)  There's also a girl in the back of Adrien's class that's a special student and bonds with Adrien's character.  You don'trealize until later how important her character is.<br /><br />The language in this movie is REALLY bad.  These students take every swear word in the book and use them in the most graphic way imaginable.  And they direct these words *directly* at the teachers.  Yes, if this movie is similar to real public schools in the city, teachers most certainly have the hardest job out there.  For some reason, the scene that stands out the most is the one with the Asian guidance counselor and the teenage girl who comes in failing every single class and lacking ambition.  The woman literally explodes on the girl by giving her a reality check as a way to get through to her and amazingly, it works.  The girl walks out of the room aware that underperforming is wrong.  Also love the old man (not sure who he was- perhaps another counselor or a substitute teacher) that speaks exactly the same way his students speak to him!  He does a tremendous job getting through to the students.  A little *too* graphic perhaps, haha.  He had me laughing hysterically in one segment when he takes a sentence one of his troublemaker students says and uses it in several different ways, such as imitating a play in one segment, LOL!  I can't share this scene in detail because amazon won't allow it!  The man is doing this not only to prove that he isn't the least bit affected by immature threats, but to humiliate the student.<br /><br />Overall, this movie had me moved to tears a few times because it's not all about swearing and awful language.  There's a clear element of understanding, compassion and trust that takes place between the teachers and students through LOTS of patience.  The teachers learn to build a wall as a way to block all the swearing and criticisms these teachers have to deal with on a daily basis.  In fact Detachment actually portrays how hard it is to live in the city, so it goes beyond public school difficulties.  Highly recommended.
B005S9EKCW|5|I am very pleased with this purchase. The motion picture &#34;Les Miserables&#34; 2012 is exceptionally well done with an all-star cast and extremely worthwhile. The Blu-Ray quality if top-notch and the movie is absolutely beautiful to watch. Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|3|The game is fun but to get started well you really need to buy things for cash which I do not like. A storage buildings for food, gold axe and buildings are some to name a few.. It has crashed my fire once.
B000IHY9UW|5|Actually, the Doors was Jim Morrison and some other guys.  Oh sure, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore contributed to the music and the sound, no doubt, but without Morrison the Doors would have been a long forgotten L.A. band.  Or do you rate \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" as classics?  Yeah, I didn't think so.<br /><br />Now that we have that settled, this imperfect movie rates the 5 on the relatively soft Amazon scale for one huge reason, the spot-on near clone performance of Val Kilmer, surely the role of his life so far.  I can recall few, if any, portrayals that are a closer match to the real person.  The face, the expressions, the movements and that voice . . . wow.  The scene in the Whiskey, fading in through the indian's eye, it's one of the best things put on film, ever.  The movie isn't great, it moves too fast and leaves a lot out, but there are great things in it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the movie paid homage to the Morrison mythos too; was he really possessed?  Did they raise Dionysus in concert?  Could he really recite from memory obscure books found only in the library of Congress?  Well, maybe not, but there was something spiritual about Morrison, the man was one of those \\"great souls\\" whose personality dominated all around him.  He had a certain amount of art in him, all written in his poetry book before they even started, and when it was done, he was done, and he was gone, probably still wearing the same shoes and pants.  His life, though tragic, was pure rock and roll.  Everyone dies.  Morrison lived like a skyrocket.  The movie is a fitting tribute, with no holds barred.<br /><br />By the way, the original version of this movie carried one last line of print before the credits, in case you're curious.  Her family managed to get it removed, but it said \\"Pam joined him three years later . . .\\".<br /><br />PS:  What's the \\"Soldier Blue\\" DVD picture doing here?  (a/o 12-06-06).
B00AJRQLTI|5|Loved LM when I first saw onstage in high school, and was really excited when it came to screen wth all these favorite actors! I could've bought the soundtrack from the stage version, but I really liked the fact that these movie stars sang the songs.
045122499X|5|I believe this book may be better than Pillars of the Earth. It is similar, but has a different main story line. The characters and plot are rich and overlap. I was always surprised with the story events. It is a long book, but worth the read!!
B00BSBUZT6|5|I LOVE the 3-disc set. Never realized just how some of these band members intertwined with others such as Linda Rondstadt, Kenny Rogers, and more (Geffen even). I won't go into details as I may spoil some of the surprise.<br /><br />The first two discs cover the history of the Eagles and the third has excerpts from their 1977 Hotel California concert. It's unfortunate that they didn't just include the WHOLE concert.<br /><br />PROS: Variety of interviews<br />CONS: The 3rd disc should have included the WHOLE concert
B00GH4R95C|5|The best version of superman since the original
B003OY91HW|3|After reading negative reviews of this book, I compared the table of contents from both The Magnolia Bakery and More from Magnolia Bakery Cookbooks to this book's table of contents and found every single recipe from both cookbooks are indeed included in this one book. While I completely agree with reviewers who felt this is a rip-off if you own both previous books (which I do and I almost bought this one), it should be noted that the title of this book is The COMPLETE Magnolia Bakery Cookbook. The front flap description does state this book is a comprehensive collection of recipes from the bakery in honor of the bakery's 10th anniversary, however, no where does it state that this book is simply a combination of every recipe from both previous cookbooks. In my opinion, omitting this key piece of information is being intentionally misleading, a tad dishonest, and definitely an attempt to make a few more quick bucks. In my comparison I did not find even one new recipe in this book. If you own both previous Magnolia Bakery cookbooks, don't waste your money or your shelf space on this one. I would recommend this book only to someone who does not own the first two.
0714834491|5|totally off-beat and eclectic - - & taken a page or two per day - - this book will stimulate your mind daily for a year or two.
B007L3BMGA|1|Crap
B000066AXC|4|This movie is an excellent movie, well written and directed and Russell Crowe's acting is outstanding.  Unfortunately, Mr. Howard's vision of John Nash's delusion is way off base and pure hype to increase the entertainment value of the movie.  It's still worth watching, but I'd recommend the book if you want to get a more complete perspective.
B00EKTCQCC|5|One  of the best. I recommend. Number 1
B00HZ3C4N6|2|To much shootem ups. I prefer stories to gun fights.
B00005JM1F|3|This movie is hilarious, and I would give the movie itself 4 our of 5 stars.  But there is hardly any difference between the unrated cut and the R rated cut of the movie.  When you have topless women on the menu and on the back of the cover, one might be mislead to think there was tons more nudity, when in reality there are 2 brief scenes with any type of nudity (besides will ferrel's butt scene).  This movie could have easily passed the R rating cut, as the unrated thing is nothign but a marketing ploy.   I bought the movie for laughs and definately not for sex, but for someone who does, the \\"UNRATED AND OUT OF CONTROL\\" part is quite misleading.
B000FC13E0|5|Michael Crichton did it again with Prey and wrote a very plausible and frightening novel.  I always have liked how he did his research and explained the science behind what he's writing.  That helps the reader to learn about what he's writing.  I highly recommend this book.
B004MC8CA2|5|It's the Bible.  It's Holy.  It's a great program for following sermons at Church.  You can email your notes to yourself using it.  Awesome tool.
B001P06GX4|5|We just got this game yesterday and love it!  We play the 3 player version (because there are only 3 of us) where each person gets 7 tiles from the extra color to play along with their main color.  It is tons of fun!  The first game we played, our 8 year old won!  Dh and I were shocked.    This is a great game with very simple rules, but uses lots of strategy and spatial reasoning.  I recommend it for families with young children as well as those with older children.  After ds went to bed, dh and I played it with both of us playing 2 colors.  It was just as much fun!  We're not great at it yet (we still have several pieces leftover and no place to play them) but I think this could be our new go to family game.
B0001I561E|5|how can you go wrong adding a new copy of a old favorite. A unrestrained robin Williams is funny enough for me to recommend this film to adults as well as their children.
044024238X|4|As usual Sophie Kinsella writes a witty, fun, and surprising book  full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.
B0087JTAKW|4|Mitch Albom always puts a unexpected spin on life and his imagination is amazing.  This book does not disappoint those who love his style of writing, if you loved \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" and \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", you will love this book.  It is the story of a man who is obsessed with keeping time in the days of the building of the Tower of Babel, to the detriment of his family, earning a living or anything else in life. He is sentenced to live forever keeping time, and it ends in modern times New York, with him helping two persons who are having different problems with too little or too much time.
B00BSBR9N6|5|I did not stop until I finished.  Don Tillman is a phenomenal character who suggests, profoundly, that we should stop trying to &#34;fix&#34; people with different wiring. The sensitivity and compassion of this character are compelling and give me hope for humanity (hope that we can transcend labels).
B002VECM6S|5|I admit that I am not the biggest Sandra Bullock \\"movie\\" fan. I say \\"movie\\" fan because as you all know, she has been type cast as a romantic movie actress. Romantic films are not my general preference. Although, when done well, a romantic comedy can be refreshing! Furthermore, I must state that my previous and further stated opinions are soley based on personal movie preferences, and not the quality of Sandra Bullock's work.        The best way to describe this film is that it hits a home run, or in reference to the movie, scores the winning touchdown! Based on true events, it paints images of a teenage boy in need of a helping hand, and a loving family who takes him in as one of their own. Despite her previous roles, the most amusing thing in this film was Sandra Bullock's witty diologue. I realize that she has previously acted in non-romantic movies. However, this film really shows her dynamic ability as an actress. The only thing that I would have changed about this film is to have the character of Miss Sue, played by Kathy Bates, as a more prominent character.       This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It has a solid story. The development really makes you care about the characters. It is very lighthearted. Although there is the ever-expected \\"sob scene\\", the entire movie was a strait shot for the goal line! This movie is very significant in the way that I can't think of one other new movie worth comparison!
B002RI9M2U|4|I really like this book, and the style with which it is written. However I can't help but think the girl on the tape is pretty selfish, which I guess is what makes her such an interesting character. That she wasn't some nobody within the school (like I'd expected) but actually quite well known and that it was her reputation that send her spiralling. All in all really good and worth the read.
B00GU9CAV2|4|This final? chapter of Riddick is just another jewel in the Riddick crown. I felt it did a good job of closing the story line from the second Riddick leaving this one wide open (since non of the other key players in Pitch Black survived, at least we thought). I enjoyed the movie a great deal and will most certainly watch it many times.
B005BRS8Z6|5|This book really resonated with me.  Four simple strategies to align my thinking and behavior, it actually made me feel better as I was reading it.
B00005JKYS|5|THE MOVIE WAS VERY VERY GOOD. BUT IN A MOVIE YOU GET THE ABREVIATED VERSION.<BR> BECAUSE THIS FIRE FIGHT REALLY HAPPENED I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN<BR>PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO READ THE BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE TO ITS<BR>FULLEST.  THIS ACTION WAS A CRUCIAL POINT IN AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT <BR>IN VIETNAM. IT ALSO DECIDED OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT VIETNAM,WITH THE ITS ESCALATION OF OUR SOLDIERS IN THE WAR.
B0036TGT2A|5|I loved the movie & wanted this for my collection, the 3D was just a bonus.  This movie was the older animation, but it did add more texture and quality to an already Disney classic.  Glad I bought the 3D version, with the anniversary set.
B00NQKWA6S|5|Beautiful music no vocals kind of dissapointed but good music
B0028IDXDS|5|i see this being my daughter's new best friend! it is so perfect for little ones to hold onto but also soothe themselves with... genius idea!!!
B00GLX0Z8C|1|Vulgar and not funny at all.  What a waste of time.  The only thing funny on this DVD were the outtakes after the movie was over.
B00IUBXPEY|5|I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. The costumes were absolutely gorgeous and so creative.
B00FRQ32N4|4|Awsome
B00DR0PDNE|5|I can't believe how long i waited to purchase this, its awesome.  So easy to setup, a third grader could do it. Phone to big screen in seconds. My favs, Netflix,  sho box, Pandora. Picture and sound Instantly improves from phone to your tv. Im buying more for all my tvs and as gifts.
B00P7PBD2C|5|Maleficent = magnificent
B00AYB0TOW|3|I'm not sure why this was called Dredd since it had next to nothing to do with the original Dredd story.
B00IG2DOKM|4|It takes a bit to figure everything out, but this is a cute game! Lots to do and no pressure of time restraints. I just wish it was easier to find friends. If u r not on facebook it's pretty much impossible, but u can play without friends.
B00B5HQLMI|4|This is one of the best Bond movie in a very long time! One main reason for me, they brought back the bond music during the movie! Okay, so the plot was good also (sure that helps) but the theme music after he utters is name or after a witty response, that's classic Bond! I Love This Movie!
B000XUBFE2|5|without giving anything away, i can say that though this book is indeed heartbreaking, it is one of the most incredible piece of literature i have ever read. a must read.
0486274268|4|I bought this book with 3 other ones for my grand son who just started to draw,he is very happy,he finds them easy to follow and of good help.
B000AQJPQE|5|It's a great little set.  The distances between planets aren't, of course, proportional, but we've had lots of fun lying on the floor listening to the CD and watching them go round.  Good price for what it is.<br /><br />We didn't have any noise issues as reported by some other buyers.  Sure, it makes a noise, but what would you expect?  Doesn't overpower the CD to listen at the same time.
0345803485|1|I would not have read this book had I not borrowed it from a friend. I'd downloaded the first two chapters and the writing was so bad that I knew there was no way I could buy it. However, the story seemed like it might be interesting. A friend loaned me the book and I took it on vacation.  The writing is bloated and repetitive (often repeating the same thing two sentences in a row, just in a slightly different way). The book should have been about half the length it was. Everyone I've talked to that read it said they basically skim read it because of the bloat.<br /><br />The characters are not likeable. Christian Grey is a controlling stalker type. He just happens to be really rich and hot. Ana is young and naive, a virgin. She finds that Christian is the first man she's really attracted to and because of this she's willing to do things that she would never do otherwise. She recognizes that he's controlling and a stalker (comments on it many times) yet she allows it to continue.  When she discovers his kinks, she's at first intrigued but then after being initiated into them via her first punishment, she's a wreck.<br /><br />The book gives a poor introduction to the BDSM lifestyle and will lead many to misconceptions of what it is about (and what the people who enjoy it are about). The idea that he fell into it because he was abused as a child and then introduced to it at 15 by an older woman.  That despite the fact that he's rick and controls a major corporation, he still NEEDS this kind of control over women and sex.  It's just sad.<br /><br />As for the sex scenes themselves, they are rather uninteresting. they are also few and far between. There were maybe 5 or 6 in the entire 500 page book. The first one is almost half way into the book, so if you are looking for erotica this is not it.
B00FB13Y74|4|keeps kid busy, not sure if she will keep playing if something more exciting comes along. keep adding free games.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Hated this, gave it away to a relative. I'm sticking with the Apple TV-- much more intuitive and it may be a bit more, but with its recent price drop, you just get more bang for your buck.
B005LLSZNM|5|Loved this show
B00AFROVQC|2|The writing is about 7th or 8th grade level with characters appearing very transparent to everyone except Thor who is a simple country boy with some kind of magic power and a lot of naivete.  He makes a lot of mistakes from his naivete but all turns out well either due to his power or due to someone else's intervention.  About 3/4 of the way through one begins to realize that the novel cannot possibly resolve in the remaining pages.  At the very end his charm deserts him and we get no end at all.  It stops abruptly in mid-scene.  I would not read another book by this author.  I do not believe any of them would really end.
B003DT194G|4|got this because a friend raved about it....well if you arent into old -strange westerns then this isnt for you....but i enjoyed it and happy i got it -especially for the price i couldnt not get this!

B0017QSZW6|5|Very well done! Actors do a great job making their characters believable and dynamic.  I was hooked from Season 1 and Season 2 did not disappoint.
B00HMJTBU2|5|I have said this many times in my life. Many, many, oh so many times.....TIM CURRY IS THE GREATEST ACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF ACTING. Obviously when dealt with the task of having to cast someone to play a super creepy clown, a clown which haunts the dreams of those young and old who watch this film, Tim Curry is the first name to pop into anyone's mind. That voice....that face.....everything about Tim Curry screams, &#34;Weird Creepy Guy...but I'd probably still do him anyway&#34;. His performance of &#34;Sweet Transvestite&#34; in Rocky Horror is to forever be known as EPIC BRILLIANCE! No one could pull off a song like that...no one but Tim Curry! Then we look at the not so known film &#34;The Worst Witch&#34;--A movie I watched every single Halloween as a kid. Why did I watch it every Halloween? No, not because of the story of the poor clumsy girl who couldn't get her act together in witch school, who was always taunted and teased by those around her only to triumph as the greatest little witch girl ever at the end. No. The reason was always, I repeat, ALWAYS because I had to watch the scene of Tim Curry (AKA-The Grand Wizard that every girl in witch school was in love with) sing that HORRIBLE Halloween song. Yes, the lyrics to that song are absolutely awful, but when Tim Curry sings them it somehow makes the song fall into the category of greatest ever, right up there with &#34;Little Red Corvette&#34; by Prince, and even &#34;Baby&#34; by Justin Beiber. When Tim Curry sings that horrid Halloween song he sings it with heart and soul, something no other actor, not even Peter Ustinov or Laurence Olivier could pull off. As far as I'm concerned, anything with Tim Curry in it should be considered a classic.....does the dude have any Oscar awards?? If not he should get one...not for any movies he has played in but just because he is TIM CURRY!

B000JMKQX0|5|Better than the Survival Guide, less technical and more human. A fresher take on the zombie genre. I enjoy all the stories from the different characters, they create different viewpoints of the war but still fit together overall.
B00BMR4RIG|5|It's just a simple app and I like that. I can add all kinds of different locations too. It does better at getting the temp right, others I've used always were off on the temp.

630469654X|4|This great fantasy epic will become a classic,portraying the eternal battle between the \\"Romeo's and Juliet\\"s\\" of this world or the next.  The line \\"Forever Together but ever apart\\" is the cry of ages.  Tastefully done with very little to incite the masses.  I was sorry to see it end, as the wolf could have played a bigger part,for who can blame an animal for doing what they do best?

B00A2H9OSK|3|I was really looking forward to this movie.  And while some of the fight sequences were creative, the overall pacing of the film was slow.  I don't remember any particularly clever one-liners.  And I really didn't like the death of the CGI doggie.  I honestly don't know if I'll ever watch this one again.  I'll probably just stick with Chronicles of Riddick.
B00OALA8YS|5|I honestly do not know if it was because i went into this movie knowing precisely what i was going to see and therefore there was no chance at my expectations being not met, if it was because it shows that sometimes the last thing that a person should do is listen to critics, or i was just in the mood to see this, but i absolutely LOVED this movie!<br /><br />first of all, the acting was amazing!  Luke Evans was incredible in the role of dracula, i really felt for his character and with this performance, i am surprised that he is not a leading actor in hollywood right now.  all the actors on the whole were exceptional, yet he stood out the most.<br />the direction and visuals were wonderful and i enjoyed dracula's transformations while he flew through the armies, and i felt as if i was watching a greek tragedy: you already know the ending, but you are watching to see how matters unfold.<br />Sometimes, i have learned that the worst things to do is listen to other people when it comes to their preferences, because while some things are bad, there are those exceptions where something is good, but others look for the bad in it, so they find it.  If you go into this movie knowing what you are getting, you will see that it is quite wonderful and very well done.  is it perfect?  perhaps not, but what ever is?  also it was not deceptive.  if you watched the trailer for it, then it depicts the movie perfectly, instead of making it look better than what it was, or worse. overall, i would just say that sometimes don't knock things until you try them for yourself.  you may be surprised.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game I've always wanted a horse but I'm highly allergic to them so this game is awesome<br /><br />hi
B000FA675C|1|I read this from a library loan.  It was not worth the time.  This is a good example of how not to write a historical novel.  He represents it as \\"fact\\" but doesn't do even the simplist fact checks.  The worst thing is how predictable the story actually is, with no real suspense.
B00A757EFW|5|I can spend hours playing this game.  I played with my children when they were younger and we always had a great time.
B00BKBCF38|1|Give me a break...<br /><br />This band isn't even METAL!  They are just being marketed to the metal demographic because of the imagery and lyrics.<br /><br />Musically, they sound like a 70's rock band....the vocals are absolutely HORRENDOUS.. \\"Papa Emeritus\\"? More like Papa John's Pizza if you ask me.  Extra Cheese!<br /><br />There are so many REAL metal bands out there busting their asses to make a living, and it's a shame media creations like this end up getting all the fanfare.  Just the \\"flavor of the month\\".<br /><br />That all said, I am sure this will go platinum, or gold. lol
B0091VYG86|5|I think I may have seen it a long time ago but it was very entertaining and has a good message for life.

B003U6BE8I|5|Very fun action film, with a modern twist on the Gods of old.  Good acting, story is cool, and the Special effects are awesome. Worth a rental.
B00I4SJK7O|5|she continues to put out great music... just one solid musician and storyteller .. I love her music
B00BT0ZDF2|3|I had been waiting over 9 months to watch this, and was prepared to buy at least 10 copies to send to friends and family. That's how excited I was about this movie! However they pushed the boundaries of their rating beyond their limits!!! It ought to have been rated triple RRR, or X. There was so much graphic violence and porn as well as superfluous use of the F-word, so as to have it lose its effect, that there is no one that I could possibly send it to, that would not afterwards cut off all contact with me, and lose all respect for me. I don't know anyone that would not be offended by its content, which is sad, because the premise behind it is soooo absolutely TRUE! I ought to have just kept watching the trailer. After removing inappropriate content, that is about what you are left with. I had no issue with the flow of the scenes however from story to story, as some complain about. You get the same thing watching soaps! :) Lol.The flow was fine.
B006VRDZ44|5|Great show.  Reminds me of Sopranos
B00000J2KT|5|I am writing to clear up some of the uproar surrounding the 1:1.33 full frame versions of Full Metal Jacket and The Shining being released as part of the Stanley Kubrick Collection.  Before his death, Kubrick personally  oversaw the creation of these DVDs; every detail down to the typefaces used  on the packaging was Kubricks choice (Research has led me to believe this  is true, though I cannot confirm it in any way).  Due to the advent of the  VCR and Kubricks disdain for Pan&amp;Scan,   The Shining (and later FMJ)  were  actually filmed &quot;Full Frame&quot; by Kubrick, and later matted  for theatrical release to avoid Pan &amp; Scan butchery by the movie  studios.  That is why these two DVDs are Full Frame.  We will see the films  as Kubric intended them.  True, I prefer the shape of widescreen; it is  more &quot;stable&quot; and pleasant, compared to 1:1.33, but I'd rather  follw the masters orders...
B0018QQQK8|5|As we all know, Nicholas Sparks knows how to write a romance novel. It's what he does best. This is another example of how well he writes
B006LSZECO|4|Very surprised at the twists and turns in this book. Nothing was as it seemed in the beginning. A real page turner.
B002VWONB2|5|GREAT product, as described. FAST shipping, very satisfied. A +++
044654146X|5|I read this excellent book, here in Brazil. This book was writen by two Jews: Dan Senor and Saul Singer. And this book is correct, concise and very easy to understand. If you read this book, you will see that companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel, etc. are so successful, because they are using inovations from Israeli Jews.  I found just two mistakes in all this book. On page page 130, there's a small mistake about eugenics and on page 130 this book claims that France sold fighters to Syria, while France sold jets to Lybia, another Israel's foe.  The best part of this book, I found on pages 209 and 210. There, I could read these sentences: \\"The United Nations' Arab Human Development, which presented the organization's research from 2002 through 2005, found that the number of books translated annually into Arabic in all the Arab countries combined was one-fifth the number translated into Greek in Greece. The number of patents registered between 1980 and 2000 from saudi Arabia was 171; from Egypt, 77; from Kuwait, 52; from United Arab Emirates, 32; from Syria, 20; and from Jordan, 15 - compared with 7,652 from Israel. The Arab world has the highest illiteracy rates globally and one of the lowest numbers of active research scientists with frequently cited articles. In 2003, China published a list of the five hundred best universities in the world; it did not include a single mention of the more than two hundred universities in the Arab world.\\"
0553593714|4|Written in exquisite detail, A Game of Thrones is the first novel in the critically acclaimed “A Song of Ice and Fire” series written by George R. R. Martin.<br /><br />  In a land where alliances are few and betrayal is common, seven kingdoms exist in a relative peace under King Robert Baratheon’s rule. When this peace comes to a shattering conclusion, however, traitors start to show their true colors as commoners watch in horror as would-be kings play their “game of thrones”. Featuring an extremely dynamic and colorful cast of characters, Martin successfully launches off his book series with a fascinating and page turning fantasy.<br /><br /> As stated previously, Martin is a master of incorporating as much detail as possible. “He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider.” One of the best aspects of the book is the elaborate detail in which Martin describes his settings and characters. Another wonderful component of the book is the characters themselves. Each chapter of the book is told from the point of view of a different rotating character, each of whom is more interesting and dynamic than the last.<br /><br /> A Game of Thrones is an incredibly worthwhile read, filled with drama, suspense, powerful imagery and, above all, a phenomenal cast of interesting and well developed characters. It is a must read for any fan of fantasy, but it should be noted that the novel contains many graphic scenes not suited for squeamish readers. I give A Game of Thrones  4 1/2 stars for being an incredibly entertaining and well written story.
B009YP9L7U|5|This was a very cute book. I read a lot of romance books and some all kind of the same but I can honestly say I never read one similar to this. Book was also an easy read.
B00HWWUQYY|5|Absolutely love this movie, my wife bought it and surprised me with it. Bluray and a nice HD tv and you can't beat it! Can't wait till the next movie.
B00LEIT6K2|5|Gorgeous graphics. Good storyline. New puzzles.
1616202416|5|It's a story of a young girl and her young brother as they grow up under a strict father and discover themselves and their freedom. Set in Ibo-land, Nigeria, Purple Hibiscus is a well spun story full of suspense and intrigue. Kambili, through whose eyes and mind the story is told, starts of as mute girl with excellent academic credentials and by the end of the story she is in love with one she will never possess, has discovered her voice through her association with her cousins in Nsuka, and has &#34;lost&#34; her brother through her mother's brave but misguided attempt to liberate her family.<br /><br />This is certainly Ngozi's masterpiece. You will not regret ever reading this story.
B0001ARCFA|5|Excellent sound quality and comfortable to wear.
B005H9B2CE|5|Great for family members of all ages..recommend it to anyone who has not seen the movie..great from start to finish
0743289684|5|This is without doubt the most important and interesting book I have read this year. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants a picture inside (and outside) Islam from a woman's point of view - albeit one who has made the journey from under the burka to become an active politician in a western country. Ayaan Hirsi Ali's courage and honesty ring out loud and clear. She has the gumption to say what most people and politicians are too politically correct to say. I salute her.
B000008LOU|4|I agree with other reviewers that this Wilburys album was a step down from Vol. 1, mostly due to the absence of the legendary Roy Orbison, but it is still a great album, superior to much of the pop/rock material that was being released circa 1990.<BR>One of the pleasures of listening to the Wilburys is that they were so much fun - you could tell they were having fun writing and performing these songs. With Vol. 3 they were running on the momentum created by the immensely popular Vol. 1, and they crafted some fine songs here, but it obviously didn't have the sheer awe value of Vol. 1.<BR>Bob Dylan was actually my least favorite vocalist on Vol. 1 (I have since come to appreciate him more), but here they gave him prime chores, and I just remember being disappointed I wasn't hearing as much from Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. I especially thought Lynne would step into the gap left by Orbison to give us some soaring vocals, a la \\"Turn to Stone\\" from his ELO days. Even so, \\"New Blue Moon\\" became my favorite track on this album. I also enjoyed \\"Inside Out\\", \\"Where Were You Last Night\\", \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" and \\"Poor House.\\"<BR>I highly recommend both this album and Vol. 1. I only wish they had continued to make music together and maybe even roped in another legend for the Wilburys, like Eric Clapton.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Great book written my a talented man. Stephen King does a wonderful job in this suspense filled novel that surpasses the creepiness of &#34;The Shining&#34;  Bravo Mr. King! Job well done.
B002A4UQLW|1|Beware this version is the plastic jewel case version, not the cardboard case version that is pictured and i was hoping for.
B000WGWQG8|3|This series was a bit of a let down.  I was expecting more, having read some excellent Revolutionary War books, Jeff Shaara's 'Rise to Rebellion' and 'The Glorious Cause' among them.  The problem is that this series was based on David McCullough's book of the same name, which was a bore, just like his '1776' was a bore.  I guess having read books of a broader scope, narrowing the focus to only John Adams chopped out so much more that was interesting.  '1776' would have been a better series, providing McCullough wasn't the sole source.  PS:  'Rome' and 'Deadwood' were the best HBO series of all time.  Full stop.
B00Y6QF0PE|1|If you read the first one nothing new here.
B005EHNMWM|5|Wilco has never put out a bad or even mediocre album, so saying this fits right in with the Wilco catalog, which it does, is high praise. Each album is great in its own way and I suppose what makes this one stand out is that here Wilco offers several great pop tunes, reminiscent of Summerteeth in some ways. \\"Born Alone,\\" \\"Dawned on Me,\\" \\"Whole Love,\\" and \\"I Might\\" are as poppy and melodic as anything Wilco has ever done. At the same time there are less radio-friendly but equally satisfying tunes like the sprawling, melancholy \\"One Sunday Morning\\" and the complex, Radiohead-like \\"Art of Almost\\" (I should add here that Nels Cline just shreds it on this song). \\"Open Mind,\\" \\"Black Moon,\\" and \\"Rising Red Lung\\" are gorgeous pieces of mellow, acoustic Wilco. I saw Wilco live on release day (in Raleigh) and it was clear that many of these songs will become concert staples. Jeff joked about this album going platinum (and about reading Amazon reviews). Wilco has never seemed to be fixated on commercial success, but they certainly deserve it. I could see this album going platinum though as more people discover that Wilco is an American treasure, truly the best band to hail from the U.S. This is a great album. Buy it. Maybe this will be Wilco's first platinum album!
B00HXYKYIE|5|loved it
0805095152|5|Tremendous insight into life choices rarely discussed among loved ones, that pretty much determin the difference between dying with dignity and dying according to &#34;the system&#34;. An absolute must read for everyone not just seniors or caregivers - pretty much anyone alive should read this book - specially doctors and nurses for whom this book should be a must read in med school.
B0018QQQK8|5|This was a keeper!!!
0385504209|1|I must say this book is one of the most poorly written books I've read in quite a while.  I suppose I must say it was entertaining, though not entertaining enough to buy, just borrow from a friend or the library.  If serial novels and suspense thrillers are your thing, you might enjoy it.  I personally could not even keep it.  I bought it and swiftly returned it two days later.  If you want suspense that is enriching too I would recommend Khaled Hosseini's &quot;Kite Runner&quot;.  That is a fantastic book.
B006GLLXXK|4|Takes a couple episodes to let the whole &#34;mainstream vampire&#34; thing kick in and not be lame but it does it well. every episode ends with big cliffhanger so you cant just watch one

B004JZBGWI|5|I haven't used a notepad on my kindle, but really needed one.  This has worked great for me thus far.  It's easy to manipulate and enter information.  Look forward to using it more extensively.
B009NG1Q96|4|Note: This review will have some minor spoilers for those who haven't read the first book in the series, The Selection.<br /><br />Reading The Elite reminds me of why I've never been interested in watching The Bachelorette. It reminds me of why The Hunger Games made me swear off love triangles (however temporarily). And yet I devoured The Elite. I was excited and pissed off and anxious at all the right moments. I loved The Elite (and The Selection) despite it being essentially everything I tell myself I hate.<br /><br />Maybe I've been lying to myself?<br /><br />I absolutely hate the idea of women competing for a man, lowering themselves and their own self-esteem as the volley for his affection. But that's not exactly what's happening in The Elite. I mean, isn't America (the main character, from whose point of view The Elite is told) actually learning to value herself MORE because of the competition? She never believed that she could attract a prince, that she could be princess material... But now she's considering it. No, its not the same as The Bachelorette. Plus, real friendships are being formed between some of the remaining girls. And they're getting a real chance to be more than the number they were born with (their caste). Perhaps that's why it doesn't bother me?<br /><br />Perhaps the reason is Maxon (the prince). He doesn't want a woman who doesn't love him. He knows its a competition for a crown as much as it is a competition for his affections, and he's trying to find his match - a person who can make him happy and be happy with him. Sure it makes my blood boil that Maxon has all but said he loves America, and yet he continues to SERIOUSLY date the other girls. But I do love the doubt it creates. Can I -and America - really trust him and what he claims to feel? And some things happened in The Elite that made me really start to question my initial impressions of him. Is he REALLY good and does he REALLY want to fix things? I think so, but I'm not completely sure. It's pure, perfect torture. And I'm devouring it.<br /><br />And then there's America. Even though it's driving me crazy the way America can't seem to decide between Maxon and Aspen (the boy she fell in love with before all this), she's not some passive observer to all that's going on, just waiting for a decision to be made for her. America is trying, SO HARD. She's genuinely confused, and I don't think it's so much about the guys - I think deep down she knows which one she loves most - but about herself. What life is right for her? Life as a one or a two? Life in the limelight and able to make change (and seriously screw things up)? Or a quiet life?<br /><br />That's indecision I can put up with. I still wish she would stop already (particularly because Aspen does NOTHING for me - seriously, if you're team Aspen, comment and tell me what I'm missing!) but I can at least deal with it. It helps that I otherwise adore her. I love how she treats people. I love that she has a moral compass and that she sticks to it, regardless of the consequences. I love that she screws up. She's so damn real.<br /><br />And then there's just everything that's happening BEYOND the competition in The Elite. After reading The Selection, I said it felt like a light dystopian. Now, though, I've started to see the dark parts of this world more clearly. We're starting to see the corruption, power and pure evil - even though its still not DARK. Its dark enough to make me spitting mad though, which is a really good thing.<br /><br />So yeah, The Elite is built around ideas I say I hate. But they're wrapped in different packaging, with different (better) characters, and some elements that piss me off so bad I can't book down - and I can't wait to see what's in store with The One. If, like me, you aren't a fan of the bachelorette-like scenario or the love triangles, but you do like solid characters and dystopia, I'd say give it a try. You might be surprised.ly sure. It's pure, perfect torture. And I'm devouring it.<br /><br />And then there's America.

B0081SRJSY|5|I have never played the board game for this app.  It took a while to understand how the game works.  I still have some trouble understanding how fields are scored, and I have been playing it for over a month now.  However this game really does grow on you.  It takes a great deal of strategy to beat the computer opponents.

B0052TDGQO|1|12 identically-sounding songs by another flash-in-the-pan pop singer with a freak-of-nature voice singing about the incongruousness of pretty women driving beat-up old (presumably pick-up) trucks.  What's the point?  Save yourself a few dollars by foregoing the CD; buy one 99-cent MP3 so you can say you have it, and move on with your life.
B002MQYOFW|5|A well written book which, if read with an open mind and heart, has some important messages and warnings relevant to our times and current situation in the world.  Ms. Collins created a strong heroine who is able to overcome unthinkable horrors through resourcefulness and intelligence.  She did a great job of letting us see into the mind and motivations of a girl who will do whatever it takes to protect those she loves.  She also wove into this fascinating story (and it's sequel novels) a powerful warning against we as a people giving up too much power to government.  Well done!
0399160477|5|Gave it to my husband for Christmas and he could not put it down!!!  He kept going off away from all the festivity so he could finish it!
B00NWLIW0E|4|It lags, but fun game.
B0000DD7LB|1|...and do NOT buy this. I liked Britney after her first 2, (\\"Oops! I Did it Again\\" and \\"...Baby one more time\\") but this is really not worth your dollar. Like that person with the helpful review said, the only reason she has a record deal is her \\"sex appeal.\\" In case you haven't noticed, she poses in nude magazines. Pop stars like Hilary Fluff are only here because they are pretty; they do not need vocal talent to get in. But this girl, it's like whoa!, even with a computerized voice, she doesn't sound good. In some songs, she tries to rap, but she fails. The background music (if you can call it that) is tiresome and boring, and sometimes you can't even hear Britney. It really does sound like she's \\"going against the music.\\" And no, she does not have that \\"boom boom.\\"<BR>I'm not going to lie and say I have this CD, because it's really that bad. Like many, I listened to the music at a friends' house. If you want to waste your money, go ahead and feel free to buy this. But I reccomend that if you do like pop, you should buy \\"Stripped\\" by Christina Aguilera or \\"Coverage\\" by Mandy Moore, because at least there's some vocal talent there. If you like \\"Me Against the Music,\\" then I suggest you buy the single (I know I said that singles were a waste of money before, but you're saving money with this deal).  <br />Once again, maybe if the record-people start giving us some GOOD music with actual substance, then we will buy CDs instead of downloading. <br />So, do yourself a favour and do NOT buy this waste of paper and plastic. Not only will you be saving yourself and the music industry, but you'll be saving the enviroment too.
B007PTJOV0|5|this game is addicting, fun, and a great time waster!!! just like Mario, but with pots of gold and a leprechaun. awesome app for all ages, no doubt about it.
B00C8S9VKM|5|Very interesting and readable.  This account of an important time in our history contains many facts I was not aware of.  After reading this, I'll never think of the events of that ear in the same way.  A page turner.
0425166805|2|This information is great fiction.<br /><br />The book, and the idea are old. Time to move on Von Daniken, along with all of your followers. For ONCE please, if you are going to go on with this idea come up with some new &#34;evidence&#34;. REAL evidence...not theory.
B002MQYOFW|5|Great read...looking to read rest of trilogy

0553296981|4|Anne Frank was a young Jew girl just around my age 13.  Anne's story is remarkable, it tells about how her and 7 other people lived in a secret annex for years.  Anne Frank's only reason to hide was her religion being a Jew. Anne fell in love in the secret annex with a boy about two years older than her, his name was Peter Van Dann.  Later when Anne's family is caught she is sent to Bergen Belson.  Later she dies there of a serious illness.

B00NAXE8V6|5|One of my favorite KISS albums of all time! Bonus disc is cool!
B000002UAU|5|It's quite difficult to write a review for one of the greatest albums of all time, but from the disillusioned reviewers out there that claim this album is \\"not that good\\" or \\"a waste of money,\\" I felt obligated to point  out just how wrong they are.<br />First of all, this album is a CONCEPT album  so you cannot say, \\"Take away the art work and funky packaging and all you  have is some music.\\"  This is a piece of artwork, so the album liner,  cover, and artwork are all part of a presentation.  I might add for you  Beach Boy fans that the Sgt. Pepper artwork is a hell of a lot more  interesting than the bunch of farm animals hanging around on \\"Pet Sounds,\\"  but hey...some guys swing that way.<br />Second, this album is not for the  song-selecting few out there who are trying to get a couple of radio hits  for their collection.  This album was meant to be listened to from start to  finish, or more precisely, from \\"here to there.\\"  The ALBUM is meant to  move you, not a particular song or song(s), so don't start griping when you  have to skip to \\"track 3\\" every time you pop in the album.  Stick to your  greatest hits collection for the radio play, buy this album to experience  it.<br />Third, you've GOT to wonder why this album is still causing a ruckus  30 years after it was released.  Ask any kid today who the Beach Boys are  and they will respond, \\"don't you mean Beastie Boys...?\\"  Compare that to the  fact that the shelf life of today's bands is about 2 weeks and you'll  realize it's quite a feat.  Yet 3 decades later this album is still as  timeless as the day it came out, and still as applicable to today's society  as it was to the 60's generation of hippies.<br />Finally, I expect to get  some flaming emails from those of you who happen to hate The Beatles, like  the Beach Boys, or just like farm animals.  But if you're just mailing me  to gripe about how much you hate \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" don't bother.  That's why  used CD shops exist....
1476715904|4|I'm not usually a reader of YA fiction but was curious about the title. The story held my attention and I thought the author did agreat job of creating realistic characters and their situations.
B00BAXFAOW|4|I liked the book but I wasn't sure where some of the chapters fit in.  He makes decent arguments, but you also have to remember that they are basically arguments.  It is a decent use of statistics, and statistics are well statistics.  It offers a differing point of view on some topics which is always good, but the world and every situation is unique and finding one formula that fits across the board is very hard.  I wasn't really sure that the 3rd strike law chapter completely fit in, it's a difficult topic in general when wrongful death comes into play.  Just writing that chapter on crime and the law itself doesn't really address the education issues, possible family issues and job opportunity issues that take place in areas of high crime/ low income.  The ending result of the law needing to take into account the seriousness of the crime is something that should have happenned a long time ago....I don't have an answer, and we seem to be running into this issue in Chicago with repeat offenders getting out of jail too quickly.  Complicated subject, and I get the robberies.  I mean if my best job opportunity is some fast food place where I won't make in 5 years (probably 10) what they pay one athlete to do a commercial I wouldn't be very thrilled about my future either.  Not that the only opportunities are fast food work, but quality work employment seems to be lacking....a lot needed to be done in America.
030758836X|5|a very mystery book what a ending, really good.husband and wife mystery reminds me of war of the roses,you will want to turn the pages quickly.
B00I8H6MGS|4|Seeing Matthew McConoughy so very thin was difficult to watch.  I realize the weight loss was needed to authenticate the story. Enjoyed the performance of Jared Leto - true professional. I enjoyed the movie very much
B0054JZC6E|4|great way to kill time and boredom. tons of games to play hours and hours of fun. just needs an upgrade.
B004J4WLB4|5|Reading the first two pages, I wasn't sure if the book was indeed a story, or a reference book. However, I am so glad I continued reading the book. It was a wonderful story dealing with real life issues. The characters became real as I was pulled into the story as the author so artistically succeeded to do. This is definitely a book I would recommend to put at the top of one's reading list!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4|It is a great read!
0446608955|5|I loved it! This was one of the first books I read by N. Sparks and I like the way he writes. The book had a great mix of comedy and romanace.
B000J670ZI|3|It was a great movie! Enjoyed the instant streaming technology available to me. Cary Grant was very attractive man in his day.
B00CO4GO7I|5|A truely  amazing read taking you into the personal depths and highs of a very special man.
1446301583|5|Absolutely loves it. I completed the pillow and elephant project, added a blanket to create a beautiful baby set. Easy to follow instructions.
B001AQQR2S|5|So enjoyed watching this.  I love watching at home with my prime membership.  The quality of the picture and sound were excellent
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Incredible young group!!!  Such voices and modulated harmony!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved it. So moving, so believable. This is a story I will remember, think about & share. Finished the book just a couple of days before I walk in my local Relay for Life event which is the premier event for the American Cancer Society.  Thank you for your gift of story telling. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00HSOXKD0|5|Every song is a potential hit.
B00GXKVZSW|2|So lacking in story... graphic gore replaces suspense, many scenes are completely disjointed and loud music, presumably for shock effect, accompanies the end of the frequent, bizarre dream sequences which are introduced as to appear normal but showing the mental decay of the series' hero, Will Graham. Yes, Hannibal takes second place and in one episode, he is barely present.<br />The episode's premises are preposterous such as a serial killer assembling a totem pole of corpses weighing more than a  thousand pounds and erecting this, unseen, on a &#34;deserted&#34; beach without the use of mechanical aids.<br />Presented in a dark and melodramatic manner, the viewer is meant to be lulled, via weird long-toned music, into anticipating something, which, disappointingly, never seems to materialize. Loud drums beating to accompany someone walking down a hall then switching to another scene is just the kind of  nonsense that seems to be used to try and maintain an interest when the story fails.<br /><br />On the bright side, the series is well filmed, the acting is good, especially by Lawrence Fishburne.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I can't believe how great this game is...wow!
B008RA3X5E|5|works just as described on kindle fire. Looks snazzy too. White noise for the sleep timer is a little annoying but it can also play music or other sound files. I like to listen to podcasts to fall asleep so this is great.
B00DJFIMW6|5|It's an awesome game a lot of fun ..the minions are so cute and it a good way to pass the time...
B007BVOEPI|1|I kept hearing great things from people about this show, but I could not get into it. I found myself having to look up the family frees and terms just so that I could keep up! I am guy who watches The Walking Dead, House of Cards, The Following, etc. and I COULD NOT GET INTO THIS SHOW
B0015GF4FO|5|I initially turned off the first couple of episodes b/c they were so slow. Later, I tried them again and was hooked. The premise for this show is so basic and yet so compelling. The authenticity of the characters were mesmerizing, I couldn't stop watching. They made me care about what happened to them and for me, that's makes my five-star list.
B007EC27QM|5|I love that the calculator saves the history. No more starting over when someone interiors you while you working. Good Job..
B00L9B7IKE|4|Excellent writing.  A little hard to follow but I couldn't put it down once I hit the climax.  Excellent portrayal of the psyche of a sociopath but the psyches of the female characters are not cohesive throughout the novel.
B000G6R7B8|3|Difficult to set but otherwise OK.
B009UX2YAC|5|It's awesome! The glitches are a problem though. If you haven't downloaded this yet.. the moment is now!! Download it please!!
B00MIA0KGY|3|case was broken,left in cellophane plus having to pay £11.72 pence shipping costs (Customs)<br />not very happy would like replacement and refund for the above amount.
B00KA87GCW|5|This game has good graphics and is a good game to play to pass the time away. Time management game, glad it's available on my kindle fire.
B00NZ1E9GC|5|Superb album that grows on you over time. Give it time. Highly Recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5|its ok and stuff but it. doesn't work all the time abed it sometimes would make me lose with pop up ads
B000QCS8TW|5|the books are so much more info than the tv series its amazing....
B001V7YJMG|5|Very enjoyable, so much better than the movies we Americans butcher. This flick is actually scary because it's not overdone and typical. The characters are vivid, the acting is excellent.
1609611543|5|Do yourself a favor and know this stuff. For the healthy body and educated mind ... It is worth knowing
B000084T18|1|i think it's disgusting how much hype this guy gets for his mediocre crap.  it seems that getting shot can't make you a good rapper, and 50 cent is living proof.  he can have all the street credibility in the world but it doesn't mean he has any substance.  like many others have said, this is mtv stamp of approval carrying tripe.  maybe he'll win like 10 grammy's so he can hang out with will smith and the other pop bs that passes for hip hop these days.

0679720200|4|Camus has written a story in the simplest form to investigate an extremely complicated side of human nature.  Every word uttered by the narrator causes even the most apathetic human to read it twice, constantly asking how he could so callously brush off every event in his life.  This is a book that not only asks, but demands to be read several times
B0026P3G12|5|The purchase was easy, Payment was Simple ,And the Shipping Was Fery Fast.! Thanks for A plesant  Buying Experience, I WILL RETURN. !!!!! Milton.B.
B00000K0EA|5|The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described. It was a gift for a 007 fan. They loved it.
B0089LOKHG|4|The book was pretty good, following the line of the previous ones.<br />The thing that keeps bothering me is this: we all know alex is not dead ok, so we are expecting a final book full of romance, but wait a second what is a young adult hit without a love triangule, so here we are in this love battle wondering what is going to happen next, second; I mean come on what kind of grand final is that, I don't want to spoil anything so I'm not saying more, but I expected way more.<br />Conclusion, if you are a fan of this series you must read this book, but prepare to be a little disappointed.
B00CKJ2KK2|4|It's a pretty cool game plus the graphics aren't bad so I rececemend this game to people who like war games
B001GCUO16|5|good movie
B004SUWR2C|5|It is a very exciting game.  Could spend hours playing.  Is good for the mind.<br />Glad I downloaded it today.
B00JDB4PEY|1|Forgettable and there is a reason why these songs were shelved back in the day. They are not good, and re-doing them with big names does not help. These are songs that you will forget about within a few days of hearing them.
3899554914|5|This was a gift for my husband who is a motorcycle enthusiast. The hard cover and strong binding ensures the books lovely appeal. The contents not only show  the many different bikes but the history and the designers of each bike plus so much more. &#34;The Ride&#34; it's an experience for him.  Thank You Amazon!
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Lots of Christmas spirit!
B002NXSRX4|5|So this movie got a bad rap for its suspect CG effects.  Well, considering that probably 75% of the film was full CG or at least CG set extensions, etc. it's understandable that some of it didn't look photo realistic.  Hey, we didn't complain that great films like Return of the Jedi used matte paintings for its backgrounds.  So give the production team some slack.<br /><br />But anyway, how's the film itself as a live-action G.I. Joe film.  I think it's great.  Have the traditional costumes changed, sure, but that's the same arguement used against the Michael Bay Transformers films.  But this film was a blast to watch.  It was a full fleged popcorn movie at its core.  And that's all they producers wanted it to be.  A film that appeals to both fans and those who didn't know anything about G.I. Joe.  Big set pieces, big over the top action pieces.  And lots of cool futuristic military hardware.  The film is basically one action sequence after another.  And then there's even a plot in there too with a few twists.<br /><br />Actually, I'm looking forward to a sequel.
B000051VWW|4|Although this album is not Sade's best work, it is however very good. You'll reminisce of previous recordings like \\"Smooth Operator\\" and \\"Ordinary Love\\" when you hear \\"By Your Side\\" and the CD's title track, \\"Lover's Rock.\\" I strongly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys soft, soothing music and most obviously to any Sade fan.
B00992CF6W|2|for some weird reason, I couldn't download the app. It made me buy it about 12 times and it still wouldn't load.
B000002W9Q|4|In 2001 Lauren Rakowski asked if anybody knew the song playing when Baby (love that name) first discovered the employees dancing.  I'm pretty sure that was \\"Love Man\\" by Otis Redding.  The definitive compilation for this soundtrack is (I believe) called \\"Ultimate Dirty Dancing\\" with all of the singles from this package AND the more soulful \\"More Dirty Dancing\\" which I am sure you all have now. The \\"ultimate\\" one is available but not, so far as I know, on Amazon.  Good memories here, but it doesn't compare with its follow-up.  Notable exception: One-hit wonder Bruce Channel's \\"Hey, Baby\\" with Texas bluesman Delbert McClinton on blues harp. So for one-time contributor Lauren who was 13 in the summer of Baby and Johnny, there's your answer.
B00SXK316E|5|Instant addict
B007FY9ZWI|4|Seems to be a good player.  Very nice to have a working EQ, but it has a quirk/feature that when you plug in the headphones it automatically launches and plays where you left off.  This us not good if you put the headphones in to do something else!! Also it does a poor job at picking up the album covers on songs even though the Kindle sleazy has the covers.
B00TYB95I4|5|Awesome, just Awesome! I watched 3 times. JK Simmons definitely earned that Oscar. It was just a real good movie. Don't see many like this anymore... Miles Teller will have an amazing career , if not as an actor, then he can always fall back on playing the drums.
B00992CF6W|5|When is it going to be able to update to minecraft 0.10.0
B004HO6I4W|4|They make a video in Brazil and have some portuguese words in it.  Why would they not make the video available in Portuguese.  I can only find it in English and Spanish.  Doesn't make any sense. Other than that the movie was wonderful and colorful. Lots of action for a kids movie.  Well worth the money.  More 3d dvd's should be available without the 5 dvd pack.  Some people only want 1 3d dvd not 5 dvd's
B00B7Y0206|2|Isn't there an official YouTube Kindle App?  There used to be I believe.  I hate the ads that come up after you watch a video, shouldn't have that to watch you tube videos.
1573223026|4|The innovative starting point for this novel is 4 people inadvertently meet on a rooftop on New year's Eve.  Each is intent on committing suicide by jumping.  Needless to say they don't.  However, the experience causes them to form an unlikely bond and they become a \\"gang\\", meeting intermittently over the next ninety days (one learns that a researcher has theorized that the urge for suicide slacks after ninety days).    The major conflict of the book is set up immediately - these are four very distinctly different people - a middle-aged woman, a former TV star, an American rocker and a foul-mouthed teenager.  The only thing they have in common is their failed attempt at suicide.      Hornby fills the book with very good dialogue.  The story is related character by character, so that there are often overlapping perspectives on the same event.  The changing perspectives keeps the book interesting.    The characters all have depth and are believeable.  Although they at first blush appear to stereotypic, as the reader gets to know them and their most intimate thoughts, they become unique. None are particularly likeable, although the middle aged woman is sympathetic.    At about the middle of the book, it slowed as the characters got a bit bogged in excessive introspection.  It must be difficult to keep a lot of motion and action when using four depressed people to tell the story.  However, Hornby then picked the pace.      Hornby also maintains a melancholy humor throughout.  Without that humor the depressed nature of the characters' lives and moods would have been too difficult to slog through, especially since the reader never gets a \\"rooting\\" interest for any of the characters.    This is an interesting look at the characters' lives and their perspectives on their own lives as well as the others'.  Also, an interesting investigation of suicide and suicidal people.  Not a happy go lucky read, but interesting and well-written.
0061537969|5|Oh, did I love this book!  Much like Marley & Me, I knew I was going to be emotionally destroyed at the end, but I dove in whole-heartedly, anyway.  I am such a dog lover and Enzo reminded me so much of my dog, Crash.  He \\"said\\" things that I always imagined Crash would say if he could talk.  Such a novel idea, telling a story from the perspective of a dog!<br /><br />Garth Stein really pulled this off.  This type of story could have come across as cheesy but that wasn't the case at all.  This story was touching, heartwarming, painful and honest.  A must read for all dog lovers.
B0017SWPXY|5|Enjoyed every minute of this charming and touching approach to story telling. Reading this book gave me many insights into car racing as well!
B003JTHXOK|5|This book made me laugh, cry, and it made me think. Out of all of Sparks books, I have to say that I really enjoyed this one.
B0001NBMBC|5|First off i would like to say that i have been a Slipknot fan since their self-titled cd came out back in '97 (at least i think it was '97),anyways for all of you saying that this is not the Slipknot that once was, check your ears again, this album is still pretty brutal even if it does have 2 acoustic tracks on it. In my opinion it is time that Slipknot varied it up a little bit, you can only do the same type of music for so many albums without it getting old and Slipknot realized this.  People say that they brought more of a Stone Sour edge into the music and i can buy that but this is so much different than the Stone Sour cd (which i also have), and yes Corey Taylor does not swear on this cd, but is it really all about swearing and screaming all the time, I mean don't get me wrong i like screaming as much as the next heavy music fan but u don't have to swear to get a message across, which Corey and the rest of this talented band do. So before u go screaming ur head off about how Slipknot sold out listen to the cd and the message they are putting out there and take it for what it is, a Slipknot album, and a damn good one at that, maybe not their best, but it certainly isn't their worst.  So either accept it or leave it and for the love of music in general, stop bitching about stuff u happen to not like, it's annoying and i'm sure everyone has better things to do than rip apart a band.
B00AQ2G7D6|5|One of my all time favorite Steve McQueen movies.Just goes to show that Steve was just as good in serious rolls as he was in westerns.Much better than the remake.I would highly recommend this movie.
B009NFHF0Q|4|Love Neil Gaiman. Couldn't put it down. Disappointingly short though.<br /><br />Book too short e-book price, in my opinion, but still recommend if you like Gaiman.
0385504225|3|I've loved all of Dan Brown's books--except this one. Ever so slowly, the story evolves requiring the reader to wade through copious lectures and discourses about freemasonry, historical symbols, religions, and other arcane subjects. Brown's books are always filled with a myriad of detail and \\"stuff\\"--but in the past, I found such passages absorbing as Brown cites \\"fictional fact\\" that comes across as non-fiction. In his latest book, the \\"stuff\\" outweighs the story line as the book staggers to an ending by attempting to reinvigorate religious conviction. Afterward, I found myself dog-tired as though I had sat through one of Professor Langdon's very long and very dry Harvard lectures. Come on Dan, I've faith in you; try again.
B008220BLG|5|I read the book after seeing the previews at the movies and I loved the book. When I saw the movie I loved it. I thought it stuck to the book pretty good, there were some changes but they were minor. My sister, who has not read the book but saw the movie, loved it. We were both cracking up throughout it, a great zombie rom-com (two words I thought I would type). EDIT: I have now seen this movie two more times, it is still funny. The bonus features are great also.
0618680004|4|I recently read professor's Dawkins 'The God delusion'.It is a quite interesting book which resembles much professor's Harris 'The end of faith'.Dawkins is a well known atheist and in this book he expresses his hatred against all organised religion.I think that the objective of this book should be to criticize the politics of the church instead of attacking religion as a matter of faith.After all he is a scientist,not a philosopher,and it is better to leave the job of undermining religious belief to professional philosophers like Sobel or Martin.The reason i rate this book with 4 stars is that it highlights the dangers that are the result of religious fanaticism,which are quite evident in our era.I would suggest the book to everyone who is interested in finding out the disabuse of religious belief and its transformation to a possibly lethal weapon,but it is not the kind of book i would recommend to people who are interested in the philosophical foundations of religion.As a conclusion it is a quite good book but examines religion as far as its results and not its foundations are concerned.
B00992CF6W|1|This is exactly what happened to me I built a massive cruise ship and then I went on and have of it was completely gone please read the review written by alisiaseg at something something something .neocon?<br />Well something like that it is the best review and the most helpful one EVER!!!!! I would write 5 plus stars for her
B0042U94UQ|5|So many of the recent animated films are formulaic, even if they are somewhat entertaining and the kids like them, and they've all got to see them because their friends have seen them, blah blah blah. I did not see this in the theater, as I was expecting it to be as dull as the others that have come out this year. It didn't help that it was (imho) over-advertised, and the image of the strange little yellow creatures, plus the title, made me suspect it was a reworked Mike Meyers show. Then I saw a few reviews that made me think there could be something more to it and it would be worth watching. I took a chance on it as a Christmas gift for my 8-year-old.  I was so pleasantly surprised and amused. The yellow characters (the \\"minions\\") have just the right amount of personality and coherence in their strange, chipmunk-inspired silly language, combined with impeccable timing and just the merest hint of the word you think they'll be saying (e.g., when they are sitting on the copying machine giggling together, they are saying something that sounds much funnier yet not QUITE recognizable as \\"Butt! hahahahahaha!\\") Gru, the \\"evil\\" guy, is a little Mike-Meyerish, and he's predictably \\"evil-looking,\\" with the predictable (for my generation, anyway) Boris-and-Natasha Russian accent--and, as with many CGI movies out these days, I had a vague sense that I'd seen these characters and scenes before (The Incredibles? Bolt? Who knows? They're all the same!) but the three kids actually seemed relatively real--at least the oldest, Morgan, who seems like a sensible, spunky kid. (With real-looking hair!)  They actually make use of the animation in this moview, instead of just doing things in animation that you could probably do in a non-animated film. And, while they do have the obligatory roller-coaster ride (to satisfy the crowd who paid the extra bucks to see it in 3D? Future Universal theme park tie-in?), it is blissfully short-lived. Not like a lot of current movies that waste 10 minutes flying around just because they can induce nausea in those prone to motion sickness, with no corresponding plot support, or any reason at all to be included in the 90-120 minutes of any movie (e.g., Jim Carrey's A Christmas Carol, or How to Train Your Dragon, Avatar, TRON). They have made a couple of new animation advances here, my favorite being the smoke, and the goofiness of Gru's life-long attempts to make something of himself. He's just not that good at his aim to be the world's worst villain. But he's nasty and self-centered, and he's got some really cool toys. With great smoke.<br /><br />The plot is not just a relief. It actually has substance and surprise, plus a few truly unexpected touches! It veers AWAY from the predictable at almost every turn, only heading back in to the predictable in order to poke fun of the standard plot lines, then twist them around again.  Steve Carrell and Russell Brandt, who can be irritatingly, stereotypically juvenile/dumb in most of their roles, are exquisitely cast as Gru and his inventor/manager. I felt like they'd finally found their medium! Gru is just cold enough so that the tug-at-your-heartstrings aspect is surprising and sweet rather than cheesy, and the kids just seem kind of normal, which is saying something for the CGI-generated cute-kid thing. Julie Andrews pulls off a believable and ironic Mom to Gru. My 8-yr-old was losing herself in giggles at some of the pranks, and I was torn between laughing out loud and marvelling at what a good job the filmmakers had done, and how much fun they must have had developing the plot and characters.  The characters and some fun plot points and minor details will make my obligatory 3rd or 4th viewing of it still enjoyable. Plus, the ending is -- dare I say it without sounding cliche -- heartwarming.  But still real and quirky and not too perfect or \\"awwww\\"-inspiring.  Just sweet enough to put an appreciative smile on any parent's face. It is ultimately about family. I swear.And the imperfections of family.<br /><br />This is NOT a scary movie for most kids, even most of the little ones, because the characters, such as the duplicative minions, the shark-mouthed dog, and even the actual shark, are more ironic than real. And ultimately nothing bad happens. Even the explosions are kind of harmless. I'm not exactly sure why this is rated PG, whereas the much more frightening \\"Toy Story 3\\" is rated G. (I confess I enjoyed that movie too, but it's cloyingly sweet and a calculated heartwarmer relative to this movie... plus, even though I love Tom Hanks and his acting abilities, his voice generally doesn't do it for me in any of his animated features. It's just annoying.)  Get this movie for your kids. Get it for you and say it's for your kids. Get it for you and plug your kids and their friends in so you can get something done around the house or shut them up on that long drive. Get it if you are obligated to watch movies over and over and over with your young kids. Get it if you are a sarcastic teenager. Or a nerd/geek. Or someone who likes to complain about nerd/geeks (Vector, who for some reason made me think of Steve Jobs, I don't know). Get it if you are tired of the same old, same old, and want to watch asomething a little more inventive.  Get it if you love Steve Carell & Russell Brandt, or if you hate them. And of course get it just to hear Julie Andrews. Get it if you don't mind a little potty humor (it's funny, not really vulgar). Get it if you have kids, and know how annoying they can be. Oh, and all the minor characters are fun as well.
B007R11DKQ|4|Great movie
B002BU0DPE|5|ok
B006PHD0RW|5|Filling the bags are fun n challenging. Cute animations keep you trying<br />If you like clean fun its 4 u.
B004QZ9PLU|5|One of the most touching books I've read yet. I loved all the characters except the ones who were despicable, and there were plenty of both! Cried through the last several chapters and enjoyed every tear shed! I highly recommend this book to everyone she has ever been in love!
B006LSZECO|5|One of the best books I have read so far. If you looking for a great mystery book you should read this
B00008OWZC|5|I was at one of the Seattle concerts in 1972 - my first rock concert at the ripe old age of 13.  I had quite literally never seen or heard anything like Led Zeppelin - from Robert Plant's piercing wails to Jimmy Page's solos and violin bowing to John Paul Jones' relentless bass rhythms to John Bonham's merciless drum pounding.  This CD reminds me of why that night made me a lifelong Zep head.<br />To some, the long solos and improvisations may seem sloppy or self-indulgent, but it's what made every concert a unique gem - so different from the overly staged and choreographed concerts we see nowadays.  And the music - combinations of folk, blues, oldtime rock n roll imbibed with a hard electric edge.  Nothing was sacred, any style was fair game and any song could be worked and reworked to create ever-changing panoramas of sound.  Whole Lotta Love is a particularly stellar example of their improvisational style in action.<br />Thanks, Jimmy, for bringing it all back live for both old and new fans!
B00H58VGIA|5|A beautiful narrative...told through the journal entries of the two main characters beginning with their official meeting at the age of eleven and following them into their forties!  The two characters are Sarah Grimke and Hetty/Handful, a black servant girl &#34;given to Sarah&#34; on her eleventh birthday.  The story of their lives amidst the struggle to end slavery is rich in detail and historical accuracy. Shocking, provocative, and emotionally honest, this story held my interest for every second.  Two things set this novel apart from others that take place in the Pre-Civil War era: the amount of actual historical events and characters included and it's emotional honesty toward the subject matter. Sarah Grimke, as well as also sot a dozen other characters, were actual people. Sue Monk Kidd has brought an important story to life, paying tribute to an incredible woman who has not, until now, received the recognition she so rightly deserves.
B003FNWR6Y|5|This board game came exactly as it was described, and it's fun to play with all your nerdy nintendo friends!
B00G2GMRCU|4|Entertaining and very short.
B002BU0DPE|2|I purchased these for my husband 18 months ago. He liked them, but the right ear piece just stopped working. They were never pulled on, dropped, ect. He was very careful with them because he knew I spend a lot (for a pair of headphones in my opinion) for them. I paid more than what they are being sold for now. I am really disappointed that they didn't last longer for that I paid for them. My Koss have lasted longer, and were cheaper.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game . It is very amusing. It very fun also. I think it is very cute and quite adorable. I think it is a great game and deserves a five star rating
B0091REZMW|4|I enjoy this game. It has been fun to play. I don't like waiting for the recharge though too slow.
B00LI9VM7W|5|Wow, Jackson at his best, no matter what period of JB you like this album is fantastic !
B008602KQI|5|Awesome movie!!!  I highly recommend it!!  I saw the movie in the theater and I've got the DVD.  Jennifer Lawrence kicks ASS!!
B00DMCV7K0|3|Entertaining, but would have preferred a bit more death into the history of the times and less prose about the story quilt.
B00GINENG0|5|It's a cute app I'd recommend it for anyone. it's fun and adorable you get to raise a little kitten up to a Tom cat. It's a great app.

B00001U03Q|3|I am not an Eric Clapton fan, but I have enjoyed the songs he has put forth from the past few years, which are on this album.  I believe you would have to be a fan to appreciate his entire collection on this album,  otherwise it's not worth getting, unless stuck in the used soundtracks  section.
B00AE6SS5O|5|To much clutter in the rooms when searching for things using a cell phone. Otherwise fun and great for a freebie!
B00992CF6W|5|Addicting and enjoyable.
B00006879E|5|I love all the songs on this CD.  It does have very sexy music.  I am not a Maroon 5 fan particular but I do love the songs &#34;She Will be Loved&#34;.
B000GFLKEY|5|So many twist and turns kept me on the edge of my seat.  fantastic movie.  I would recommend to everyone!
0151008116|5|This is truly among the best books I have ever read.  As of today, it has won the prestigious Booker Award.  The story can be read on multiple levels and can be interpreted a number of ways, but from the first page it grabs you.  Besides the tale on the high seas, you also learn about the character's life in India and about the zoo his father owns.  Among other messages here (mentioned in other reviews), is definitely an envirnmnetalist one about zoo-keeping and our responsiblity in it.  The book has left me overcome with joy, wishing to share it with everyone.  Having said all of this, I can also say that the book is an easy read and I am almost ready to give it to my 10 year old (except for the very graffic death and eating scenes of various animals) I can not say enough about this marvelous book!!
B00AIQP9DE|5|I really enjoying this game. IT is so colorful. I feel like I was in the game. I couldn't stop playing. I am waiting for part 2.
B00992CF6W|4|You cant explode TNT and you don't have switches but other wise this game is the best game i have ever played
B00AHTYGRW|3|The movie was good but I had a hard time following it because of poor sound on the disk. The action scenes were way too loud and the conversations were way too low. it was impossible to adjust between them.
B007EC27QM|5|Myost used calculator.
B000FA5STS|4|Fast-paced with enough twists to keep you turning the pages.
B007FG9LIE|5|Outstanding premise. I couldn’t put it down and finding all the answers to the burning questions at the end of the first book was refreshing. I’m almost finished reading the entire series and each book has it’s own tragedies to contend with. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5|I could n't wait for the next segment!  We watched two at a time.  Everyone felt bad when Dan Stevens died (Matthew Crowley)..  Felt like we lost a friend!<br /><br />Whoe thing was done excellently!
B00261OXUY|5|I've really gotten into The Tudors with Amazon Unbox, watched Seasons 1 and 2 within a few weeks. While it may not be entirely historically accurate, it is extremely interesting and excellent drama. Episode 10 of Season 2 was intense, to say the least. Of course, we all know that Anne Boleyn was beheaded, but the way this episode was done was extremely well acted, filmed, written, all the above. I disliked Anne from the start, she was scheming and manipulative and power hungry. But in this episode, I actually felt sorry for her. Her execution was delayed not once, but twice after she was mentally prepared for it. She watched the rest of her friends and family get beheaded, saw her father turn away from her.<br /><br />I cried and cried through the last 1/2 hour of this episode and, even when it was over, I couldn't stop crying for another 15 minutes, I found it just that intense and sad. If ever an episode and actors should have been nominated for an Emmy, this one single episode should have won hands down.<br /><br />I can't wait until The Tudors Season 3 is available for download, I'm going through withdrawals! Oh, and Henry Cavill who plays Charles Brandon has to be one of the hottest, best looking men I've ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous!
B000PMG16U|5|I don't think there's really a reason to rate the movies (you either like them or you don't), but as far as the purchase goes, I feel it was a great deal.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Liked the book better than the movie but it was still good, would recommend.
B007SYWFRM|5|this game is like petshop but I love this game more than any other. People who say this game is bad are lying. to you guess they would like to keep it to themselves but this is no waste. of time. Believe me and all the other 5 star raters.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Not enough instructions on how to remove the captured jellies. Can't find instructions..can't get off of number 40 for months!!
B003E6K1VK|5|Compact, stylish & functional is what the FiiO E7 is all about.  It is an amplifier/DAC all in one nice compact package for under a C note! Tested it out and it really brings the voice and instruments onto a wider soundstage.  Included with it is a black perfect fitting silicone skin, soft velvet pouch case, 3.5mm male connector, black rubber stretch band to mount your E7 together with your Ipod and a USB mini connector to charge your E7. Just a real nice package. The instruction manual is minimal and the writing is small. I needed a magnifying glass to read it! But the operational sequence was easy enough to figure out! I also have an Airhead amp and it also is great sounding and cost the same as the E7.  But the Airhead is not a DAC and not as high tech as the E7. It is difficult for me to hear any real difference between the two devices both sound really good. The Airhead works on 4 AAA batteries and a wall adapter transformer.  The E7 has an internal lithium rechargeable battery that can be charged by a USB port. It takes around 5 hours to completely recharge it. It is supposed to last up to 80 hours depending on the drain caused by the efficiency of the headphones you are using. I have not yet tested this number but will be trying to over the next month with my Sennheiser 600 headphones and Koss Porta pro open air headphones.  I would also like to talk about the OLED display. It is real functional and looks great. I read that this type of display burns out much faster than regular LED displays. The solution to this is to keep the display on for a minimal amount of time while listening to your music. This can be done by enabling the \\"Key Lock\\" function in Menu. It is the 4th choice when scrolling down. I set mine for 30 seconds. The display will shut off after 30 seconds. Hit and hold the Menu  button and it will unlock your E7 so you can make adjustments to your E7 once again. Seems to be a great buy but durability is something I will be testing out over the next month or two.  Hope to update my post with further info in a month or two.    UPDATE: 2/20/2011 - E7 has performed to expectations. No problems yet. Have not used it that much recently. Charged it 1 time and it seems to be efficient in power handling based on the 20 or so hours I have used it in the last 3 months.  The price has stayed the same and the other positive reviews seem pretty much in line with my views on this device. The bad reviews seem totally unjustified because the E7 does in fact amplify clean sound and does provide a bigger soundstage. The main purpose of a DAC is to correct the unnatural spatial sound produced by headphones into a more balanced overall sound as heard when \\"not\\" using headphones. I believe that this has been achieved by this portable DAC at a reasonable cost. The difference is subtle but that is what these devices do. If your phones are poor quality only much better headphones are going to make a big difference and there is a limit to that also.
0812932293|5|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.     I'm not big on reading autobiographies, but this one I really enjoyed, couldn't put it down!
B008RKIACK|1|Bad acting, cheap settings, lousy story,terrible everything!
B005LAIISA|3|This Ice Age 4 was more zany, crazy, and over-the-top than any of the earlier Ice Age movies.  Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was my most favorite and the only version I wanted to own a copy of, on DVD.<br /><br />The movie company did not make Ice Age 4: Continental Drift available to rent on the day the DVD was released so, out of impatience, I purchased a DVD copy for the sole purpose of seeing this movie for the first time.<br /><br />Even though it had outlandish geological events and crazy situations and outcomes, I still like it as my second favorite Ice Age movie because I like Manny's mammoth family, who's daughter is now a teenager, and I'm glad that the Saber Cat, Diego, finally got a female partner though, the film could have spent more time developing their relationship.<br /><br />I like the continuing concept in the series of \\"We are a herd.\\"  \\"Herds look out for each other.\\"  This aspect of the stories gives me a warm feeling inside.<br /><br />The movie may grow on me enough to compel me to keep the DVD, I purchased or, I may sell it used on Amazon Marketplace.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Love this game. Great app that will have you glued to your kindle all day.  Tends to freeze from time to time but other than that, everything else is amazing
B00AZMFJYA|4|The second in the series, Star Trek Into Darkness keeps the action coming and provides twists at just the right points.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great product Fast Shipping!!
B00E8KLWB4|5|I am still learning the game, so far I am really enjoying it.  Looking forward to learning all the secrets.
B000LC4TJ0|1|Mozart would be ashamed.  This is a desecration of a masterpiece.  The entire cast and everyone associated should be ashamed.
B004XQYBA2|5|I play sudoku a lot.  This one is a lot more intuitive than the 'free' games that are out there.  This will keep me entertained for hours and hours.  Thanks!
B0089LOG02|5|Often a very sad but also moving and uplifting story with wonderful surprises.  I fell in love with Vivian and Molly and was very sad when the book ended.....
1451627297|5|Amazing story...not only a trip back in time but to King's old writing style as well. I absolutely loved it and highly recommend to all!!
B00DPM7RJW|5|this is my all time fave book. I promise if you like love stories... this will be perfect a fit! the storyline is absolutely like no other and I didn't want it to end!!!!!
B00008GKEG|5|This is a wonderful DVD collection.  If your into the Beatles, your gonna love this.  If your not a fan, your still gonna love it.  This DVD is all about the music.  The sound quality is so good, I had to lower all volume to be able to sit in the room, even at the normal level.  The sound is just fantastic.  And talk about cleaning up the footage.  They did a great job cleaning up the video footage, normally you would expect to see lines and/or fuzz, etc.  None here.  Great job folks.<br />I highly recommend this collection.
B004FRX0MY|5|Love it!
B00005A1PR|5|This is a masterpiece!  The words have such great meaning and the music is wonderful.<br />I hope that all young ladies take the words to &quot;Video&quot; to heart.  What a powerful song.
B002DQLGHU|5|Great
0394800192|5|Great words and rhymes in this book.  It's fun to read.  When we first got this it was read over and over and over again.
B00DVKOYBM|4|Enjoy playing this game. Don't like the fact I have to power up cue to play the game.
B0007PLLQ0|1|I purchased this video, after reading about its features, thinking it was the \\"original cut, not the directors cut.  I am displeased with the video only because I was sent the directors cut vs the original score, which I may add that the directors cut has a totally different musical score thoughout the entire movie (which I do not like), many extra scenes and cut scenes from the original movie release.  There was \\"no\\" mention on the web page that this was a directors cut, thus I feel ripped off.  This is a great film for me in its original format, but very poor in the directors cut.  The company that sold it probably just wanted to get rid of these extra directors cut videos, and did not tell the truth about the movie format just to get them out of the store.  VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE
B000000P17|3|This Is NOT a \\"BAD\\" album, But even as a huge Guns N' Roses fan, I can't call this a \\"GREAT\\" Album and it is an Unfortunate way to end the legacy of \\"THE GREATEST SEX, DRUGS, & ROCK & ROLL BAND OF ALL TIME\\" So when I see other reviewers calling this album \\"Strange\\" or \\"Odd\\" I feel it is important to mention that THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT? is not what it started out to be,  S.I.? was initially intended to be a stop-gap release of a FEW Punk Covers.  This Punk [EP] was meant to be released during the long period between LIES & The USE YOUR ILLUSION album.  Jamming on some of their favorite Punk songs was supposed to be a way for the band to get focused before diving into NEW songs.  It worked (perhaps Too well).  The Band ended up with so many ideas & songs that Use Your Illusion Became 2 Albums & the [EP] was shelved only to re-emerge after the U.Y.I albums as a Full-length [LP]. <br /> <br />I think THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT? would have done much better & been better received, if it had been released as intended. As a Fun [EP] to wet our destructive appetites, And it would have been cooler if GNR had left on the much grander note of their ILLUSION epics than a comparatively  weak cover album, but who am I to complain about MORE songs...  especially now that GNR is gone  <br /> <br />But If your New to Guns N' Roses, I recommend  <br /> <br />GNR's GREATEST HITS: <br />(If you like the songs you may have heard on the  radio or seen on MTV)  <br /> <br />or  <br /> <br />APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION  <br />one of the best hard rock albums of   all time, & one of the few from the 80's that hasn't become a joke) <br /> <br />...& I know GNR isn't gone but I consider what Axl is doing a completely different animal        <br /> <br />  ....................................CHINESE DEMOCRACY NOW!!!
0739341243|2|This pop psychologist is not a psych by training at all; she's an extremely biased, opinionated lawyer.  Big strike one.  Then the first track immediately repulses me in raising the Rosa Parks civil rights incident as if that has anything to do with psychological advice or introversion.  I don't want to hear about civil rights -- that's an entirely different subject.  I want to hear scientific, evidential insight into introversion, period.  She is unqualified to do so, obviously.  Huge strike two.  Then shortly thereafter she starts slamming extroverts and society in general by broadly painting them as psyco-bullies toward introverts, as if we're helpless wallflowers.  Big strike three.  And then she declares that Al Gore, among others, is an introvert.  Are you serious?!  No, he's an extrovert (as any alpha male/female politician naturally must be) that happens to have intellectual curiosity in his favored subject.  Susan Cain is a exploitative fraud, which is natural for lawyers.  And I should know; I'm a paralegal.
B008P1EWIM|4|All you need to have to sleep by. Easy to use, the price is great. Enjoy your slumber and rest well.
B00PTB7B34|5|This game is easy and fun to play
B00A0R42L6|5|Another one a big thumbs up
B005EYP8PO|5|The best U2 album by far and one of the best of all time in a great 2CD edition, really worth it.<br />If you can't buy the super deluxe edition, this is the best solution.
B00AFEY354|5|One of the best movies I have seen this year. Emma Watson is incredible, as usual. This movie is a must see.
B004SJ3BCI|1|Grandson likes it, but I've found that Angry Birds makes for angry kids.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I just got this game and I can not stop I have to play it some more
B00AKEMHCA|5|Great game, easy to learn, andvery addictive! Thereare many levels to choose from, never boring, lots of action and challenges.
0143035711|4|This was a great and interesting read. It had a few dry parts but usually rebounded fairly quickly. If you're just looking for a general Vietnam War read I'd recommend The Killing Zone by Frederick Downs over Chickenhawk.<br /><br />Chickenhawk was a great look into the amount of training that went into the Vietnam War and the events that unfolded during.
B00ISJSK7K|5|I am a fan of these movies so they really cant do any wrong in my book. So this probably wont be the most helpful and objective reviews. But the quality was fantastic as was the acting. I don't even mind much about the incredible creative licenses that they took with the story line.
B0011Z51QG|5|Nice quality product.
B006LSZECO|4|Looking forward to the movie.  The ending was kind of a copout, however.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Great game. Cant stop playing it. Wish it was a little easyer to upgrade (import times,price,ect.) But besides that great game
B004HWYTP4|5|Good movie.
B005MJ883K|5|Super fantastic
B0020BUWX2|5|The story is tough but at the same is very easy reading and the author keeps you looking for more. Definitely reading the second part.
0060254920|5|I bought this book new because it was my favorite book when I was a child, and I didn't receive many books, but this one stood out!  I loved how imagination made the boys room become a jungle and I loved how he wasn't afraid of these monsters because they were nice.
B00MCC6UR6|4|I couldn't put the game down. It was challenging, but not too hard. I highly recommend this game. Very fun.
B007PVHMCG|5|It is exactly was I was looking for and could not find in any store. My grandson was very happy with it.
B000024KRO|5|I'm not familiar with the songs in this album, but it sounds great, just like the old albums of Deep Purple.<br />Love this album
B006I1OB0U|5|Downton Abbey Christmas Special is exactly that, something special. I like the direction, the camera angles, the sets and the actors. Is the dialog perfect, generally yes. Are the lines delivered well yes. The costumes look fine too. I like the characters too. I have read some other reviews of the first two seasons and it struck me that  they we good with one or too criticisms about knit picking things like dialog phrases. I say to the few glitches I can live with them as I do not live in a perfect world. People who make such criticisms are people who cannot do what they are commenting on. It is a good story, great character development, pleasing to look at and listen to.<br /><br />The story itself takes place at the turn of the twentieth century and continues to 1920 where the Christmas Special concludes; a 10 year period. It is a family's story in a time when family included not just relatives but their hired hands-servants, butlers, cooks and drivers. The family has a master and a mistress of the house with their three daughters. Each character has a matching servant. In a time when masters and mistresses were good they were very good. My family had a disaster and the owner of the large company my father worked for in the 1950's, he helped our family as well as many others. This is similar story on film.<br /><br />Like Gone With the Wind it is a tale about a nation's society, its people and all the ups and downs both move through. There are so many characters you have plenty of time to select your favorite. Like the true classic movies of the thirties, forties and fifties you could listen just to the sound track and it would work. The visuals add to this wonderfully entertaining story.<br /><br /> It is not finished at the Christmas Special as the story leaves us on one happy note and one continuing story line. In a day where entertainment is mindless sex,violence and abnormality this film is a delightful change to what a real movie should be. There is sex, some violence (WWI), love and deception and goodness. So sit back and enjoy this masterpiece.
0316044695|5|Great book.  Another book with a higher price for the Kindle version when compared to the paperback.  What crap.

B0087GF8ZG|1|We purchased this product in hopes of it turning on when the baby, to alert us, or us, checking on the baby, moved around it. This product would occasionally turn on but only at night with no other lights on. Also, it is extremely bright and harsh for a &#34;night light&#34;.
B00KWNQTXM|5|This is a cute game.  I loved it.  Unfortunately I bought a new Kindle and my game info erased but I got my boyfriend into it and he loves it!
0380789035|5|Awesome transaction! Arrived quickly! Great book... Huge Neil Gaiman fan!
B00005K9LN|5|\\"British Steel\\" was a major hit for the band and will forever be one of the most important works in the long discography of the metal titans. The disc contains classic heavy hitters like \\"Grinder\\",\\"Living After Midnight\\" or \\"Breaking The Law\\". Those songs alone are reason for puchasing the record, which is considered by many as the finest work of the Birmingham Priests.

B004ZMWUCU|5|Excellent writing and character development.  Sad moments, but<br />a good read nonetheless.
0743455967|5|I have only ever read one of King's novels, when I was about nine years old. I don't remember much about it, only that I was scared stiff, and that reading it under the bed covers with a torch was probably not a good idea. Since then, his work has never really appealed, but this book has changed my mind - if his novels are as good as his non-fiction, they would be worth the effort.<br />This first third of this book is a brief background of King's life - his chaotic childhood, his menial jobs and teaching before his breakthrough, and a very honest opinion of his battles with addiction.<br />The main section of the book is taken up with how King writes. He writes this part as a how-to, but it can also be taken as an insight into how a successful author does his thing. A lot of how he does it differs from the traditional how-to-write guides, but it seems to work. I really like the idea of not using outlines and plots, but working on uncovering 'the fossil' as you go. <br />The last section tells of King's life-threatening accident. It reads as a very harrowing ordeal, but King infuses this part with the humour used throughout the book.<br />An interesting, funny and inspiring read for want-to-be authors and appreciators of good writing alike.
B004J4WLPU|4|Liked it a lot...would really give it 4 1/2 stars
B002G1YPH0|5|Cools my i5 2500K OCed to 4.9 GHZ with no issues under 100% load, just make sure you use a good thermal compound and clean both surfaces with alcohol 90% or higher.
B00CHSPB8Y|4|Game is fun and addicting. only down side is it takes a lot of playing time to unlock everything. some times freezes and you gotta re boot. over all a good time saving the world as Iron Man!
B0054JZC6E|5|this game provides lots of varity and is really cool it works great on my kindle fire my brother love it
B005LAIIRQ|5|The special effects in this movie are outstanding!!!  Liam Neeson is a great actor.  He is absolutely fantastic in this movie!!!
B00006JSS8|5|This might be the best \\"best of\\" album I have ever had.  Truly an album full of hits.
B00FAPF5U0|5|The best game ever since the last time I had to go back to the same appstore
B008RNGCAO|4|20 years ago I bought these comics. Great to get them back in digital. Worth buy. Jean Paul Valley rocks.
B004U8VUUC|4|Because I thought the story was compelling and the acting superb; also the surprise though terribly sad ending.<br /><br />Sorry Im sick and have no more words!
B003WUYR6I|5|Very fast moving. Loved the suspense. Couldn't put it down. But I only see Matt as the Lincoln Lawyer now. Not sure I could ever accept another actor if there are future<br />Movies.
B00CHIMG6Y|3|I love true stories and this was a story of triump, but they kept showing the pain & hurt over and over again, wrenching your heart.  It was hard to watch.<br /><br />Fortunately it has a happy ending.
B00G6Q29KQ|5|Wow!  Simply mesmerizing!  I was so happy book 3 was finally released!  I couldn't put it down.  A perfect blend of entertainment, real world happenings and spiritual awakenings, elude to a world that really hits home. I simply love the portals, time control, the general style of how the story is told.  Brandt Legg is by far among the top 5 of my favorite authors list!  It would not be hard to admit that I would read anything this author releases!  I'm not a big reader, so that is a huge compliment from me.  I generally have a really hard time finding an author's writing style and story line captivating enough for me to get more than 3 or 4 pages into before I lose interest, and yes, that even includes world famous authors.  He's also an amazing photographer as well.  If you haven't yet, you should definitely look him up on Facebook and follow him!
B008XBHIEY|5|Watch it all the time. My son's obsessed!
B00KIZ9F8K|5|great cd
B0054YH7DA|5|the great cd i was missing
B009LH1Y1W|5|This program is great to watch.  The relationship between brothers is very interesting and their adventures together make it fun.  I enjoy the humor that happens once in a while in the episodes and look forward to the next chapter at the end of each episode.
B0063IH60K|3|I realize that free apps come with ads but these are quite annoying.  It is intuitive to use once you get into the game.
B009AMAGXK|4|I didn't realize that this was adapted from a book until after I rented and watched the movie. I then read the reviews and noticed that most people who are disappointed or downright hated the movie have read the book and didn't like the adaptation. Having not read the book I can honestly say that as a stand alone movie it was enjoyable. It was beautiful to watch, had a great cast, fantastic costumes (Ridley's was the best), and all around fun story. I would have given it 3.5 stars but since that isn't an option I enjoyed it enough to adjust up. It seemed to be lacking in depth but I don't watch obviously fantasy romance for deep meaning and life lessons.<br /><br />The only real complaint I might have is that as much as I love Jeremy Irons and his performance, his voice is so distinctly British and try as he may he does not get rid of enough of his accent for the Southern drawl to sound anything but a strange cross between the two. Emma Thompson, on the other hand, is wonderful in her accent and character.
B004VMVTNU|5|Great alat
B0001US62I|5|I love the extended version of this film. The plot of this film had me going, all the way until the very end, and then I was like &#34;Wow, that's messed up&#34;. But, in a good way. Lisa Bonet did a good job in this film as well. It's a good thing that I believe in karma and try very hard not to do anything that'll come back and bite me in my hind-end. This is one film, of several,  that will always be a cult-classic favorite of mine.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is very addicting but I can't update it with the amazon appstore so I'm forever stuck in 0.5.0. Butthis game is truy exceptional
B0047Y0FGY|4|but didn't love it as much as Jenny Lawson or Mindy Kaling. Still worth the read, but I wasn't as anxious to finish as with the other ones. Definitely funny though. My favorite section was about her Dad and what a badass he is!
B000006MS3|5|One thing about the majority of Kate Bush fans is that they will take anything she gives and praise it as the best thing she's done. I just don't understand the wide-eyed droves that offer that blind praise. But for the discriminating fan of more than 25 years, that being me, The Dreaming is leaps and bounds above anything Kate has done in the past 25 years.<br /><br />Back in 1986, my sister brought over a VHS tape of The Whole Story and recommended I give it a look. I remembered Kate's name from the early 80's, having seen 'The Dreaming' on a TV show called MV3, though the song didn't stick with me at the time. I watched The Whole Story tape and was immediately struck by the insane 'Sat In Your Lap' video, and the bizarre 'The Dreaming', which now made an impression on me. Upon repeated viewings, additional songs caught me. I bought some of the albums I could find at the time, but The Dreaming was one of the last I found, and was the one I was most eager to hear. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />What can I say, but this album is infested with creativity all over the place. But the buying public was already a little weary of this album, and it's known for being Kate's lowest selling album at the time. Even the singles released made very little impact, despite their creativity. 'Sat In Your Lap' was already a year old when the album was released, but opens it nicely. Though the single charted just outside of the UK top ten, further singles faltered. 'The Dreaming', with its durge-like sound and Kate's strange Australian accent, rambling nearly unintelligible lyrics (luckily, the album came with lyrics), charted outside of the UK top forty, and a planned 12 inch single mix of the song was shelved, (is it still in the EMI vaults??). By the release of the playful 'There Goes A Tenner', buyers stayed away and the single failed to chart. But time has been very kind to The Dreaming, and it remains a true fan favorite.<br /><br />Kate doesn't sacrifice the beauty that her voice can offer entirely for the sake of being odd, as displayed in the breathtaking 'Night of the Swallow'. Kate's vocal range and musical diversity know no bounds, and she presents the Gothic tinged 'Leave It Open', and better yet, 'Get Out Of My House'. She screams, wails, and turns into a mule, accompanied by some pretty amazing drumming. And thankfully for fans, Kate produced a total of 4 music videos for the album, 'Suspended in Gaffa', as well as 'There Goes A Tenner', could be viewed on an earlier VHS release, The Single File. But not everything on The Dreaming works for me. 'All The Love' and 'Pull Out The Pin' do tend to get on my nerves.<br /><br />Kate Bush would hit her worldwide commercial peak with Hounds of Love in 1985. And while that is a great album, all of her future releases would start moving into a safe Adult Contemporary zone, to the point of being virtually unlistenable. What a shame. Perhaps if The Dreaming was more of a commercial success, Kate would have continued channeling those carefree spirits, and we could have had more music of such diversity. But let me finish this review by stating what some of the ignorant state about any new Kate offering that comes their way: This is Kate's masterpiece!
B006P0FIGU|5|It really sticks to the book!!! Soo many good looking guys, yum yum!!! Add in a dash of humor and you have a great movie!!
0425256391|5|Loved it and so sorry for the series to end. I would recommend this series to any who enjoy fantasy and fun. Amazon always shipped quickly and it arrived in excellent condition.
0810983915|5|I bought this book for my son, he loves this series. He has the full series and reads them over and over. he has also watched the movies. This really opened up a world of reading to him.
B00HGJ18C2|5|I love this Solitare.  I am playing for hours it's so fun, except you can't always see the score.  But no matter, I'm playing just for fun!
B006AZZPCM|1|This app was nice at first now it crashes all the time now. I wish Amazon would just get an official YouTube app. This app is really not worth the frustration
B00GX598FO|4|Good movie,  worth watching. Didn't think that it was as good as the first one, but was still a good movie.
B00003CWPL|5|I am surprised that this film seems to be embraced by the mainstream. Who would have guessed?<br /><br />Well, if you are open to mind-bending, expirimental, dark art, then this is among the creme of the crop. Eraserhead is one of those films that may mean different things to different folk.<br /><br />Me, as a simpleton I pretty much just enjoy the dark visuals and sort of apply them to my own dreams and experiences. I can see the argument that it tackles the fears, changes and sacrifice involved in becoming a parent, but prefer to see it as meaningless in the most meaningful way imaginable.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I have never been a big reader - it has to be good if it can hold my attention. I love this series. They are three of very few books I have read that I could not put down!
B00DR0PDNE|4|I love it! I love how I can stream anything from my computer. Downside is that I was under the impression that I could show more things from my phone when it can only do a few select things from my phone.
B00ARAO720|3|Nothing spectacular about this movie.  Enjoyable and worth the $4 I paid to watch.  Action was OK and so was the plot.
B005Q1W10A|5|This series is absolutely awesome. I love everything about it! I have all 3 series and couldn't stop watching. Can't wait for season 4!!!
B006ON41FC|1|I really enjoy this game. This is a distance game where you must fly as far as you can while collecting nuts and achieving goals along the way. The music goes quite well with the speed of the game, being of the country/rock variety, and the sounds are adequate. The graphics are really nicely done, with bright colors all around and good color choices on different objects and obstacles. The game never gets frustratingly difficult, and I played for hours before my phone needed a recharge.  The game does have some flaws that impact my score for it, and they're mostly due to the interface. For starters, there are no tilt controls. In this type of game, tilt controls would benefit steering the squirrel greatly. Instead, you're stuck using the left and right sides of the screen for input. Since you can select power ups while flying, tilt control would freed up your fingers to use them instead of having to choose between flying left or using a crash helmet. You can't set anything up from a main options screen; everything is scattered. For example, you can't turn off the sounds or music from anywhere but in the flying part of the game, and you can't opt out of Open Feint till after it logs you in and starts collecting data. I really don't like OF, but at least other games ask if you want to use it instead of just using it without asking. Even checking achievements loads OF. Why couldn't this just be done in-game? Lastly, the power ups seem sparse. The squirrel has a very bad turn speed, so I was hoping there would at least be an outfit or gear that increased agility or speed, but all the outfits appear to be only cosmetic, and the gear focuses on nut collection, distance boosting, and collision with obstacles.  Again, I really enjoy this game. I haven't had any freeze-ups or crashes in it like many other games do, and the game is really fun to play. The stars off from 5 are -1 for poorly-designed interface, and -1 for no up-front opt out of Open Feint. It's really a shame there are so many simple-to-fix problems with the interface that could have made this a 5-star game in my book.  UPDATE: On my third time playing the game I was once again logged into Open Feint involuntarily. This was the third time I've had to delete the OF account because the game started it without my input other than launching the game. The game also asked me to rate it twice in one game. Because of the Open Feint problem and the constant rating nag screens I've deemed this game unfit to remain on my phone. Unless the developers start hearing the cries of their customers and remove the nag screens and Open Feint problem this game will not get anything past 1 star from me (down from 3 before the update to this review).
B00JNQMKT6|2|Just not my kind of book.
1615230823|5|This book dissects what factors create a successful person.  Gladwell admits that there must be a minimum of inate ability which exceeds the average, but he demonstrates that ability alone cannot guarantee success.  Other factors that affect success are family background, ethnicity, persistence, practice, and luck.  Being born at the right place at the right time has as much to do with success as education.  This is luck pure and simple. As a student of statistics I know that one can cite statistics to support any theory.  One just chooses particular statistics.  Gladwell's theories are interesting and thought provoking but should not be taken as the gospel. His theories dictate different solutions for educational dilemmas.  Here , however, is an example of a fallacy.  He determines that every music maestro completes 10,000 hours of practice. An ordinary musical performer will complete 6000 hours and music teachers will complete 4000 hours.  He deduces that every highly successful person has engaged in 10,000 hours of practice in his/her chosen field. Gladwell concludes that 10,000 hours of practice is the path to success. But he cannot address the issue of whether or not a more talented musician tends to practice more.  Perhaps, the more talented musician derives more pleasure out of his production and thus is induced to practice more hours.  So does the mastery come from practice or does the practice arise from the talent.  There is no way to separate these threads and Gladwell does not attempt to do so. Perhpas, they are too entwined to be separated.  If you read this book for other theories of what makes people successful but not for rules set in stone, you will be satisfied and rewarded.  Clearly, the implications his theories have for closing the gap between the poor and the rich in schools is itself worth the read.  Still without this analysis most people would agree that a longer school day, more homework, and shorter summer vacations will increase poor children's learning.  He does not address how that same formula would affect rich children's learning.  That is the fallacy.  Still this is an easy breezy read about the social phenomenon of success.
B001DJLD1M|1|Not what I expected and not what I ordered 100% crap!!!!!

B000W1YYYA|2|It's cool that there are so many reviews (mine'll make 100) regarding this CD. Most are enthusiastic, and that's cool, too. But those recommending this work should be more up-front with themselves and others that what they love about the \\"raw emotion\\" et cetera is really in the vocals and lyrics. The music itself is substandard, and folks, I grew up as a punk guy (Dead Kennedies, et al) and musical proficiency is still NOT a priority for me.     Positive reviewers should realize that the negative reviewers are probably more \\"in tune\\" with the lack of hooks or other non-lyrical proficiency on this CD (with the exception of \\"Teclo\\"). Put another way, this CD is not \\"accessible\\" and it's probably why the enthusiasm level is so high amongst many reviewers. It's different, even from PJ Harvey's other works. So please continue to recommend it but try to put an \\"advisory\\" or give background on your musical preferences.     My take? The lyrics are very spiritual (PJ for or against God) so I'd listen to it in a car to think about it. But as background music, like now when I'm typing at a computer, I'd never play this CD.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I just started playing today and it's green fun so far! Sliding puzzles are my favorite!
B000XUBFE2|5|A great book with a different perspective of the life between the Germans and Jews through the years of WW II.
B007S3S8HO|4|my son had fun assembling it but was more interested in throwing the birds at the piggies then using the slingshot- he didn't have the strength to squeeze the birds off of it. He loves the fact that there are cars to roll the piggies around.

B00GPWEPZ8|5|great  movie
B00A8ECU24|4|It's fun and addictive, the only problem is when you play connect the stars, the timer starts right away even when you didnt touch anything and if you finish a split second before the timer is up it will show you the score you might have won, then it flips and gives you a lower score, change that and I'll give it 5 stars.
B005LAIHPY|5|For a week now I've had a Vizio P702ui TV connected to a Marantz SR5009 receiver  hooked up to 2 Martin Logan Motion 40 speakers with an Oppo 103d blu-ray player. How is it? Fabulous. The Oppo is connected to the Marantz so the video and sound from the Oppo pass through the Marantz. The sound and picture quality is excellent. Blu-ray movies look and sound great and all my computer-burned video CD'S play no matter what the file format. I'm using the HDMI ARC connection i.e. audio return channel between the Vizio TV and the Marantz. It didn't work for awhile until I figured out how to configure the TV and the Marantz for ARC then it worked fine. I love it!
B002ZG98UA|3|there's not a whole lot to say. It's another resident Evil movie. Not exactly the greatest but you know still good.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Amazing journey, a must read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This app is the most amazing game I've downloaded on my kindle fire hd .<br />  I couldn't have imagined this game to be the real deal.
B008JGSM6G|5|This game has a simple concept that starts out simple but gets more complex as you progress.  A good way to relax and challenge your mind.
B00DPM7TIG|4|An insightful look at the horrors of WWII through a number of different perspectives. Engaging characters.
0425098478|5|For any new manager, team leader or supervisor this is a MUST read. This  book will also serve you well in many of your relationships both on and off  the job.  Well worth the cost and well worth your time to read.  Could be a  life changing read.
B004FOA84A|5|love this game played it on brothers game so fun and mysterious lol love thank goodness they made this game
630241380X|5|I certainly agree with the other glowing reviews of this movie but I would like to say that it is not simply the best western ever produced, it is, in  my opinion, the best movie ever produced. I have seen it approximately 10  times and it is just as good each time as it was the first time. Rober  Duval's acting is as good as it gets. Tommy Lee Jones is at his finest. The  music is superb. The cimematography is excellent. The story is masterfully  crafted and is based largely on real life characters. Charles Goodnight was  the real life model for Woodrow Call and Oliver Loving, Goodnight's  partner, was the model for Augustus McCrae. Duval, in playing McCrae,  brings to life the character of the gallant old ranger and lover of all  women with a degree of perfection of art that is unsurpassed in the history  of movie making.
B007FEFLTO|5|You will be on the edge of your seat with this book and learning a lot of WWII history!  The writing is just phenomenal!  Looking forward to reading the third of the triology!
6305166021|5|Cutting edge.  Energy squared. Lawrence Welk cubed
B0008ENICU|5|Being a Rosalind Russell fan I knew I was going to be pleased.  It was very interesting watching a full length movie and not seeing one male throughout the entire movie. Though filmed in black and white, the fashion show was a total surprise!  It is well worth the money spent.
B00V4JKT52|1|Pointless movie, hard to finish, not worth the money.
B008Z9YLV2|3|It was OK. Another post-apocalyptic thriller with minute revisions of the same old theme: Roman bread and circuses to calm the hordes, good poor folk, bad rich men. Reminded me of the TV show \\"Lost\\" except no fat guy. The girl, however, shot a mean arrow.
B00F1BFRA6|5|Starts slow but builds to a great cliffhanger. Highclere Castle provides a stunning backdrop to the series. Great performances from Dame Maggie, Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Brendan Coyle, as usual. Creator Julian Fellowes is quickly becoming my favorite &#34;content provider&#34;. Can't wait for the next series which begins filming in January. There has been some criticism that it recycles storylines from Upstairs, Downstairs, but as I haven't seen it...doesn't bother me.
B0063GORYU|5|This is a great app! It works great with no hangups and it is enjoyable to play. Great graphics as well!
B00IK1J9QM|5|Brilliant as usual
B00003CX8N|5|If you enjoy clever dialogue this is the movie for you. These two do a great job of portraying their parts.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Another over-the-top work by Moriarty. There are, admittedly, similarities in plot and characters to Big Little Lies --- but they work. Poignant and heartbreaking, but redeeming nonetheless .... And one hell of a good read!
030758836X|5|A best seller for obvious reasons. Well written & great story. Actually surprised me towards the end.
B003XKPPOU|5|I was kinda iffy when I heard about Toy Story 3. But Pixar has never really let me down. Upon viewing the movie, I knew I was right. The movie's brilliant.
6305910340|4|Interesting story about a real-life, well known chess player, plus some insights into father/son relationships.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|this book was great, start to finish. characters were so well done and the plot was delish! Liane has outdone herself!
B0014CDKVY|4|Spoiler Alert!<br />While the movie veers from the book, (especially in the ending), this is perhaps the best post apocalyptic movie that I've seen in years, if not ever. Will Smith portrays a scientist who was responsible for finding a cure to a virus that had spread throughout the world.  This virus turned people (and animals) into a type of Zombie/Vampire. Unfortunately the good doctor didn't find the cure and civilization was pretty much destroyed.  I love that they showed a typical day in the life of this doctor. While the movie is packed with action created by the zombie/vampires, it takes the time to show how he survives from day to day. His existence is better than most survivors that are portrayed in these types of movies until an event occurs which throws him into a careless rage bringing his carefully crafted existence into dire jeopardy. I also love the zombie/vampire creatures.  They are quick, incredibly scary looking and intelligent.  They are the scariest virus victims of any movie that I've ever seen. I truly hope if anything like this ever occurs in real life that the monsters are nothing like the ones depicted in this film!  I am hoping for the slow, unthinking, unintelligent zombie of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; or &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; - certainly not the kind depicted in this movie.
B005OCHOZS|5|Inspirational! As a vegan and recreational runner myself. Knowing a super human like Scott Jurek chose to be a Vegan is very reassuring and inspirational.
B0049VZ222|5|Everything was great.The acting,directing & writing ect...
B0091V6TF4|5|fantastic......its lots of fun to hear all the many james bond hits that were released throughout the many years of james bond films.....everyone from Shirley bassey and tom jones to rita cooligde and Gladys knight
0785163174|2|I desperately wanted to like this story, but it fell far below the bar of anything solid.  The sole purpose of this book is just to have our heroes duke it out.  I loved the Marvel vs DC Amalgam match ups back in the 90's when I was ten and story and character didn't matter.  I expect a lot more out of Marvel, especially with all the talent they have on board.  Too many characters mindlessly fighting, no real attempts at resolving the issues peaceably, and frustrating ideologies contribute to a lackluster event.  I think Marvel needs to spend more time developing quality villains so they don't have to resort to more hero vs hero infighting.  Again.  I never became invested in any of the characters, just frustrated that they were all acting stupidly.  At least those possessed with the Phoenix Force had an excuse.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a complete waste of space; just fights with no purpose.  Luckily they read fast because my attention was barely there at that point.  The one redeeming quality is the art.  John Romita, Jr., Oliver Coipel, and Adam Kubert deliver some amazing art.  Save your money.
B00J2PCCYQ|5|Best movie disney has made in awhile. I enjoyed watching it just as much as the kids did. You will not regret getting this movie.

B000FA675C|5|Dan Brown is like a master cook. After intense research he gathers piles of data and pokes, seasons and creates  a believable  yarn. Even if you don't have a passion for fun puzzles, you will still have a great time getting caught up in the action.
B0000AQVCL|1|The only good song on this album is &quot;Cold hard bitch&quot;.  The rest of it totally sucks.  The lyrics in the other songs are as terrible as the gay music.  I mean come on...they put out a kick ass song like cold hard bitch and then pussified the rest of the album...then this guy has a hard on for ranting about DJ's cuz they &quot;spin other peoples songs&quot;...give me a break and save your pussification of an album for nickelback or creed.  Then the song &quot;Timothy&quot; starts out with him again trying to sing a slow ballad which his voice is NOT made to do, and as it cracks while he moans Timothy like a depressed gay lover I almost puked up my lunch.  Thank god I was close to the &quot;next track&quot; button or I probably would have commenced the up-chucking.  This album is an example of why I do not buy CD's anymore and just burn them from others or download free music.  If I could give this disc less than 1-star I would.  Sucks ass.  Don't buy this album.
B00C74SHRK|5|I cannot give Donna Tartt less than 5 stars for this tour de force. The book can also not be summarized or boxed or easily put in some literary genre. But let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />For the first 60% of the book I literally could not put down my Kindle. (Sorry, my Kindle does not have page numbers, only gives percentages of how far I am with it). Normally this \\"story of a boy\\" (at the start) would not fascinate me so much, but for almost two-thirds of the book Tartt is on a roll and I rolled with her.  That part is brilliant and keeps you enthralled.  Well, it did that for me.<br /><br />I do not want to go into the story -- I believe the paper book has 800 pages (?) -- as it is a very convoluted tale. And in spite of the 5 stars I gave it, the fairly densely-written story dipped towards some tedium two-thirds through. I found that parts of this intensely-researched book tended to the obscure and the unbelievable. It is as if the author is lecturing the reader on art -- both with regard to old furniture and Old Masters paintings.<br /><br />(I say \\"intensely-researched\\" ... yet some bits did not make sense. In the timeline of the main character's life at 13 iPods did not exist, and not every child -- if any! -- had a cellphone. Being in South Africa, I cannot comment on possible inconsistencies regarding the descriptions of Las Vegas, New York, buildings, apartments, etc.)<br /><br />Where the story bogged down for me was when characters appeared (later in the book) who were scruffy, immoral criminals from the murky world of art smuggling, yet they knew so much (so eloquently!) about art and painting itself. This part of Tartt's telling of the tale --  it moves across Europe too -- becomes somewhat obscure and hard to follow, and was certainly not completely credible -- for me. (I must, however, take for granted that the author would have done her research on this underworld as well)!  Things deteriorate for Theo and Boris in this underworld of art smuggling, and there is even a Mafia-like shoot-out in a parking garage -- all about a painting -- which was like some scene from a 40's movie.<br /><br />The main character, Theo Decker, is a kind of anti-hero, awkward in his relationships with people and too often monosyllabic at important times, so the reader feels like giving him a kick and saying, \\"For heaven's sake, get on with it! Say it!\\"  His relationships with women come across as equally awkward, and not very convincing even when he is engaged. Why did he get engaged?  He is not in love with the girl, and seems to have done it for the sake of her mother -- who fostered him for a while. Having lost his own mother in such a shocking way, it is understandable that he has empathy for this older lady; subconsciously he is forever mourning his dead mother ... but this is never properly articulated. Theo often seems melancholy and a sense of fun, humour and sparkle is not part of his personality --  except now and then when he's on some drug.<br /><br />Long parts of the story are too long and too detailed. Donna Tartt obviously polished her thoughts and her style -- word for word this tale is perfectly thought out, perfectly written -- and sometimes perfectly obscure. The last (many) pages at the end consist of Theo's philosophical treatise on life and its possible meanings, also as it relates to his own life -- but honestly, Donna, I so got the impression that that was your own voice intruding on Theo's narrative, and that you were also lecturing your readers.<br /><br />Donna's shining intellect is impressive ... often I found myself re-reading sentences, paragraphs and utterances, and still not understanding what the author was actually trying to say.<br /><br />However -- this book kept me glued to my Kindle, and if you don't mind a few frazzled brain cells, read this book. Apart from my niggles above, it is a brilliantly-written book.a-like shoot-out in a parking garage -- all about a painting -- which was like some scene from a 40's movie.

1843793792|5|Having read and listened to a number of Georgette Heyer books, all in a row, now, I am happy to report that this abridged version of Venetia does very well in the capable hands of Naxos and in the excellent reading by Richard Armitage. The editing didn't take away from the charming story, Naxos used very tasteful musical interludes, and who, I ask you, could resist listening to that deep, sensual voice of heart-throb Armitage? What is not to like? Only problem I had was I kept visualizing Armitage (who does a superior job with all the characters) as the very desirable rake Lord Damerel, and wishing somehow that this was a movie. Armitage's agent has simply got to get him into more romantic roles--he would have been great in Jane Eyre or Pride & Prejudice, or another other brooding leading man role. Meanwhile, I'll rush out for the other Heyer audio book he's done. I think these are great books for audio production. Heyer was incredibly prolific, and the fact that every public library has dozens of her books circulating very nicely after all these years is a testament to this pedestrian housewife's talent for producing a good read. Naxos does an excellent job in translating the novel to audio. More please.
B00DR0PDNE|5|i bought the chromecast with the specific intention of using it to stream from my nas media library. i waited until recently to get one because i wanted to make sure the android apps were available to meet my needs. as it turns out, i found two apps to do this perfectly: NAS Cast ($1.67) and LocalCast (free with paid ad removal). now i can stream all my local content without having to fire up the ps3!<br /><br />as an added bonus, i received my chromecast on the first day of the coachella music festival, which was streamed live all weekend on youtube. using my chromebook, i cast the youtube live feed to the chromecast and enjoyed free, live music all weekend!<br /><br />ok, bottom line. everyone interested in a chromecast has a pretty good idea of what it can do. with the potential of this device, the price tag makes it an easy choice over roku, wd live, or appletv. i'm considering adding one of these to every tv in my house! the cost of a couple more is about the same as i used to pay every month for cable tv, and with the ever-increasing compatibility of the chromecast with media sites and services, this thing could very easily become the main media delivery device in my home.

B0027WNRJ0|4|Look at any list of all-time greatest albums and you're likely to find two from the Def Leppard catalogue: 1983's Pyromania and 1987's near-perfect Hysteria. Now, prior to their Mutt Lange-produced breakthrough in '83, the band released two warm-up albums, and since Hysteria, have gone on to release about a half dozen discs of new material, a b-side disc, a covers album, and a couple greatest hits collections. Like a lot of bands, their star has dimmed quite a bit since their late-eighties heyday, even as they continue to fill modest arenas on their semiannual tours.<br /><br />Once in a while I come across their 1992 release Adrenalize in some bargain bin somewhere with a sticker that says $1.99 or something. The Hysteria follow-up was years in the making, an even longer gap than the epic one that spanned Pyromania and Hysteria. Adrenalize had its share of hits--not a bad accomplishment in the shadow of 90s grunge. \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" was a fun song that threw in everything but the kitchen sink. Lep fans ate it up. There were other singles that fared well after that: \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\", and \\"Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)\\". But obviously the album never earned that classic earmark that the band's previous two releases enjoy, but it almost could have.<br /><br />Adrenalize has a weak side one and a solid side two. Side two, to this day, is listenable start to front: \\"Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)\\" kicks it off, then the harder \\"Personal Property\\", followed by the single \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\", then the Sugary \\"I Wanna Touch U\\", and finally the re-recorded Hysteria-session b-side \\"Tear It Down\\". Good stuff one through five.<br /><br />Side one doesn't fare quite so well. \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" was a good first single at the time and kicks off the album with an in-your-face barrage of wall-of-sound nonsense, but as years go on this song, a staple at concerts, is when I make my bathroom run. That being said, I loved it at the time and still accept it as pop fun. \\"Heaven Is\\" is just okay, and \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", the second single, is forgettable at the very least and even sillier than the first single. \\"Tonight\\" is a flat ballad that never leaves the starting gate, and \\"White Lightning\\" is an attempt at an epic song the likes of \\"Gods of War\\", but again, the song evaporates and never quite imprints on the brain the way a good song should.<br /><br />What's strange is that the singles, released on CD, were backed with really cool b-side tracks. The worst of the bunch was \\"Only After Dark\\", the cover tune paired with \\"Let's Get Rocked\\". But it got good from there. Later singles came packaged with \\"Two Steps Behind\\", which later became a nice little hit for the band when it appeared on a movie soundtrack a couple years later, the sandpaper-harsh \\"She's Too Tough\\", the ballad \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", and the Sweet cover \\"Action\\". I filled up a blank tape with these tracks and pretty much had Adrenalize side three, and it was the best side of them all.<br /><br />Which got me thinking: did the band put the wrong tracks on the album? How different--and better--would the lineup have been if this had been the track listing (replacement songs in italics):<br />SIDE ONE:<br />1)  Let's Get Rocked<br />2)  She's Too Tough<br />3)  Two Steps Behind<br />4)  Action<br />5)  Miss You in a Heartbeat<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />6)  Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)<br />7)  Personal Property<br />8)  Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad<br />9)  I Wanna Touch You<br />10)  Tear It Down<br /><br />Now, the slick pop assault of \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" is followed with a stripped down screamer, with Joe Elliot's vocals razor blade raw as ever. Then \\"Two Steps Behind\\" as the album's signature ballad. And since we know it's a hit, the song gives the album a lift of credibility. \\"Action\\" is a cover, but that's okay. Who says covers have to be b-sides? The song is not a familiar one to a lot of non-Sweet fans, and it's a catchy substitute for \\"Make Love Like a Man\\". This could have been the second single. \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" end side one with another ballad. Now those other four songs become b-side extras, where they belong. And we're getting closer to a classic album.<br /><br />The fact that Adrenalize only offers ten tracks always felt a bit short, especially when fans waited five long years after the epic 12 tracks of Hysteria. Consider the fact that \\"Tear It Down\\" isn't really even a new track, and the album gets even skinnier. \\"Tear It Down\\", by the way, is a great song, and although it helps Adrenalize quite a bit, the truth is it belonged on Hysteria in place of \\"Excitable\\". So maybe then it needed an 11th track to give it some heft: maybe \\"Fractured Love\\", which later appeared on their b-side album from 1994 but dates back to the Hysteria recording sessions. Okay, so track 11 is \\"Fractured Love\\", ending the album on the kind of epically dark note that could have given the album the punch to the gut it probably needed.<br /><br />Finally, it was released late. Granted, Steve Clark died in '91, delaying the recording sessions no doubt. But still, five years was a long time. The album did well given that the grunge front had rolled in about a year before, but probably would have done even better, and perhaps been viewed more favorably down the road, with 1990, or even 1991, as a contextual frame.<br /><br />Finally (part two): Adrenalize was a weak title (if I remember correctly it came from a naming contest). It's a nonsense verb and sounds hokey, and does nothing to help the boring lightning strikes on the cover art.<br /><br />So here's the fix: shuffle those b-sides into the lineup, pull out tracks 2-5, get the album on shelves one year earlier, call it Fractured, and the Leps might have nailed the trifecta.
B00ABKGG0C|2|I kept waiting to be swept up, to be captivated, and counted on the ending to do a lot of explaining. The ending arrived in a blur, creating far more questions than it answered generally un satisfying, to me at least
B000003S5H|4|i bought this cd after hearing a short snippet of &quot;sexy boy&quot;, which i loved immediately-- the rest of the album is even better.  really chill music, kind of spacey.
B00005AAFT|2|I am a big Rammstein fan, but i ordered this cd over 3 months ago and it still hasn't arrived.  If I wanted to buy this cd, i would just go to the store to purchase it.
B003EI2EH2|4|While this book is more informative, and better, than the 4-Hour Workweek (my review) it's not as easy to read. It's like reading a cookbook, especially one where several recipes are similar but slightly different. You like the idea of trying each recipe but acknowledge you'll never be able to, so just knowing that recipe exists and you won't enjoy it brings you down a bit. Ferriss lets the reader know up front that it's not to be read in order, but the reader should skim for chapters applicable to himself and then dive in. But where to begin, as it's mostly loosely connected? Even then, each chapter contains links to videos and more material elsewhere. Some people have devoted their lives to trying all of it piecemeal. (Follow the link, the guy has made some handy PDFs of the major stuff.)<br /><br />The value of this book comes from the fact that Ferriss has harnessed his OCD to getting his bloodwork taken multiple times a week, even buying a real-time glucose-tracker he's constantly connected to, and recording every workout he's ever done since age 18 in order to meticulously analyze everything he does. He has broken, torn, bruised, and damaged just about everything. He is a &#34;human guinea pig,&#34; from which the reader reaps the benefit. Better yet, he's reading scientific studies and cold-calling the researchers for the inside scoop, sometimes hanging out with them or recording in-depth interviews. It's not just doctors and scientists but body builders and professional athletes.<br /><br />The goal is to get the minimum effective dose (MED) in all you do so you can maximize productivity and minimize time. But to do so requires a large amount of up-front cost in examining the methods Ferriss presents, trying them for yourself over a long period of time (to be certain of the result), and tweaking them. So, in a goal to increase our output and happiness, I find Ferriss has rather decreased mine. If you're familiar with Seth Godin's The Dip, these are the activities you can do in relatively little time that help you scale your skill or attribute rapidly but not to a meticulously elite level. So, Ferriss increases his vertical jump dramatically in a couple days.<br /><br />Want to quickly become a decent baseball hitter? Swim faster, hold your breath longer? Increase your testosterone? Your sexual prowess? Build muscle mass and increase your strength with little more than 30 minutes in the gym? Up your bench press by 100 pounds in a few months? Get six-pack abs without crunches and Ab Ripper X? Run faster and with less injury? Run a mountain marathon while running more more than a 5K in training? Sleep less, but more effectively? Lose weight without working out? Heal your back and other seemingly irreversible injuries? This book is for you.<br /><br />I recommend skimming the book's website, the book itself has links to many hidden items on the website.<br /><br />From 4-Hour Body, I have basically modified my previous diet to more of a &#34;slow-carb diet.&#34; But while it sounds like Ferriss stays on the diet during his travels around the world, it's not clear whether he recommends it when trying out the various chapters. For example, if you're working on increasing your strength and running speed (&#34;geek to freak&#34;), do you add a starch or not? Do you lift three times a week or five? Do Occom's Protocol I or II? Or do the weightlifting regime used to boost the runners' time?<br /><br />I've made dozens of highlights that I will have to study (29 pages pasted into a Google Doc at 11 point font). In the meantime, I'd already adopted a weight-lifting routine (the Faleev method) Ferriss featured on his blog but not exactly in the book. I've started consuming his PAGG supplement stack (&#34;The Four Horsemen&#34;) while modifying my diet to more slow-carb. (Note: My wife was a bit surprised by these changes as I'm usually quite skeptical. Ferriss' self-experimentation and track-down-the-experts style are quite convincing.) I consider it my own experiment, and I'm skeptical of the results.<br /><br />I'm a little apprehensive to see the results over the next month. I'm not going to spend the money on bloodwork every month, I'm content with my annual insurance-funded blood tests. That said, the book has given me a lot (too much, really) to think about.
B007VUCAVO|5|We have not had much experience with electronic gadgets and we have just purchased a smart tv and got broadband for the first time so we then got a kindle fire and we are still learning and to date we are very happy with any thing we have purchased from Amazon and also their services

B00HVEFCS8|1|I tried to get into this game I really did but the only thing I found this app did for me was block my home screen options--it takes up the whole screen which I find very disconcerting personally because there is no exit button that I could easily spot to exit--,waste precious memory on my tablet, and make me wish I hadn't wasted my time with this pointless app. In one word: removed.
B000LTAY1U|5|It's an automatic, it cheap and its fairly nice looking.  Since I've been wearing it I haven't kept the closest eye on accuracy but as long as it doesn't run slow (which it hasn't so far) I don't mind if it gains a few seconds here and there.  I've heard great things about the movement in this model so hopefully it will last a few years (I would prefer decades but I tend to abuse my watches).  I also like the size as I am used to wearing larger watches and this feels like there is nothing on my wrist.
B008BQ8VOC|5|This is a great show! It's a court drama with hardly ever being in the courtroom! Definitely got me hooked after watching one episode.
6303942830|5|A work of brilliance crafted from a work of brilliance.  Strength, courage, culture, individuality.  These are the themes on which the story is built.  White man, red man, wo-man.  We are all equal so long as we  think with our own minds and speak with our own lips.<br />Cinematography and  musical score equal the story's grandeur.  I love this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|1|So many people like this game, I don't get it. First you have to stay connected to the internet to stay alive. The seek and find scenes are hard to see, even expanded. And there are no options, like music off, or no timer. It has the strangest set up, you don't move through scenes you go through Windows. It's just plain bad...in my opinion.
B003B02O0A|4|No word  about. ELLEN after  the verdict ,  No word about Jake's wife as well. No word. About his wife's  reactions about their house.

B000N6TYLW|5|I find the Gilmore Series a good product to have,especially at the price I paid for them. There are good actors in the series. The series is funny, and yet the daily lives of these women and the community; you could think of them being your own community. Stuff happens in life and this series brought that all out well. Any one wanting to have clean every day life brought to life in their homes; I recommend this Series strongly. I enjoyed each episoed I watched on TV; therefore, I was glad to have bought this product thru the Amazon \\"Store\\".  Sincerly yours, E. Haught of W. VA.

0316113506|5|I like this book because it presents the research in a more objective manner than other popular press science books that I have read over the years. This book is concise and carefully refrains from sensationalism of the link between exercise and the brain. It describes groups of studies within a certain context and it presents the findings in a way that readers will be able to discern between \\"evidence\\" and \\"law\\".<br /><br />This book was fun to read because much of the content of this book contradicts my outdated education on the brain, how it develops, and how it freezes from further significant development around hormonal changes as teens. Additionally, while Piaget may describe behavior well, the inferences made about physical brain development from his ideas are also rendered obselete.<br /><br />As a matter of serendipity, I also read this book at a time when I was around 15 weeks of regular exercising after being dormant for 7 years. It really helped my confidence with the decision to make investments of time and money to exercise as many days out of the week as I could.<br /><br /> The underlying research that is in this book should be given credit and I have to take away points for not presenting the hypothesis of all the experiments presented in the book in greater detail, because a casual reader will likely infer that all the studies were conducted on behalf of the thesis of the book.<br /><br />Still, 5 Stars.
B000FA675C|2|It's a fun read, but there's nothing particularly deep or great about it. It annoyed me when it began touting certain things as facts that I know are not facts. (Leonardo da Vinci did NOT discover the Golden Section or the Fibonacci sequence.)
B00DJZR46G|3|Is it just me or has Elton been recycling and re-using the same hooks and melodies again and again over the last few years?  The hooks and melodies used on \\"Songs From the West Coast\\"  seem to re-emerge over and over again.
B000H305U0|5|I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't impressed with Justified. While it had its moments, I didn't think he deserved too much credit for recording Off the Wall 2003. Justin hadn't developed an original sound, so he bit off other artists instead, and relied on the Neptunes to deliver banging beats for him. <br /> <br />NO MORE. With Future Sex/Love Sounds, Justin finally lives up to his potential. Although he still allows other artists to influence his music (he favors Prince this time instead of Michael), Justin really has created a niche for himself. Also, Justin addes interludes and preludes at the beginning and ends of some songs. They're a nice transition and they add a unique twist to the album <br /> <br />Although I wasn't sold on the idea of the Neptunes not being on this album at first, after a few listens, I realized that he didn't really need them. After all, the Neptunes production is rather unoriginal in the sense that, you always know when you're listening to a Neptunes song, and the aritst doesn't really get a chance to shine. There are Timbaland tracks on the album, but again, I feel like Timbaland is a more versatile producer, so you don't always get that same repetive feel that you get with the Neptunes.  <br /> <br />The album starts out with the title track. I'll admit - this is my favorite song on the CD. The mid-tempo beat, the Prince vibe, the song is really sexy in a kind of fun way. After that is the first single \\"Sexyback\\". I don't really need to talk about it - everyone's heard it. However, if you're skeptical about buying the CD, that song isn't really indicative of what's on the rest of the album. Nevertheless, it's a pretty solid song.  <br /> <br />The next 3 tracks on the CD are some of the stronger numbers. \\"Sexy Ladies....\\", \\"My Love\\", and  \\"Love Stoned\\" are 3 completely different songs with completely different sounds - yet all three work. \\"Sexy Ladies\\" has that 70s funk vibe, \\"My Love\\" (the 2nd single) has a techno, futuristicfeel to it, and \\"Love Stoned\\" has a simple beat with great use of an orchestra and harmonies.  <br /> <br />Justin slows it down on the next song. \\"What Goes Around...\\" [which sounds like it's directed towards britney] it a great mid-tempo ballad, it reminds me of some of the ballads on Justified.  <br /> <br />Justin then makes his only misstep on the CD with the song \\"Chop Me Up\\" with 3-6 Mafia. I'm not impressed with the lyrics or the beat of the song. I think the CD would have been better without it. \\"Damn Girl\\" [w/ Will.I.Am] has another funk Prince vibe and I love the live band sound. Again, it's not one of my favorites, but it's a pretty good track. \\"Summer Love...\\" is another one of my favorites. It has a simple fun vibe, and i really like the attached song \\"Set the Mood\\". It's a really short yet really pretty ballad.  <br /> <br />The next 3 songs are all solid slow jams. Out of the three, my favorite is \\"Until the End of Time\\". Justin ends it with a collaboration with Snoop Dogg on \\"Pose\\". Again, I think this track has a bit of a Prince feel, but still is unmistakably Justin. It's an upbeat number about pretty girls posing for the camera. It's another fun summer song.  <br /> <br />If you got the album pre-ordered, you get a bonus song \\"Boutique in Heaven\\". This is actually another one of my favorite songs. Although the lyrics aren't the best, the song is really catchy, and Justin's voice takes on a slightly different sound.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great buy. <br /> <br />TOP 5: <br /> <br />5. Until the End of Time  <br />4. Summer Love / Set The Mood <br />3. My Love <br />2. Love Stoned / I Think She Knows <br />1. Future Sex/Love Sounds
B00H71PBQ8|5|Excellent
B000002GFC|4|I like the choice of songs but I am not a hardcore fan of Cream, mostly interested in the songs that featured EC.
B0006GAI6O|5|The movie is happy and extremely likable. This movie will definitely make you want to take ballroom dancing lessons. Richard learns lessons about life, love, friendship and basically becomes a better man.
B00IHMEBDU|5|I have to say that before I started reading Adult Romance, I read mostly young adult paranormal (Blame Twilight) ..then I started The Hunger Games. After that trilogy I searched and searched the internet for books similar. When I stumbled upon this series I was totally sucked in and riveted. I devoured all 3 books in 4 days. I then had my coworkers reading them too. We all loved them. Action packed with so much mystery and so much emotion between all the characters and how these young kids have the responsibilities of the world on their shoulders. If you like the dystopian/post apocalyptic type settings with suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat then this is the series for you.
0553584537|5|Wow!  Lisa Gardner is one fantastic suspense writer.  I would recommend her novels to everyone.  We are led down a winding path of mystery, murder and mayhem, but never knowing for sure who is behind the diabolical events.<br /><br />Great work, as usual.<br /><br />Irene
B000T06172|5|Very simply best pop album of the rock era.
1609613937|1|I would be unable to recommend this program to anyone with a clear conscience.  The lack of protein in the plan is alarmingly low. The recipes that are presented would not be edible unless you were the strictest vegan on the planet.  The use of great amounts of starch would be inedible with no oils or condiments.
0375415297|5|Truly great read by one of the world's best Bach scholars. I understand now why he performs Bach the way that he does.
B00000K413|5|TFFs debut album is essential 80s new wave. This album serves as a blueprint to all their music. Intelligent synth pop  with heartfelt lyrics. Maybe one day we could get a 2 cd deluxe reissue as well to really give this classic album justice !
B00NM7IR26|1|It was not a good movies  at all
1582701709|1|I agree with some of the ideas in this book, but not in the matter-of-fact manner it is expressed.  If you have never read a book about positive thinking and attracting prosperity, this book might just change your life.  Which is a wondeful thing if it does.  But, if you have read books on this topic, don't waste your time or money on this book, just browse through it while at the book store or something, if you're that curious.  Or find another book on this topic, there are several out there that delve deeper with more profound explanations. This book definately recycles information that has been around in several books for several years and makes the idea seem like some extraordinary secret that has never been unlocked or exposed.  Just not true.  And life is not always so simple and this book might mislead people into not accepting and loving their lives the way it is at any given moment, for the good and the bad.  To really lean into life is living abundantly, not trying so hard to make a million bucks, finding \\"the one\\" or having the perfect life.  Life is much more intricate than that.  There are more pieces to the puzzle but, thinking positively does do more good than bad.
B00005JLPK|5|If visual arts warm your spirit and your soul is stirred by people who know how to express passion this movie is for you. I felt so WASP when I watched this movie. The music, the honesty of her life, the color... all were astonishing. I especially loved how Frida's works of art were presented. Truly inventive.

B0037TPMOA|5|Loved it! I almost don't want to watch the movie as I just don't think anything else could live up to this! The creepy images I have in my head.... Mind blown
B000002JOH|5|This Album is one of my favorites. But one thing I can't stand is groups now a days trying to be like Pantera, it don't take alot of talent to SCREAM.  All those Gothic people are pathetic.  WOW, I'm wearing Black, look at me eveyone I'm trying to be different. It makes me sick
B000001DQI|5|In my opinion this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. At what is still the most prolific period for the two of them, it seemed they couldn't record the music fast enough.<br />The result of this was the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album, which encompasses a broad range of material that is very strong from beginning to end.<br />Many people overlook some of the lesser known tracks which didn't get a lot of radio play that are some of the best material Elton John has ever recorded, and are what make this release so good.<br />A must have recording for the Elton John fan!
B0009HLDFU|5|There's only one thing I can say about this album, it is one of the best I have heard in many many years, and it's most likely the best rock album that will be put out this year. Any rock fans will love this album. If you even remotely liked the FOOs before, you will LOVE them now! The lyrics are amazing, the riffs are catchy and the entire album is tight. HATS OFF TO GROHL AND CO. ! You dont hear new rock like this very often.  <br />
B000AMJDHY|5|This is one of the best albums that I've heard in years - and I'm not your typical Panic!At The Disco fan... I'm in my early 30's and I like bands such as Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, the White Stripes, and older stuff like Nick Cave, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey.    I appreciate the clever, literate lyrics and the creativity of sound. The blending of styles of music is a very welcome change from bands whose entire albums sound like one big long song.     I appreciate the subtle (and not so subtle) ironies of the vocal presentation, and I respect their musical ability.    I should also mention that I lived in Vegas for seven years and this album is SO VEGAS. I really hate that some critics have made nasty references to My Space,etc. NO! NO! A THOUSAND TIMES NO! THIS ALBUM IS ABOUT LAS VEGAS, NOT THE TRIVIALITIES OF MY SPACE.     Maybe if one has lived in a Vegas or has spent a lot of time there, it's easier to appreciate some of the songs...    My favorites are \\"Build God. Then We'll Talk,\\" \\"These Tables Are Numbered For A Reason..\\", and \\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks.\\" And the \\"Intermission\\" - wow, that's such a cool break in the middle of a rock album.    I think \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" is a little bit mainstream teen fare, but it's still catchy and fun.    I love the verses of \\"Lying is the Most Fun A Girl Can Have...\\" but the chorus was totally lost on me (why this teeny-bop stuff in the middle of an otherwise sexy song?) until I paid closer attention to a few of the lyrics.    This album is a work of art, and it's clearly meant to be listened to in it's entirety from beginning to end.
B00O64D3N2|5|Easily one of my all-time favorite albums.
B0063IH60K|5|My favorite game. It's wonderful.

B00O3UBB1U|4|It might be hard to believe but this year of 2014 marks 40 years since Aussie hard rockers AC/DC formed. To celebrate, the band has decided to release a new studio album and have a tour to follow it in 2015. The new album, Rock or Bust, is the band’s first album since 2008’s Black Ice. However, AC/DC release Rock or Bust with a heavy heart as the band has gone through a major change in their line-up: rhythm guitarist and co-founding member Malcolm Young was forced to retire from the band, having suffered from a stroke earlier this year and is currently being treated for dementia. Replacing Malcolm is Stevie Young, nephew of Malcolm and Angus. Stevie is no stranger to AC/DC, having filled in for Malcolm during the band’s 1988 tour. Despite Malcolm’s absence, Rock or Bust manages to be another good album from AC/DC and celebrates their 40th anniversary well.<br /><br /> The band gets right down to it, opening the album with the title track. With a mean guitar riff from Angus (similar to the one in “Back in Black”) and solid bass line from Cliff Williams, “Rock or Bust” is one of strongest tracks from the album. Singer Brian Johnson sounds great, which is saying a lot considering his age. The lead single, “Play Ball,” is another great song. While the song doesn’t have the greatest lyrics, it’s a short and sweet catchy song. For an album that’s a little under 35 minutes, there’s plenty of things from this album that can be enjoyed. AC/DC sure know how to deliver hard rocking tracks, slow and fast. “Dogs of War” is a slower track with some dark overtones and an edgy sounding chorus while I can already see Angus doing his Chuck Berry duck walks during the rapid-fire “Baptism by Fire.” Speaking of which, Angus really shines on this album. He and Stevie dominate during “Miss Adventure” while he plays some tasty Zeppelin-esque riffs during “Rock the House.” The latter track is so catchy; I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s used atany strip joints!<br /><br />Rock or Bust does have a few weaknesses. As mentioned before, the album runs at 34 minutes- making the album AC/DC’s shortest. While I praise the band for trying keeping it short (which wasn’t the case for Black Ice: that clocked in at 55 minutes), I still feel like something’s missing. While Black Ice was the longer album, I feel it had better songs. “Got Some Rock & Roll Thunder” has a nice bass line from Williams but doesn’t go elsewhere while “Sweet Candy” just sounds like a continuation of “Rock the House.” Still, these are small bits of criticism and it doesn’t stop the album from being enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, Rock or Bust is a solid album from AC/DC. With that, I will look forward to seeing the band tour next year. However, there might be another line-up change in the future:  along with Malcolm’s retirement, drummer Phil Rudd was arrested in New Zealand last month and is now facing threatening to kill and drug possession charges. Despite this, AC/DC has said their touring plans remain unchanged, saying they will go on with or without Rudd. In the meantime, AC/DC fans can enjoy Rock or Bust.

B00EBJ624O|5|It makes perfect sense to create a musical partnership between Yuja Wang and Gustavo Dudamel, both superstars with DG contracts.  With the added influence of the Simon Bolivar Orchestra of Venezuela, there's a great feeling of freshness and youthful spontaneity.  For all the thrill of excitement that these young musicians bring, some will worry that they'll show signs of inexperience.  Despite flashy careers and great popularity, some critics charge them of shallowness, and lack of intrinsic musicality.  Is there good cause for premonition?<br /><br />Starting off with the Rachmaninov 3rd Concerto, long a virtuoso display piece, we hear musicianship that is well-considered and very mature.  Rachmaninov readings of late have tended to shy away from gooey sentimentality in favor of more refinement and modernist sensibility.  Here the first two movements could almost be seen as dry-eyed, yet they move with flexibility and true involvement.  Every phrase sounds natural and there's dramatic undercurrent that lends a feeling of expectation.  Wang has an inspiring technique, so she tackles every challenge with no sign of stress.  But she doesn't simply run through the music either; she has commanding control and one feels she gives everything she has.  She chooses the shorter, easier cadenza in the first movement, something some listeners will bewail, but it's a minor cavil either way.  In the finale we get to hear actual fireworks for the first time, with both Wang and Dudamel letting go with frenzied abandon.  I can't imagine anyone listening without being captivated by the sheer charisma of these musicians--it's quite an experience.<br /><br />If anything the Prokofiev 2nd Concerto is better and there's comparatively little competition.  With its percussive, modernist idiom, it hardly hurts when interpreters take it with towering precision and unbounded energy.  It's a thrilling display of pyrotechnics here.  Nothing sounds brusque though, and it's a good thing that Wang can be biting and sarcastic without banging out the notes.  There's freedom in the phrasing actually, which makes the piece playful without wearing on the listener's ear.  Dudamel is vivacious and makes the most out of the rip-roaring orchestral part--the orchestra plays with surprising accuracy.  In all, the force of two fiery young musicians makes this concerto a romp from beginning to end.<br /><br />There's a chance this recording will be a divider, since there's a unique combination of refinement and dynamic involvement that some will find self-conscious.  I can only argue that charisma wins out in the end.g can be biting and sarcastic without banging out the notes.

B00R2LTNL2|4|great ending to the trilogy however the animation was too obvious that was animated. honestly i think The Lord of the Rings had better cinematography than the Hobbit
B000TGCR3I|5|This film was recommended to me, and it took me a while to get to a store where I could rent it for the first time. Then shortly following the rental I felt I needed to buy it and watch it a hundred more times. I sat at my computer paying close attention to even the tiniest details. This film is all about precision (See the special features- 300 day documentary about the making).    First, this film is about two orphan boys living in a crumbling town called \\"Treasure Town.\\" The focus is all about perspective and how one views the world. While Kuro (Black) has a very dark possessive view of his home town, one that he thinks should never be changed, while Shiro (White) has an imagination and an eye for how the world really should be.    The two are endlessly dogged by the Yakuza who want want to change the town into an amusement park (among other things) and make a profit. Kuro fights to preserve \\"My Town\\" and keep it a place that he can always be the top of and see everything from. Like many other people he wants to keep a sense of security. The world turns upside down with its inner workings and everything in the real town seems so superficial that world and dreams of Shiro seem the most logical option for surviving.     The precise colors, time taken for each shot is clearly expressed, nothing in this film is ever missed, all the work is clear cut and every single scene has its meaning.    Kuro and Shiro share a lonely life living in broken down car and living off stolen money and goods. Although Kuro lives to care for his friend, he has his reservations about how care free Shiro is and that Shiro doesn't entirely like the way the town is developing. The conflicting feelings and various lenses that they see this world from is amazing.     I sat back after seeing this and thought it was an intense but completely necessary violent movie about two kids who just don't want their childhood world to be shattered by the adults. So many themes, ideas, and undertones play into this film that it's open to all viewers.     The time, effort, and thought put into this 111 minute film is clear. The sync of the musical score by Plaid and incredible ending sound by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the bizzare world by Mr. Arias makes me want to go be a director, he did an amazing adaptation of \\"Black and White\\" and transformed it into something else entirely with more graphic images and characters that you don't want to ever forget.    If you liked Akira, Steamboy, or like strange, abstract, but intricately woven films, this is the top of the list, and is good for a group of friends or personal viewing. This deserves a 10 out of 5!
1609611543|5|I am a strong follower of nutrition and evolution and very into the idea of ancestral diets.<br />Our ancestors started eating grains, cows' milk, etc. around 12k years ago.  Evolution is very slow.  As a consequence Homo sapiens is still generally allergic to these products.<br />I find it interesting that the subject of evolution is not mentioned (at least, I did not see any reference to it)<br />I also find it interesting that there are those that find milk products, such as casein, bad for modern humans and others that find gluten and other ingredients in bread bad for modern humans.  However, I do not find the two indicated together.  It appears obvious that they do not consider evolution in the subject.  Since humans were introduced to both at approximately the same time, I would think that they would be associated with each other.  If a person is allergic to casein I would think he/she would be allergic to gluten also, and visa-versa.<br />Miguel Melgar
B001JIDE3M|1|Really boring! And the story line was stupid. It was all about special effects. Earlier versions of this story were done much better.
1594489505|5|Khaled Hosseini has written another masterpiece. The characters creep under your skin and shake you to the bone. You get so involved in the story that you start living in it. You cry with them, you laugh with them, you feel there pain, their anguish. As you turn every page, you feel sad that in a few hours, you will finish the book and then you can no longer 'feel' the characters in the book.   I am normally skeptic, about fiction written about the muslim world that only represents a biased view point that 'sells' to the western world. However Hosseini has written multi-faceted story that is spread over 30 years. It potrays life of Afghan women not just under Taliban but also under warlord and militias armed and supported by the West. I can only admire the courage of Afghanis, innocent men and women, who continue to be hopeful after 30 years of war. I can only pray that one day, they get to see their homeland free from war and carnage, flourishing and prospering.

B000QRIGLC|4|Some parts seem a little Hollywood, but overall I enjoyed the read. I would recommend this book to a friend. Now it's time to watch the movie
B0025UHKNS|4|It does a lot of stuff which is good but makes it complicated.  It has a bit too many options so it makes navigating through the menus a pain.  You really can not operate it right out of the box.  I suggest plugging in the charger and reading the full online manual to figure out how to do what you want.  The directions are very clear and easy and once you have the initial set up done it is no problem to use.  I like that it has a heart rate monitor and is compatable with a foot pad.  I use it for exercise at the gym, treadmill mostly,  the calorie count is dependent on your HR so it seems to be better for keeping track if you are trying to lose wieght.  Only big issue is the watch is so big and bulky especially if you are a woman, but not really noticable while you are working out. The touch bevel is somwhat annoying because it can be triggered by your clothes touching it.  Problem is easily solved by locking the bevel.<br /><br />Cons: Complicated menu, big and bulky, overly sensitive touch bevel.<br />Pros: Lots of options, does pretty much everything.

B002MQYOFW|4|Interesting story line and had trouble laying the book down, however after finishing the book I realized the story line was not unique. The book reminded me of &#34;Clan of the Cave Bears&#34; in as much as the main protagonist is continually questioning her feelings. Book is not bad, but certainly not the best book I have ever read and I will wait to purchase the sequels until their price comes down.
B0007Y08QA|4|The first 15 minutes of Brad Anderson's dark dissension into the inexplicable realm of psychosis, called \\"The Machinist,\\" will intoxicate you with shear disbelief... disbelief that actor Christian Bale has whittled his already lean frame down 63 pounds to become a true walking skeleton (weighing in at just 120 pounds).  Never before has an actor gone to such lengths to fill a role -- most recently Renée Zellweger gained weight for her role as Bridget Jones, and Tom Hanks gained and lost 50 pounds for 2000's \\"Cast Away,\\"  but Bale takes the cake (or rather, passed on the cake).    The film itself is as dark and grim as Bale's body.  His withered body represents what can happen to a man that hasn't slept for a year.  It's the film's driving ambition to keep the reasons for Trevor Reznik's (Bale's) physical and mental declivity a secret, until the very end when all the strange behavior becomes clear.    Director Anderson does a fine job depicting a boundless downfall with intriguing support and detail.  As a factory machinist, Trevor Reznik's fatigued mind and body is a means for trouble to happen and an invitation for catastrophe.  When a fellow worker is maimed by fault of Reznik, the dark playing field of paranoia rears itself as he finds his fellow workers closing in on him... or so it seems.  The film loses its fluidity and becomes more ridged and seamed-together (like a patchwork quilt of images) that make less and less sense as it rolls on, until the culmination and climax gives way to the truth.  With such a pristine and tightly controlled climax, we don't mind the discombobulating that precedes it.    The score is catchy and similar to Hitchcock films of old -- and Anderson points out such on the DVD's extras.  In fact, the whole film screams Hitchcock, but in small enough doses that the movie avoids becoming a pastiche.  Rather, this film is what Hitchcock may have evolved into creating today if he were immortal (and in many ways he is).    The film, thoughstrong, has its flaws, like lack of supporting character development.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a convincing prostitute (I mean this as a compliment), Stevie, who is strong and nimble though vulnerable.  She doesn't transcend being a casual acquaintance when she could have played a more pivotal role, perhaps advancing the plot that seems to lull at times and focus only on our leading man.  Some back-story could have been expanded upon to better elevate the expectations that build, and truly depend, on the final climax.  In the end, Anderson and Bale do well to include all the ingredients for a wallop of an ending.    Grade: B-

B0006A9FMI|3|It seems Dreamworks put their most inept intern in charge of transferring this DVD to English. Not only do they plaster the subtitles on the film itself (not necessary for a widescreen DVD release), they did a \\"listening disabled\\" subtitle. Thus, during amazing video sequences, we have subtitles like [helicopter noises] and [singing in Japanese] thrown at us.  <br /> <br />The movie itself is gorgeous, with a plot that is both utterly convoluted and simplistic at the same time. There actually isn't that much violence in it. Mainly the characters recite depressing and cryptic poetry at each other, although the \\"What Is Reality/Humanity?\\" crisis is less apparent than GHOST IN THE SHELL. Lots of screen time is taken up by slow pans over the extraordinary CAD rendering of the sets, which is fine. But the movie is not as slow as it could have been. The music and audio is incredible; almost its own character. <br /> <br />I appreciate what Mamoru Oshii is doing in these films; the kinds of cyberpunk postmodern issues he brings out in his movies are timeless in their own way. He's really going beyond anime with his films, and I hope they inspire people to create such films, but with more creative and interesting storylines. <br />

B008Y7B3NY|3|I fail to understand why it has been so popular with both critics and public. I found this movie quite flat. I don't mind a movie which does not stick perfectly with fact, or even a movie who just ignore half of the facts or questions raised by the topic. It is ok so long they entertain me and &#34;capture the spirit&#34; of the story. I found this movie wanting on all of the above.<br />It never really brings you to Neverland, you never frankly bond with the characters, the question of the relationship between the characters is dodged to focus on other subject but I think it was a mistake that deprived the story and its characters of contrast and depth and genuine humanity.<br /><br />That said, it's not an awful movie, just not a very good one either.
B005LHO274|4|Excelente muy buena
B007IXWKUK|4|It is interesting, psychologically, to delve into the characters and it's well-written. It flows. There is too much devoted to sex scenes, however, so that the time sequence and span of the book is confusing. It has a little more plot than book one and is a little less like one big orgy, but not much.

The anti-Hillary folks must have decided that posting poorly written reviews of the book was a way to sway public opinion. Granted the writing style is a bit wooden, and, yes, obviously she wants to make herself appear influential and wise, but as a primer on American foreign policy in the 21st century it is quite interesting. She is one of the smartest people around, and I hope she runs.

The characters were written out of character. I didn't feel like anything was right anymore. There are just so many problems with this book.

One of his best and I like all his books (other than Dark Tower).  I would recomend this even to non-King fans.  It is intersting on many levels.  I've been trying to catch him on mentioning things in the 60s that were not yet discovered.  One I think stands out is there is a young girl playing soccer in the street in Dallas in 1962.  I doubt this one.  But other than that, his attention to detail going back to the 60s is very good.

0439023513|4|Trilogies don't always end well. The story will almost never end in a manner that leaves everyone feeling satisfied. Whether it be the direction the author takes the story, the inevitable fates of beloved characters, or the conclusion that binds them all together. Fortunately, I found that Mockingjay succeeded in giving a proper conclusion to a incredibly emotional journey, although it isn't perfect in its execution.<br /><br />Upon being rescued from her second foray into the Hunger Games, Katniss has found herself among an army of rebels living in District 13, the same District 13 that was supposedly destroyed by the Capitol for their previous rebellion. Katniss has become the symbol of hope in Panem's fight for freedom: the Mockingjay. If the rebels are to stand a chance of defeating the seemingly unstoppable Capitol, Katniss must adopt the charismatic persona that District 13 deems necessary. All the while she must contend with her own psychological war with President Snow.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy has had a very cohesive evolution in its storytelling that flowed perfectly from each book. The Hunger Games showcased the nightmare of living under a totalitarian government and the atrocities they can inflict. This led to Catching Fire, which was a subtle social commentary on the individual's will to defy an evil regime and how it can inspire other people to join their cause. This all culminates in Mockingjay, which focuses on the horrors of war through the eyes of children. It possesses a very different feel than its predecessors but fits perfectly well in the over-arching framework of the trilogy. Suzanne Collins once again demonstrates her astuteness as a writer, completely rejecting obvious cliches of cigar-chomping acts of bravado and instead focuses on the physical and psychological ramifications wars have on human beings. It's an incredibly powerful political statement on the many behind-the-scenes factors of war that may seem lost in today's mainstream perception. These themes never felt forced or shoved down the reader's throat, it's more than possible to simply enjoy it as the intended conclusion. Dig deeper though and you'll find a thought-provoking stance on conflict that exudes a strong sense of humanity.<br /><br />Despite the ever present Capitol's denial, District 13 wasn't destroyed during the Dark Days and is fortunately given a believable reason for its continued existence. District 13 itself has grown into a heavily militaristic society with aspects in the vain of communism. They're the enemy of the Capitol, but they aren't perfect either. Collins understands that war almost never has any perfectly good sides. Despite the honest nature of soldiers, politicians may possess hidden agendas that benefit their own personal sociological and political views. Wars are fought for inner held beliefs, ideologies, or a beacon of hope. Yet sometimes in the madness of war these ideals can be forgotten, or even worse, twisted into something grotesque. District 13 and its leaders perfectly summarize this morally grey tone of wartime politics. Katniss and the rebels share a common foe in which they are committed to destroy; but is the future they envision truly a better one? Who are the real villains in the masquerade of war?<br /><br />A predominant running theme the trilogy has encompassed is the use of propaganda to manipulate the perception of the masses, particularly through controlled mass media or transforming an individual's outward appearance and personality to reflect their views. The Capitol dressed and pampered Katniss for her supposed slaughter at the Hunger Games, tried to redefine her as a less inspiring figure in Catching Fire, and now District 13 wants to utilize her as their beacon of hope in their self-righteous war against a tyrannical regime. Collins really does an excellent job showcasing this running theme from both sides of the war, having Katniss's simple image pretentiously blown out ofproportion for the rebel's war effort, only then to have it demonized by the Capitol's redundant attempts of maintaining control. A personal identity crisis such as this can have insurmountably negative affects on the individual's psyche; Katniss can't be herself, she must be the image the rebels require her to be. This in some ways makes District 13 no better than the totalitarianism they ever so valiantly fight to destroy.<br /><br />It pains me to say that Mockingjay is the only book in the trilogy that I feel suffers from an awkward pacing. The book definitely started off strong, showcasing the existence of the rebellion and the grieving sadness derived from the devastation of war. The problem falls in Katniss being sidelined when in the confines of District 13 for a very large chunk of the book. It makes sense in the context of the story since only a fool would send their symbol of morale into a potentially hazardous situation by choice. Her death would demoralize the rebels and give morale to the Capitol, completely turning the war effort in the enemy's favor. The downside is that it severely cripples the narrative, Katniss's non-involvement makes the reader feel less attached to the war and the horrors which it entails. She's the reader's intangible link to Collin's fictional world, her separation from the conflict makes for a very disconnected feel with the events that transpire. At its worst, it prevents Katniss from being the incredibly strong heroine that I've come to know and love. She never loses her courage, she just isn't given much opportunity to use it until much later in the book. The reader feels more like a spectator instead of an inhabitant of the dystopia, which is something Collins did in the Hunger Games better than any author I've seen before. I had originally planned to give Mockingjay a three star rating and consider it a step down from the previous books, that is until I reached the second half of the story. It follows the same structurethat Collins has established for the trilogy, the first half serving as exposition and world-building while the latter half serves as the more action-oriented section. The events that take place during the second half of Mockingjay don't share the same déjà vu feeling that Catching Fire suffered from with its repeat of the Hunger Games. While I disliked the pacing of the book's first half, the whole thing just clicked for me once I reached this point. Katniss and the reader truly get to experience the harrowing sensation of battle, the burden of leadership, and the undeserved fate of anyone caught in the crossfire. It's entertaining, heart-wrenching, and deeply thought-provoking. It's all done so incredibly well that I feel it actually made up for the book's disjointed feel.<br /><br />I've also constantly praised the love triangle in these books due to its abandonment of the painfully cliche romances that teen novels usually rely on. This was a character-driven romance, not a sexual one, which I why it was so endearing. I never felt like it left the formula that Collins established, even if some moments felt somewhat contrived when compared to the larger scheme of events. It concludes the way I feel most people wanted it to myself included. What didn't feel as conclusive were the several minor characters that are introduced in Mockingjay. Their deaths lack the emotional impact that Collins intended simply because we know nothing about them, thus their end falls flat when compared to the demise of more established characters.<br /><br />The ending of this book is by far the most emotionally-draining tear-jerking conclusion I've ever read in my life. It's the kind of ending that will keep you up at 2am to see how it eventually unfolds, I know I did. It's superbly malicious in the way we've come to expect from Suzanne Collins's masterful manipulation of our emotions and thus a worthy ending to the Hunger Games trilogy that'll make you both smile and cry. With that said, I believe people are really overreacting to how the book ended. Wars and revolutions always come at a dire cost, Collins simply demonstrated this in a way that she knew would make the reader care. Physical wounds may heal over time but emotional ones stay with people forever. Consider every man or woman who comes home from war with such horrible memories fresh on their mind, are they supposed to just naturally adapt back to everyday life? The only thing that can help these injured souls get by is love from another human being.<br /><br />This would have been a five out of five if it wasn't for the unfortunate pacing issues. Mockingjay is an incredible introspective on the horrors of war and a worthy conclusion to one of the most emotionally powerful trilogies I've ever read.
B00AEFY3DQ|5|Love this movie!  Fast Shipping!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved it! One of my best reading experiences!
B000021XR5|3|I suppose I should say that I enjoy this album much more than the last one.  Many of the songs are reminiscent of their first album, Core.  And I have to admit that a good portion of this record really rocks.  There seems  to be some anymosity fueling the fires of songwriting on this one.  There  are moments, however, that sound more like &quot;Tiny Music&quot; or more  dubiously Scott Weiland's solo album.  This record is a borderline 4 star  effort, and if you like &quot;Tiny Music&quot; and &quot;Core,&quot; you'll  probably dig &quot;No. 4,&quot; but I can't give it that strong of an  endorsement.  One thing I will say, is that the richness of Scott's voice  seems to be returning a bit, though it will probably never get back to  where he was on &quot;Plush.&quot;
B0078XGEK2|5|Great book
0439023513|1|I thought this book would be great in the fact that it would hopefully do these three things:    -Resolve Gale/Peeta love triangle  -Resolve winner (e.g. Capitol, Rebels)  -Give Katniss a happy ending, PLEASE.    Although Suzanne Collins very effectively described how terrible being in a war would be, she did not make the book fun to read.  I guess what I mean is that when I read the first two books, they held a few key interests that kept me pulled in, and I still say the first two books are fantastic.  Katniss's love life in this book is almost nonexistent.  Katniss is not helpless at all in the first two books, I will even say she was absolutely kickass, but in this book she is, as Collins puts it, \\"mentally disoriented\\" in the entire book, not to mention the many times she gets herself hurt in her craziness, thus putting her in a hospital for a great portion of the book until the end.  Ah.  The end.  Why on God's earth would Prim have to die?  Isn't this book depressing enough without THAT little tidbit happening?  Along with Finnick dying, is there even a point other than to describe how terrible the situation Katniss is in?  Forgive me if I say that there isn't.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes tragedies are good.  In this case, I definitely think the opposite.  Back to the Peeta/Gale thing.  Gale is a war-obsessed temperamental die-hard soldier in this book which I find exciting but Katniss is far too \\"wounded\\" to care about Gale.  Then Peeta comes back just to torture Katniss because he has been \\"hijacked\\" meaning his brain is pretty much programmed to kill Katniss by Capitol peeps.  Bring on more \\"wounded\\"-ness.  And so Peeta doesn't even remember all the good stuff we've read about in the two previous books, bringing on a hearth of depression and a dearth of even the tiniest enjoyment.  The first two books had at least some happiness.  The ending again, was just a little bit bizarre.  Katniss votes for another Hunger Games, and then realizing she's stupid she shoots Coin before anyone finds out when she is supposed to shoot President Snow.  He then dies from laughing so hard at Katniss's silly notions.  Flashforward a bit, after Katniss is let out of her prison room she sings in like a lunatic for weeks and is sent to twelve for a life of woundedness with Haymitch and Peeta.  We don't even get to hear about Peeta and Katniss, let alone for one lousy paragraph, where she says she basically is with him because he understands and loves her, and she supposes she loves him too. Flashforward a bunch of years when she has 2 children and she talks about how they are playing in the meadow where all the people that died in the twelve bombing are buried.  What a fantastic ending.  I give this book a one, because for me it just didn't deliver the goods.  I realize this is pretty much a huge rant, but it's what I think.  Hope it helped you.    (By the way, I still give Suzanne Collins props for the first two, those were actually quite good.)
B00CSR2J9I|5|I love this game! It's so fun to play on any given day, and you don't need WiFi so you can play it on a roadtrip and still get the same quality as you would at your home. I TOTALLY recommend this game for any person.
B002PLALCO|5|This was hands down the best concert we have ever watched on DVD.  I have no idea why Pink never won a Grammy.  Every song was awesome and the dancing and special effects were out of this world.  Wish I could have been there in person, but watching this DVD was the next best thing.
B00IS87HYI|4|have issues getting lives added even after friends send to me.
B00BRR66SA|4|Justin hit out the park with this album.  His production on this album is next level.  You can put in the album and just let it play...  Great album for any occasion.
B00005JMFO|5|\\"Love Actually\\" is grand, actually.<br />\\"When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love.\\"<BR>-Hugh Grant (as Prime Minister) during opening credits of Film<br />the quote above is just one of the many things i loved about this film...when i went and saw \\"Love Actually\\" (Friday--the day it opened), I had two expectations in mind.  One: it would be just as good as i thought it would be, if not better.  Two: it...just...wouldn't.  haha Well, thankfully, my first hope was fulfilled.  \\"Love Actually\\" is grand...need I say more?<br />But I will.<br />The movie--soo good, wildly entertaining, extremely funny, heart-warming, and charming...very romantic...i fell in love with a certain handsome character (Rodrigo Santoro who plays Karl)...mama mia!!! ;-)  hehehe. When I went to the first showing at the box office, the lady behind me asked me what the movie was all about.  I only had to say but two words, and she was convinced.  Is that not cool, or what?  ;-)  <br />i recommend this movie immensely! it is so funny...(one of my favorite parts is the spectacle of Hugh Grant dancing about and through his house...too, too adorable. :o)  his moves...man oh man...maybe one of the best dance sequences I have ever scene...I mean, what is better than spontaneity when it comes to groovin'?  not much.  hehe Hugh Grant...boy, an incredibly talented actor, especially when it comes to humor, not to mention he could charm the boots off of anyone. :o) ) I also loved it when Liam Neeson had that \\"serious\\" talk with his stepson Sam, who he thought was having trouble dealing with his mother's death when \\"actually\\" his depressed mood was due to his passionate and painful unrequited love for a slightly older America pop star.  The eight or nine-year-old boy was so serious when he told Daniel (Neeson) that he wasn't too young to be in love...that, too, is so incredibly cute.=)  <br />    This movie will have you laughing at every point of the film. ok, well except for the really touching, tender moments like when Laura Linney goes to visit her brother in a pyschiatric hospital--her brother, who during Laura's last visit tries to strike her, but this time throws his manly arms around her and hugs her tightly--is the forgiving spirit of Christmas at work here?  maybe...you could go ahead and infer that. This random act of love may bring tears to your eyes, but of course some might be a little irked that in order for her to tend to her brother she had to forfeit her newly-begun relationship with the really tall, dark, and handsome Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro.  tut tut tut.  What a shame...they never did bring complete closure to what went on between the two.  That's maybe the one thing I disliked about the film.  the ONE.  haha...in other words, everything else was wonderful. hehe <br />And then there's the really sweet, romantic aspects of the film that will bring some, like my friend Kim, literally to tears. Who knows? Some people cry at weddings. Others, like me, cry at funerals. Who knows why really...who knows why.....<br />the characters are just too hilarious, too sweet, and too cute or cool or just so undeniably hot that you can't NOT like 'em. u kno whadda i mean? they're jus lovable characters, and you and your subconscious suddenly find yourselves relating to them because you or someone you know has been in the same or a very similar predicament as the characters brought to life on screen. The presence of Christmas was never overlooked. =) Well, ok, maybe that is truly obvious because the holdiay was the underlying theme of \\"Love Actually\\", but all shrewdness aside, the warm, fuzzy spirit gets you in such a way that you feel like leaping out of your seat, jumping up into the screen, and hugging every single person in the movie.  Hmmm...seriously now, what more can I ask for in a movie? A brilliant cast, a story set in the most celebrated, highly favored holiday of the year...the stars speaking in the most beloved accent of them all (English)...handsome, but humble men (who really don't take themselves too seriously), pretty but adorable ladies (ladies who seem to forget just how lovely they really are) and the cutest boy (Sam played by Thomas Sangster) you have ever laid eyes upon; and I mean, EVER. :D<br />Love Actually has it all. And the great part about it is, it's not just exclusive romantic love that is celebrated.  You have several forms....maybe even the most essential kinds--the love of a family, the love between a mother and daughter, stepfather and son, friend and friend, but most of all, the love of a community...a community joined for a single purpose: to present to the world a love that consumes and touches all.<br />I wanted to see \\"Elf\\" this past Friday, too, but since it was already late in the evening, I only had time to see one, so of course, I, being the Christamas-loving, romance fanatic that I am, chose the movie that has those similar aspects of humor and Christmas as I am sure is seen in \\"Elf\\", but with that added, much endorsed instance of love's beauty.  Love is actually the greatest thing on earth, and \\"Love Actually\\", well...attempts to show the most dear and great things about it. I must say, the makers of \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" succeeded in doing just that. (pip pip! cheers!!)<br />So throw away your cynicism and lame opposition to anything and everything that has to do with the entirely human emotion of love, and do yourself and every other cynic out there a favor...just see the movie!!  You won't regret it.  =)<br />(no pressure of course =P )
0062202081|5|IF YOU AS BIG OF A JUSTIN BIEBER FAN AS I AM,YOU'LL WANNA GET THIS BOOK. GOT IT PRETTY FAST.AND IT IS MORE THEN I EXPECTED. I LOVE IT.GREAT PHOTOS OF HIM,AND  A GREAT READ.
B004KKX814|4|These Japanese Beyblades are very nice for the boys. They like them better than the Hasbro type and they seem to be faster allowing them to win more battles over the Hasbro type.
B00AREIAI8|5|Great game, very addictive, easy to understand and play, glad I installed this one. Would highly recommend. Great fun. Great graphics and sound, good range of tasks and activities. Provides many hours of fun. Good for adults and kids alike.
B000FVQYYK|5|The first I heard of Muse was in the Twilight soundtrack.  Then Adam Lambert singing Starlight at an AI concert, which I loved.  So I was prompted to buy this CD and I really love the sound.  A lot of interesting musical combinations - especially love the sound of the heavy piano chords in some of the songs, which I personally think goes very well with the alternative rock sound.  I like this CD better than their new release
B007FG9LIE|1|I feltt it was more a SYFY<br /> and I would not read any more in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5|Great idea to be responsible
B000HKW7E0|5|Classic! One of my favorites and always puts me in a festive mood!
B00003CXAA|5|The product came quickly and was the perfect gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it!!
B0090EIILU|1|This was an awful movie. Previews are the funniest part. I chuckled at some parts but overall it was pretty painful to watch. I do not recommend it and wish it hadn't cost so much to rent it.
0399255370|5|best book EVER!!!!! my grandson loves this it is a neat book.
0385344430|5|I hadn't planned on a review but couldn't figure out how to leave questions that I hope someone can answer.<br />I did enjoy this latest in Ms.Gabaldon's epic epic!  I, on the whole, have found reading this story to be entertaining and enjoyable.<br /><br />I am curious about a couple of things, tho.  Since the collection started many years ago, and I am too old now to want to reread them all (tho I would like to) since there are soooooo many books left to read before I go toes up, perhaps some other reader can help me out.  How old are Claire and Jamie?  She started out older than Jamie, didn't she?  But now it seems he is the older, tho, not by lots.  Since going back and forth in time must have allowed the age difference to even up sort of, now I am curious about what ages they are now in this latest book.  40's or 50's??<br />Also, it does take time for Ms.Gabaldon to get each new tome written and published, I am wondering if I have the chance of living long enough?  I know that sounds silly, but I hope to hang in there at least 10 more years, so maybe there will be time enough for another one - does anyone have any idea how many more Ms.G thinks to write?  I would hate to not be able to finish the series just 'cause of a little ol'thing like death!
B000002WYT|5|Out of the 200+ CD's I own, This is my FAVORITE one of all time!!<BR>I listen to this CD every morning just to start my day off right. I love it!!
B00VFTD43A|5|Amazing film. Best of the year.
B006885LZM|5|enjoyable, enlightening.  History made real. I heard stories from my father about the U.S. Marines in the Pacific, but this brought it to life.
B006GLLXXK|4|entertaing, face paced
B00G32VYDG|1|I wouldn't even give it a star! It was horrible! I don't even have ten words to describe it! RIP to the movie.
B00DVKOYBM|4|I have played this on other devices and it seems a little laggy on here, still love it though and would definitely recommend to others. Thanks Mini Clip 😁
B0089LOG02|5|This was a great book.  Although I am normally an avid reader anyway, this was one I just could not put down and finished it in the course of a weekend, ignoring anything else I had to do in the meantime.  I didn't know anything about the Orphan Trains, and learned a lot.  I also really liked the 2 main characters.
B009CG2YDE|4|playing through the first couple of levels in bed was very hard to control.  when I sat up it was still not great, but better.  I love this kind of retro feel games and not a bad example.
B000S81MHY|5|Excellent product, exactly what I expended. I would buy again.
B001N1DPDE|1|Initially impressive, heavy, feels industructable, sheath is fairly nice however i found it a pain to pull it out quickly.   I was using it to de-branch a tree that was cut down with the Cold Steel Trail Boss (Five Star axe) and it worked okay, certianlly the axe helped more, but after a half dozen large trees I noticed that the handle had almost broken in two, rather the poly-ur-a-thang (Spell check, hah) part of the handle, i suspect either the vibrations of the act or it may have hit a rock and cracked, either way both of those situations should not have broken what is supposed to be a heavy-duty knife.  I hope that mine was simply defective, there are many positive reviews.
B000EYK4KI|5|The Unrated Collector's Edition is for anyone who saw the original in theaters and wished that there had been just a little less rushing.  The Unrated edition adds more than ten minutes of extra footage -- mostly adding a couple of minutes to each of the big fight sequences (most noticeably, the car chase scene, where some extra dialogue is added).  The second disc includes many behind-the-scenes bits on the cinematography and direction, as well as script development.  Not a bad choice for those who don't own another version, and true fans of the movie.
B007PTJOV0|4|always loved playing Mario bros now its with an Irish theme.  works great on the kindle.  even my 3 yr old likes it.
B004VMVTNU|4|This app works nicely with my Kindle Fire.  It has a simple and elegant interface, lots of programmable settings and is very intuitive.  I have tried several other alarm apps with disappointing results.  If you want a nice, simple app without personal assistant software I doubt you'll go wrong with this one.
B00AYB1TP0|5|grandson loves it
B000JBWWRY|1|The dvd gets stuck in a frame at least 3 times during the movie in the same spots. We have tried to clean the DVDs, but it does not make it better. Our DVD player works fine with all the other movies we own so we know it is not the DVD player. Not happy about our purchase
B001GZ6QDS|4|The Batman movie that's been 70 years in the making!  A perfect movie.  Takes nearly every aspect of the Batman mythology and, in continuation with the perfect set-up (Batman Begins), forms an epic film where, in my opinion, Batman was the weakest performance, and that's not an insult.  The supporting cast is superb.  Heath Ledger.  Enough said.  Gary Oldman deserved some kind of nomination.  Morgan Freeman is as classy and witty as ever.  Maggie Gylanwhatever redeems Nolan's poor judgment in formerly casting Katie Holmes.  Aaron Eckhart is brilliant.<br /><br />However, the DVD is a typical quick release.  Great featurettes, very interesting, but for the magnitude of this film, its release, and Heath alone, it's skimpy at best.  If you're a fan, you already have it, but I wish they would have done just the single disc until the Collector's Edition was released.  Oh well, I'd triple-dip for this movie if I had to.
B00004ZAV3|3|I know this album is supposed to be about 'no.1 chart toppers' but a casual listener listening to this CD would have hardly understood the Beatles. The majority of the songs are from the period 63-65. Where are such classics as 'If I Fell', 'Nowhere Man', 'Michelle', 'Strawberry Fields', 'Across The Universe', 'Norweigen Wood'.etc.etc I know its impossible to make a Beatles 'greatest hits' CD, but a double or even triple CD with all their major hits would be a better bet.
B00099BPP6|4|As a 24 yr. old rock-and-roller, I checked the cassette tapes of this recording out of the library in 1966 out of curiosity. As somebody completely new to opera, I just tolerated the music enough to keep listening. Then came the Act II quartet which blew me and then my wife away. We almost wore the borrowed cassettes out.  <br /> <br />We eventually turned into multi-decade season ticket holders and love the entire world of opera, but Rigoletto remains our favorite. In our minds Rigoletto is the operetic standard, a \\"perfect\\" balance and meshing of drama, technical fireworks, lyricism, melody, emotion, memorable characterization, solos and duets, ensemble pieces, choral and orchestral music. When this recording became available on CD, we rejoiced and bought it to add to our collection of two other Rigoletto recordings. <br /> <br />We were lucky starting our life-long love affair with opera with this 1964 recording. Renata Scotto is in perfect voice. Carlo Bergonzi as the Duke is warm, lyrical, and seductive. Dietrich Firsher-Dieskau as Rigoletto also has a warm, lyrical voice, unusual for Rigoletto but beautifully heartbreaking. The chorus of courtiers plays a critical starring role in Rigoletto and the La Scala chorus is superb as always, as is the direction by Rafael Kubelik. The sound quality is fuzzy by current standards, hence the 4 star rating, but is very acceptable for casual listening such as in an automobile.  <br /> <br />If you don't have any other recordings of Rigoletto, I'd recommend the recording with Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti, Sherill Milnes, and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge, for the excellent sound quality and poweful performances. However, you can't go wrong with this recording, especially for the price.
1594202273|5|WOW!  A must read to understand the history of America's nuclear bomb policies.  Fascinating history!
B00FKAA3MA|5|I am not a fan of either Eminem or rap music and want to make the crystal clear.  I have reviewed well over a hundred things and nothing comes close to either.  BUT I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS CRUDE YET BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE!!  I loved Lady GaGa's five star latest feat ARTPOP but complained in my review of the constant need for everybody to throw rap into their own work.  YET HERE WE HAVE RAP THAT IS UNEARTHLY!!  I must make a mention of all the endless prudes who criticized Lady GaGa for stepping slightly out of the box and using loads of sexual innuendo because next to The Marshall Mathers LP2 (DELUXE EX) Lady GaGa has shrunk to the level of Mary Poppins!  When I listened to song four So Much Better I thought my teenage son would really feel it.  BUT THEN I HEARD SONG SIX LEGACY AND I THOUGHT MY TEENAGE SON WROTE IT!!  It was amazing to actually encounter enough similarities to the words he utters and not feel so horrified finally!  Thanks Brian for your boldness; you have made me appreciate rap in a way I never thought I could!
B006LSZECO|4|I clambered to read the book before seeing the movie which is a box office hit. The story is a study of a  marriage modern, deep and raw. I particularly liked the honesty expressed by the wife from her raw emotions which were diabolical and from the husband equal<br /><br />Great study of a modern dysfunctional marriage.  It was raw, honest and suspenseful. A good read for anyone who wants to be a fly on the wall and see what constitutes the minds of the twisted spouses.
B004UID2LC|5|It works about 97% of the time but can't complain it is the best video and mp3 downloader around..I love the fact that it can download music so I can download everything in one spot..it's also fairly fast (depending in your connection of course)
B00992CF6W|4|I think it is awesome... but I wish you would have buckets of water so you can make a pool. Anyway it's awesome because it has 2 games.LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3|it;s so agravating.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I think this game is great but it only gives people a certain amounts of life and after that you have to ask for help or wait thirty minutes for another life. Over all it is a very fun game
B000002OOY|5|Even though this soundtrack is over 10 years old, I was easily able to find it on Amazon. Contains instrumental music from the first movie. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Jurassic Park. This would also make a good CD for road trips!
B0094LYJZI|4|Enjoyed the movie
B00785P2QC|3|it works,  you have to work hard to get what u want and. just get it its fun blab blab blab blab blab blab blab blab blah.
B00594XOZU|4|Fun app. Use it when my family is unable to call.
B00KFVE4B0|5|True  Life....back in the day
B00CNQ7HAU|5|So happy to be back with the honest,fair and flawed Jake B. I love a man who loves  his wife and family and they are always a part of the story.what an interesting story, my attention never waned even though Jake seemed a bit more jaded. Still there was (dare I say)  enough morality coming from Lucien,Harry and the Judge to satisfy all of us \\"right fighters\\". There is still more cases to be solved by this wonderful man - keep it going please!
B002KKCWN6|5|I bought these for my husband who has bunions on both big toes.  He has a hard time finding shoes comfortable.  These replaced a pair of Columbia sandals I bought for him a few years ago.  He wore them at the lake the day he got them and he says they are comfortable.  They look very well made - good quality sandal, especially for water.
B007KZY1YY|5|Excellent! Can't put it down.  After the first book. The others are a must. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B005DJREJS|4|Season 1 was the most interesting.  Season 2 becomes more typical with its drawn out conflict between which boy Jenna should pick as her beau.  Witty but sometimes juvenile writing.  Lots of trendy &#34;text-icon.&#34;
B00ECTZKJ6|4|a pleasant surprise! overall a very solid album.as an old korn fan  after hearing the very horrible single and disappointing last album i was very weary of any new korn. to my amazement they have restored my faith. that being said this is goin in my rotation with a slight edit. there are a couple of so so songs and that horrid single gets a 4 stars. glad heads back ! CHECK IT OUT!
B00881VLCE|4|My thanks goes to the masterminds who created such a great app!
B00HUCF420|5|This was an awesome series.  Thrilling and suspenseful.
B0063IH60K|5|It is amazing and never want to stop playing ... I do really recommend this wonderful  game....  :-) If you like solitaire with this you'll love it!!! :-)
B0032SQCQI|5|I thought this was a great extension to the classic Twilight Zone episode.  Great acting.  Creepy. A little dark humor and plot twists to go.
B0002T7ZKW|5|It's amazing to me how many American Idiots there really are in this country!  I see them EVERY DAY!  This album tells it like it is -- and what it says is that this country is headed for a rude awakening!!!  People....get your heads out of your ***es and start paying attention to what's going on around you.  And learn how to read, write and spell for crying out loud!!!  There's nothing worse than an American that can't read or write his own language!!!!!  We expect it from those that are \\"illegal\\", but NOT from our own people.  WAKE UP AMERICA!!!  --ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00GINENG0|5|Well, the game has pros and cons.<br /><br />  Pros:  Cons:<br />It can talk to you.  It's voice is annoying<br />You can play in app video games.  2 of them you have to purchase<br />It's like a real cat.  You have to check on him a lot.<br /><br />There are more, but I can't list them, bye.
B005VGMYZM|5|Easy listening.
B004LE7PCM|4|I love the Sherlock Holmes stories and having them on my Kindle makes it so much easier than carrying heavy books around.<br />There are some minor editing mistakes that I hadn't expected on Kindle, but not enough to detract from my enjoyment of the stories.
B00C7JGDBW|5|You'll needed to try it l loved the movie . I love everything on my Amazon Fire HD tablet and Amazon.com. l love to shop and look on Amazon.com. Thanks again.<br />Love,<br />Patty Thilman
0307269981|2|Like Larsson's first book, this one was a page turner.  However, I fairly quickly became bothered by all the coincidences--time after time seemingly unrelated people just happen to show up at the same place at the same time. And, yes, they all play a part in the story but not a part that would have drawn them physically together.  Overuse of coincidences strikes me as lazy writing. But this flaw in no way prepared me for the totally implausible way the book ended. For those who haven't yet slogged through the book's 500+ pages, I won't mention the details. But the rest of you know what I mean. I don't plan to devote time to Book Three. As far as I am concerned, Lisbeth Salander is dead.
B00J6YA1V4|5|Note: original review below, but I wanted to address the critics here. As time has passed since my completing this novel, my appreciation for it has grown exponentially. I think this explains some of the problem with those who are comparing this addition to the originals in a critical way. You've grown, time has passed, and everything from your past is still seen through the rose colored glasses you were wearing when the you began reading the series, but anything new is going to be seen from the sh!t stained cynic glasses that we all inadvertently don as we age.  This is a well written and exciting edition to the series, and if you MUST put your cynic glasses on, wear those rose colored glasses at the same time, and maybe you'll see this book for what it is, and what it isn't, instead of only the latter.<br /><br />Original review:  I have only just started reading Prince Lestat and for those other reviewers who have already finished the book; Can you tell me how you learned to speed read, please?  I only have a few things to say thus far. I will return when I've read more and continue to do so until I've completed the book- perhaps completed it twice (as I've read all entries in the Chronicles and many of Rice's other books numerous times over).  First, Rice caught a lot of flack for the previous two books in the Chronicles; Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.  While I enjoyed these books, I can't say that some of it wasn't deserved.  It did feel like the voice of the Chronicles had changed almost too drastically.  It made me uncomfortable.  In preparation for this book, which I pre-ordered the moment I saw that it was to become available, I went back to reread the entire series- just as Rice did to prepare for writing it.  I still felt that same oddness at the end, but then began reading Prince Lestat and saw it immediately melt away.  I heard Lestat's voice again.  I knew I was reading Rice, the Queen of the Vampires, before I finished three sentences.  There's just something about the way she writes.  I'm sure a linguist could probably crack the code but I've never been able to put my finger on it.  I've rewritten this sentence five times over, trying to explain it, and I just gave up.  You'll need to read it to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />For those of you starting here with the Vampire Chronicles rather than going back to the beginning as some would advise (as I might advise in a later revision to this review), there is a glossary of terms in the beginning that I at first found annoying but have decided would have been quite helpful for me had I not decided to reread the series.  I think you should do just fine picking it up without any research.<br /><br />I'll be back for more when I've read some more.  And to Anne Rice, who I know does sometimes read her Amazon reviews- or did at one time- you have made me very happy!  I was eating breakfast this morning when I saw that Prince Lestat had appeared on my Kindle, and I immediately let out some sort of unintelligible cry that scared everyone in the food court.  So, thank you!<br /><br />UPDATE 10/30:  I am to chapter 9 and would definitely like to revise my earlier statement about not having to read the earlier books.  I think I would be pretty confused and frustrated to not know the history of these characters reading Prince Lestat, so I would suggest reading Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and  Queen of the Damned at least.  You might want to go ahead and read the next three books in the series as well.  Or read Prince Lestat and if you feel a little lost, but like it, go back then and read these.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS- BUT POSSIBLE HINTS....<br />So far, so very very very good.  Already I have read right into some major surprises and unexpected turns.  There is one central mystery to this excellent novel, and though I think I've gotten that figured out, I'm amazed that Rice went there- it's as if this was the plan all along.  I won't say any more about it.  But this is lush, fulfilling storytelling at it's finest, and I feel like I'm enjoying it even more than The Queen of the Damned.  There are elements that might feel cheesy in any other series, but they are already ingrained into the Chronicles, so they work well here- as is often the case with Rice.  She can tell a story so skillfully that even the most hokey of plot devices feel fresh and remolded in her hands.  This is what she does with her works as well- she takes burned out legend and myth (Vampires, Mummies, Werewolves, Angels) and re sculpts them into her own evolved species.  And she continues to add to the vampire canon here, filling in some of the blanks and creating new blanks (mysteries) for her readers to ponder.<br /><br />I'll return to finish this when I've finished the book, but I doubt my recommendations will change.  Yes, I am a huge fan of Anne Rice, but I would have given this book a low rating had it been deserved.<br /><br />I completely forgot about this review- to be honest- and finished the book a while ago.  I simply loved it.  The complaints that I see in other reviews really don't hold water.  People complain that 'Prince' is dealing with things covered in previous books, but it's actually dealing with unresolved issues.  I wondered if something would come of the issues that were handled in this book.  All I can say is this:  I'm cynical and skeptical and have not been a fan of some of Rice's previous works in the Chronicles.  Prince Lestat is a wonderful addition and I hope to God they keep coming.  There's something about this world that's very different from any other far reaching literary universe that I've visited.  I will always but a ticket to visit again.at it's finest, and I feel like I'm enjoying it even more than The Queen of the Damned.

B00M7URUUE|1|The movie was definitely not what I was expecting to see. Don't waste your time renting this.
B0012QRPU4|5|Heard from others I had to watch this series. From watching this pilot I Can see why.  So good!! Will be buying the rest of the season!!
B003E48AYC|5|I got this movie in blu ray so the graphics were amazing. The movie was awesome. A perfect storyline, plot, and everything else. They picked an amazing cast. This movie is a movie that you can watch over and over and over and over again and you'll never get tired of it. So if you're looking for adventure buy this. If you're looking for a new movie for family movie night buy this. You won't regret it.
1476746583|5|Beautiful story, beautifully written.
B0053YGYO4|5|Coldplay fans will not be disappointed with the latest offering from the group.  It is great from the first song to the last.  I had never ordered through Amazon.com before and was very impressed at the quick confirmation and delivery of my order.
B004O3YGMC|5|Got this on a deal one day. Totally worth it, works well even on my Linux desktop. Currently  installed on windows, Mac and Linux.
B003ZSI7R2|5|This was a gift for my Dad, and I was able to surprise him with something he had never heard before, so that was really cool.  We both really liked it, it has a great sound that mixes old and new.
0783226160|5|National Lampoon's animal house is the all-time classic college movie.  Other college movies like 'road trip' and 'revenge of the nerds' just don't come close to this comedic masterpiece.<BR>The movie is stolen by John Belushi who plays the beer-guzzling John 'bluto' blutarski, sergent-at-arms of the infamous 'Delta tau chi' fraternity.  The Deltas do several pranks during the movie, including stealing the answers for a test, looting the supermarket, and throwing a roman toga party.  TOGA!! <BR>In one of my favorite scenes in the movie, Bluto stuffs mashed potatoes in his mouth and slaps his cheeks, spewing potatoes all over the rival fraternity chairman.  &quot;I'm a zit. Get it?&quot; he proclaims.  Classic!  And so much of this movie was done spur of the moment, including Bluto smashing a beer can on his forehead, and Daniel Simpson 'd-day' Day playing his throat.  If you haven't seen this movie, go out and rent it.  You won't regret it.
0345803485|2|A Critique:<br />REVISING YOUR FIRST DRAFT BEFORE SENDING IT TO YOUR PUBLISHER IS A GOOD HABIT TO DEVELOP<br /><br />DOPE COVER ART THOUGH
B00SXK316E|5|Best thing produced since Lord of the Rings. Great adaptation from the book. Captivating characters. Incredible attention to detail in costumes, scene design, filming, accents the actors use.....everything. I hope they do all 8 books in the series, and add the Lord John Grey spin-off series as well. Not for the squeamish, however, as there is a lot of blood, violence and sex. The second half of the 1st season is even worse, though. And even then, the only truly negative cruel perverted character is Black Jack Randall, and most of the other characters are honorable folks with integrity. This is the opposite of Game of Thrones, where the ratio of bad guys to good guys is 100 to 1.
B00LXLM05I|5|Just all around good fun.the focus is on the lot and combat rather then unnecessary graphics and things
B00A0SKFLG|3|It was ok. Entertaining, I don't remember anything negative about it.
B0032CVAQQ|5|another great book to enhance your relationships!  it helps you understand what type of love language you and your partner are so you can work on what works for yourself and him/her. knowing how to keep the love tank full will keep you both satisfied with your needs.
6303165680|5|Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell at their finest.  Also a great performance by Kristin Scott-Thomas.  A must-see that is one of my very favorite romantic comedies.  And by all means, buy the soundtrack!  It's one of my  favorites, as well.
B004ZIHYXO|4|Great songs for the most part but you will like this if you like Pitbull.<br />I would recommend this product. I have already bought 3.
B000065V41|5|This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!!  Perfection my style.  Micheal Caine is the perfect scrooge! Gonzo is terrific as &quot;dickins&quot; doing the narration. I really enjoy watching this dvd over and over and over and over.
B002ZFQD04|5|Next best thing to being there. I thoroughly enjoyed it and worth the experience. If your a fan it's a must.
B001GQ2TGA|5|I am so happy that Enya put this album out, especially this year when times are so hard. It is beautifully done in that it has both a typical relaxing \\"Enya\\" spa like quality, and then she has added some fun twists to a few other songs for a bit of uplift. This album is great for Christmas, and can be listened to right on into January and February. I like how some artists are doing \\"winter\\" themes this year, so that you can listen to them even if your not Christian. You will not be disappointed in this lovely album. I miss winter very much, and feel lucky that she put this out, it takes my mind to soft falling snow in the mountains.....
B003XF1XOQ|5|This is an amazing book. You must get it! If you love adventure, action, and a touch of romance, this is deffinately the book for you! READ THE WHOLE SERIES. THE HUNGER GAMES BY SUZANNE COLLINS
B00C7KXUOE|5|Rich, extremely complex characterizations combined with beautiful cinematography.  Here the question is not necessarily &#34;whodunit,&#34; but &#34;why&#34;?
6305508550|5|If you've seen trailers/previews for this movie that make it look lame, ignore them. I saw this movie as an &quot;Oh this will do I suppose&quot; selection from Blockbuster, and found it HILARIOUS. The Bill Lundberg (the  boss) character is a hysterical characature; I've been exchanging Lundberg  quotes with a friend I work with for over a month. Get a six pack and a big  bag of chips, call some of the people from your office and kick back and  enjoy. Moments to watch for?...listen to the lead character explain to  Jennifer Aniston his new approach to his job.
B00HVIS0XS|5|Bought it for my 13 year old niece.  She loved it.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Wonderful read. It kept me intrigued and never wanted to set the book down. Very real-life scenario, which became a tear jerker at the end.
0790737345|4|For you Meg Ryan fans [10 years ago], this may well be the best performance of her career. She is utterly believable as a young heart surgeon who falls in love with a haunting Nicholas Cage [her angel]. I found Cage's performance strong [because he is a strong actor], but in this case, not strong enough to maintain my suspension of disbelief. The script is a little heavy-handed on the metaphors, like Ryan's \\"heart surgeon\\" role, and the fact that angels must literally \\"fall\\" out of their protective, celestial perches in order to experience what humans feel when they \\"fall in love.\\" I dunno. Maybe thse are minor points, but they seemed a tad hokey to me. What happens as we follow the foibles of Nick's coming to terms with human frailty - as well as the conclusion - are also a little predictable. I did, however, love Dennis Franz's performance as a fallen angel who learned to accept - and adapt to - his new role as a human being. He brought some much-needed levity to a script that might have otherwise found itself drowning in self-indulgence. In the end, this is a film about true love, and about how much we're willing to give - or let go of - in order to feel it in the first place. In a world where everything is over-analyzed, and caution is at an all-time high, it was a welcomed relief to visit this over-the-top look at romantic love one last time...before we forget it ever existed. Maybe that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B005VPRGB0|5|He loved it so much we couldn't get his attention until it was finished!  It came on time and complete.
B004VMUS9G|5|It's nice that you can name each alarm so you can use it as a reminder.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Excellent
B00NOPQU2K|4|Well written, ending a bit thin
0062213423|5|granddaughter really wanted and enjoyed this book. she said shed was letting all her friends look and read it as long as the gave back. really enjoyed it.
B00HXGD52O|5|What a ride, Colleen has yet again hit the ball out of the park! Never knowing exactly what was around the corner in Ugly Love<br /><br />Colleen takes you on a ride that pulls at your heart strings, and at one point tearing your guts out and stomping all over them. She has yet again found a way to arrange the words and dialogue on a page, so neatly that it's like you are wrapped up so cuddly and warm, you don't know what is next then it hits you, slaps you in the face, seriously what a bitch!!! I never saw that coming! I managed to make it to the end with tears rolling down my face.<br /><br />Ugly love was exactly that UGLY! Raw and emotional! One cannot forget the sex, sex, sex and more sex, and it was goooood! Not overdone, just right!<br /><br />For the world to be the beautiful place that it is we need the bad to show us the right way to appreciate what's good. Ugly can be beautiful!<br /><br />There is no other rating than to give this book 5 stars.
B008476HBM|5|I have seen the movie from 1995 over and over agin. After seeing the movie I enjoyed much more reading the book.
B003IDMUWC|5|I enjoyed the story cause as you are reading it's feels you with and see everything as it unfold!All years I like reading David Greshams books!the moment you start reading you don't want to stop reading and when your finished I like going some of the chapters just to relive that excitement!
020530902X|4|This is an authoritative reference book. It is small enough to be accessible and comprehensive enough to be valuable. Any writer could benefit from having it to hand, any time they are writing.
B00IINPXLW|2|One reviewer said she downloaded this and let her grandson take her device home and it came back with extra games on it and &quot;knows&quot; that her grandson didn't do it. I thought,  yeah right. But it happened to me and I have parental controls on so it's not possible for someone else to do it. All of a sudden a Halloween cut the rope pumpkin, or something like that, appeared on my device. A bit violating if you ask me! To bad cuz game is kinda fun.
B000NHG7BG|4|no problems with this DVD; this is a very good movie and I like the extra materia; in fact anything they still have and didn't add to the movie will make it better because it's so good
B000002H33|4|Master of puppets was one first Metallica albums that I bought, because I thought it was the best. Actually, there is some good stuff to listen on the albums. But some anthems of metal are combined with real losers. \\"Master of puppets\\", \\"Welcome Home\\", \\"Orion\\" are classics, but can you believe they're together with \\"Leper Mesiah\\" and \\"The thing that should not be\\" ? I really think this is not the same quality as \\"Ride the lightning\\", on which everything is great from begin to end.<br />Battery begins with a soft guitar intro : I really like that, like on \\"fight with fire\\" (Ride the lightning). A good guitar solo can be heard on this one, but I found the lyrics too repetitive. Though, it's still very far from the annoying repetitive Damage inc.<br />Master of Puppets may be the best song of Metallica. It's also very long, and I never get tired of it. It can be listened from begin to end without being bored. It also has a great double guitar solo.<br />Orion is my favorite track. At the time I was new to Metallica, it was the only piece I found really interesting, and I could have bought the CD only for this. It has a great bass solo, and you won't be able to hear any other of that quality, since Cliff Burton left us in a bus crash in september 1986, few months after the release of this album .
B007A2O3FO|5|The plot and story line is well thought out and executed in a fun and suspenseful way with a few twists that make this movie a wonderful experience.
B00BHMETKC|3|Not quite what I expected...I guess I just wanted more.
B00C7DGRL4|4|Great movie.  I give very few movies 5 stars.
B00FATEJYE|5|Awesome game and tons of fun. Great for unlocking stuff in console version and doing stuff in console version unlocks stuff in app version.
B00908DDZM|5|I didn't think I'd like this CD at first, but I fell in love with it overtime. I ended up buying it originally to just listen to the popular songs overtime, but then decided to listen to it all.
B004TBWFAO|1|I do not like someone else to read a book and than tell me the story this is not my type of reading. Style didn't like!!!!
B004APVI1G|5|Item as described. Fast shipping.
B004EBZX6W|5|I use this app to setup my range extender. It is very useful because you can move your range extender and walk around the house to see how far the range has extended! Very useful indeed! Recommended!
B008NMT684|4|2 year old son loves these puzzles. He does them over and over, soon I will buy the paid version to unlock more puzzles.
B00H71PHS0|5|Every minute is great acting and great story line to follow.  I watch each episode several times to catch all the meanings that follow through in story.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Awesome show. Now I am hocked on it. Video streaming was of excellent quality on my flat screen TV.
B00792EGES|5|Awesome show. I have seen this band 4 times live and they never disappoint. They bring 100% to the stage every time. Get this DVD. You will not be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5|absolutely love this game. my three yr old cant get enough. the Colorado are great as well as the need for strategy.
B001KT6JPA|4|Twisted crazy movie but good
B008PQ8XZK|5|I just love kate morton books . I've read all of them. This book is fantastic. It has drama murder and love. You just fall in love with her strong female characters. The story is simple yet intriguing. If you love house at riverton, you will love the secret keeper. Utterly unputdownable. I'm looking forward to her next book.
B00E00OGE2|4|my son loves this movie.  it is very cute and he watched it over and over when he first got it.
B00M5MBOG0|5|While some of the music and camerawork have a distinct 1970's feel, the action is amazing and can be further enhanced by huffing gasoline during the entirety of the film.
B00HB62MC0|4|Is Colleen Hoover one of my favorite authors? Absolutely<br />Have I read all of her books? Yes<br />Will I pre-order her next book? Yes<br />Was this my least favorite? Unfortunately, yes.<br /><br />For me, there's a fine line between true emotion and the overly dramatic, exaggerated type that rings hollow.  Ugly Love never made me emotional.  It didn't make my heart hurt at times like Hopeless or Maybe Someday did. A lot of it had to do with the formatting.  It translated for me as trying too hard. It was distracting and it pulled me out of many heartbreaking  moments rather than its intended reaction, which was to make me feel more.  However, I give respect to Colleen for trying something new and taking a chance. I am in awe of how she constantly comes up with wonderful stories that are always page-turners.<br /><br />My other issue has to do with the premise of the book.  The biggest strength of Colleen's books is the connection I have with her characters through their dialog with each other.  Since Miles refused to share anything with Tate, their interactions were mostly reduced to staring into each other's eyes and having sex.  I didn't have enough of a connection with them as a couple.  I felt as frustrated as Tate was wanting more from him. Maybe having POV from Miles in present day (not just at the end) would have helped me.<br /><br />Obviously, many people will love this book.  I wish I loved it more than I did, but I'm still glad I read it.
B004SKHJF2|5|Very good.
B000063DFN|5|This is my second best album by Maiden (My first is Seventh son). All the songs are amazing and this album is a must for all the metal fans.Unfortunately in the future they will not give us albums like this anymore.
B00BVYNSLC|5|This is an interesting series that is a suspenseful mystery.
B00ODGXCOS|5|Love this band. Love this album. If you're a fan of ITM, support them! Buy this album. You won't regret it.
B0094BB4TW|5|Love FB.
B002ZBZNPO|5|Evanescene is amazing..soulful and mystical.  I didn't even know this album existed. Thank you Amazon for always having what I need.
B00KNWYDU8|5|Fun, grasping, awesome, surprising, cool
B009329ZF2|3|The story line was a bit far fetched and the outcome was wat too predictable......not the first time an old battleship was pressed back into action to save the day.
B00AEFYK5M|5|!970 saw the release of Love Story,and luckily I got to see it in the theatre. It is probably Ryan O'Neal's finest hour on film. You can watch this with anybody.
B000TLMWMY|5|This is a stunning collection.  Eighty five-star reviews out of about ninety reviews... that says it all.  So does the list of artists and songs.  I bought the sampler DVD at Positively Records outside Philly and decided to trade up to the 2-DVD version within hours of my purchase.      I really hope that a Volume Two is in the works.  As a long-time Everly Brothers fan, I also hope that a DVD compilation of The Everly Brothers Show (Johnny's summer replacement series) is forthcoming.  They had an equally impressive list of guests and, similarly, had many unique pairings of artists.
B005ZOBNOI|4|When artfully written words can force a person to sob and truly reevaluate their outlook on life, it's safe to say a classic has been born. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a good cry.
B00AE2LJVS|5|I watched this movie in the theater and was absolutely drawn in to the story of this movie. Based on a true story, this movie told the story of these brothers with no regret of not hiding the visual and verbal details of what these brothers went through in an important period of their lives. Guy Pierce played his role really well embodying the bad guy you want to pull out of the screen and beat the snot out of. Shia LaBeouf's performance was almost enchanting being the weak brother who transformed to a respected man of the town like the rest of his brothers. Tom Hardy is just a solid sensational actor playing the tough and respected brother the town fears and highly respect. This is just a great freakin' movie!
0812983459|5|Beautifully written and very intelligent. Rachel Joyce is amazing with a remarkable gift for character development.
B0085YNML2|4|It was cute but very slow moving.  Get it for your kids to waste time on your Android or iPhone or tablets.
B00A3VLJCE|5|David Hockney had a great exhibit at the San Francisco De Young Museum, and it has been in London and other places. He showed screens of drawings he'd done on an iPad and mentioned Photoshop. As I've used Photoshop on a computer since it came out, and before that even helped write some graphic manipulation software in raw Postscript when Adobe started, I thought I'd get this software for my Kindle HD.<br /><br />So far it is really well done and a pleasure to use. I've been working my way through some excellent tutorials. I haven't tested it exhaustively, but so far it works really well and has a very pleasing user interface (now if only the desktop version of Photoshop were so clean).<br /><br />Despite coming from near Bradford where Hockney grew up, and having art lessons throughout my high school years, I don't think I can be another Hockney, but I am going to love using this software.  I hope to make some drawings and enhance/filter/modify photos for our TV and digital photo frames!<br /><br />It runs very well on the Kindle HD.
B00CN7YU18|4|Very good songs, specially the cd with modern classical music which are very relaxing
B000UR9T8C|3|Great action.  Good plot.  Cool villians.  A little more sentimentality than I expected.  There are too many tear-eyed scenes.  First Spiderman had the right blend of sentimentality, heart and action.  The second one dealt with some angst, overcoming and great action.  The third put too much sentimentality.  There are legitimate scenes that call for the tears, but the film was rank with weepy-ville.  Peter Parker is crying.  Sandman is crying.  May Jane is Crying.  Harry Osborune is crying.  Puh-lease.    Highly entertaining but borderlining on sappy.
B008602KQI|5|A movie cannot stay true to the book.  It would take too many hours to cover all the details found in the book, and nobody can sit and watch a movie that long!  The screenplay was as true to the book as it could be.  Well developed characters, well acted.  LOVED Hamish!
B00B2JSRAS|5|I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that if you can imagine it you can make it happen. It just gives you the tools to help you do it. No hokus pokus... just clear making sense. Have already reread and sent to friends.
B00006M183|4|Ive been a PJ fan for years and i must say, this album is nothing like their previous work.  Over the years PJ has amde the transition from the loud grunge band that it started as to more deep and circumspect lyrics.  Although this album lacks impact songs like \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Betterman\\", it still has potential to turn some heads with songs like \\"All or None\\" (more stereotypical PJ) and \\"Thumbing My Way\\", which sounds more like...well it doesnt sound like PJ thats for sure.either way this is still a great album which is definatly worth purchasing.
B00004YW6I|4|PJ Harvey intimated in a recent magazine interview that this is the least favourite album that she has created and that she can't listen to it now.  But, that aside, this is probably the most accessible album she has created and the one that got her the most critical acclaim.  And, despite her reservations, it gives us some great music to savour.<br /><br />`Big Exit' starts with typical PJ Harvey fervour and the incessant drumming, coupled with her vocals and lyrics makes for quite a heady start to the album.  My favourite track is `A Place Called Home' with an intro that gets straight into the action and then maintains the brooding feel throughout, just great stuff.<br /><br />PJ Harvey has such a distinctive sound and has managed to be fairly eclectic in her career.  Her dedication to her craft and refusal to pander to the media bulls**t is also refreshing and I loved how she refused to talk about aspects of her personal life that she felt were irrelevant to her music in the interview I read.  That singular vision and confidence translates into some wonderful music and this album is no exception.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B007HC3LHS|5|Elizabeth Haynes, you've scared me. A terrifying, well written novel which gripped me from the first sentence. Well  done,  cannot wait for your next work.
B003UESJFG|5|I love this movie, so does my family. It is a great family movie night choice. I especially love the combo pack, one dvd for the car and the blu-ray for the house. Pleased with the price as well.
B004SIP7F8|5|Love this movie.  Hot sex scenes.  Wish I could be that kind of wife except for getting killed by the husband crashing into the lover with a plane.  Perfect movie romantic great acting.
B00MIA0KGY|5|OK
0780622553|5|This was truly one of the best films of 1998, and BY FAR superior than Titanic. Some have claimed that the actors appear shallow and confused, but I think that's the way they should be. Their memories are erased and  replaced every night. The Strangers are a stroke of acting and costuming  genius. They glide and walk, searching for the human soul, in their black  trenchcoats and bald heads. But the best part of this movie is the scenery,  the huge skyscrapers and dark streets are amazing. Buy this DVD!
B00004T9UF|5|another Awesome cd, fast shipping, case had a tiny crack but otherwise amazing.
B00VFTD43A|4|Well done
B0000009SY|1|One of the greatest disasters in modern music is the way a peerlessly gifted and intelligent musician like Frank Zappa could end up frittering away his talent and career on garbage like this triple &quot;concept&quot; album. Did I say concept? That would just confer more dignity on this sophomoric nonsense than it deserves.<br />Too much of the music is bog-standard US AOR rock tarted up with occasional Zappa-esque touches just to remind you who you're listening to. This music is so dated it's almost prehistoric, but then it was hopelessly out-of-touch when it was released, so no great surprise there. &quot;Why Does It Hurt When I Pee&quot; is a funny hard rock parody - but is this really the best you could do Frank? Some of the jokes on Part I, are actually quite funny even if they display Frank's middle-aged rock star's sexism. The title track is a listenable three chord trick (one can almost hear Frank sneering at the simplicity of it all), and almost borders on the nostalgic but for Frank's customary inability to display anything that could reasonably considered a human emotion.<br />Parts 2 and 3 constitute two of the most dreadful sides of music you will ever have the misfortune to sit through: antiseptic, sterile music and puerile homophobic humour, all the while Frank sniggering at how funny he is - honestly, it could make you puke or cry or both. The one saving grace of this farrago is the track &quot;Watermelon In Easter Hay&quot;, which is a lovely, moving piece of music (no lyrics of course!). That track shows what Zappa was truly capable of, the rest shows why anybody with any sense gave up on Zappa long ago, leaving him to pathetic Zappaphiles who are incapable of admitting to any of the great man's (numerous) faults.
B000ICM0YY|3|(3.5/5 stars)<br /><br />Emil Gilels' recordings of Beethoven's sonatas were left incomplete due to his untimely passing in 1985. They are, however, complete enough that this collection withstands comparison to truly complete sets. As such, one must first acknowledge what is missing: #1 in F minor (Op. 2/1), #9 in E major (Op. 14/1), #22 in F major (Op. 54), #24 in F sharp major (Op. 78), and #32 in C minor (Op.111). The most glaring omission is the final sonata, but I would not be without the others either. It's hard to believe if you haven't experienced them, but there is no filler amongst Beethoven's published sonatas. The early electoral sonatas thrown in by DG have some curiosity value but do little to compensate for the missing published sonatas.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said for Gilels' powerful, virtuosic and flexible approach to the music, which never strains credibility. Sometimes the results are spectacular (examples: big, dramatic `Pathetique' and `Appassionata' sonatas, a virtuosic `Waldstein', and a rollicking Op. 10/3), but while he works within a successful template his playing often lacks warmth and sensitivity. The result is a  clinical `Hammerklavier', a bumbling first movement to the `Pastoral', a rather bland pair of Op. 2 sonatas, and the list goes on.  There are exceptions to these characterizations: His hushed pensive opening to Op. 109 defies the \\"vivace\\" indication, yet it is undeniably moving and his recording of that sonata remains a favorite. His Op. 110 is similarly convincing, conveying sensitivity and subtlety of feeling. Overall though, as I have conducted comparisons with other complete sets (Arrau, Goode, Gulda, and Kempff - mono), I have gradually lost interest in Gilels' recordings. Technically and intellectually he is a master of this music, but his playing lacks heart and spontaneity.<br /><br />The recordings were spread over the course of more than a decade and include the transition from analogue stereo to digital, yet the sound is strikingly uniform. Although very clear and well balanced, it has a clangy quality  that casts an edgy glare over the music. It's no showstopper, but it tends to exacerbate Gilels' lack of tonal warmth.<br /><br />There are many choices in this music, and although Gilels' was my first set of Beethoven sonatas it is not one I would recommend. If you are looking for virtuosic edge-of-your-seat playing, Gulda (on Eloquence) or Goode will satisfy while also conveying the warmth and spontaneity that are lacking in Gilels' set. If it is depth and introspection you seek, I recommend either Arrau (Decca) or Kempff (mono, DG import), each of which finds the heart of this music in their own way.

0553213105|5|It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic.  Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.<br /><br />Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about.  Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.<br /><br />Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income.  A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.<br /><br />Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett.  In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.<br /><br />Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman.  To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.<br /><br />But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction.  Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot.  The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.<br /><br />On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.<br /><br />The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel.  The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.<br /><br />The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter.  The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character.  The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects.  It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said.  Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.<br /><br />I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book.
B0007IN318|5|POMPEII<br />Robert Harris<br />(Random House 2003)<br /><br /> Here in \\"Pompeii\\", a novel, author Robert Harris has told the story of the eruption of Vesuvius (August 24-25 A.D.79) in verbal technicolor and has given us a cast of many characters from a clean cut young Roman engineer (Marcus Attilius) down to a couple of crafty villains (Corax and Ampliatus) who are almost stereotypically evil, one employed to kill Marcus, the other the employer. There is mystery, romance, adventure, fact and history aplenty in this great tale and it's a great read for everybody from the high school student to this writer who is past 90. But it's pretty much a guy's book. I read it when it was first published and have just reread it for the joy of reading a good story.<br /> The plot is simple. The Aqua Augusta, a 200 year old engineering miracle runs from the springs near Rome for a hundred miles south round the Bay of Naples behind Vesuvius and behind Pompeii to the Roman naval base of Misenum at a constant decline of one inch per hundred feet to deliver water by gravity flow to Pompeii, Herculaneum and Puteoli. But on August 22, two days before the eruption, Marcus Attilius, the young engineer just seconded by higher authority to take charge of the aqueduct, discovers two things. One, there is sulfur in the water. Two, somewhere up the line - past Pompeii but before Herculaneum the line is blocked and unless reopened in 24 hours half the population of Campania will have no water!<br /> The first 200 pages of this well researched novel set the stage for the eruption. You are in the naval base with Pliny the elder, the old general and avowed naturalist, now retired, run to fat but not to leisure. You are also there with Ampliatus, ex slave, cruel master, self-made millionaire with a beautiful daughter (Corelia), an ambitious politician and completely evil. You sail in the fast trireme with Pliny from Misenum to Pompeii where Atillius gathers his workmen and his supplies and goes out to find the stoppage; and you are with him while he finds and frees the obstruction just behind Vesuvius.<br /> In the meantime strange things are happening - waves on the sea, but no wind, flocks of birds where birds should not be flocking, vapor rising from the ground, wine shuddering in the wine glass - not much, but some, and more than intermittently. You are immersed in Roman culture, well and authoritatively set out by Mr. Harris; and you tend to recall your high school Latin (if you had it)<br /> The obstruction freed, Attilius, fascinated with the mountain, goes to the top of Vesuvius where justice done to Corax and you see the crater just about to erupt. Then on the way down he is flattened by the first explosion; and the last 75 pages of the book take you into the explosion, into Pompeii and into the ash.<br /> I had always thought that when Vesuvius erupted everything happened at once; people died instantly where they were and where they were embalmed for centuries until excavation stared in the 1800s.  Not so. The eruption went on for 36 hours in various stages and included several things - a rain of pumice which covered the surface of the ocean to three feet and made it impossible for the rowers on the trireme to dip their oars, rocks raining - small ones, big ones - heat, vapor and the huge explosions accompanied by waves of heat (500 degrees centigrade) which brought instantaneous death and destruction. Some numbers: The original explosion released the energy of 100,000 Hiroshima atom bombs. 1.5 million tons of magma and lava exited the crater at a speed of Mach1 and reached a height of 35,000 meters before dissipating over hundreds of square miles of land and sea.<br /> All this is laid out in language which I have called verbal Technicolor. Great descriptive writing. When you are through with this great read  - and, yes, Attilius and Coralia do escape the inferno - you know you have been treated to a really good book which took your mind off the troubles of our contemporary world. And that's eminently worth while!
B00QQW1ZIW|4|Good movie. Seems underrated to me. Story line was good and made me want to follow along even if it seemed a little outlandish towards the end.
B00005JNEI|1|Alright, first of all this movie jumps around and trys to make connections that do not exist.  It is like saying I was born in May so was JFK, I must be his reincarnated spirit.  Of course Moore is able to make this argument a little more effectively with relatively clever wit and use of very clever music. <br /> <br />I will hand it to him, he is bright, but the people that enjoy this and buy into perhaps are not or are just grossly uninformed.  I by no means am defending the President or saying that this administration has been perfect- but come on!!!! <br /> <br />I got my graduate degree in public policy and one thing I can say for sure is that it should definetly have focused a lot more on rhetoric and distorting the truth b/c that sadly is what people are now letting their votes be swung by. <br /> <br />And just by this movie, but by ads (on both sides of the aisle) and trash like this. <br /> <br />There are going to be people who love this, most of them will be relatively uninformed and already disliking the president and the war- this is merely fuel to their fire.

0792164903|3|I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. And I think he is long overdue for the best actor Academy Award.  Certainly Depp is very good in this part. My problem is not with Mr. Depp.<br />  One of the most delightful and also one of the drollest of American characters, Ichabod Crane, is here thrown completely away and replaced with what? Yet another of  Burton's arrested and disturbed innocents. Depp can play this role in his sleep, though this is of itself not necessarily bad - the same might have been said of Cary Grant during his run of sophisticated comedies. Obviously the star and director have a great deal of simpatico to judge by all the films they turn out together. Just now witness Willie Wonka, though I found that film's send off on Michael Jackson a different type of scream.<br />  This telling of Irving's tale has no interest in Irving's subtle and sly story. The original was carried along on some of the finest lyric prose ever penned by anyone. Burton never for a second catches Irving's delight in everyday human nature, the charm and whimsy of an author's happy bliss as he creates a great comic character - Ichabod. Instead he has latched with a death grip as it were to the macabre and can see nothing else. This annihilates more than the hapless victims of the rampaging ghostly horeseman. It also twists the sunny side of the story inside out turning everything into one long nightmare. Unrelieved by not one iota of the original's gentle humor the story unfolds as a black study of witchcraft and violent death -an historical slasher movie.  Gone with the humor is contrast and complexity. Is it possible few modern reviewers can appreciate just how wonderfully Irving juxtaposed the scary legend with one eye giving a very broad wink?<br />  What is perhaps more appalling in the overwhelming majority of the reviews here on Amazon is the non-chalance before the ridiculous number of scenes showing human beings suffering beheading. Counting the earlier battle scenes there must be well over twenty! Yes, I know there's a headless horsemen, but after a while the mayhem is just plain tawdry. Perhaps someone might be reminded - not a single person is beheaded in the original - Ichabod simply disappears from town. Is the American movie-going public considered so base and vulgar that directors have to completly revamp (sorry) the story of Sleepy Hollow into a chainsaw bloodfest?<br />  Personally I don't think children of ANY age can profit by such indiscriminate slaughter.  This is not lightheartedly revelry folks. Some of this stuff is repugnant. I certainly did not let my 15 year old watch this stuff - it's revolting. If a director wants to use such a moment he or she had better use a little restraint or after a while...there were good reasons why the Greek plays had violence offstage.<br />  In sum, absolutely not for impressionable young children. Tim Burton enjoyed revamping the story in his own image, and took, as always, the easy self-indulgent path.  Nothing lacking in the foreboding side of the story. Maybe someday a more mature director will return to this wonderful story, and we can enjoy Irving's fabulous story in a wiser and more fully mature reading. For now, unfortunately, this half-filled glass, the ghoulish half of the story, will be all Hollywood will deign to present.suffering beheading.

B00EJOCAYW|3|was a present
B0013O123Q|5|I saw that some lads put 1 star on here for it, saying it's too violent and the infamous rape scene was pure s***. Well, I am here to tell you that if you ever watch a Gaspar Noe film then what you are in for is not only shock to the eye, but to the mind, body, and soul. This is not for intended for viewers with a weak stomach, or immaturity,or pure shock value. There is so much more to a Noe film than gore and galore. You will see the same concept with I Stand Alone and Enter the Void, the less violent of his filmography. To the person that said they didn't understand it or was really confused, it's really not. You simply follow the sequences as if they were beginning to end instead of reversed. The point to this is, one simple word, anticipation. This film starts out extremely violent and does not let up at all throughtout the entire film, and everything you think you know, you don't because there's always a surprise waiting in that next chapter. Since everyone has already written a review and has given you the synopsis, then I am not going to give it to you again knowing what you already know now. Just prepare yourself for the real world. It's cruel, evil, nefarious, twisted, and unpreparing. He does not hold back and never glorifies any situation, even the party scene. It was uncomfortable for me, and when they make love. Every scene effects me many different ways. I have hatred for someone \\"forcing\\" me to watch this, but it's myself that wants to be on the same level as Noe. I will say this, it never ever gets easier to watch. I have probably seen it 15 times hoping I can get through it without closing my eyes and being so enraged that I can't do anything to help. It's an experience you will never forget but do not mistake this film for it's taboo subject matters. There is an actual point to it and if you can't figure it out, than Noe's films are not for you. Watch at your own risk and despite the rumors of the 10 minute rape scene, there are other scenes thatfeel just as horrific as the main rape scene. The end, knowing what you now know, makes this gritty film worse than you expected. ENJOY!!
B000MR9D5E|5|I bought the DVD version because everyone on amazon was complaining about the Blu-Ray version being sub-par in terms of the video quality. The DVD version has good quality footage; video quality is good so far (I have seen about 2 and a half DVDs) and the narration by Attenborough is good. Also, this DVD set indeed has the \\"behind the scenes\\" footage which supposedly the Blu-Ray version does not have. Overall, great product, good for a gift and great price too!

1451627289|1|I hesitate to write this in view of Stephen King's reputation and popularity.  But having just finished this 848-page tome I am let down and disapopointed.  Mr. King labored for two years and amassed very much research to bring forth a novelistic mouse.  The whole wormhole concept as he described it was just plain fanciful although, as usual, he evoked old Maine and New England with his usual luscious attentivity to nostalgic detail.  Re the wormhole fantasy, that's OK, storywriter's license.  But to then get bogged down and more bogged down in minutiae about the Oswalds in the leadup to the assassination was a waste of time.  Further, I had hoped to find in King's imagination some sort of plausible reconstruct of what the world might have been like after his character succeeded and the assasination had been averted.  But no, just a few unpersuasive dystopian pages in Chapters 30 and 31.  That said, I did find the love story between King's protagonist and his beloved Sadie somewhat appealing and persuasively romantic.  But THAT said, the ultimate end of the novel was a real downer.  To preserve Sadies's life who otherwise died in preventing Oswald's attempt, King's protaganist goes back in time one last time to save her, he ignores Oswald, and Kennedy dies.  Bummer.<br />P.S.  I did much appreciate and applaud Mr. King for the grace note in his Afterward at the very end to give a bow to the unsung late Jack Finney, author of a novel called \\"Time and Again\\" and unacknowledged inspirer of the later Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour movie \\"Somewhere in Time\\" (see my reviews of each). That novel and that movie are musts for people intelligently interested in the theme of time-travel.

B00STPQ8PO|1|So we watched Exodus: Gods and Kings last night. I’ve got to say it was the most disappointing & worst show I’ve seen in quite a few years. If possible I would give it zero stars or negative stars. Yes, I know it was a Hollywood production; however, there have been quite a few of those that were actually great movies. Spoiler alerts if you want to waste 2 ½ hours of your life on a work of fiction. They took God out of the story-No, ‘Let My People Go’, no questions or warnings to Pharaoh. No staff which Aaron used as directed by God. You’ve got a petulant Moses that constantly argues with ‘God’ who is portrayed by a young boy with a bad attitude and vengeance against everyone. They keep Moses as more of a general – who trains the slaves to fight (ala Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) – rather than the Prophet he was that turned to God for direction in all his doings.<br />The first signs when Moses went to Pharaoh, the staff turning into a serpent-totally not shown.  Aaron as the spokesman-nope, in this farce Moses takes care of everything himself. They also took the plagues that were caused by God, thru his prophet, into just mishaps that happened to fit the plagues. The three days of darkness-only the Israelites had light in their dwellings-the Egyptians had no light at all for those three days – Hollywood changed the story again, let’s give light to everyone.<br />Cloud by day and pillar of fire by night to lead the Israelites where they needed to go-nope, let’s change it to Moses deciding all by himself which way to go. Crossing the Red Sea on DRY ground, again changed-let’s start wading up past our waists in the water, also lets have Moses stay behind and almost get drowned as well.  All the Egyptians that followed into the sea were drowned and not one remained- changed again that some survived and washed up on shore.<br />The Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses while on Mount Sinai – engraved on stone tablets, by the finger of God;the movie decided to again take God out of the equation and had Moses engrave them himself.<br />If this had been portrayed as just a fiction story and not an occurrence in the Bible, it would have been an ok movie. However, when the storyline and script are already outlined for you, how and what exactly occurred, it’s pretty darn stupid to ignore it all. It seems to be an unfortunate attitude in this day and age that God is being taken out of all that happens and has happened and are giving tribute to man as the one who did it. This follows along the lines of other things in history – like saying that the Holocaust atrocities never happened, it’s just a story something that the Jews made up; that slavery and the atrocities there never happened. Just because man changes the history books and stories doesn’t change the facts.
B007T8BYWE|5|Fun, addictive logic based puzzle. The 5 x 5 puzzles are rather easy, but the larger puzzles are a challenge.
B00EMXBDMA|5|I can't recall the last time I picked up a book that kept me at the edge of my seat and wishing - no - demanding that my body fight off sleep so that I could get to the end. More than anything else, Weir truly made me believe a whole planet was rooting for Mark Wattney because I was rooting for him too. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B00005AXEL|3|When I heard that Stevie Nicks had hooked up with Sheryl Crow, one of the most vapid and inexplicably well-regarded songwriters to come down the line in many years, I shuddered.  Magical Stevie joining the ranks of trendy singer-songwriters?  A frightening prospect.  Fortunately, Crow only contributes one song in its entirety, an easily-overlooked wisp of a tune called &quot;It's Only Love.&quot;  On the other hand, she does co-produce two of the best tracks: &quot;Candlebright,&quot; with its distinctive mandolin, and &quot;Sorceror,&quot; which, as the title implies, touches on the mystical themes Stevie is known for.<br />The title track is a nicely upbeat piece that could well have been a single, and &quot;Planets of the Universe,&quot; the first single proper, is also great (despite it's awkwardly-phrased title.)  Note the musical nod to &quot;Rhiannon&quot; in the guitar line.<br />After the four very strong opening cuts, the album disappointingly settles into a comfortable middle of the road pop sensibility.  It's all pleasant enough, but not particularly memorable.  Only &quot;Fall From Grace,&quot; which comes near the end, sparks of some of the life that infused the first third of the album.  Sarah McLachlan, whom I've been a fan of since 1991, contributes vocals, piano and guitar to the final track, &quot;Love Is.&quot;  But like much of Sarah's own latest album, it's rather mundane.<br />While this sort of material isn't uncommon to Nicks' solo work or to Fleetwood Mac, it isn't the music I enjoy most.  If you prefer the harder, edgier side of Stevie Nicks, this record only partially satisfies.
B00IUBXPEY|5|This sequel stands on its own, expect to see a third.<br />Expect to see a lot more of Jennifer Lawrence.

B009186E3O|5|I think that what makes the documentary at the heart of this box set so refreshing is the fact it was shot without the preconception that it would be shown anywhere. It was really meant to be a trial run, a kind of \\"proof of concept\\" aimed to get the Rolling Stones ready for a more professional piece along the lines of the Beatles' Hard Day's Night, which had come out a year earlier. At the time this was shot, the Stones were obviously already popular and still a bit uncomfortable with and confused by their status as stars and sex symbols. They're still sorting it out, not even sure they want to be pop stars or what it all means. It's nice to see that when they are asked questions about who they are and what they stand for, they seem to be thinking it through and working it out, not all that polished, they're puzzling a bit on the difference between who they are and the role they play on stage and in front of fans and reporters. Some of the best bits are of them working out songs, improvising, or singing around the piano, relaxed.<br /><br />They are so young here. More importantly, they're coming at the cusp of the social revolutions of the late 60s and just beginning to glimpse its potential and realizing they were a part of it. It's really worth watching as a document of an era of transition. Well-dressed kids, coming to their concerts, and then mobbing the stage. The documentary was painstakingly reconstructed for the 50th Anniversary of the Rolling Stones, and the footage looks great. The soundtrack, from both the Rolling Stones and the Andrew Oldham Orchestra, feels fresh and alive and sounds amazing. This set comes with a DVD and Blu-Ray copy of the film, including the original 35-minute cut by Peter Whitehead, a longer 50-minute producer's cut by Oldham, their manager, and then an even-longer 65-minute extension done by ABKCO music, for which they had to restore all of the original bits as well as collate video with audio from various sources. (There's also a documentary on both the Blu-Ray and the dvd about the difficult restoration process - this was obviously a labor of love.) The special set also comes with a soundtrack album and a CD - as well as the vinyl LP! - of a live concert in England, and comes with a facsimile of the poster for the concert in Belfast. The box set would make a perfect gift for Rolling Stones fans - but the dvd or Blu-Ray by themselves are highly recommended for fans of music or of documentaries, and especially those interested in the '60s. Maybe not as important as [[ASIN:B002P8O29K Gimme Shelter]] (which came near the end of the revolutionary era that's just beginning here), or as polished as [[ASIN:B001G0INIE Shine A Light]] (which shows a mature group much later, still enjoying the music) but in some ways I like this best, as they feel young and hopeful and have an unknown future ahead of them. It feels quite fresh and is a great piece, well worth watching.

B0000AQS0F|5|It is quite unbelievable that Fox network, after viewing the show many times has messed up the timing of the series (Second eps. first, first eps. last), and consequently killed the show because most of the viewers did not have a clue as which is which since the start of the series around year 2002. After a friend has recommanded to me the entire DVD set, I was still being skeptic about the name firefly, it sounded like a low budget sci/fi that did not make it to the big screen, boy was I ever wrong! I not only became a loyal fan and a active messenger for many of mine friends, but I also felt like part of the crew on a lonely cold space journey. Never before was I ever so attatched a TV series. <br />I've been anticipating the movie for quite a while and it is worth every minute; however, certain outcomes from the movie in my opinion will definitely impact the future of the show if there is one. Unless they come up with something very creative like a prequel, or more things they did on their journey before the movie. Although there are a lot of unanswered questions still out there as to what is the true background of the preacher and the outcome of the captain and the companion's relationship etc. Many of the questions surrending the \\"gifted child\\" has been answered which is a big selling point of the show. If Josh Whedon wanted the show to contiune, he wouldn't have answered many of the questions in the movie.  <br />In my opinion, the series premier is a two hour episode which is pretty much like a movie and let's just view the movie as a two hour and half Grand Finale. If there will be future epsodes, I will be very much interested, so will every single person I told about this show.  <br />Peace

B00CWVGBEO|5|For just shallow, non-involved entertainment it was great.  Shoot-em-up, bang, bang.  Not greatly<br />believable but most mindless entertainment isn't.  Arnold is still the quintessential hero, however<br />unbelievable it is.
B000O8OTNC|5|I always took pride in keeping my tools sharp. I still do and with this tool I can maintain my knives in a fraction of the time in comparison with my whet stones.
B0094BB4TW|5|I really like this app becuase my friends always get angry if i dont respond right away and it also lets me watch the vids that people post authough sometimes they dont always work but that might have to do with the internet konking out not the app
B00BD99JMW|5|a great series that you don't want end.  the life lessons and truths are spot on and moving.  the whole series is very creative and I highly recommend reading it.
B00KWVZ750|1|no directions were given for 1st time players .
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This game is the exact same as the original if not pretty dang close. If you got minecraft pocket edition and didn't like it get this to replace it.
B007N85POS|4|Great for 5 yrs and up.. Seems to be entertaining and easy for this 5 yr old.  And it's free
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great if I did not have to work and did not have kids. Probably done in a day
1400067820|3|Tabeb is even more infuriating to read than in his previous books where he manages to call everybody names! It's easy, when you have both a PhD and MBA, have worked in academia, independently and on Wall Street, you can feel free to criticize doctors and MBAs, academics and bankers. The only population that seems alright in his eyes are entrepreneurs. In criticizing everyone, Taleb manages to make his book more controversial, which of course increases sales, but also makes him culprit of the very hubris and over-confidence he blames a lot of people for! For instance, one of his areas of hubris is that he knows everything: history, philosophy, economics, etc. better than the experts he derails.<br />Furthermore, Taleb's writing style is pretty terrible (he must not gone through a lot of rounds of edits, it feels like the draft was published as is!), I read some criticisms about the facts he talks about, namely that some of them are inacurate.<br />The redeeming feature of the book is the central idea itself, which is a new paradigm for many areas of life and expands and generalizes the notion of optionality.
B00BAXFECK|4|Rendering of events too tedious with unwanted detail. Personal weakness of substance abuse almost too much tto bear for reader. Still narrative draws you in.
B00AYR2FOI|5|just fantastic.
B009LH1WLO|5|Best Supernatural episode yet!  Just watched this one and Swoon, when the tent's a rockin' don't come a knockin'.  Felicia Day - \\"I'm the one who saves damsels in distress around here\\" and then a nice nerdy lesbian kiss!  :)  Even Dean can't help but get into some of the quirky LARP action in the end.  Great fun episode.
