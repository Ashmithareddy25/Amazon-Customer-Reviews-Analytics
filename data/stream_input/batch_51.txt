B0041LN1L4|4|I like it but could not use it. If your car has front bumper sensors you cannot use this item the car recognizes it as an obstruction and the senors will go off till you remove it. Too bad
B00IQZ9LZG|5|Well made product no complaints with it.
B000B62150|3|I presume it would be OK (based on the use by the camper in the next spot), but since it arrived missing half the parts, it was returned for a refund.
B0006IX7WY|5|Handy buggers!
B00FJUZY8Y|5|Bought this for work for caterers that come in.  Works fantastic.  Very sturdy and well made.  Wheels works great.  Love that all 4 rotate.  Now my coworkers keep stealing it for their projects.  Fits nicely in the hallway so they can pull files.  Great all around work cart !
B004K7F8PQ|5|A very good creeper. Very well made, it's heavy. Very good design in the way both ends can to tipped up so you don't slide out of it when you are propped up. The covering is heavy should last for some time under daily use. If you are looking for a very good creeper I would recommend this one.
B00JA390S6|5|I purchases the 24&#34; and 19&#34; PIAA Aero Vogue Silicon wipers for my mom's 2005 Camry. It has been using Bosch Icon wipers for the past 3 years and have worked well, but a recent storm cracked the windshield and had to be replaced. When that was done, I installed the new PIAA wipers. They do an amazing job since they are made from silicon. It cleans the water off, does not streak or chatter, and there is no noise. It was a toss up between the Aero Vogue and the Si-Tech, but the Aero Vogue is still made in Japan while the Si-Tech is now being made in Vietnam (lower quality).<br /><br />On a side note, I did try PIAA wipers on my 2009 Altima. The Aero Vogue 26 or 28&#34; on the drivers side and 17&#34; on the passenger side, but due to the curvature of the glass, several inches of the blade do not even touch the glass. I then tried the Si-Tech 26&#34; and 17&#34; on the Altima, and they do it and make full contact with the glass. But when used at high wiper speed, part of the wiper place arm is turning under and makes a loud squeaking noise. So I ended up buying a new pair of Bosch Icons for the Altima.
B00OZVOHTK|1|My check engine light for vapor leak came back  after installation. My mechanic did smoke testing and could not find any leaks. I will have him remove and install a new canister from Toyota at my expense. Do not buy this defective product!
B007KPUM06|2|First let me say I am a Kuryakyn fan. I have found the quality of their products to be top notch. That is until I purchased this cover. Or should  say purchased two of these covers. They are made out of plastic. I installed the first one and noticed it was a bit flimsy but was pleased with the way it looked. Less than a week later I came out of a joint and noticed the cover was missing. I was Pi$$ed to say the least because it looked like someone had ripped it off as the two attachment tabs were all that remained of the cover. I chalked it up to bad blood and ordered a second one. This one lasted exactly 45 minutes. I used the &#34;spacing tabs&#34; this time and blue locktite on the screws making sure to not over tighten and crack the tabs. Granted we have bad roads in CT that shake a bike and rider to pieces but after a short ride I got off the bike and there it wasn't. Again, all that remained were the two tabs, the cover being gone. All I can say is stay away from this unless you live in the south where the roads are smooth. I am looking for a metal replacement. Granted it won't look as good but it will at least last a few years. I gave it a second star solely because I don't hate the look.
B00KO77C5A|4|I'm a pretty strong guy and it's fairly heavy and hard to move alone not impossible just hard. It is awesome to have the bed back to normal when you don't need the hitch. Not as quiet or as easy to hook up as my curt q20 but still nice.
B00CFMF50G|5|Fits our 2013 Ford Explore (over the 3rd row seats) perfectly. Good quality and plenty heavy duty enough for anything you may want to carry in the back of a SUV. Some reviews complain about the liner being slippery, it appears to be a heavy duty playable plastic that is slightly slick but not bad at all in my opinion. Very happy with this liner...
B001UCEJKY|5|Did fit SC430 transmission pan.
B006O0F7OE|5|Worked perfect
B00JX00VJ8|5|AAA
B00MIZT7OK|5|Great Deal. Thank You. Love it!
B003K20JXI|5|I love these!  They work equally great with hot or cold beverages.<br />They will keep ice and water all night.<br />Being squat they don't turn over easily.
B0009OMYCO|5|Great product and price. Super fast shipping
B00QMVKIEO|3|Its ok. Kinda hard to make it look nice. I took over 2 hours putting just one on to make it look perfect and it still just looks ok. Quite impossible to not have jagged lines. I think plasti dip is the way to go.
B00AZXBDY4|5|Perfect tune-up kit for my Troybuilt mower.
B0126YHORE|5|[[VIDEOID:792d04107fe5d920e40dc6ae97dc8636]]Worked great for my little project. Recently I planned to upgrade all yellowish interior light in my wife's Mini Cooper to white light. These LED bulbs came to my rescue because they did what I needed. They worked right out of the \\"package\\". I removed my previous manufacture bulbs, put in these LED bulbs and bam, the Cooper is now looking cool with them under white light. My wife loooovvvvveeeees these white light so much.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fills my entire window and easy to use but small when folded up. Love it.
B00CBDUH5C|1|This is one piece of crap. My car was hit so badly door cant even open but not one second of the accident was recorded. Even if i had already turned it to the most sensitive mode it would only record and lock those files when u bump into a pothole which is so useless. Trust me, You don't need this in your life.
B00PIJ0KYE|5|It's good.
B000YE584U|2|poor fit . had a little play after install due to outside diameter slightly small
B00GSAUHB8|5|Item was exactly as described and pictured by the seller the how to video and instructions were clear precise and super helpful. This shade it awesome it keeps my car cool even in the 90 degree humid weather in South FL.
B0000TREN2|5|Looks great in my new mancave!!!!
B00JYPQD8U|1|They look good but they are a pain to install and the peg design doesn't work. You can tighten them or else the shifter and rear brake won't work. And the rear break won't even lign up right.
B00T47KYZ6|4|Good
B002J7VX4Y|5|Does provide that new plastics smell to a car.  If you are looking for a fruit, look elsewhere.
B002VVIQ2U|5|Awesome brake shoes, my squeaking brakes are gone!!!!!!!!
B00DMOSGH0|1|The first time I put air into it, it blew apart at the seam.
B000HAEPAO|4|so far so good. I think it will serve it's purpose well. There is only one concern, and that's the question of durability in harsh weather conditions. I'll see later in a few months if it holds.
B00ESC2Y0A|5|Gift for husband, loves it
B00R8OLL7M|5|Great oem fit. Fog lights are exact fit. Includes all hardware. Installation can be done in two ways; utilize the provided toggle switch or tap into existing park lights wiring harness to use your headlight switch.
B006LIZ3D4|5|Working awesome
B00XZ9OMAC|5|I had the remote in a day or two . Dealer had it programmed in no time . Nice to have a remote that works
B00FZFOWIQ|5|A perfect fit for less money that does the job!!!!!
B007Z8VG30|5|Placed over Jeep Patriot brake light. Looks great.
B004QJH9M8|5|Great stuff!!!
B00WZX9Z7E|1|didn't like them there product didn't work like they stated.wasn't pleased
B00D9C2CDO|3|Worked well, but I was surprised to find some small cracks in material after just one use. Not as for the price .
B009KP77WU|5|Great.
B000C9LOHW|5|2005 Tahoe filter and quality gasket.
B006G14FK8|5|Works great on seldom driven sports car. Ready when called upon.
B006FZRCJG|3|It fits and works. Just wish I could have gotten one that matched the vans color instead of black.
B0002Q80RW|5|as expected
B008U1IBO8|3|It didn't fit my car
B00T8VG132|4|They were a lot less expensivte to buy by the pair than separate and I had to replace both,  thanks
B008MM0CV0|5|Arrived sooner that stated, works great
B00HVVVEYM|4|This is a great improvement on having only a basket hitch. I used ratchet straps to secure this as I don't trust the built in straps. Otherwise this is great.
B00D1A01ZK|5|Great product. Durable, heavy duty, weigh a lot so they stay in place. Back cargo mat fits great as well, and I have the sub-speaker. You just cut out that space. Would buy again.
B001PWA0IO|5|One of the best add on you can get for your tailgate.
B0068FWM70|5|Excellent
B00M6EIZVO|5|Wonderful as described very high quality glow resin 0 speckling it looks like one uniform rod of glow substance rather than the typical suspension of insoluble powder. It lasts after a good charge about 30min to 1.5 hours before the glow diminishes out of useful range. The titanium housing only had 2 machine marks neither are terribly noticeable. I was able to anodize my frame using borax water and 3 9v batteries to give my fob a blue color that was uniform and deep it seemed to take longer than other larger titanium pieces i have anodized but this ones finish seems tougher.  There are several common misnomers over glow in the dark products 1 that they last forever 2 they glow like the sun all day long. First the strontium based powder within the resin only lasts for 5-20 years before it will not glow even after being charged. The older zinc sulfide powders are worse they don't glow nearly as bright nor last as long chemically. Most consumer packaging rates the glow powder on how long from full charge till it drops below a threshold of visibility for how long they last this is something variable and everyones visual threshold is different so expecting this to shine like a flashlight is beyond what is expected. To get cameras to pick up the glow and focus in a dark room typically is achieved by controlling the shutter speed and over exposing the image this causes pictures of the product to look much brighter. The pictures for this product are accurate for about 30 seconds to 1 minute after which the glow gradually ramps down until I can't see it that takes about 30 min to a bit over an hour. But generally after 15 minutes in darkness the light emitted will drop below what is emitted by a tritium tube.
B00ELHT5JA|5|American made and the best!
B00ELHTC5C|5|Good stuff will see how it compares to mobile one
B00EC0Y6OA|5|This was super easy to install and remove the cracked mirror. I used a screwdriver to pry off the old one and it took less than 2 minutes from beginning to end. I'm a 51 year old female who refused to pay the dealer over $100 to replace the mirror on my 2012 Accord. I ordered the part for $10. It was a heated one and was surprised that there were no wired connections but it looks and works perfect. Thrilled!
B0048J1HII|1|Should have the road the reviews because yip,  the wires are reversed. Not cool. If anyone can point to info on how to reverse the pins,  I sure would appreciate it because I don't trust them to send one that works correctly. Thanks, fellow reviewers, and no thanks Ac Delco.
B001Q01K8Y|5|I purchased these fender well trims for my 2010 Honda Odyssey because one of the original pieces of trim had become detached and was hanging down over the wheel. The original trim was apparently stick-on of some sort. I replaced the trim over all 4 wheels for a consistent appearance and am very happy with these. I am definitely not a car expert of any kind but the installation was simple and they seem very secure. One note is that there were no instructions included in this kit at all. I fortunately was able to find the installation instructions on Honda's website with just a little searching. Overall, great product that improved the appearance of my vehicle for way less than the dealer would have charged.
B0054DALPW|5|Worked great
B00H6ETIWY|5|Very nice mirrors. I received them quickly and the price was reasonable. I installed them wrong at first and could not adjust to see behind me but figured it out and they work great
B00318RIMQ|5|Wow I just need to say these are way brighter than aftermarket,  I like more than led since the turn signal will blink to fast.  They are also more white,  so double win,  bright and no amber color.
B000GKD5NI|3|This was the only shade I could find for the rear window. The suctions come undone pretty often, but one or more of the others usually hold it up. I've only had to re-stick them a few times. Legally I'm sure it couldn't be any darker but I kinda wish it could.
B000X37WSC|4|Great for the price!
B009IKAARQ|5|These muthas are HUGE. I guess I should have read the other reviews. My one liter Iced Tea bottle is sloppy in these things. A small Coke can't be found, let alone stay in them if you hit a bump. Nothing wrong with the product or service, but get the smaller size for general use. These are for the Big Gulp they sell at the gas station.
B001CQWM8E|5|Very good mirror
B00D6AHVNK|5|After I bought one for myself & liked it so well, I bought 2 more for gifts.
B00M6I7EGM|3|It is a little flimsy, but it gets the job done. If you need to store a heavy or very large drink, this will not be appropriate. For standard drinks, this device will suffice.
B00279RELK|5|Delivered as promised
B0006GF5SK|5|Ok
B000C5I9MO|5|This is an awesome device , this should be standard on factory vehicles.
B00MR74AEG|5|Wow, less than $21. Works Great from my front door! Took me 2. minutes to have it programmed a d working GREAT. (Including reading instructions in the 2min. No rocket science involved) THANK YOU VERY MUch !!!
B000CPCOAM|4|Worked well for bleeding brakes on the race car. Do not over tighten.
B006VFEJJQ|5|A tight fit but has worked well.
B00M92Y5EY|5|fit well
B00K4G48IU|1|No good the thread onmuch e sandwich  plates is no good as will the tap they send me a kit the first time with missing  part and the second  one was no good as will quality  on thread on product is poor  and it was a waist of time and  And money took that much longer to get my engine  together
B001D8XA50|5|We didn't mount this on the wall or in a cupboard because it will stand on it's own on the counter. It's small but I love it. It's very well made and the little push door just springs back so neatly. I wish they made it a little bigger would be my only suggestion. I was very impressed with it and still am, even after a few months.
B001MU28TI|5|Have being driving with this wires for a year now, my engine went bad with a bad catalytic converter, had to rebuild useengine, used same wires with no issues!
B00D1CQVIY|5|Very nice i like my shiping
B004I2GEGK|4|maybe the cable is too short for some applications ?
B0009IK9DG|5|Good product.
B00M9IAJQQ|5|Keeps buckles from getting hot &, blocks smoke from getting on the seat!
B00LWHWEEA|4|Works good, solid value for the money.  Mine leaks slightly.
B00ITC7536|1|Unfortunately this one did not work for me.
B009R57LBU|5|fun for your car
B000C7VY8I|1|This killed my auto transmission in 2 months.  Bought this item and was installed by a professional at a shop.  The tranny cooler that is built in the radiator had a clog, so it forced all of the tranny fluid to burst out for the tanny vent.  I lost all of the tranny fluid in matter of minutes.  Had to get a tow truck and the tranny is completely busted.<br /><br />Check out another 1 star review by another person, same thing happened to him/her as well.  This is one piece of s*** product.
B00GYFKIAW|5|perfect
B00BITKV5G|5|The window replacement switch was an exact match. Only took 2 minutes to replace  on my 2005 Ford F150.
B00J9TXCGC|5|Looks really GREAT on My Wife's vehicle.  She loves it!!
B004L035UW|5|Works good on buggy
B004969RCI|5|Great
B006TGHWUA|4|Gets many compliments.
B00EAAOY1M|4|This is a well built box.  The handles are very sturdy and it has nice gasketing.<br />It came in damaged (looked like they pushed it around with a fork lift truck) so I had the delivery man make note of it before he left.  He also called it in.  There was no follow through on their part.  I tried repeatedly to get it filed online but it became such a pain I just gave up.  Fedex needs a lot of help, they will always be number two next to UPS.
B00S4HFNXK|4|These boat bumpers have been employed in the boundary waters of MI for the past few weeks. The lakes up there are expansive and can be surprisingly choppy. at times. This being the case, I always carry bumpers in the boat so I can protect the hull when I'm tied off to a dock at a marina or other lakeside stop. I tend to go through bumpers pretty quickly, actually (I have been replacing them every two years or so), so it was nice to have some new ones to test out. I thought these ones performed adequately - though not particularly better or worse than other bumpers (all round) I have used in the past. The biggest advantage these have over the round bumpers is that they can be stored much easier and you need fewer at a time on the side of the boat. (They seem to stay in place better than the round variety.) Though they are what I would call an &#34;economy&#34; bumper, they still held up very well - at least as well as I figured they would in rugged conditions. I liked them well enough that I could see myself purchasing more like this in the future.
B000BZEG86|5|I trust the Bosch brand for everything.
B000IMB5CC|5|Best Product, best price.
B00C7XVACA|5|great product. fit well.
B000GV5GD4|5|I'm glad I bought these instead of cobra slashcuts. They are well constructed, easy to install, and they make my cycle sound great.
B00CQBYVO2|4|They work just fine. We ride in muddy conditions.
B0083G3AXC|3|Ehhhh, these are ok, the cup holder's not very deep
B000IZ1CX6|5|better than the locals have
B000C36BLC|5|Works just as I wanted, perfectly nice and Quiet... Fast shipping and great company
B00FSC93WQ|5|Part is exactly what was discribed and it worked too. No defects or issues. Great price compared to others and on eBay.
B000J2JE0G|5|It is a bulb and it worked.
B000CIQ47S|5|Works as it should.
B000C30IPW|5|The Only Belt That Will Stop Corvette Belt Squeal
B000FQBWCY|5|Excellent product. Used it on a Jaguar XK convertible. Eyelet cable allowed the cable supplied to be permanently attached to the battery (Battery is in the trunk), an optional extension cable allows easy connection to the one attached to the battery. The CTEK unit has several charging modes and protects against over charging a car battery it gets warm when in use but not hot. There is an indicator that shows when battery is under full charging and then moves to trickle charge. Easy to use and is a fairly rugged device. This was also a great price. Have used it for three weeks so far and no issues reported.
B000C9JTGK|5|The product came in time, all was as advertised.  Thank you!
B003S8B5CS|2|didn't work
B00ODTBVPW|5|Great purchase. Had a problem with installation. Amazon replaced it, no questions asked. Car is running about 10 degrees cooler.
B004HOEK8I|1|Package arrived missing needed gaskets and having extras that were not needed. Had to order a set of needed gaskets from a local parts store just to finish the repair on my car very disappointed
B0002TDUW4|4|This product only works if you put time into the preparation. I agree with the statements about the buffer pad that is supplied. It will not really do the job that abrasive paper can.  Taking time to leave no shiny paint will benefit you in the end. Dabbing with the brush in all the corners will also make the roll on easier. I didn't do this but I think if a smooth roller was run over the final coat while its soft may take out some of the aggressiveness out of the surface. It's a lot rougher than the professional jobs. Take the time to mask off the items you don't want this stuff to get on because it sticks like they say. Use the cleaner that is mentioned in the instructions. It works very well. I even used it to clean the bed once it was sanded. Good stuff. One star off for the roughness. A smoother roll may help.
B0011FLODA|5|works great on my generator
B0091OE6K6|1|I ordered two of these and only received one in a torn package. awful!!!
B007BJBQ4C|5|Outstanding quality!  They even took the time to send a personally signed business card. Proud to display my EGA on my ride with this kind of quality.  Semper Fi
B00JYFDED2|5|Easy to use
B00W2RBI0K|5|The fit was perfect. Would recommend this to all.
B00YV48684|5|The keys worked great once I found someone that would cut blanks that they didn't sell to me.
B000AP0APA|5|Tough, strong, retains stretch well. Love.
B00G6IU98I|5|All the internet research I did to find an excellent vinyl paint lead me to this brand, and this prep cleaner makes easy (and stinky; use it outdoors) work of prepping the vinyl for the Colorbond paint.
B0055DN7M0|5|fit fine,good quality,
B001UC72UI|2|Apparently, these sensors don't fit or work with my car because the Check TPM Sensors light is STILL on. 😧
B00HTN3DGY|5|Works great!  I replaced an old rectangular one on a 1989 Fleetwood Southwind RV and this worked great!
B007N6YYI8|5|Great price for the strong arms and easy to install.
B00HVLMTV4|5|A great experience, thank you so much amazon.
B000BUR9O4|3|Uncertain
B0096UAZ6E|5|fast shipping bright lights excellent light for the price however the blue is not as dark as in the picture and the cord needs to be longer with an inline plug from the switch to help with install
B000C543GK|5|Awesome price and fast shipping
B004RNOVTM|5|How bad can a hose be.  Ordering and shipping easy, price great!
B0033WDDQA|4|This installed in 20 mins. And that was because it takes ten minutes to get the jack out and put it back. The only draw back is that it sticks out about 3 or 4 inches beyond the bumper. Other wise it is great and installed very easy.
B000X1XXXC|5|Weather Tech are great products
B000JLOXJO|3|Not ready to run out of the box
B00DV2Z2T8|5|These were perfect replacements!
B000NSLA9E|5|Perfect!
B000VVSPX2|5|Ordered 2 covers. One for a 2007 Ultra Classic, one for a 2008 GL1800 Gold Wing. Fit both bikes perfectly. Good quality. Arrived in timely manner.
B000A6X56U|5|OEM fit
B000UVKKNQ|5|Excellent
B00KTHY3F2|5|Great replacements!! Would recommend this purchase to a friend!!
B00KLKN7VI|5|Worked great at a fraction of the cost of a factory oem part.
B000JFJM14|1|Look elsewhere.  Poor seals made oil extraction even at warm temps impossible.  Brand new unit had seals that leaked around both pump plunger at the top cap and at the tubes.  Unreal the price on this is $90+.  Returned will seek another manufacturer.  Have used multiple extraction devices over the years, this one is the first that would not function at all.
B00GJKXW8M|5|I was skeptical when buying these.  I mounted 4 of them to the front of my pontoon boat for night time use.  They are the flood beams and at 1170 Lumen each, work well beyond my expectations.  For the price you can't beat them. Nice low profile doesn't have the gaudy look and are very functional.  Since this was a marine application, I changed out the mounting bolts to stainless steel.
B0009IQZQG|5|Ordered these for waxing and compound for car and they worked perfectly.
B007NQ61LG|5|Perfect Fit.  Took less than 60 seconds to do both!
B00GC3YQ1I|5|Good quality. Perfect replacements mats. Makes the jet skis look better than before.
B00NLIPZJ4|5|Good quality
B003054ZFI|5|Fixed my car right up! then the window motor gave out... always something...
B00TSA0THC|1|I was lead to believe that the product ordered was for my 2006 honda pilot...the blade was too long and didn't fit...very disappointed...
B004RFQIKA|5|These work just great
B00BCU60JM|5|Real nice looking helmet and excellent quality! Also they promised it would be delivered sooner than the date given. Had it for my road trip!
B00DEP3C9Y|4|Fit was great
B0054T95ZS|5|vg quality
B00MMXHUAG|4|Works: (purchased for a VW Golf 2015 TDI)<br />Pros: Will protect your back top of bumper from scuffing as you move items in and out of trunk. Price is good.<br /><br />Cons.  The arc of the protector is not exactly the same as the arc of the bumper.  It may be generic and not specific to the Golf.  It is not really as big as it could be... so be careful when sliding stuff out the trunk, keep your scuffing centered.  It uses two 1/2&#34; strips of double back tape to mount to the bumper.  And the tape is thick, leaving room underneath for dirt to accumulate.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:  This works but I would hope that someone somewhere could make a better one.
B00FBOW814|5|No brainer works excellent
B00BSKYM82|5|Used on the soles of my LOUBOUTIN shoes - to keep the red paint from scratching. It works!
B00P057UIA|5|Looks Great On My Car! Fast Shipping!!
B0031I9ZJK|4|Came in the same packaging that you would get from a GM dealer.<br />Chevrolet gets about $15 with tax on this item.<br />This is a snap to replace on my 2004 2500HD Duramax.<br />My mirror temperature was reading weird and this fixed that problem.<br />It's about an hour job and simple.
B00KJGPN2K|5|Pretty over the top with all this thing does. Way, way better than my Scala Q2. Great sound, 54 pages of instructions, ease of mounting, great sound. AND&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; I like the Sena app for my smart phone, makes setting easy. Picks up my GPS instructions and music from cell-unlike the Q2 that only would use the cell phone.
B003E1O9ZE|5|Perfect
B00CQN8BSM|5|I recon it filters as it should- 200 miles and no problems! Quick shipping and a quality product
B007NCFH1K|5|Easy to install, and worked like a champ.
B00P2D3VZG|5|It was supposed to be for my dome light (2000 Toyota Celica GT) but it didnt fit because that year Celica requires a double ended bulb. Anyways, I improvised and put these as my license plate lights on my trunk and they are beautiful! The white light really makes the car stand out from behind and it's so nice that it even shines a bit on the ground which gives it a nice look. Would definitely buy again!
B000GZPLE4|5|perfect .That  was what I needed.
B00L26Q81Q|5|Looks dope. Now how long will they last is the question. I'm sure they look better at night... thx. If they burn out that will suck tho. Fut perfect in my 2011 328i xdrive 2 door cope. Had to adjust the light fixture it self so the logo would be straight but took 10 min if that.
B003JDKSO8|5|No more stress about sugar or piss in my YJ gas tank!
B004GC78A8|5|Perfect fit
B00B1XHA5S|5|As advertised
B004ZF39T0|3|Kit states 6000k but the bulbs are much closer to 8000k.  Definitely more blueish than I expected.  6000k should be bright white and have only a hint of blue.<br /><br />No mounting hardware for the ballast &#34;brackets&#34;, only the small screws and nuts to mount the ballasts to the mounting plates.<br /><br />The &#34;extra&#34; harness I also ordered from Kensun only had ONE resistor on it so it gives me a &#34;headlight out&#34; warning from my 2015 Jeep Cherokee.  The harness is supposed to eliminate ANY errors you have from installed non-halogen, factory bulbs.  Different review on that.<br /><br />I'll have to see if I can get used to the blueish light output of the bulbs or get new ones.  The GE LED Nighthawk headlights that I bought previously for my 2010 Wrangler is definitely a bright white and these are clearly blue from a side by side comparison.<br /><br />I had to use the old gaskets from the factory bulbs because the gaskets that come with the new bulbs are too &#34;fat&#34; to fit back into the factory headlight housings.<br /><br />Because of the bad experience with the additional harness and the color of the bulbs, I don't have 100% faith in this brand.  I hope the bulbs and ballasts last.  My Acura TSX never had any problems with the factory HIDs, so time will tell.  Good luck!!
B004RDNOTA|5|Works like new easy install no brainer
B000CK7L1O|2|Brake pad shims adhesive is weak and two of the shims migrated after one week creating noise. Attempted to re-adhere only to have them fail within two days...plenty of brake grease used between caliper and shim to help but without success. Other than the shims moving the pads work as advertised. Most agree that functioning noisy brakes are still not acceptable so, I will be replacing them.
B00CXV174W|3|The cord is a pain in the neck
B010EYQ60E|5|...wonderful way to display your patriotism and support a great leader...
B00LCFOIVE|5|look really nice on the the car dressed it up some.
B007O3N75Q|4|Fixed the issue of water running into the passenger side floor - too bad Chrysler can't spend the money and fix it right the first time.
B00BTLAPTA|5|Good part went on easily
B001O0XMHS|3|One rear caliper became frozen and ate the Akebono pads, which I believe is the brand Honda used as the original.  Wagner was on sale for half the price and rear brake is not that critical anyway, so why not?  While, everything seemed to be working fine and I didn't notice anything different, until later I had two new rotors put on.  The rotor on the side with Akebono pads is much hotter after hard braking, and the pads quickly made the machined rotor surface much smoother than the side with this Wagner.  We all know from General Physics that braking is pretty much a process transforming kinetic energy to heat.  Less heat means less braking, right?  So, in this quite unscientific experiment, Akebono pads proved to be a superior product.  In the future, I am going to buy only Akebono pads, even I probably need to pay a much higher price.
B0015PN010|5|Very solid tool, like the other OTC ball joint tool I bought. Should be useful for many years.
B006NJVS62|5|Good oil for guzzi
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Great organizer. Love that the trash bag isn't huge - who needs to store a bunch of trash in the car!?!
B00IT9MBV0|1|received on time which was nice. however, after putting on my car window, I noticed not even 24 hous later my decal was discolored and the part that was clear was turning a milky color. very disappointed especially since this was part of a birthday present.
B0051MYLS4|3|With too much pressure, the wand handle snaps.
B000GZGV3E|5|Excellent spark plug s.
B009S69MVK|5|Fit perfect
B007QC3HP0|5|This part- while not absolutely necessary to make a good repair- will save a LOT of time and frustration. Highly recommended by this long-time auto mechanic/enthusiast!  The wiring description below is for the BTSI solenoid (shifter interlock). If the purple wire breaks, the key will not come out of the ignition lock.

B00PZYEQQA|1|I purchased this bulb to replace the tail light on my bike. Incandescent tail lights have two filaments, one dim, for when the brake is not pressed but the vehicle is on, one bright for when the brake pedal is pushed. I assumed that this bulb would function in the same way, but it doesn't. It is either off, even when the vehicle is on, or lit up when the brake pedal is pressed. It does function, and the LEDs are bright, but the description should not say &#34;tail light&#34; as it is not a suitable replacement tail light.
B001HNYW6W|5|was just fine
B0012WTYHU|5|Installed easily and working fine for the past few months. No problems. Great price!
B003TXJ4SY|5|Very nice quality of the embroidered logo and also has a good tight fit on the seats . I would definitely recommend these covers to any Washington Redskins fan or to anyone who wants a great looking seat cover .
B002GQEZH0|1|Where are the valve spring adapters described in the product description? I received two of these tools without the valve spring adapters. This tool can't be very useful without them. I ended up sending both tools back.
B007FHH6SK|5|The item is really good, and fix my Toyota Corolla 2003.
B00M78820I|5|I received my car shade very quickly and was very glad to have it for a 95 degree day.  It's great!  Folds up conveniently when not in use.
B00J7RB72M|5|Great product! Holds all dvds as advertised!
B00A0XTT18|5|Works Great. Easy to install. Low profile.  Use it on a tow behind cargo trailer. Works good and looks good too.
B000E8T81U|5|I've been using this on my 2006 CBR1000RR for years! Same specs at stock filter, with better parts (silicone vs rubber). Fits a plethora of other motorcycles as well. Save yourself some time by having it delivered to your door, and definitely save yourself money... At least 1/3 of the price!
B006QH561E|3|Great battery but didn't fit my 2003 Ford Ranger - had to have some metal work done.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Good product.  Seems to be holding up well.  Folds and stores easily.
B003MRJ7AC|5|Nice key chain.  Very pleased with the purchase.
B00T6JDUVC|5|Great LED driving lights and perfect quality. Used it on Honda Silverwing Scooter and it added my visibility on road significantly (and also with respect to ongoing traffic).
B00HVI7426|5|Wow! The key case was taped together and the electronics would not work. Took the tape off, replaced the battery and broken plastic key case parts, put the case around it and &#34;voilà&#34;.
B005DUFC0A|5|Perfect, as shown.
B004GFTC0E|5|This product works exactly as advertised.  The headlights on our '06 Pilot were dull and starting to yellow.  Restoring both lights took about 2 hours and the results were outstanding.  I will be ordering more of this product for our other vehicles.
B008MMOQKS|5|It cleaned the top very well and the put the protectant on it.  It looks great and well worth the money.
B00MJLH8W6|5|Very nice.  Easy to affix.  What I wanted is what I ordered and what I got.
B00JA3BMDW|5|This is a great thermometer - I use this for canning and it gives me fast results without me having to burn my fingers using a stick thermometer.
B007GLCMVQ|5|Amor All products work great.  This was a great price.
B0041C8T9M|5|Works Great! I would recommend this for any bike. Night and day difference!  This is a must have if you change exhaust and intake. Forget taking it to the shop to have it tuned, this is a little more expensive bet well worth the money. Very easy to install.
B00UNRUJ7E|5|I bought this for a hand crafted teardrop trailer. The trailer leaks and I needed a good cover to prevent leakage. The material is extra thick and made well. So far, so good but I haven't had a downpour on it. It fits perfect! The only thing I don't like are the strings.  It's made so well and the strings are so cheap. I fear that the ones sewn inside to draw it will break. The bag is quite small too.  Not sure if i can get it all back in there.  I am still very pleased and would by it again.
B00NNTAHOO|1|Did not stick to the car! I can't even use them they only thing they are good for is being used as a fridge magnet. I was very disappointed
B001FXRO7S|5|GREAT quality, both material-wise and print-wise.  SO glad I spent a few bucks more for the quality.
B00XZV2N9W|5|Worked great
B003ZA8WIE|5|these work great. highly recommended. light and easy to store, don't slip.
B00LMTNCQC|5|These replaced the 921 bulbs in our 2004 surveyor fit perfect and use much less energy so if we need to dry camp they won't kill the battery. Will be ordering again to replace the rest of the bulbs and to have a few extras
B008ZU834W|4|Good gloves but they would be better with leather. I'm not sure how long these will last.
B0042XORMI|4|Nice kit, but lost one star because there are no amp labels inside the case and the amperage is not easy to read on the fuses (usually amps are printed in white, but on these you have to squint to see that the number is molded into the translucent plastic
B009B5ROYU|4|Dropped them in and they worked great! 2012 f150xlt s-cab with Ecoboost. Great but
B00SOH7VCQ|3|Very bright but some hade glue behind the lenses and others did not and were fine, so you can't put the dissimilar fixtures next to each other or the flaw will be apparent, a little more Q.C. At the factory.
B000BWEH6K|5|Arrived on time and stuck to the window well. Great product for the price.
B00SIA7HJ6|5|Works like a charm. It worked with my battery but the big plus is that the light also works AND it charges all my devices when going out of town. It charges the latest iPhone 6 Plus (even though phone tell you to use original charges, it charges fast). It also charged my Android phone and my tablet.<br />Highly recommended if you travel often.
B000O80AZS|5|Very convenient to have. Works great!
B007XVBTY0|5|2011 Dodge Challenger rt classic (6mt). It dropped the back 1.7 and the front 1.5  it took a good 2/2.5 hours to install  Love the look and fixed a lot of the problems I was having before.  You will need to order a camber kit for a perfect alignment  Overall highly recommend it
B0006JO0X8|5|8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^
B011FW5QVO|5|Very bright. Very clear projection. Good price and quality.
B000CRO4IK|5|very nice design and easy to use!
B00YJL5I9Y|5|I have a 1996 toyota camry they are alsome
B00SZFAIFE|5|I have a 2014 tundra platinum 4X4. This works amazingly! Dose everything as advertised. Quick easy install. All instructions are great.
B003CK3QVU|5|Everything is perfect
B00I80TOWY|5|Great quality.....
B0007LL0CO|5|Wiring was a challenge. I confirmed with a multimeter that the wiring matches the attached picture.
B0000WU82I|2|I used it to clean a bandsaw blade. I found out the hard way not to soak the blade in alconox detergent. It stripped of the teflon type coating. It works better when used in my ultrasonic cleaner to clean ammo brass.
B008Y3OU0Q|5|Fast service  item as described exelent
B004P1GK0Y|3|Replacement bolts would be great addition to this product. They allow your stock lights to be much brighter.
B000RGS4IM|4|Works great!
B00LNDP9CW|4|Fast shipping and a quality product for the price
B00THH9I7I|5|Great pressure gage
B000B6DGDG|4|good for price
B00KLKKZK4|5|Fits perfectly and hasn't leaked yet.
B0081ZZXO4|5|These are perfect for adding a vent on the newer gas cans with the stupid emissions crap. Drill a half inch hole and tap into place. Nice tight fit. No leak!
B000M5Y72A|4|They were a great improvement for my 2003 crown vic. See further down road and signs a lot better then OEM.
B0027UPQA0|5|Well engineered. High quality. Perfect fit for my Warn XT30 on Polaris Ranger Crew.
B00BMVQYTW|5|It was just what my husband needed. Very satisfied.
B00CFCI99K|5|Durable and super easy to clean, just spray em down with a hose & let them dry.
B005HAYDR4|5|Works great like having them to get into the lifted jeep and nice to hold while driving with out the doors
B005N0TS9G|1|Box was completely destroyed when i received it. Part was falling out of the side of the box at my front door. The part had many scratches and spots missing paint. As well as it looked like someone had dragged it down the street had to retap the threads on the ball joint. Do Not buy!
B00JH5O4OW|5|Perfect fit and easy installation on my 2011 Chevy silverado. I like the look and the added protection.
B00HNDE10M|5|Love it. Jason Richmond tx.
B003YLIHT8|5|fit like it was made too
B001IGE6ZK|5|Very mini.
B00QWBQMN0|1|Does not fit my 2009 BMW/E60 528IX.
B0067ECPS8|2|Does not meet the Kia standard.  The valve in the center is not there as it in in the Kia OEM filter.  This will void your warranty if you have a problem.
B0084UJHNO|5|Fits perfect, easy install.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Local store wanted 30 bucks for just one, you can't go wrong with these.
B004MNE200|2|I don't know what's wrong with me, I hate this thing. My husband thought this was a good idea and I guess I understand where he's coming from but I never park on it and that isn't on purpose. I get in the garage and I can close the door. Isn't that good enough?
B00TPQJ62S|5|fast shipping. great quality
B00KTHWXH2|5|After 6 years, my master key casing broke. This key will work as a a replacement. Go to Home Depot and get the key cut ( they will likely charge you to cut it) and then insert the chip into the key. Works like a charm.
B008R15IT2|4|Worked great! I highly recommend!
B00631TTXO|1|no llego
B006TMKRGA|5|one fourth the price of the local junk yard and this was new.........great price and great value
B00I4PE3A6|5|High quality and service
B00MA7744G|5|Awesome deal thanks
B00REV5C42|3|The material is pretty thin and it won't last very long but it does do the job at a budget.
B00UZ4NG4S|5|Fine
B003CJJOOY|5|Fits great around my staff terrier. Too bad it was made in China
B000GAN3I0|5|Perfect grease for lubing wheel bearings on bicycles.  This size container will last years.
B000N32110|5|Worked great to pick up 500lb motor.
B002WBRRO2|5|I'm a repeat customer...even for same part. Awesome product of course its SLP. I buy these to customize
B0032A60W2|2|Got mine a few months ago, I don't use it often and when I do it's not pushed to the limits but its already way out of calibration and won't zero. When it starts up it reads 55ftlbs and there's no way to zero it again besides returning it to the mfg.
B0007LD7SE|5|Perfect fit replacement.  Not any horsepower increase you can feel, however my MPG increased about. 5 after a week and thats what I was looking for  a long with the fact I can clean the filter and not have to replace it.
B00UQJAIKM|5|Came in quick, set the code worked like a charm.
B00SX1V49O|3|There are no directions included and wire colors are not the same as oem part so it's difficult to guess which wires go together.
B00510GH7Y|2|Faded within a week..
B006ZAPESC|2|Installed plate on Dyna in 2013 and LED burned out in 2015. Luckily Kuryakyn has three yr warranty on the LED.
B00NK9XEQK|5|Nice piece
B000C5FSFA|5|Good fit
B006CVFHCW|4|I measured incorrectly and had to return.
B00OJYHEOS|1|Flimsy and cheap!  Connectors bend on install.  Would not fit my Q5 connectors securely so the lights kept flicking on and off.  Waited three weeks for this piece of garbage.  Because of that I would not dare send back for a refund.
B005LXTOEY|5|I have a 2007 Honda Pilot.The driver's side rear window was stuck in the down position. My boyfriend was able to install this in under an hour. His only help? YouTube.
B004QMCU10|5|Perfect!  I have a very small 4yr old and this xxs suit was just right.  Couldn't have done better without custom ordering.  And the price was better than direct ordering from manufacture.
B003F6BLZY|5|worked great for my husband to mount his winch
B00JAMYDFC|5|washed fabric convert top first with water and some dawn liquid as suggested on car forum and then used used cleaner. Top looks new.
B00JBQFVBM|5|Makes oil changes clean and easy. Couldn't as for more. Except maybe a safety wire hole.
B00UGVFO8G|5|I have a 2002 Jeep Wrangler Apex. This was a perfect fit. I didn't have to modify anything.
B0002KKTT0|5|Loctite 222 works well on smaller screws that tend to loosen from vibration and shock. I use the product on firearm screws that need it like scope mounts. Less hold than the 242 Blue.
B00BCRMAAS|5|Awesome looking forward to doing business again thank you
B00042L0IA|5|Quality jack boot, fits snugly on my 42&#34; Hi Lift (made for a 48&#34;).  I am able to use the HI Lift Handle-Keeper inside the boot as well.  I like the 42&#34; jack as it does not protrude above the cab on my 2014 Jeep JKU while utilizing the Rugged Ridge rear jack mount #11586.  The boot is made of strong but pliable canvas and the seems and heavy nylon zipper are well placed and designed.  Would definitely purchase again.
B00SVE8IR4|5|Crazy good sound now. I have several late model vehicles and my 15 mustang Gt just didn't fit by the way it sounded at full throttle. The Roush axle back gives me that hey mom look at me I'm flooring it you can hear me coming kind of sound. Similar now to my scat pack when the active exhaust is open. Very happy.. And no drone really does mean no drone I can't believe it. At idle or cruise speed it sounds no different than the factory muffs.
B00LNIPAIU|1|First seat cover ripped on installation. Back seat cover strap ripped when pulling through bottom of seat. Top part of back seat requires you to &#34;cut&#34; the cover to fit seatbelts through. Steering wheel cover is way too big.<br /><br />When Amazon says &#34;Yes this will fit your 2009 Prius&#34; I assumed that it would in fact: fit my 2009 Prius. I guess that was too much to ask.
B000C9I0CY|5|Fast shipping great ac delco product I'm gonna put this on my 2000 camaro
B00LX28WAO|5|The Rudolph of lights! We do a lot of cat fishing and a lot of it is at night. We put these on our boat to help with out night finding adventures and I am very pleased. Easy installation. And lights the way perfectly. You can't catch catfish like these when it's pitch black out without having a light to light the way!
B00BGH52F4|4|I haven't installed them yet.<br /><br />For this price I couldn't pass on them as the rear is going out every 20K miles
B000BPWTKS|5|I have this located in the front bumper of my 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix going with a metal pipe through the fender brace.<br /><br />When I step on it, I hear it immediately and it has made a great increase in throttle response. I am noticing a drop in gas mileage but that is because I can't keep my foot off the pedal with how nice it sounds. I'm sure once I get over it, MPG will reflect a nice difference.<br /><br />The biggest pleaser is that with this filter, my air intake temperature gauge shows only 1 degree above outside air temperature even if I am sitting parked or stopped at a red light. I spent less than $100 on this filter and pipes included, and it performs and looks nicer than any pre-made kits.
B002LOUJ4A|5|Just makes your windshield washer better, enuf said.  Hard water spots are removed easier.  I treat a gallon of the the actual washer bottle and do not add it directly to the tank.  Do not let this stuff freeze.
B000AMBOPI|5|Fit right in my truck tail light.  I'd purchase again.
B005FV2RQY|5|just what I needed quick and priced right
B000H3TUE2|5|Installed these bulbs in the fog light housing for my CR-V. I love that it produces a rich yellow color when it is on. This helps when driving in the rain and snow. When the light is off, the bulb upgrade barely noticeable.
B000924QO0|4|I applied this to a 2008 eight mustang that is cared for very well. I applied 4 coats as instructed and it was not as great of a product as I had hoped. It may have lasted a few months but nowhere near as long as it should have.
B00MHDL0O8|2|It fits little bit tight but works the way I wanted. However, the S line writing doesn't look the same as the picture which almost looks like a fake one.
B000G28PQ8|5|I've always sprayed my oem calipers with high temp paint when I change my pads but rust always reapears fairly quickly. I've had a set of calipers powder coated before for over 100$ after removing and disassembling them. This is by far the best alternative, little time and disasembly yet very durable. I painted mine while attached to the car with the rotors off while replacing the pads an rotors. Went on very smooth using supplied brush, I was able to reassemble  after only an hour but as the directions state did not drive the vehicle for 24hr cure time. 4 months later and the calipers are mint after hosing of the brake dust. If you want perfection send them out to be powder coated, if you want good looking durable paint to cover up unsightly rust and discoloration on factory calipers this is the best.
B00TQHHCTK|5|A1 great transaction
B0054YMJOW|5|Proud to be a rescue Sheltie Mom !! Love my decal.
B000B8GAPK|5|Came as dicribed and as expected
B002J7VX4Y|5|The smell is extremely strong. Plan on diluting it with water in another spray bottle or use only 1-2 sprays in your car.
B000CF5U1C|5|Worked fine, but that was not the cause of my engine hard start problem, unfortunately. It was the fuel pressure regulator. The CPS was very difficult to get to and had to feel for the hold down bolt.
B00IR7DYME|2|different from what I thought I was buying.
B000C9FQ8U|5|Worked as designed!  Great Price!  An Amazon's delivery was exceptional, as always!
B00P2D41OQ|5|They look great so far.
B00DLZSAAI|5|Very bright.  Mounted as work/auxiliary backup lights on a truck headache rack.  After a year, no signs of rust, moisture incursion, or diode failure.
B00B9O3AH6|5|Fits our Hummer 3 perfectly; however, the outside edge on the driver's side is starting to curl up a bit --probably our fault for kicking it when we get in.
B006GFBJD0|5|Very good quality.  No issues in putting it on, and it still looks great after being exposed to Florida's super thunderstorms and brutal sun.
B00UVTHJ90|1|Do not purchase. There are small plastic tip strings coming from cover.<br />It is so poorly made.  These small tips hurt your  fingers when<br />you drive. I have small pin size little marks on my fingers from these<br />plastic tips.It seems they should have used something not so sharpe<br />when they put it together. I feel it is a danger as when you turn your wheel<br />it can scratch you.It is like what you cut off a blouse when there are tags<br />on it and throw it away.
B00BQLBVBY|1|Absolute junk as it falls off the car leaving the double sided sticker behind within 2 days - would not recommend this at all.
B00HVHN2G4|2|Didn't work well for me.  Fits car seat well but is hard.  Not much give.  Didn't help with leg pain.  More comfortable just using the car seat.
B0027URG0S|5|Fit like a glove.  Easy to install.  Very strong when mounted and I like the way everything is &#34;tucked in&#34; the front.
B00W1WK9HE|5|was built good folding arm ok but to long so i shortned it.
B0014GDGPU|5|Sticker looks awesome. Lots of detail! Thanks a ton
B000NUES82|4|Ford motorcraft fluid, nothing else to say.
B000BR51BK|5|Excellent
B00CIWOK3Q|5|Looks great, much cheaper than a body shop. I was able to get some of the missing hardware at  Home Depot.
B007IQ4N1G|5|I got four to use with an aftermarket exhaust. They were recommended to me by a friend with the same car as me (Honda CR-Z) to replace the stock stretchier rubber ones. These are almost solid, very little give. This made them easy to pop on and off. The stock rubber ones stretch and are harder to pull off. I get the feeling these won't be drying out and cracking be soon like rubber.<br /><br />They are so stiff that there is no wiggle room for the exhaust. My aftermarket exhaust is hitting a part of my heat shield and I will have to replace two of these with longer adjustable ones (with multiple holes). This is of course not Torque's fault, so I give 5 stars!
B00BTLEIIY|4|Not bad for the price
B00B1J7YUI|5|So nice fit perfect on my truck ! Fast delivery
B000CQOIVO|5|heavy duty easy to installl
B00HFHBLEA|5|Great product

B00UYAFDEY|5|Easy to install and works Great..
B003Y92RUU|5|Laid my bike down on a dirt road and this sucker didn't budge. Very durable.
B00DDOSNH2|2|I measured the wattage and they are not 2 watt as described. They are 3.35 watt. I'm going to use them for an RV but I'm returning them and getting 1.5-2.0 watt bulbs since the use less than half the energy as these do.
B00HWEJ3KK|5|Shipped fast, Easy instructions to install. Works great
B00BI2APMW|5|Works as advertised.
B00APOFQYQ|5|Great service-part just as described. Thx

B000QUXWVS|4|great product,perfect fit and priced right.......a real 5 star product.  Thanks,David A.
B008G26UBM|5|Fit perfect and a great price
B000R5OIB0|5|Easy to install and they look good.
B00ZGHV71S|5|You definitely want to buy the set of three duffle bags that go along with this, but as long as you do that, this is a great thing: much cheaper than installing a roof rack, very easy to pack ahead of time with the duffles, secures very easily with the included straps. If you have an old rug pad, you can use that instead of the one they sell to go with it, but if you buy them as a set it may be cost-effective to just get the rug pad from them. We had about an eight-hour drive and there was no problem at all.
B00GHSGY0O|5|Fit my 2013 Dodge Avenger perfectly. Clips right into place and in less than 5 mins your mirror is fixed.
B00FMWCI9W|5|Quick delivery, genuine Lexus mats, one year warranty with any Lexus dealer, fit my 2015 ES 350 perfectly.
B008FQ6D8E|5|Easiest body repair I've ever done... And a competitive price.
B00BWAPLXS|4|Installed on 2004 BMW 325i. Cheap but does the job.
B003RB0H4S|1|I have tried to get this product to work but I now know that this the wrong product for this or it is defective I would like a refund.
B00V6VX2OS|5|Super bright. I like the side visibility. Somewhat hard to remove the rubber charging band to access the mini usb.
B00BA782JI|5|overpriced, but they are quality with S.S locking nuts and such.
B00MRC61DY|5|Great price; Perfect fit; Early delivery.  What more is there to say?
B00LGVEU1M|5|The Fender Flares were a lower price, arrived in a very timely manner, work and look great!
B007J461ZS|5|great!
B00G3H6ZA8|5|Just as pictured.  Super Seller.  The first one got lost in the mail.  They called me and IMMEDIATELY mailed a second one. This was a gift for my son-in-law to celebrate the birth of my twin grandson and granddaughter.  We are already blessed with their big sister. He is a very quiet man, and when he opened the envelope and saw this decal, I saw one of the biggest smiles ever.  Thank you!
B003A1P24U|5|After 11 months use, I couldn't have gotten better quality and fit than if it came from the manufacturer!  This was a fantastic buy at a reasonable price!!
B000VL9WTS|5|perfect waterproof cover for my jeep, glad I spent the extra $ and bought a better top, easy on and off no issues  we love it
B00Y7O46U0|5|These actually did fit, directly, into a 1994 Honda Accord EX lamp housing assembly.  I can instantly tell the improvement from a Xenon lamp output.  With these, you don't have to worry about a warm-up period for the ~6000K output, it is just an instant on.  I removed any lens from the CREE LED so it had better heat dissipation overall (they come with a yellow and blue lens set).  In Colorado, you can be pulled-over for a blue-ish color (~8000K)...and I have been, even with BMW releasing that as a stock kelvin.  I run with them for both day and night due to driving safety and they appear to be working great and dependably.  I just ordered two more sets, one set for my high beams and one for any needed future replacement.  Overall, these are a great upgrade for a 1994 car that takes 9005/9006 form-factor.
B007X3UOTO|2|Snapped this on the first day using it. I don't know if it is me being hard on a machine or this was not ready for commercial use but the first time it snagged on something the small end broke. I used it on one lawn and now I just got a grade 8 bolt in its place. Has held. It might be a good product for some but it failed me fast.
B000PEZOD4|5|This is that cherry 3M stuff, just a better value if you want to buy the larger amount.
B00IAOWQ0U|4|Works good & easy to install.
B00IY2CR3E|4|Bought a used Tahoe & it was missing the DVD remote. Works well but thought it was pretty pricey!
B0018E6T0M|4|Liked them but fell apart after awhile.
B0081O5XU4|4|Awesome mirror's, but the shake when extended and towing
B009DJSEM0|5|looks good
B00SS3TBTM|5|nice!!
B008OJ85M4|3|It had some bad reviews so I knew I would have to modify before it was satisfactory. I did that and it now appears ok. You say it will handle 1000 lbs, no why! It is suitable for a small dirt bike or scooter. No more than 500 lbs.
B00IEPAB6G|5|As expected.
B005DM4ZXS|5|Love it,love it, love it!
B00P64F0E6|5|Installed in an hour no poblems made my car faster. Love this intake make me wanna floor my car everytime i drive. Good on gas too! But wen floored bewear of gas going to drop ALOT
B000IYNAFU|5|OEM-like quality. Instructions were very clear and straight-forward when it came to installing. Comes with fuel meter gasket pre-installed. Even though the harness/bracket that the injector assembly seats into isn't included, the old one that holds your old injector unit is 100% re-usable.
B00L4TF32G|5|I use it for the vinyl roll top on my truck - I live in the desert where Temps reach north of 110 degrees and the vinyl top looks new after 8 yrs. And the truck has never been garaged even once. I use 303 on it every 2 weeks. Great product!!
B00HU6N3LK|5|incredible good!
B0006O2P4O|5|Fast shipping and smell great, I would recommend and order again.
B0087XOTWW|4|These bulbs work really good in my travel trailer.  If you dry camp without generator you should replace all incandescent light in your RV with this LED bulbs.  It saves your battery and does not heat up your camper interior.
B002P8HBJS|5|good quality
B00KY8QGLA|5|great fit 2009 chevy1500
B00M7P3CXS|3|I do like this product but wish it was a brighter orange.  Wasn't the shade of orange I thought it was going to be.  But I'm still using it.
B001EAQTRI|3|Doesn't do much in my car.
B007AAZJL8|1|I really wanted to like this helmet, I already have a Bell Star that I love and wanted a modular to use on a cruiser road trip. I figured this would be a good bet as I could use the same transitions lens. When the helmet is open its a bit off balance and it does not clear your vision so its really uncomfortable to ride with it open even at low speeds but thats far from the worst problem. the helmet causes massive turbulence when riding upright on a cruiser at highway speeds, so much so that your head will be bouncing around like a bubble head and you will have massive neck strain after the ride (no I did not have it open at highway speeds this is with the helmet closed). Half way through my road trip after days of neck pain i gave up and switched helmets and the neck started to recover. I might test the helmet out on my R1 later to see if its as bad in the aggressive riding position that offers. point is this helmet is as horrible as the star is wonderful. If you truly hate yourself this is a clear choice for you.
B00C8EA6W8|5|I used this part to repair a door that wouldn't stay latched and on a 2001 Volkswagen New Beetle. I was a little worried as APDTY's price was about a quarter that of my local dealer and other suppliers on Amazon. The part was well packed and arrived about twelve hours after I placed the order. It was a perfect match for the factory part and even seemed a bit sturdier.  Its replacement solved my door latching problem along with a headlight and key buzzer problem and an alarm problem.
B000C5HXLM|4|These are Ford parts so they fit as expected.  I like the European deasign better (reason for 4 stars not 5), but these work great.  Plus they have a &#34;wear detector&#34;.  I dont know how it works but there is a dot that changes color when the blades need to be changed.
B00L26MXKQ|4|The switch is quite a bit larger than expected. I know: &#34;read the specs!&#34;. I ended up not being able to use it, since there is no place on my 2014 Ford Focus dash to place this huge swith, or nearly any other switch for that matter.
B00XU2KKUU|4|It's very nice and comfy!! I like tre colors but it slightly ripped but it was not noticeable so it was fine
B00DBEO1QG|5|Works perfect
B0012WHBSO|1|This might be a great compressor, but the advertising is misleading, which is why I am giving it 1 star.  'Heavy Duty' in my mind, implies that it can be used for big jobs!  But that is not the case. It should specifically state SOMEWHERE in this ad that this is only for compact and mid-sized cars, which is very clear on the box.  I have a Lexus SUV, and bought this because of the feedback, some of which state that they used it for their SUVs.  This really makes me wonder about the authenticity of reviews and those that are 'planted'.
B009774GCA|4|Looks great, no performance difference but it looks better. I had to get the new rubber ring that it goes into to make it fit but not a problem
B007ZGBLNW|1|Not very bright. There are brighter lights available for just a few dollars more
B002UD0GIG|5|Worked great. Cleared up the scratches on my lenses so I could continue using my glasses. Would definitely buy again.
B00WIT28A6|5|Perfect Fit for my 2015 Honda Fit.
B000EGNAWA|5|Great product for great price
B002FRFIBM|4|Worked fine, but not a perfect fit.
B0027ETL5W|1|Double Check<br /><br />I tried to post a review on this item once already but they said that I couldn't, but failed to give me a straight answer as to why I couldn't. I did not say anything offensive, or throw anyone under the bus. I mearlly stated that if you have a German car like mine (wouldn't let me say what kind of car) you really need to check and make sure you order the correct filter. I read the numbers that met it's requirements but it was still the wrong filter. So there it is double check to make sure it's the right one.
B001KS0M5E|5|Excellent
B0010Y4PVU|3|It faded from the sun quickly, but it was fun while it lasted
B009IFIETM|5|Came quick and was exactly what I needed. Easy to install and works great!
B005D4AHSS|4|The product could be better packaged and as indicated by others, the instructions needs clarity.  While most people won't find it difficult to install these, it's worth noting that some may find this unnerving.  Unfortunately, mine was also built incorrectly with the polarity being reversed on one of the connectors.  (The red and black wires were reversed)  The seller however immediately reached out to me to rectify the issue.  He was very apologetic and responded quickly to my communications.  I can appreciate the level of service he provided to ensure that his company is consistently delivering a quality product.  Outside one connector being wired incorrectly, the product otherwise worked flawlessly.  I trust that the replacement will work as expected.
B000CF6RX2|5|This set of Auto Ventshade number 194953 In Channel fit my 2005 F-350 perfect and installed easy in less then 30 minutes.  Thanks
B00KTHV5SK|5|My original key fob broke, but the remote still worked. Actually, the 2008 Honda CRV will not start with the key, separate from the fob. I ordered this, inserted the inside from my broken fob, then took to a locksmith who charged $50 to cut the key. For less than $60, I solved the problem after calling the dealer, quoted almost $300 and roughly a two hour wait in the service waiting area.
B002LWL3XI|5|This is what my car needed. It works just like it is should.
B006P0UD4W|5|We bought a hatchbag for our XC60 and it is a very nice fit.  It has saved the interior from our 3 labs.  We did shave a few of the tabs for a little easier installation and added a few more straps and snaps.  Did I mention the 3 labs?  We've been EXTREMELY pleased with the quality and marvel at how well it fits.
B004BNV8B2|5|i love it and so does everyone that is a dog lover. thank you Amazon (:
B000GGMJS4|5|Good deal
B007RW2XYA|5|Fit perfect.
B001ADBV18|5|Fit And works great. I can't believe I made it this long without one.
B00NHPH4EU|4|Had to modify in order for my light to sit properly but all in all its ok
B001TWD5GY|3|I was really excited to get these lights put on my jeep.  One box seemed to be brand new as ordered.  The other was a return.  It did not have all the plastic wrap and had a fuse in place.  The switch in this box was broke when I opened it.  I had to go buy all new wiring, the wiring that came with it got to hot when hooked up the way it said to hook them up.  I also had to buy new switches.  Changed to 30 amp switches.  Everything now works great.  But I had an additional cost of 50.00 on top of what the lights cost.  It was 50.00 that should not have needed to have been spent, if the lights had came in working order and nothing broke.  The wire also needs to be bigger gauged.
B00KVVROCA|5|While expensive these things are awesome. You don't have to worry about your dog leaving too much hair on the carpet or your kids spilling something and staining the carpet, and if either of them do anything 'destructive' all you have to do is pull them out and hose them off. The $207 price is the same as buying them from the Weather Tech website + shipping and I felt it was better buying through Amazon, and these will definitely save $200 worth of carpet detailing in the long run if I ever wanted to sell my vehicle, so I say they were completely worth buying
B00U9YYK12|3|Two out of five pieces were scratched. The top sunroof visor and one of the door visors. I didn't notice until I installed the first door visors that the sunroof visor was scratched on one side.
B000QA0SKQ|5|Worked Great !!!
B00XJOAADG|3|The instructions are not worth the paper they are written on.  Also, the rear bolts are too long for 2015 model.  I had to run to the hardware store and buy 8 extra flat washers and insert 4 on each side to use up 1/4&#34; of the bolt.  The bars are solid and look great.
B000BQSIWK|5|Worked great brought my car battery back from the grave
B0026M7W56|1|Does not fit 1998-99 ek3/ek4 civic rhd (for japan). Waist of $$$
B00Q2ITWZI|5|Good replacement part.
B00QU70X7M|3|Ordered two of these over a month ago. The price was lower than anywhere else. Was able to finally use them this weekend and unfortunately, the lower fan setting doesn't work. I suggest you check them as soon as you get them.
B00LFL8LM2|1|DOES NOT FIT HYUNDAI SONATA! hub is about 1/16&#34; too long for the hyundai sonata and even when you fully seat the hub into the bearing it will cause the caliper housing to rub the rotor. buying this kit to save me $50 ended up costing me $400 extra. DO NOT BUY!
B0006307GI|5|The replacement was great.
B004CISMME|1|Great bumper but..... Had a bunch of scratches looks like it was slid across the ground before getting packaged for shipment..... Really disappointed with the condition it came in
B000BQPIGY|5|This is the best glass cleaner that I have ever used. It is necessary for me and my vehicles because of the tint used I cannot use some other products but this worked great and is always streak free. Great for other cleaning purposes also.
B0019470XQ|5|Actually needed it for the license bracket. Was afraid it wouldn't work on my Keystone Passport but it fit perfectly. Arrived quickly and was well packed. Easy to install.
B00MJV0ARQ|5|I was very pleased it was the exact piece I needed Thanks!
B0079GQLO2|5|Very good tool!  I am a honda technician and on most vehicles it is easier to use and makes things very quick. Make sure u grease up the threads and keep them clean! Things will go much smoother
B00U2II9DU|5|Love it!
B000NCOKZQ|5|Just what everyone needs
B000SOIRCG|5|Removes the water and contaminants from the gasoline I use in my riding lawn mower and several gasoline powered water pumps all over my property.  Quick and easy to use and very effective.  It cost me some money to have my pump cleaned and tuned up after a bad time with gasoline that had water in it.  Now I filter all my on hand gasoline before I put it into my equipment.
B002YKBAXK|5|Nice and large, perfect for bleeding brakes.
B00JNEAQIA|5|Great product at a great price.... completely satisfied and quick shipping.
B00UIYT9FU|5|Amazon is now my official site for car parts. the price was great -so much better than the auto parts store-and it was easy to install. Works just fine. Very happy.
B000UDL8AS|5|Try and get these at the local auto parts rip off store and see how much the mark up is! These are a good knock off or they're made by the same company. Very satisfied with the purchased and they performed exactly as I would've expected them to.
B000C9QQAW|5|Did its job as a replacement part.
B00EVY3RQU|2|Looks cheap
B00853A6FI|5|The tailgate latch was what I expected and the instructions were easy to follow.
B009K4H42Y|5|The Honda oil filters were same as the filter on the car.
B0036BL34C|5|Good value. Produvt not available at big box stores.
B0040OJ652|4|There awesome I've had them for a while now and still no problems
B00JFWKM2K|4|Good product for surge protection. Some campsite layouts and posts are too short so it lays on the ground. Been through heavy rain and it functioned well. I have extention cords now so the 55301 is placed under the RV for better weather and theft protection.
B009GJRNKG|1|The clip broke after 2 times
B00A2VHM1W|5|The product came in time, all was as advertised.  Thank you!
B0117EETEK|3|The product seems fine, however, these would not fit under a 2015 Subaru WRX STi at stock ride height.  They get caught up on the underside of the front end of the car.  I rated the product average, as it is advertised being able to fit under low vehicles.  I've owned a low vehicle, and I don't consider the STi a low vehicle...I've never scraped the STi on any driveways or bottomed out on any speed bumps.<br /><br />Guess I'm still better off using 2x4's and a floor jack until I can find ramps that aren't as steep.
B00TPM7UTI|5|very happy with price and short amount of time to it took to receive it.
B00XYSZ1D6|5|Fits perfectly.  Great for catching leaks from ice, groceries, etc., before they reach the interior carpeting.  Much better price than that from the local dealer.
B005VPWQI8|3|Fits well. Easy to install.  The reflected image is a little distorted compared to the factory mirror. Next time will just buy the genuine Ford part.
B0084LT5N0|5|Placed in the car and look great.
B00E3W7L6M|5|It was for my son. He loved it
B006FZRBOM|3|It fits and works. Just wish I could have gotten one that matched the vans color instead of black.
B00CAY4WSA|5|AAA
B00FRHOGU6|2|Not impressed.  Had to tear the unit apart to install the connector for the pull/pinch connector in my 2012 mustang.  Took me so long to do this that my neighbors took note and, surprise, the next day my hood had been keyed.  For this price, Rain X should have sold multiple versions with the proper connector pre-installed.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Nice product
B003DUFCGQ|5|Nice
B0107P07K0|5|Daughter loved them
B00XV5BTA6|5|They were so cheap!! I love em!
B00HR5YRPU|4|Looks good and easy install👍
B00DJ5KE9A|5|works great
B00FOX5KEY|1|Could be better.  Not sure if someone was asleep when my harness was built.  ONLY ONE RESISTOR on wiring harness!  This harness is suppose to PREVENT the &#34;headlight out&#34; warning but NOTHING is plugged into the passenger side factory headlight plug.  (Where's the SECOND resistor?)  The longer, passenger side power wire is TOO SHORT to reach to the other side and I had to extend it to make the install look more professional.  My install is on a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  When I cut the wire that extends to the other side, I was surprised to see the the power wire is really skinny.  It is THIN, definitely NOT 16 gauge, it is 18 gauge and not a great quality.  Also pictured is split loom insulation, which mine DOES NOT HAVE.<br /><br />No zip ties or screws to mount the relay.  No hardware!  I'm guessing less than $12-15 dollars in materials to make this harness.  Someone is making a decent profit on this.<br /><br />I bought this harness along with their 9006 HID kit.  I hope the HID kit was better built than this wiring harness.  Only time will tell.
B004CRZXHM|5|Well worth the price, easy to install. Really like the chrome. Highly recommended.
B000X23TQC|4|Good mat, but when you adjust the back seat it folds the rubber and pushes against mat.  There is a cutout for the anchors.  Overall a quality mat.
B000630IBC|4|For $22.00 this is a darn good air filter fits My 1949 Chev like a glove very well built
B00P2D3VZG|5|So far they work great and look good.
B0065J3368|5|great product
B00837DITC|5|This product is  superior in every way. You get adhesive /Velcro pads to help keep it in place. But, I didn't even use them. I would recommend highly.
B00EYF5ZQQ|5|It work for my 1996 toyota camry just fine... I took my car to Express auto in Kansas City Shawnee they asked me $199.00 for the right side $199.00 for the left side $149.00 dollars for labor for each side lower control arm bushing they brought the total up to $843 dollars. However Amazon sold this lower control arm bushing 35 dollars only. I paid my Mexican friend $25 for each side labor. It's only to come  less than a 10 minute to do them for a side. The total hundred twenty dollars it cost me. I saved  $700 dollars . This is what you call it wisdom from God. How to be wise how to spend your money right. I do it all the time. Praise God I spend my money for the right reason
B002XL2HVO|5|Fits perfect in my small kitchen drawers.
B00F9LPJ8S|1|Used twice in two weeks. Second use the battery &#34;melted&#34; and poured thick acrid smoke from my ATV. This could have easily been a safety issue. I was only a couple miles from my truck, so I was able to walk back and drive to get a new battery. Fortunately the electrical system was still okay. I have absolutely no idea what could've caused this since it was being used with no abnormal electrical load (I was just riding) or anything unusual. Charged/maintained on the Battery Tender charger for this type of battery. It was new. No idea. I would steer clear until they refine this technology for use in Powersport applications.
B00ADF2QZY|5|Looks great on our boat trailer. Nicely made and good graphics.
B0080J97Q6|5|I love it. best price too. super fast shipping and exactly what i wanted. Most recommended.
B00M78820I|5|It works well for me and I like it very much
B0026FCGHC|5|As described,  worked in my old Dominion trailer
B00042KGMG|5|Perfect, as described
B003SZ9APA|4|This product worked just fine , but the holes to put the clips in were not the same as the original piece I had to modify them , it works.
B004RZMCCI|5|Works great nice product fast shipping
B008GGH9IQ|5|Actually really great product. They were cheap, had no missing or unlit LED's and installed in minutes. They are very bright and look great.
B000KYV8WU|5|I have had this for a few months and i have to say it does the job. I love the convenience of having this because without the fob my cars security system didn't activate. It works great and it arrived promptly. I would Definitely recommend this to a friend.
B000C5CEKC|1|Doesn't fit my 2015 Silverado 1500 Z71 as stated on website.
B00GYH3RAS|4|Fits well but has a caustic odor- air out beforehand
B005BZJWB2|5|This headlight modulator works very well. Get the right harness for your motorcycle.<br />The company Signal Dynamics was super helpful.<br /><br />I've 2 lights (so 2 bulbs) on my motorcycle.<br />Low beam: it will modulate (as long as the light sensor sees enough light)<br />High Beam: for my motorcycle, that means both low and high beams are on together. This will modulate the high beam but not the low beam.<br />I like that feature, and I think that really makes my motorcycle more visible, which is the main point of having a headlight modulator.
B000BYB8F6|5|Screwed right in to my 1982 Honda 900F. Fired right up. Still getting me down the road.
B00LBIUBY0|1|The worst ever,  never gonna buy this again!!!
B00A14OORU|5|Was exactly what the car needed.  Specs were spot on and delivery was excellent!
B001U7FTDK|3|It's OK but not great.  There is just two sets of grommets to secure it to your step - this is not enough to prevent parts of the rug from hanging down below the step and flapping in the wind.  I will probably buy a grommet kit and install additional grommets to create a better fit.
B000SBCHCA|1|Did not use for very long!
B00G620ZVU|4|They feel solid and work great. Bright to.
B00U2CDJV8|5|Best on the market!  Works great!!!
B004GE5IKS|1|terrible quality, terrible materials, and only half of the holes line up with vehicle. returned.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Does the job, and keeps my Civic at least a few degrees cooler than when I don't have it up.
B00CDA8FYS|5|Fits well. Works well. Followed the instructions that were included (to prepare the unit before operation).
B000H0RCA4|5|Fit perfectly.  Nice, bright lights and a good replacement for older lamps.  Hella lights are, in my opinion, one of the top three in the industry.
B00802F244|5|Love them
B00BWAPTX0|5|Perfect fit. Don't forget to use the new window clips - you'll hate yourself if you get it all in place and then realize you used the old clips by mistake...<br /><br />Anyways, highly recommended!! Absolutely the cheapest regulator I could find for my 2000 328i. I used the zip tie trick to prevent any failures in the future (if you don't know what I'm talking about, do yourself a favor and look up &#34;e46 zip tie window fix&#34; before buying this)
B001KNWJB4|5|Everything is perfect
B001AY2WLU|5|Sweet little gadget.
B00WYO2TMM|4|Everything seems great! I used it to charge my iPhone it was very efficient . My only letdown was no case to keep all together.
B007MD9M9I|2|All the other reviews are accurate. This product has poor fit and finish and requires you to make modifications. The holes for the daytime running lights needed to be opened up and the headlights leaked at the first sign of rain. It is too bad because they look great.
B009UYO3D2|5|Looks awesome on my 2014 GMC SIERRA.. LOVE IT
B00IV73DK8|1|not the right part.
B00FDQPCR2|1|Took the time to install it way up in pecan tree. Worked nicely for about a month, and then the battery pack wouldn't hold a charge anymore. So now it alights for about a total of 4 minutes and then goes out. So I now get to see what their warranty service is like, while I also get to climb a tree with a screwdriver again. Boo.
B00QW3D01U|5|No problems at all 😊
B0009VIPYI|4|works good
B00GSAUHB8|5|Absolutely PERFECT! Fast shipping and it fits perfectly in my 2011 Ford Taurus. It covers the entire windshield. Make sure you measure your windshield before ordering.&#34;
B001MA5AWK|5|Used this to fix a headlight on my 2013 JKU Wrangler.  It worked perfectly and the extra wire length was a plus during the installation.  I'm very happy with this connector.
B00L84B4HU|5|Great thanks
B005EJGSQ2|5|Great on a cold morning.
B00823FSRC|4|The only issue is with the tie down strap the clip broke on the strap broke on the 2nd use.<br />Otherwise very easy to use
B00ETPDZ1S|5|Great items and super fast delivery!
B0033WNLO4|5|Fantastic device! Easy to use and install!
B005CDYQXW|5|Still working.
B000GVEW8O|5|Fit my 2002 BMW K1200LT perfectly.  Of course you have to take off the antenna or carefully bend it down to fit under the cover.  Like the zipper feature very much.  Makes it much easier to put on and take off and to access the trunk while the cover remains on the rest of the bike.  Highly recommended.
B00UHD4HJA|1|I was really hopeful for these stickers. I had ordered two packs for mine and my step-daughter's body boards. I was disappointed that both packs included the same stickers. I would think if I was ordering two they'd be different. And not to mention they were coming off in the water.
B000NC0SA2|5|Perfect for securing the mud cover below the engine back to the frame for my Honda Fit.
B000CPI5XW|2|I am not really sure about Red line yet. I put it in my bike 2012 Heritage 6 speed before heading to Sturgis Rally. It did seem to shift better. But I am starting to notice some slipping when starting off in 1st gear and sometime during shifting. Not sure if there are adjustment that need to be made after so many miles or what. Will look into it.
B000COTT1U|1|I replaced the 2003 Grand Marquis air shocks with these. After 6 months one side is sagging over 1 1/2 &#34; below other side. Junk.
B00E3W7Q1C|5|Great addon
B00DM8N7R0|5|Great product and even better company
B00JVHLS3G|1|Cheap couldn't use, arrived not together. Junk.
B0068ERNNE|1|first use was horrible on my bike.. spent to much time fixing and pulling down.. not a good rain suit for riding on a motorcycle..  also the zipper ripped the first time I rode with it.  sleeves are not tight, so the air goes into the suit and it yanks you all over the place.  hated it!
B000CN5QG8|1|Rubber seal is not designed as a kit for a Nissan Titan.  It is simply a roll of rubber seal.  The MaxSeal states it will work for Ford F150, Chevy 1/2 ton, Titan 1/2 tone and Toyota 1/2 ton. The seal work around the lower portion of the tail gate, but not the upper portion.  Not work the time spent, and defnitely not worth the $30.00.
B000I45Y8Q|5|Great.
B00BCRMB34|4|Great look but difficult to put on.  It took two of us over an hour. However, they do look nice.
B00KSNDOZ2|5|Definately a must have for any supporters of the knights
B008NMWRGM|3|Received my Firestone 4190 air bag kit in two days by amazon, that was fast.  Three days later I opened the box to start installing my air bags but there was no manual or instructions ....I couldn't call Firestone because it was on a weekend so I had to go on Youtube and found someone with the same truck showing how to install these air bags....<br />It's a big job and a pain in the NECK ...it's not as easy as they make it look or sound...ONE HOUR my foot....it took me more than three hours and I had my brother's hydraulic lift and it still took that long...If you buy these air bag kits get ready for some hard bending work.. Even with the download manual from the internet doesn't show that much of information for installing these air bags...The only good thing was the price with Amazon and their fast shipping....
B002P8DIIG|5|Just what we needed! Fast delivery
B000C9TCDA|5|best filter brand  great product
B007TY03R0|5|Great Product and Price!
B00FNA29GU|5|working fine
B000KITSMI|1|Would not extract the valve after unscrewing then the tip broke off so didn't work well for me
B00AU0M5UI|5|Fit perfect and sealed great
B000COTKDM|1|Everything was wired wrong and it does not have the pulling capacity that was advertised.
B00FRZPN64|5|I renewed my Zubie after not using it for a year. Their tech support was awesome and quick response. It was a little trickie and they had to bring in extra help, but we got it setup and working great again. For $99 a year, it's a a great price for what you get. I let friends use my car sometimes and this way I can keep track where they've been and if they've been hard braking or excellorating to fast. I can also look at &#34;live map&#34; to see where my car is at any time. Way cool!
B004J38GZU|5|Did as I expected!
B00HT9XJLW|5|Posi-Locks and Posi-Taps are simply the best no-solder connectors you can use.
B0080DNUC4|5|Used it for school project. Worked out great. Highly recommended.
B00BQFRV5A|5|nive
B00JM62592|5|Nice High Gloss finish without the greasy residue. Best applied with sponge and a detail brush; as I normally use a cotton cloth which just didn't seem to work as well. Very Happy I found this.....will be ordering more when needed.
B00RUDWX4G|5|Look awesome on my blacked out  bobber sportster.
B0013CXCYK|4|It's great the extra padding is a nice addition.
B00BFDFP60|5|nice
B000RY60OO|1|These do not hold your motorcycle in place. I have a road king and the chock is by far the worst I have used in 30 years of trailering motorcycles. Will not recommend.
B00T7CRL72|1|Terrible. Did not fit the seat of a 2012 Ford Focus. Secondly the non-sheepskin portion on the side looks like a faux fur from a gorilla costume assuming it is a gray gorilla. It does not look like the Amazon picture. Sadly, we returned.
B00U2IKC3K|5|Great product
B00069CN2I|1|Received two right hand mirrors.
B0009IQZH0|5|Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)
B000CMHEXW|2|While these covers look pretty fantastic during the day and fit with no problem, they absolutely DO REMOVE headlight luminescence!! They pretty become useless, even with the $30 range halogen bulbs in place (I've yet to try the more expensive ones) I got around this by adding additional lights in the grill area wired into their own switch, these are now my practical head lights.
B00EAOIKWC|5|Works great. Great replacement. Does what it is suppose to do.
B001PYSWEG|5|Less price but worth more. Delivered on time.
B00VC1IXO6|5|OEM fit. Worried given the description &#34;workshop&#34; but is a real Bosch filter.
B001KQAAFS|5|Works like a charm
B00FP0W11G|5|Works fine looks good
B004I30A8W|5|These are superb!  Love my ladybugs!! These mats fit well and are very thick . they have rubber backing on all four to prevent sliding on the floor.  The ladybugs are brilliant color and have a plastic coating to protect them from the elements. They have added another touch to my collection of ladybugs over the years!!
B0012GTVVA|5|This bar makes it much easier to open the screen door and protects the screen.
B000N5UVME|5|Love these!  Super easy to put on and sound great.
B0007LVHT0|5|Fit perfect, be good for a few more years
B00T47HUEO|3|This is not an atheist sticker, it's the opposite! NOTW (Not of This World) is a Christian apparel company and it means we are not of this world but are in for eternity. I'd rate this five stars for the sticker but one star for the description.
B00NHX826Q|5|The CV Boot work just fine. I do not believe the statement about the Stainless Steal bands not needing any special tools is accurate, I could not get them quite tight enough until a purchased a tool. after worked great.
B00L51X5UU|4|Product looks great.  Do you have one for back seat Lexus gx 460?
B00MFW2MQG|1|It was broken when I received it and had to return it.
B009CWCQZE|2|I ordered deep blue and the lights or white
B001B7TT1M|4|Good product, handy with todays trucks and lack of storage.  They could be a little stronger.  For the price I would expect a stronger box and a better method of securing to the truck.
B0024GYTLY|4|There is no disappointment in quality for the price. However, it has no sizing preventing edge and end fraying.  It is not primed with Volan.  If you are doing something serious, consider a roll of Hexcel fiberglass cloth primed with Volan - though it will set you back some $$$.
B00404V588|3|The size , color and durability is fine however the words and Mazda decal started to fade in less than two weeks of having it. The reason for buying it was the Mazdz decal and words and last of all was the color .
B003CJJVPG|5|These make loading and unloading a sled super simple. I used to have to screw in the old tie downs on my friends trailer, but with the screw part staying in, and being able to drive over them without causing any damage to the sled, it now takes mere seconds to tie down the sled instead of minutes. Also like I can lock these, and not have to worry about tie down straps as well to hold the back down. Got the matching superclamp for the back. Installation took less than an in my brothers enclosed trailer to add a set of these with a backer plate.
B00IWXU7FU|5|Thank you
B00BITJF0S|1|Very cheap quality item that did not fit properly on my 1995 Geo Prizm. I guess I got what I paid for, even though I verified it should fit on my car. Will never buy from this seller again.
B00DP5L5D8|5|Great letters! Thank you
B00BITHO74|1|Cheap item that did not fit as advertised. Had to modify it to get it fit my 1995 Geo Prizm.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Good product does want I need it to do , excellent price
B001B78TXQ|5|Fit perfectly behind dash inside blower box. Ac system runs/cools like new at 100$ cheaper than local auto parts store
B0000AXR7J|5|Worked nice product
B004RPJWHQ|1|If I could give less than one star I would! I thought these were great, super cute, Then when my tires needed air I couldn't get them off!! They melted onto my wheel!!! It took me months to get these off, my borther had to rip them off with pliyers.<br /><br />10/10 DO NOT BUY!
B000E2CVIS|4|Great thanks
B003A4QJS0|5|great
B0052FRRIG|4|It fit well. Matches the color of my car. Wrong one was delivered at first. But was taken care of in a couple of days. Very satisfied.
B003SZ3GK0|5|Works on '95 Jeep YJ (Wrangler) 2.5L
B00KNXACFC|5|Extremely easy to program.... just YouTube it and in seconds the remote control will work..... just got it a few days ago, so far no problem, hopefully it will stay that way
B0002MQEVU|5|this is the best stuff for convertible tops
B00JNVD79I|3|It is alright.  It seems to just atomize dirt and put it into the air.  I use it for spot treating and headliners. It drips quite a bit from vent holes in the cap.
B000C948ZW|5|Working well
B000IETTS2|5|Perfect  fit. Easy to install. Took all of 10 minutes.
B001JT320Q|5|Works great
B00DTBU6AG|5|Love it !!!
B00B2ASVJO|5|Worked great and easy install!!
B00LOR5NF0|2|I used an Impact wrench to install these, the chrome flaked off of many of these during install.
B00WTI3IKA|5|Supports worked perfectly. Very fast shipping, received before I expected them.
B0031I4HN4|5|Rotors that beat store parts.
B007Y86RH6|5|excellent alternator. arrived on time. no complaints..
B007QV1RLM|5|I waited on purchasing this because of the price but I'm glad I did finally pull the trigger. I love the flexability and retracting mechanism works evenly while locking at good increments.
B00287GY1W|5|Great
B00T7CE0YY|5|Looking good
B001O039US|5|Price was 35% less than buying from the local GM dealer who also had to order it. Perfect fit right part and 35% saving on price. Couldn't be happier with this purchase! Delivered on time direct replacement. THANK YOU!!!!!
B00R8N6916|5|Excellent product, fast delivery. Could not ask for more. Definitely will look to this vendor again in the future if I need parts for my bike.
B007Y4BL1C|5|Bought this unit and it works just great!  Fan doesn't come on until needed.  I use it in my RV to power the TV and DVD player at night without turning on the generator.  Perfect!
B001KOOY7K|5|very dark for sunny days
B003ZUPKGG|5|Bought this for a couple different reasons. I have a small hatchback. I use this hatchback on occasions to pick up bags of wood pellets. I was also interested in hauling either a boat or camper. I decided to go with the camper. I knew I would get more use from it where I live. The camper was where it got its first test. So far so good. Took the camper out a couple weeks ago. Put about 35 PSI in the bags hooked the camper up then deflated to about proper ride height. Car and trailer handled great.<br />As for install: Instructions were very nice, however, on my application these could not be mounted per their instructions without modifying my car.(drilling) I ended up destroying one of the bags during the attempt. Five stars goes to customer service also. When I contacted them, they gave alternate instructions, and promptly sent me another bag to replace the damaged one. No charge of course.<br />Being a little picky and a bit (just a Bit) of a perfectionist when it comes to my car; after a close look at the alternate instructions(mounting bags upside down and running the lines from the bottom) and the original. I opted for the original. I ended up drilling the proper holes needed to run the air lines through the top of the springs. Just made more sense to keep the air lines out of harms way under the car.<br />Now that I bought the camper, my next purchase from them will be the controller. It should be very nice to be able to inflate/deflate from in the car.
B00EE7BRQ6|5|gives my 08 DRZ a fresh more modern look
B00JVHLS3G|1|Received the decal/sticker late. It said that this would fit the trunk, not the case..stay away from this buyer and product
B006MDD650|5|Looks and Fit just like the original one.<br />Came with gasket and screws.  Gasket fit perfectly.  Screws are not captive type like original cap, but that really didn't matter.  Was easy to put them in one-by-one.
B002YKI51U|5|As advertised, fast ship
B0009NUG66|4|Great product! I definitely recommend it!
B00AO2CWJQ|4|Soft and comfortable behind the ears.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I received my sunshade one day earlier than the estimated date, and I've been using it regularly. It works great, and it's easy to pack up and store in my car!
B00LM4OQMG|3|Attached easily enough, haven't used it yet.
B00LGDR6NO|5|Husband loves it!!!
B0009TOBTI|5|Very good, thank you
B007CVGTIC|5|Works just as described,. Purchased 2 just because...
B0073MFSHI|1|What a debacle. This radiator is approximately four inches taller than the factory part- THEREFORE IT IS NOT OEM... notice the creative phrasing in the product description: \\"OEM style\\". I believe this is intentionally misleading. Why didn't I return it and get my refund? Because I had my truck disassembled and had to get it back together asap.<br />So here's the deal: It's a \\"confirmed fit\\" for a '95 Tacoma 2.4L Automatic 2WD, and the product description says OEM in it. Yes, the hardware and brackets mate pretty well for the most part. However, there is a very major problem. Because it has an additional four extra inches added to the bottom as compared to the factory radiator, the otherwise \\"compatible\\" lower radiator hose you buy will not reach. It's short by... well, four inches! There's effectively no lower radiator hose in the world designed to fit this craptastic nightmare. I bought two lower hoses and had to splice them together. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! Now that the lower hose port is four inches too low, there's no way for the hose to snake past the sway bar bushing mount, unless you TOTALLY disfigure it and smash it sideways. Obviously, that's not a solution.<br />I had to purchase a 90 degree aluminum JEGS radiator hose splicer to make it past the sway bar without rubbing, and even at that I had to modify it by cutting one of the ports short. STILL NOT DONE THOUGH! Because the radiator now dangles well below the bumper, its literally hanging in the breeze BEGGING to get hit by road debris. I'm going to have to fashion some type of shield for it, otherwise it will certainly crack from debris trauma. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE EFFORT. SPENT EXTRA 50 BUCKS ON SPLICES AND EXTRA HOSE TO MAKE IT FIT, PLUS HOURS GOING TO STORES FOR PARTS. I'M LIVID AND KICKING MYSELF FOR BUYING THIS THING. And if \\"Complete replacement radiator\\" means that it comes without a cap, clamps or any hardware at all, then yeah, it's \\"complete\\". Lastly, the drain plug mechanism only LOOKS like it operates like every other one in the world; you must unscrew it all the way to let the coolant spew out sideways, it doesn't drain nicely out of the little downward tube when the butterfly bolt is loosened halfway. The good news, if you want to call it that, is that the transmission lines reach, but only if you lie them directly on top of the sway bar. Can't wait for that to blow open in 50,000 miles, hen I will have really gotten my money's worth from this POS designed by Satan himself.
B002ZTNVB4|5|Great Product. Covered every part of the 2nd and 3rd row of the van I needed covered.
B00SS3S2T2|5|A gift. My husband loves it.
B00ON43CYK|5|The look great on my Jeep...
B009IFIORE|4|So, far a very good replacement. just pop out and pop in.
B00P2D3W00|5|Beautiful white light LED. I have a 2000 Toyota Celica GT and this fits the dome light perfectly. You might have to turn it from one side to the other if it doesnt work because the double ends are a negative and a positive. So if it doesnt work when you first put it in, turn it around and try it again. It worked great for me and I love it!
B000BRFGGA|4|Too loud.  I know, it sounds strange but they are not lying when they say Loud One. This thing is painfully loud, instant clap your hands over year ears loud.  I ended up running a piece of duct tape over the horn and that toned it down to something bearable. If your looking for loud, this will not disappoint.
B001EA0LI6|5|Just what I expected - easy to install and looks great
B00E5OUOCQ|3|It does the job but it's a really cheap sunshade.
B00HUEFROS|3|Satisfied with product
B00TF3IX4I|5|I installed these in my 98 discovery. They maintain the same beam pattern as the halogens they replaced. Without a cooling fan like other led bulbs I was surprised they didn't overheat. Not even after a long road trip. The color is white with a slight blue hue but even in the rain they make everything visible. Excellent range too
B00KTR4T2Y|5|Awesome sound! Easy instalation if you know how to work on cars!
B004J10PJ2|5|Working for now. Will update if issues accure.
B00OG6M3EA|5|Very good
B005H53DEI|1|did not last long and they did not want to warrenty it out
B00DU66UWI|5|Just got them, havent wired them but look good
B00B7GRFS6|5|Worked out great.
B00LDWZAK4|5|This license plate frame is the high quality item I wanted for my new Cherokee Trailhawk!
B004MEBENM|4|works well
B00SCATN6C|5|Tried it on a basket carrier and it works great have not tried it on my trailer yet
B00B51YGTY|2|Was the wrong color
B000VAKXVA|4|never used them when i went through alcan highway but i did test them and they are nicely made but a little tough to figure how to put on
B004BFZBJ0|1|This starter I installed With A New Solenoid And It Wouldnt even turn over Ended up putting the old starter back on.
B004RFKBEO|4|Packaging was a disaster with the box torn in half a dozen places. I thought for sure we would have lost pieces but everything was in the box. Carrier works as expected. Just drove 1700 miles with it no problems.
B007P2F786|5|fits great.
B005I0I8WE|5|Easy install on 2015 JK. Great fit and excellent protection.
B000C7S0Z8|4|I/we could've used an install sheet.
B00BITQMIQ|5|This was a replacement.
B00JEK5XBS|5|Don't normally write reviews, but wanted to express my pleasure with this great product.<br />Well packaged, easy to follow instructions and well designed. Such a pleasure to add power assist step boards to my new GMC.<br />Took about 4 hours to complete including taking off factory steps... You will not be disappointed in purchasing these for your vehicle.
B006GFLI0O|4|Breathes well, but is tight on larger heads. The headband part could be softer - you don't notice while it's on, but afterward it can hurt your head: may also be due to my massive brain safe. Overall I recommend it.
B00FH8P1DG|2|Out of the box one end was chipped and banged up and missing paint
B003LMHCUU|5|Love it !!!!!
B008QXRSV2|5|Lesjofors is good quality .
B007RZ3NB4|5|Got these for a good friend, he could not wait to put them on his truck.
B000C9O3H0|5|GREAT BRAND LUV THE PRICE FAST SHIPPING FIT GREAT
B001DH4C3A|5|perfect fit (I didn't realize how dirty these got) and timely delivery - very satisfied
B007KMQES8|5|Present for husband loves it, true to size
B00ANZHG7C|5|Love these! I always take them to the car wash with me. They get the water off of the car and are great at cleaning the windows without streaks. We also use them around the house for various things.
B002TO6AJK|5|WAY BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT but I'm not complaining whatsoever it's perfect! The more maple leaf the better!
B000BZ53DI|1|Purchased this as a replacement from Raybestos wheel bearing for my 2004 Impala SS thinking that since the Raybestos bearings didnt even last a year that I had cheaped out buying them so I bought TImken. I had heard this was a good brand, WRONG! Not only did the bearing last just over a year but unlike in local stores there is only a 1 year warranty on it. Local stores sell these with a 3 year. Guess I'll be purchasing more from local stores and definitely NOT a Timken again! Buyer BEWARE! Read the fine print in the warranty!
B00651CLCS|3|It was easy to install and looks good.  You just don't get very good signal .
B013HBCB6E|5|Purchased directly from Clipper Creek, service was excellent. Called before I bought with an electrical question and they had a good answer. Product is made is the US, is surprisingly compact and light weight, and feels durable. The long cord is a huge plus. Compact enough to take with you. Three year warranty. Can't ask for more than that. Oh yes, and the price is right.
B001P20XZE|5|Everything fit perfect<br />Not too Big Or Small just right size for me!<br />Looks like it came with the vehicle
B00YDSXGJM|5|[[VIDEOID:f02403e469e0ce09ad9d92622fc30a84]]As you can see in my video, the Hop and Fly Portable Jump Starter is capable of jumping any kind of batter -  from cars, riding lawn mower to ATV and 4 wheelers it gets the job done.  Besides jumper cables, it comes with a four in one cable for charging mobile devices that use Apple 8 and 30 pin adapter, mini or micro USB ports.  Also has a built-in flash light and glass window breaker.  Everything you could possibly need in case of a vehicular emergency.<br /><br />Has a built-in protection features such as spark proof battery clamps. Using regular battery jumper cables I had always feared that the clamps would spark being they were so long and awkward. Now  I can actually touch the two clamps together, and even put them on the wrong battery terminal and they will not spark. It also has over and short current protection, as well as protection against over charging.<br /><br />Front blue LED light indicates battery level and status when charging.<br /><br />[Product sample for an unbiased review]
B000H5WRPO|5|The tube fit the tire perfect and Slime has a reputation for quality.
B00LBFC4VQ|4|Mounting clips did not fit.  Poor design for mounting hardware.  Used the clips like a nut to secure bolt.  Has held OK so far.  Looks good installed.  Irritating that Chevy designers left this gaping hole in the grill on 2015 Duramax.  Should not have had to spend $100+ on a Chervrolet design flaw.
B00UHD4HJA|5|Great selection of stickers! I stuck them all on my laptop and it has become a conversation starter while I'm using it at school.
B00OST5TAU|5|Delivery was sooner than expected. Going from halogen to these led's on my boat was a great improvement. Not only do they look 100% better but the amount of light is amazing. Should have bought these a long time ago. And the price ??? Ridiculously inexpensive. I've only had them for 2 weeks, so I hope they last. So far so good.
B000CMJRTQ|5|Great fit. Looks great. Very happy.
B00LD6QX5Q|5|AAA
B000C5C524|5|I've been known to use all sorts of brand names for parts everywhere except the engine.  It pays to use Ford parts on Fords.  Now, if Ford doesn't make what you need to do what you want (changes), please know the brand you buy.  That's it.
B000DCN9DA|4|Even though the description (and the package) state these are ATC fuses, they are still open on the bottom and the fuse link is exposed. This makes them unsuitable for marine or other applications where combustible material is present.<br /><br />ATC fuses should have their element completely encased to prevent sparks from igniting fuel fumes that would be present in the engine compartment of a boat. Fuse blows, creates a spark...and now you have an explosion or a fire.<br /><br />That being said, this was a great deal since I didn't actually need ATC fuses. Bussman is a trusted name and I would never use anything else.
B000DN7VLK|5|I DID NOT INSTALL IT YET BUT I THINK IT GOING TO WORK.<br />I
B00DSO94IE|5|I like it and good
B00FAX531I|5|I bought one for my Caddy, and another for my 4Runner. They both fit perfectly and keep the vehicles cool and protected.
B006ZN4JTY|5|AAA
B00KTIK1U2|5|Work perfectly for my 2009 HHR. Had to have Dealer program them, though.
B003VAUK4W|5|Great product. Just what I needed for pulling my trailer
B00DYYGRHE|5|Perfect 👍👍💖
B00DJH49JE|5|Work perfectly for a 2008 jeep jk. Hold my double din very firm and sturdy!
B00X7CZRBA|1|No comment
B00G1Y3QCI|5|Excellent motorcycle levers.  A huge improvement in the OEM levers in looks AND performance.  They feel better and more responsive over stock levers.  The build quality of these levers is excellent.  I've installed them on 3 bikes so far.  Perfect performance on all three.
B00W2PC734|4|Comfortable boots<br />Laces to long<br />Just want I wanted to ride
B00CHSTGKI|4|Good quality factory part at a cheaper than dealer price.  Installs easily once you figure it out as there are no install instructions...a Torx driver is included to secure the crossbar to the roof racks, but you'll need the next size smaller in order to make a width adjustment.  Fast shipping.
B003JLDQNK|5|I was concerned about whether the bag would be big enough, but was happily surprised to find it was more than enough to hold a rain suit, cell phone, wallet and other small stuff.  The phone pocket is big enough for my iPhone 5, which I know has been asked by a lot of people, and the magnets are extremely strong and durable.  The bag comes with a rain cover and fits my Ninja like a glove.  I highly recommend, especially for the cost.
B00QL1TPDK|5|This breathable car seat pad fits perfectly in the SUV bucket seat. It helps give me support on long drives. I've tried other seat cushions and this one offers the best comfort and is breathable.
B0066QLN4E|5|Works great. Installation was simple
B00ZVJ35XE|5|The product didn't come prime so it took a while.<br />The seat covers were very easy to put on and fit perfectly,  even the steering wheel cover fit like a glove. I have a black 2010 Nissan Rogue with grey and black interior and it matches great!!!<br />There was a slight chemical smell but I left them out of the package for 48 hours and then installed them and there is no longer a smell.<br />It's a 17 piece set but I wish it was 18. It should have 5 seat belt covers or have an option for 5 since many cars have 5 seat belts.<br />I was given a discount for my honest review.<br /><br />**I'm not sure why the last picture looks so sparkly,  it is not sparkly in person.
B002R1MD8C|5|Just as the merchant described
B000V0G3XM|3|I generally love 1Z Einszett products and pretty much use them for cleaning every inch of my car (inside and out). I wanted to give this shampoo a try but I'm not a fan. It does produce a good amount of suds, especially if you're using a pressure washer. The results are pretty good as well, but honestly no different than their regular shampoo. I'm rating it as 3 stars because when you look at how much this little guy costs in comparison to what you get, it's not a good deal. Also, call me silly, but the shampoo smells like bad and strong shaving cream, which is nauseating.
B005CW9MN2|5|Works perfectly for the intended jobs.<br />Well made.
B00KV7GSJE|4|Color matches. Not very bright for gauges though. They don't have much dispersion, hence leaving you with hotspots..
B0029XHOK0|5|Love this decal and it's priced lower than in the NFL stores.
B0065J3368|5|Great!
B000GVCW5E|2|Poorly designed to keep rain out, first rain storm the rain got through the zipper and my seat and bags were soaked. I would not recommend it unless it was used as a dust cover. It is very sturdy, great quality but not rain proof. The company was great sent me an exchange for one of their other covers with no zippers..No storms so far so can't give you a review on that one yet.
B00LIXZLR0|5|bright as hell...
B000C3ZCBM|5|Work good so far
B004HCU77S|5|Awesome
B004940ZSK|3|Works fine, not the automatic signal off after turn is complete must manually turn signal off.
B00N2PLPRM|1|Yes, they do look good. But like others have said...cheaply made. The threaded shaft broke while installing them. I hadn't even gotten to the point of full tight. It looks like the aluminum has already corroded and gotten brittle under the paint job. Sending them back now. I'm looking elsewhere since I don't want them breaking out on the road.
B00CWNVAPW|5|As advertised!
B00ANZW28U|5|great product, but are too small for my car
B00KLKITVG|5|Good
B0040ZXDNC|5|THIS FANCY RED RHINESTONE LICENSE PLATE COVER DID NOT DISAPPOINT AND LOOKS LOVELY ON MY MATCHING BRIGHT RED CADILLAC.  IT CAME IN PERFECT SHAPE AND IS WELL MADE.
B00B8ZGIR0|1|White powder stuff is coming off the cover from inside. Gets the car dirty. Won't recommend this cover
B00V3YUKE8|5|They fit perfect trucks looks great
B009LZQV3K|4|This wiring harness did fix my problem, along with a new blower motor resistor. However I had to match the colors with the black and white wires on the harness. I just spliced the wires together with electrical tape and then zip tied them up. These blower motor resistor last around 5 years then the blow, no idea why and there is a recall on them.
B000C9G34G|5|Good as new
B00JY8RX6S|5|Beautiful, but follow directions carefully.
B00DWKXYHG|5|I Purchase this HID Bolt Series on september 2014, today September 2016 still work as bright as always. Excellent product no complaints at all. Recomended.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Thus is a great value for the money. Works great in my alarm system.
B0099EXK2S|1|It was terrible and broke right when I tried to put it on they should at the least send me a new one!
B00LBIUDGQ|5|Worked perfectly, I got these lights in March 2015 and I'm happy to have purchased  these lights but I had got the 60k and they look blue  but no problem I'm thinking of purchasing 50k lights to replace the blue ones.  Over all I'm happy with my purchase.
B00GH0DAT0|5|Awesome!!!!
B004C444PC|3|Not the best fit
B0048J6T4K|5|After 12 years my 2003 Sierra needed a little freshening up. These worked great to return the speed of the power windows. Only takes a 7mm and 10mm socket and a screwdriver to complete removal and installation.
B00D2QLEO0|5|I bought 2 for wife and I (both have trucks) and I couldn't be more satisfied.
B003G9FPQG|5|We are talking RV.  This is a 12 volt DC heat activated chemical thermistor.  I found one site that claimed it to be a 120v.  It was a type-o.  ANY thermistor of ANY manufacture will work with ANY water heater of ANY model, but you must get the proper voltage rating.  Find the cheapest of all the brands and retailers and buy it.  If you need a 120v AC, it's still a thermistor.  Buy the cheapest for the proper voltage rating.  The only problem will be installing it.  Different manufacturers have different holding/mounting methods.  Now you can test your engineering skills.  It has to be pressed tightly against the outside metal of the tank, preferably along the center line of the widest girth (the ends or length of the body, doesn't matter).  That's it.  My Suburban is 21 yrs old and uses a spring clip hold-down.  That made it easy.  Oh, .... no glue, no tape, and I don't recommend drilling (lol).  Come on, think!
B000XBK7C2|4|Delivered in new condition
B00ASY2614|2|Kinda disappointed. It locks the breaks on the trailer because the wiring is backwards. That's pretty crappy quality in my opinion. Now I have to cut into a brand new cable.
B001DSWB46|1|This product is suppose to fit a Silverado K3500 dually, it does not.
B008VDIVHC|5|Just recieved mine today. Went on easy. Easy adjustment. Looks amazing and seems really secure. 100% satisfied !
B005RN0RVM|1|The fit in my vehicles receiver is very sloppy and the receiver slot on the hitch extension is too narrow to insert the trailer hitch. I had to open the receiver with a file, which took a lot of effort. The top slot however does fit my 2\\" bicycle rack hitch mount.
B000GV317C|5|Good product installed easily. No<br /> problems
B00CRR5L8U|5|Have had it in our Silverado for about 2 months now, works great!
B002PUROAM|5|thank you ...dd...
B00OOJGY0I|1|Very low quality.  The caps just fall apart. Do not buy
B002UNCJE0|5|This worked great!  Follow the directions for installation and it'll work.  I wanted a faster heating 10 gal RV water tank.  I got it with this.  When the gas AND electric were both put to it, I still ran out of hot water, though not for long.  When I added this to the mix, plugged into a separate socket at the stanchion, I found it hard to run out (and without tripping the breaker).
B0009V1WS4|5|Cool lock does what it needs to do.
B00R1MVM2A|5|These fit perfectly in my chevy 2010 equinox.  The bezels need to be purchased separately.
B004KED7KW|3|I would buy the socket style antenna tools instead, this tool doesn't fit down into tight spots.
B001REXAC8|5|used it for years
B00CQH2YI6|1|The link has problems the side link behind clip does not fit they have to be like pressed on . I bought this one because I didn't want to have to buy a chain press. Well guess what I have to anyways now. 10 bucks out the window. And I'm not a noob I have replaced chains on every atv dirtbike and sport bike iv owned never had a prob with any but this one and it's supposed to be a really good chain. Will not buy again.
B0002UEOLO|4|No gripes. Applied to spark plugs and screwed them in.  Usually you don't change spark plugs very often so it may be quite a while before I can &#34;test&#34; and see if it has any effect at the next change.
B0009XB5SE|5|Great spray paint
B000NHUKJG|5|It worked as was expected.
B00EZI0332|4|Not super bright, but bright enough. Good fit, even light distribution.  Fit great I'm my 1999 Mercedes Benz E320 climate control
B00FWJK8ZG|5|Quick ship. Matched perfectly....
B0049ZEIW8|5|Nice
B0046I3I8I|5|Great product.  Will use again
B003ZN730O|5|Delivered as described - quality exceeded my expectations (for the price)...  Great product and suited my needs perfectly!
B00CO856X2|5|Easy to apply and looks great.  Good quality, metal, not flimsy plastic, very shinny.
B00BSUD1KW|5|Arrived on schedule and fit our 2015 Honda Odyssey perfectly.
B00CHD703S|4|PROS:  Perfect fit, Great price...Fast shipping, Better than factory, Quick install, Looks great w/lots of compliments.(Front bumper is next)<br />CONS:  All the plastic tabs to anchor the the black pad on both right and left side were all broken, lying in the box.  SO there are no anchors holding the sides right now, it looks like it has wings... Quality of the pins is bad! A less brittle plastic should be used, they need to be more flexible! I will have to get something retro-fitted to hold the ends of the pad in place.
B00KOX1NN6|5|Great size and stuck perfectly on my car!
B008X6QS90|4|These are not small, they are really, really small. 4 starts because they were not marked as to which is which and no spec sheet.  You have to be a real good solderer to solder these.  Low heat and patience.  Do you see the LED next to the date on the quarter?
B0016HPORK|2|The plugs I got are NOT the ones pictured. They are C88L's but they (the ones I received) DO NOT HAVE  that knurled area between the threads and the hex nut area, and ARE SHORTER .  The extra length is needed in some applications, as in my Case tractor.  I was able to make due with these shorter plugs because I had a thin-walled plug wrench from a motorcycle tool kit.  If I did not have this special wrench, I would not have been able to tighten the plugs and would have to go to the aggrivation of returning and reordering.  I would have also been really TICKED.  As it is, I am not happy with the service.
B00W8J2TDM|5|Very happy with decal and quality.
B00FNAX7KW|1|Just installed them, they are bright, white and not cheap looking. Far better than the cheesy LEDs that they sell in a 40 pack elsewhere. I'll be ordering a few more. Let's see how long they last!  ***UPDATED REVIEW*** I wrote this review within the first week, after having them longer a more accurate review is in order.   Avoid these lights if your looking for something to last longer than a month.  These flickered away rather quickly.  Also they are a 10k slight blueish light.
B00QIT8TUU|5|Works great! And looks awesome
B00E9W2PPS|2|i couldnt use it. My brother lent me his old r12 recharge kit, and the fitting won't couple up to the cans, Different design. Guess i should have done more research.
B00LQHR9GE|5|Honestly this was way more then I expected I really love this light bar
B000P6WMT6|1|cheap hose. it broke on me while putting air in a tire. not buying amflo hoses again
B00MP6U85E|5|Fit perfect
B002QGVW3K|4|I purchased this as a replacement to a failed battery in a handheld flashlight.  The case was larger than the original by approximately two-hundreds of an inch which made the fit in the flashlight just a bit tight and required some unplanned force to get it to seat properly.  That slight variance aside, the battery was packaged nicely for shipping and was delivered promptly.  Once the battery was installed, everything worked as expected.
B00JVI00CU|1|This product has a good size however it doesn't stick to the door and it falls all the time, I remove it and throw it away!!
B00PGYS674|5|Good buy.
B00I9Q8GJY|4|Great, wish they would have come in RED, MY TRUCK IS RED, ONLY HAD 2 THAT DIDN'T WORK.
B004HE3WAU|2|made in china, very disapointed
B00KM2LKU0|5|Love the decal looks great
B001UE64I2|5|Awesome grip and low noise. Recommended.
B000JL760C|5|Works great.
B00428UNNU|1|Lasted a couple months before starting to come apart and cause a bad vibration. Don't waste your money. Just buy the mercedes oem part and they will last another 15 years.
B000NKCIXE|5|Excellent
B00NQNJN9W|1|These never made it to my car. The rhinestones were falling off in the package. I didn't want 3m tape stuck to my car while the rest of them fell off. They went straight to the trash. Don't waste your money. Zero stars.
B001O0BJUK|5|excellent
B009DK1FMU|5|Perfect new bumper for my 06 350z.
B00AQ48E44|5|Perfect replacement. It's and going down the road !
B0012PFL6A|5|Great for the money easy install
B000NW8ESK|5|fit great delco part
B00L84B8AS|5|It fitted perfectly on my crv...but I paid $200 for installation. .not regraeting. .I am happy...
B00YMHC9E2|4|Met my expectations!
B010H0QV00|5|This is a very efficient multitasking tool which offers an LED flashlight that is nice and bright.  It very accurately and quickly reads tire pressures.  My husband loves having one of these in each car.  He also compared it to one which we own and he likes this one much better.  It has more tools and does more.  He especially likes the glass breaker.  It is reasonably heavy and compact and is easily kept in our glove compartment.  Batteries were already inside of this tool...all that we had to do was play with it a bit and tuck it into our car.<br /><br />My thank you to the manufacturer for providing me with this to review.  I have presented readers with my honest thoughts.
B000CJ3XJE|4|Spark plug works well, will take a while to see how they perform and wear over a longer period of time.
B00KTHYCEO|5|As described and super easy to program
B002UBZJQ2|1|Bought for dump trailer body bumpers, between frame and body when it comes down. It's a cam superfine 14' . well these only lasted about a week or until i put a heavey load in, they squashed and split.
B00B63PSB6|3|I had to drill every hole because the bolts are bigger than the factory originals.
B0077A7RQQ|5|GREAT looking, keeps the weather out and installs in 15 minutes.  GREAT product!  My dad purchased one for his Dodge after seeing my setup.
B0008FUHPA|5|Very handy- great for switching between my larger trailer to the small one.
B006IDFZMQ|5|Returned the defective product i received and i had to pay the return shipping cost . Are you kidding me motodynamic .<br />The one i got was defective but when it did work it was awesome .<br />It kept forgetting how we programmed it after abt 45 seconds of riding . The installer at my local motorcycle shop was baffled at how this product misbehaved .
B00KWQRC4O|4|Good product for the price.  I wish it had an elastic strap around the bottom to keep it from swinging against the seat back.
B009LNIN42|5|When I received the FASS I put it on in about 6 hours but it should go faster than than that because I disconnected the wrong fuel line and put the fitting onto it so I had to redo all of that to the correct line, but once it was installed I could feel a little more power in my 09 lmm. It smokes a little more with a heavy foot but you can feel the power it adds. Its also nice knowing that the cp3 doesn't have to do work now to get fuel to the engine and that my injectors and fuel system will last a lot longer. It added about 2 miles per gallon. I recommend that every time you fill up with diesel, that you crack open the water separator to let out the water, which is actually surprisingly a lot of water. I would recommend getting this because it will end up paying off for itself in fuel savings.
B007QBXZ4Y|1|Wrong product for my vehicle. Had to return.
B009999SH4|3|Nice clean Bumper, full kit, wires and hardwear. Meatal is not to OEM specs. I would recommend spraying the inside with a rust protection. IL be lucky if it lives thru 4 years of Pittsburgh Winters and Salt.  Bang for the Buck I gave it 3...
B002JFEETW|5|Very sturdy.  Great quality
B00E5OUOCQ|3|This is a pop-up/collapsible style shade, which in theory should stow away easily into the pouch it came with.  Unfortunately, it takes a significant amount of wrestling with it to get the shade to fold up into its original, small configuration.  I bought this for a midsize sedan and it barely covers my windshield.  I've used it for a couple weeks so far, and I although it seems to prevent some of the sun's rays from heating up the car, I have not noticed a significant difference when I did not use the shade.
B00H25LN6Q|5|Very bright light and plenty of flash patterns. Small but great warning power
B001C9E51S|5|Purchased for a 2008 EX35. Fit like I expected.
B000PUQJUU|3|A lot of reviews says no dust but mine has a lot.  My OEM was putting out black dust and this is putting out brown dust.
B000CEBXRS|5|Fit Perfectly, Great Quality, Awesome Delivery!
B000CMFSXU|2|High heel shoes get stuck in the narrow groove which could lead to a dangerous situation. Easy to cut and clean.  Would not buy again because of the heel issue.
B012GTTYEK|5|I have a 15 year old daughter that we are teaching to drive and I am amazed out how inpatient other drivers are. Honking, flipping us off and yelling. This does not help with her confidence and makes her a more nervous driver.<br /><br />The bumper decal is printed on a magnet and it sticks to the back of my car nicely. It is a strong magnet and when I put it on it does not move or come off while we are driving, even in the rain. It is a bright yellow with black lettering so it shows up nicely on my black car. I can say that other drivers seem to be much more patient when she drives and we have the decal on the car. Don't get me wrong there are still plenty off not so nice people out there and they still yell and flip us off but I will say it has gotten much better and much fewer. I will say the yelling and flipping and honking has reduced by at least 75%.<br /><br /> I recommend this to anyone that is trying to teach there kid how to drive.<br /><br />Be sure to take the decal off when you (adult) are driving because I get some really strange looks when people pass me... LOL
B0045MX902|1|I live on the central coast of California, i.e., coastal fog, moderate temperatures, and sunny days.  I bought one of these covers thinking it would be perfect for our weather conditions.  I was wrong.  The cover I bought split within five months of purchase.  The company graciously replaced the cover, but the replacement cover split just as quickly.  I don't recommend this cover.  It was junk.  If it doesn't last here, it won't last anywhere.
B000IYR5J2|5|Exactly right perfect fit quick shipment
B00P2D4C36|5|Same as the ones that came with my car.
B004RCUV24|3|I was missing a part when the door arrived.  I contacted the manufacturer be e-mail and they sent me the missing part.  I would probably purchase a better grade shower door for my RV the next time it needs to be replaced.
B008MUGQNK|5|Great price on a very good valve
B000EALHHG|5|I have used oil eater for years can't do with out it, So happy I found it on line.
B008MISF54|5|Great oil, noticed immediate improvement in shifting feel and how smooth my KTM990 adventure runs. Cheaper than anything available locally and a very high quality product.
B00OH9ACQM|5|Great upgrade! Looks great, easy to install (with some care). Will try to attach before and after pictures.
B00KF9180W|5|Fit real nice and quality is excellent
B00RRAFWG8|5|Fast shipping,looks great.
B00I9JC3N6|3|It does not fit in to the cup holder as securely as I thought it would. It was not stable at all. And because it goes in the cup holder, I was now without a place 2 put my drink. It wasn't stable enough 4 me 2 place my drank on the tray.
B007WICUL0|5|I was hesitant to order this sight unseen, but it fits perfect & looks amazing in my Chrysler 300. And there is no glare whatsoever!!  Very happy with this purchase.
B004ZIVSEA|5|It fit perfect on my 79 cb 750.
B00N16RH3S|5|Nice looking
B00SSB5QRA|1|Did not work ever
B004FZB46U|5|just got this scale yesterday. My SMan3 guages with 3 72&#34; Hillmar hoses with ball valve and 10&#34; ends fit nicely in the compartment. It should accommodate Testos, Digicool, or any analog guages and a 3/8 hose as well. I've included a picture. The scale and compartment come apart too easy when open, but if you have owned TIF scales, it's a common problem, but only a mild inconvenience. I recommend this set
B004GC98MY|5|it fits  perfectly and opens with no effort.
B00S67X0YM|1|No reception
B002X9ULF0|3|Pain in the are to get on my car. Would not stick at first
B00UBFXSYE|5|Order came really really fast. Items all packed individually in perfect condition. The fixtures installed easily and look great!
B00I9SK8XY|5|Was exactly what it says it is, Have no complaints. Stuff is neat!! Fun to use, hard to clean! Can be very messy!!
B001G4Z5J0|5|I got the cargo carrier basket really quick and it works great and perfect size for what I need it for
B00ONHHNU6|5|Worked great
B00RODS0UI|5|Worked great
B002N5DEBW|5|Perfect for what I needed it for.
B004B61B34|4|Went on rather easy. Haven't used it to tow yet but, hold my light up Jeep brake hitch cover real good & stuff :-)
B009VNK4AS|5|My truck in the hottest of the hot in Florida is saved by this awesome sun shade. My steering wheel no longer feels like lava. I love it
B00192JFBI|5|Great insect screen. Camco has wonderful, quality products for things I would have never thought about being a first time RV owner.
B003XMQFDI|5|A+
B00ZVIC02W|5|Nice product, well made. Read the instructions!
B002OUIXU8|4|Good Product.
B00SWTJNXG|5|These lowering springs are exactly what I was hoping for. They really gave my car a nice stance. My 2015 Camaro sets perfect now and handles beautifully. Installation was fairly easy. I believe the instructions are probably only up to 2014 because a couple of the nut and bolt sizes where different than listed but was not a problem as long as you have the right size tools.
B00DWVN08I|5|OEM Product and fits perfectly on my 2015 Tacoma 4x4 Off-Road.  So far, it works great. Keeps the dirt and moisture out of the hitch and looks great!  Also, it stays in place real tight and hasn't come loose at all.
B00EZ85W7O|4|Ordered these because of great price shipping was fast and item was exactly as shown perfect fit easy install there was no alcohol cleaning pads so just make sure you have some around
B0002NIJQM|5|Would buy again, easy to install and looks great. You do need to remove tires to install, but no big deal.
B00OW0NQGE|5|Love it!!
B006Z907TY|5|good
B00FWOKKGI|5|Works great!
B00UCOBX6E|5|They look and work really nice!
B008G35YJA|5|Quick delivery, item as promised, easy install and great fit.  2003 sequoia
B00MYHE13Y|5|Looks and fits great. Installed on the back of the front seats in my Mustang, which did not come equipped with back pockets. Wonderful product at a fair price. Looking forward to it providing many years of great service. Thank you for making what seems to be a well-constructed and useful product.
B002JOVUO0|5|I had some moldings that were coming off my truck after a run of very hot weather. This tape worked great to get them reattached very securely. It has a fairly thin profile, but it still works best if you remove the previous molding tape before using this.
B00KT1BH1Q|4|great
B000FQ7WHS|4|Fits ok wrangler yj. Need to do new holes
B001MXX5D8|5|Keep this on hand all the time!
B000FQ0FR2|4|Fits nice on wrangker yj, need new holes
B000C902L6|1|Received the item was difference from the one I order. It is wasting time and money, not a good idea to business with
B0002Z9CKM|1|Item was disassembled in package when received.
B000GRZJGM|5|Great price and quick delivery !
B00BTYZBR8|5|Nice product, should last for several years
B00UGRF8AE|5|No issues. Fits seat bolt on 2015 Harley touring
B0085TKJ5E|3|Fit. Perfect.
B008XKC5TS|4|Just what I needed. Thanks
B001IZIFQC|4|Early review. Have this on my Flagstaff 206st for 2 months in Oklahoma. Hot and rainy weather, it seems great so far.  Fits easily, secure, adjustable and tight. I have a 12ft long box and it easily covers rooftop a/c and spare tire. There is extra cover when on all the way but it's not bad. Just tie and tuck with side straps.  Purchased 12-14 ft cover.<br /><br />Update - Jan. 2016 - After 6 months - record amount of heavy rain, snow and sleet this cover is still doing great!  No rips or tears.  Still looks really good and it fits great.  Even in 40 to 50 mph winds here in Oklahoma, this cover has stayed tight and protects from the elements well.<br />Well worth the money and not sure what people are doing to give this a bad review.  Last picture was taken in December 2015.
B0024NSR4C|5|I ordered on Monday delivered by Fed Ex on Friday. The headlights make the car look new again.<br />They were so easy to install no special tools needed
B008YDI6QA|5|It was as described.
B004A6OA7Y|2|Radiator seems good quality, except the plastic end tanks are assembled backwards. This made the holes for mounting the fans not line up and also means my fans are not flush against the radiator like they should be. If the manufacturer wants i can sens pictures of the error.
B00UBIRLDK|4|Well I really did like them but not on even one week and one of them blew off now I only have one on the car
B003G0KCCM|5|Fits great in my truck. Glad I ordered these. I especially like the additional velcro clip that was included. Buy from this company!!!!! You won't be disappointed!!!
B00GWZ73CU|5|I live in Las Vegas, and man, it gets hot here! The Gold Series Sunshade perfectly fits my Caddy XTS and keeps it cool, baby!
B001OBKPUE|1|This is a horrible product.  Do not buy.  They don't stunt behind the product.  Horrible customer service.  Product doesn't work.  My kids spilled cranberry juice in the car.  The company said that red doesn't come out.  I could use resolve to get out, better than this.  DON'T BUY!!!!!!  THIS PRODUCT WAS EVEN INSTALLED PROFESSIONALLY FROM THE FACTORY!!!!!  AWFUL.
B00E9D4NES|1|Visually looks nice, but both of the front stickers did not fit over the entire bowtie.  I even left the second one out in the sun a bit to soften up and still did not cover the whole bowtie.  There was gold bleeding in from the bottom and right sides.
B00VNQLDQK|5|Product wakes as expected. Only issue I have is not with the bulbs, but the housing. If you have the housing that diffuses the light, the projector partYou  of this light won't be effective. Once again, not an issue with the light, just the user.
B00MJUV6MU|5|Hooked it up to my camper, at my home , I got 2 green lights, that's good. Cannot wait to try it at a camp ground.
B007O5GXOG|5|Install was simple. Just pulled a few miles with it.  Will be using it this week to travel so not much feedback yet.
B00B7ORHNG|5|A quick delivery.  Fits perfect.  Keeps out water and dirt.  Just what I wanted
B00B9H61BK|5|This works perfect to get rid of the ricey fast blinking when you use LED turn signals. It fits perfectly and has plenty of adjustments so you can set your blink rate a little slower or a little faster than stock to match your preference.
B00YTE2DO4|1|Top plastic part of grenade comes right off. It's just pushed into bottom part and is not even a snug fit. Mine fell off about half way into screwing the first valve stem cap on. I ended up glueing them on. Not worth the price, but are awesome looking when on vehicle.
B0009IK5XK|5|lasted
B00A3UNYW8|5|as described and works great
B0128D4I7W|3|My car is a mess and I bought this with the thought if I had someplace to put some of the things I just throw in my center console, things wouldn't be so cluttered. The the bag is a great idea in theory: use the side of the chair, an area that is unused and ignored for useful storage space. It just seems to fall a bit short on execution. There is a nice stiff back, and the pockets are deep. But where it doesn't quite live up to expectations is how it is attatched in the car. There is only one velcro strap at the top, and while it is super &#34;sticky&#34; velcro, having just one anchor point essentially just makes it a big pendulum. Hit the brakes hard, hit the gas hard from a stop to make a quick turn, and the bag is swinging around. Now, with the deep pockets, I have not had an issue with anything flying out. But it is an annoying distraction to have swinging around in the car. I certainly would not put a can of soda in it like in the picture, open or closed, due to the shaking that occurs. I really really like the idea. But it needs another way to anchor the bottom somehow to make it more secure, then this would be amazing. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, all opinions expressed are completely my own.
B005VPS2TU|5|Fit perfectly and simple to install.
B0050SG9KW|5|Excelente
B0083H5ES0|5|I bought this item to fix a small leak on my truck's ac it's working really good a auto shop wanted to fix it for $450 this item save me money n will order it again
B008XB9BJY|5|very nice lights - not too bright - warm color
B0060A74V2|3|The miror is quite thin and with no backing it vibrates all over the place.
B002WIL5K2|4|Good
B008HBM0H0|5|The rack installed on the 2013 Sportage within 15 minutes. It looks like it grew there and does the job of hauling a kayak without any problems. In addition, the price came in at a sane and appropriate number. The price of the Thule's are ridiculous and don't do anything different than the Rola. Maybe I'm boasting too much since I've had the rack only three months, but what can go wrong at this point.
B0096DW4C4|3|No fuss can't figure out how I ended up with 3 sets though.....
B0039234WM|5|Took about a minute to install, absolutely terrific and a great price.  Just make sure you go into the car settings and put the windshield wipers into service mode, lots of videos on how to do so on web.
B005DVHV0S|5|I actually use this tool to clean my Silhouette cameo mat.  Love it, love it, love it.
B006RAACEG|1|Factory sent them with tips installed up-side-down. Too difficult to correct without damaging the tips. Returned them for exchange with a set that has been corrected. Awaiting results.
B00ASMX23W|5|Just like the Oem, works great
B001DKO4GC|4|looks good its for spare
B002GQQ8MU|4|Good product. Fit well in my z3
B00V3RW9RQ|5|Perfect, fits.
B0075KMEWA|5|These seat covers are awesome.  They fit great, give it a good look, and whats best is they actually protect my leather seats from all the daily hazards.  Since i am all ways on the road, weather gives the truck and all of the interior a beating.  Its in use 7 days a week all year long.  These seat covers have exceeded my expectations on all levels!
B0082365AQ|1|Not very well made, light and cheap. The strap plastic clip was broken upon arrival; when I tried wheeling without the kayak the wheel pin came out and the wheel would have fallen off. I'm usually not critical about items I buy, but on this occasion the built quality is not very good.  I have submitted to return this item; need to find something better.  The response to the reurn request was that I mail it to CA from PA, which will cost almost the price I paid the the item............
B009PO635S|5|Better quality than I expected.  Strong magnet and adheres nicely to curves on the back of the car.  Very pleased.
B00JJ66B9A|5|looks great on my freshly painted camper whees!
B00EP1GMV6|5|Perfect
B001AIZ5HY|5|Worth buying.
B00UB48VRO|3|not as expected..did not work for me..
B000C84100|5|Works well, easy to install.
B00DJF4INS|4|Pretty easy to work with but without heat the size will change in the cold need a heat source when applying the color is not this dark of blue more turquoise blue but still worked for what I needed
B00M3ENQXE|5|Work perfect on my 07 Escalade. Got them cut at Walmart for free. Programmed both keys myself.
B00BOEFEPC|5|Took my boyfriend 15 minutes tops to put it together. We did not screw it down in my car as it holds well in the cup holder on its own. Plus I can take it out whenever I need to. The only issue is that it kinda takes away two cupholders, but I do not have kids or passengers normally so it is not an issue for me right now. I LOVE this quick fix and wish an armrest came standard with the Nissan Versa Note.
B005KW6S6S|4|Works well on my 2016 kia sportage. Nice buy, im lookig to get one for my fiance.
B00FRJH5WU|5|Arrived in good time. Bolt holes matched up perfectly. Instructions were right on. Install was a breeze. I was even able to use the shipping box under the car so I did have to get dirty while installing from underneath the car.
B009IX46N2|5|very good it stand up to his name worked great
B00BR1TO80|3|The air pump nozzle is really cheaply made and you have to hold it yourself really tightly on the tire. It takes about five minutes to put in five pounds of pressure in a tire too..
B00MHFOTZ8|1|This is/was a real piece of junk!!  I returned it for a full refund which Amazon processed right away-thank you Amazon.  The pressure gage did not work and the pump would not even produce any air pressure for the inoperative gage to read.  Good riddance--DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!
B000CE9OY2|5|Recently I installed a kenwood excelon radio, which gives 4v preamp output. Since I bought it from Crutchfield, they sent me a free Metra 7551 harness as well. I didn't like the sound quality and decided to replace front speakers. So I installed Kicker speakers. Still to low. Though folks on maxima forum say that you don't need this kit with a 4v preamp output radio, I decided to try. This kit increased the volume level in 1.5 time at least. Now It sounds as it should. Installation was clear. In case of kenwood you just need to connect wires with the same color.
B00GWTAAIA|5|looks and works grate. Only tried it once when i first received it. Seams to be accurate and durable.
B004I0P53A|5|Install was simple.
B000NJ4QCQ|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE
B0009PCPNQ|1|It has a fragrance, similar to scrubbing bubbles. This is why it even gets one star from me.<br />As far as cleaning...it didn't do much.<br />Waste of money.
B00NBSHP2Y|4|Love this thing. I bought a new Arai corsair v and installed this thing and it gets loud and stays out of way. I've only used it for Bluetooth to my I phone for music and phone calls. It's minimal on outside of helmet which I really like. Easy to use.  UPDATE mic stopped working after 5 months contacted amazon and they took care of it only down side is now i gotta remove old one with its double sided tape from my helmet to install replacement
B000CLJQ7K|5|Worked as expected on 1999 ek3 civic<br />Honda power
B000FIXQXK|5|Works as expected.
B00BJNNNQU|5|UNBELIEVABLE! When this came in and I looked at the directions I groaned. I figured this was a long, tedious job. WOW! 30 minutes on my wife's 2003 Diamante (24: inch long headlights) and they both look new.
B00UXZY0R6|4|I really like my product so far. I haven't been able to use the key yet, but I am hopeful that it will work.
B000CGPK5W|5|Ordered these for a 2000 Monte Carlo. Look great and work even better. Do give a whirring sound when you drive but you can only hear it with your windows down and without any other cars around. I like the sound but it may bother some. Easy to clean also.
B009MAT1GI|5|This fits my 2015 EX with no issues and helps keep my car cool!
B00U9V0DPW|5|Everything fit as expected in my 2012 2DR hardtop. Nice fun little addition to the Mini. :)
B0075XGZFO|5|I've been looking for this sticker everywhere! It's a very good size and looks wonderful on my car!
B004ZF31PC|5|These gave me what I needed to be able to see at night. I am 60+ years old and have cataracts but not far enough along for surgery so in the mean time I don't see so well at night especially with my car's standard yellow lights. I probably could have gone with a temperature color update for my standard bulbs but I was looking for something more and I have heard that the lifetime of those bulbs is somewhat low. I wanted more intensity and of course the 6000k white color and this kit provided that. I needed to get the relay cable to get power from the battery because my standard wiring did not work. I arrived at this point because I had several email communications with Kensun and they were very helpful in diagnosing my initial problems in making the system work. I am very glad they were able to get me going because I can certainly see well enough with the new lights to be able to drive comfortably at night again. Now the dilemma, do upgrade my fog lights as well because of the color difference (Yes, but I don't have the money for that yet!)? I do need to point out that this upgrade isn't as easy swapping out the old light bulbs because HID bulbs require a ballast to work (just like florescent bulbs won't work without a ballast). This kit includes the required ballasts needed to make the HID bulbs work. This requires some wiring and thought as where you are going to mount the ballasts and route the wires and to make sure that they are not making contact with any hot or moving parts. The lighting kit plus the relay harness gives you everything you need for the installation. You will need some zip ties to keep the new wiring harness in place and you may need to drill a couple of holes for mounting the ballasts and I am calling this a do it yourself project that most people will be able to pull off.
B000CIYRKO|5|Bought it for my brother for overseas and they say it works great!<br />This one is original one you can get OEM for using it here for cheaper price, but for over the seas you don't want to get something that won't work and then they have to ship it back to you especially from the 3rd countries where the post services sucks.
B002ZHDL52|5|Excellent product ....
B004LX3AXQ|5|I'm a retired auto tech and I love how well this is made and what it can do makes it so much better than the battery tender.  It is twice the charger you get from some other manufacturers.  I highly recommend this to anyone needing a tender!
B00SBZRKEU|5|I would have a horrible time trying to lift a gas can and this little handy gas pump will make it soooo much easier.  You just have to plop in the batteries, screw it into the gas can, push the button, and the gas will flow from the can to the lawn mower.  Love it.
B00APOEQFG|5|I bought this for my husband, he had to have a Jeep logo license frame. It's made of  heavy material and has a good finish. I thought it was made in USA, but it's from China (my mistake).
B00JZXACC4|5|If you plan to take off lug nuts get the W7150 but, for everything else the W5350 is awesome and will get the job done.
B00KXP9E2M|1|waste of money and time.
B00JBQQZMQ|5|Pump works great. A 5 minute install job that actually only took 5 minutes!
B00A3LPSS0|2|I was disappointed it was difficult to see the bmw logo on forearm and last abdomen
B0006SH4NC|5|Excellent detailer mix with a little water for a 100% streak free wipe down its gets the job done do not use it on a car that has not been washed its useless
B00FF1K7BQ|4|great product
B009PHUHCK|5|Worked as advertised- good & strong & fit by vehicle w/o a hitch haha!
B009IP1X22|5|Great product. Works great. Better than the $172.27 that kobota sold me. I could not believe the price difference. Thanks for saving me $145.00.
B004DRRQV2|5|fit my 2002 envoy
B003O387TQ|5|pretty, as described.
B000C7TTZS|1|Was not the correct radiator in any way shape or form; dont take the risk and order elsewhere.
B00APY5RBI|5|Really glad we purchased this item to go with our Highland Sport Wing bike rack. It makes it so much easier to put the bikes on the rack and they aren't right on top of your back door . We received this product very quickly after we ordered it. It's very good quality.  I feel much better knowing my back door of my Equinox isn't going to get scratched. One other nice thing is it's much easier to attach the bike and the bike racks because it's not so low to the ground and close to the vehicle.We would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an SUV and has a bike rack.
B00CMSTXUG|1|Really poor quality. Installed on a Hyundai Santafe, tested 2 days full of rain and these make a horrible noise like a knife screeching on a dinner plate that does not stop. Will be returning them.
B010FIBKT6|5|very nice improvement
B004C443PS|4|Gloves are nice but the Velcro closures wears out quickly.
B00937X9ZE|4|worked just like it was intended, good price!
B00AM1Z67O|5|the price is great and the quality very high. It is the only oil your car MUST chug down for maximum efficiency
B00Y5I4SQA|4|This horn is good, louder than factory and looks impressive too.  It is larger and louder than the factory basic horn.  I have a VTX1300c. This horn will not fit this bike if you have a crash bar that mounts on top.  I like the horn and still just toying different mounting ideas.  I have mounted it, it does work well but had to remove it because of size and interference with respect to the area.  Note the size and measure before buying this or any horn.
B001AWJD1Y|5|Did the job.  Two years down and still going strong.
B00T36HLYU|4|Fit very good and worked well
B004AIHCOU|2|Second one I have had to buy for the same door. They come apart in the door. I wont buy this brand again
B0050N1NM6|5|great worked as discribed
B00K889FCI|1|Wipe New makes their money by doubling customers' shipping orders and by not refunding money to ask of the unsatisfied customers. If you see a review that states that the product is wonderful and they upload beautiful pictures, beware, it is a review written by Wipe New employees who get paid to do just that. ***DO NOT SAND YOUR HEADLIGHTS!!*** Headlight lenses come with a protective coating. Sunlight does cause fading and discoloration. Look at the side of your vehicle (or other vehicles) that faces the sun the most during the day; that side will be more discolored. It is NOT &#34;microscratches caused by dust... &#34; that causes the damage. If that were the case your clear coat and paint would be worn off also. I prefer using Formula 14 on my vehicles because it clears the light lenses without sanding, polishes the paint, makes minor scratches disappear, restores faded paint and protects the dashboard and interior as well. That is the best product I have ever used. Good luck.
B000NZUQG0|5|I　love it!
B009NOZ4PK|5|Bright light, easy fit for 2003 VW Golf.
B003UC0OC4|5|It took me a while to get this in place as I am not a mechanic.  But I have had in my Jeep for quite some time.  I love the dual battery system. I run all my extras off one battery and the starter and stock equipment of the other.  I added https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CEDZBK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 .<br />When my key is off, the batteries are separated, when the key is one, the batteries are in tandem.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product.
B001DRHMMS|5|Worked perfectly and easy to install. Much cheaper than getting the dealer to it. I don’t see how the dealer can charge so much for something so simple.
B00LGXI3B8|4|It works great just feels a little cheap but better than full price Suburu gear
B0012RI5MK|5|Awesome! 5 min install!  I did think it was funny they have you 2, count em 2 zip ties to tie up 5 feet of harness... But no complaints here!!! Lol
B009DJKL7Q|4|Was the exact past I was looking for. It fit perfect.
B004A67S64|1|Wrong part for my vehicle.  Unsure how I selected something which does not fit any of my vehicles.  Amazon sent me info on returning for credit but I have not completed.
B00G24610Q|4|Nice quality, but they should be larger length wise to cover the thread.
B004HCOE8Q|5|great stuff
B0073MF21K|5|Great price and fast service
B00MBPLPOC|5|This product leaves a nice shine on my tires and lasts much longer than other products. It is not greasy like the others and does not wash off as readily. I am purchasing more to have on hand.
B00JPQW92M|5|Just  what I wanted thanks
B001MYWBF0|1|First use, it died in less than 1 hour.<br /><br />I bought this in December 2014. Got a couple of 6V Golf cart batteries in July and decided to use the charger to make sure they were charged. (with a plan to charge them once a month). i.e. I connected the charger to one battery. (in case anyone wondered if I did something stupid :-)).<br />At the beginning everything was fine. Charging started with Type = 6V. The fan was on inside the charger... all expected.<br />I come back one hour later to check it and there were no lights on the charger, nothing happening anymore. The charger was very hot. The batter was still a little over 6V, so it seems that at least the battery was not destroyed.<br /><br />I unplugged it (and tried in different outlets, verified the outlet was still working...), let it cool down in case some overheating protection kicked in. Nothing.<br />The warranty is a joke. it's 2 years from the box, or 5 years from inside the manual, but IF YOU REGISTER IT WITHIN 10 DAYS of buying it. Clearly very few folks do send a warranty postcard within 10 days of buying something. At best you register on a web site. The manufacturer knows that, so that's likely a way to get rid of 90% of warranty claims.<br /><br />So no warranty. I studied electronics, build kits in my spare time, so I decided to check it out. Inside, the quality seems fine. All soldering and crimping looks good. Nothing smelling funky (burnt electronics have a smell), nothing obviously bad.<br />There's a huge fuse for the 12V line that is also fine.<br />So at this stage, I don't want to spend more time troubleshooting, and need to find a place that recycles electronics...<br /><br />If you know any relatively fast, 'computer' (micro controller really) controlled charger, that also takes 6V batteries (I know I could plug both in series and use a 12V charger, but I'd rather charge them one at a time), and that is NOT a Schumacher brand, please let me know. Under $100 would also be great. TheOptima chargers are well rated, but 12V only, and $200 on Amazon. [[ASIN:B009M3PQFA Optima Digital 1200 12V Performance Battery Charger and Maintainer]].
B00498WLEM|4|Requires an 18 MM socket and wrench to install.  The original link had 17 MM nuts.  Constructed well and more substantial than OEM Honda link.
B007C7ZQA8|1|did not work
B00DEJUYBE|5|looks great om my new Meteor grey Mazda 6 , It looks like it is part of the car and original equipment!  Showed it to the dealer and he thought it looked great.
B00SXE4GI2|3|The material is very light weight, tie down straps or bungees must be used to keep it from blowing off your rig. The solar reflective material is good for Phoenix, but not a great value for the price.
B00GOYN3Y6|4|This is a great headlight. ONLY issue I had is on my 2014 SGS this headlights color temperature (Kelvin Rating) does not match the Custom Dynamics Ringz. The JW Evo 2 has a brownish tint where as the Ringz have a blueish tint. To some it won't matter but to me matching light color on front of bike was a necessity. Hope this helps
B000XECJD4|3|I like it but one of the tools ..the one which comes with the plastic stick is not similar.
B0076HK74E|5|Will buy the other side now I saw the trouble free installation. It’s just perfect
B00JH2C4XI|5|Had it installed by a Tire Kingdom and it worked great and at half the price Nissan wanted
B001RBCU90|5|Nice product, you do have to be careful with install.
B006QGD996|5|Wonderful; It does the job; It fasten, and hold items<br />into place, and make it fit nicely. Very durable, easy to use,<br />and overall it is a very nice item. I recommend it;
B001RBQF4G|5|Fits my 1982 Honda 900F over the seat with nothing under it. So far it has held everything I put under it very well. Seems good for my purpose. I like it.
B002UC8SUU|4|these were what i needed for the DC pump i purchased. they connect to a garden hose.
B009RN2TQ4|5|The caps work great
B00651CBHI|5|great antenna for my hummer, easy to install works perfectly
B007SKHNY6|2|collects too much dog hair and lint...
B00CIMAXZU|5|Got it two days after ordering, sounds like a log truck now! It definitely turns people's head when they hear it.
B007QV1VCC|5|Excellent
B009NHPZR4|5|We have three of this same brand. They are strong, light, and fold and open flawlessly. 5 stars!
B00REJXAZC|5|FANTASTIC!!! For the money this Tri-fold version is absolutely unbeatable. Stop looking because you found the one you need! Packaging was great! It arrived on my door step a day early too.
B00080QHMM|5|Received in good condition. Work as advertised
B001LQMWTO|3|Pretty good frame I expected a little better quality
B0007RVLWW|5|Really makes it cars and motorhome shine!  Easy to put on and smells great!
B00B5ZYY38|4|They would probably be fine but tag frame wouldn't let me use the black covers
B006B7YLX8|5|This is a great upgrade for your truck. It was easy to install and sounds great. I also noticed if you drive regularly there is an increase in mpg. I drive to work about 30 miles a day at about 55-60 and have noticed about a mile per gallon better then before it was installed.
B007ZOM9ZS|1|Item does not fit this vehicle. This part number is correct according to denso and other retailers however, Amazon is sending the incorrect fitting and the hinges and will simply not fit. The box says the correct part number but the item inside the box is wrong. Does not look like ad described either.  My vehicle is a Nissan Sentra SR 2.0L engine. According to Denso, this is the part for my vehicle, however, their is an issue with their claim. This part does not fit the socket. The two hinges on the sides will not allow it to enter the socket. instead of having one hinge higher and the other lower, they both need to be straight in the middle and parallel to each other.
B001MOVN22|5|Great. It saved me a bundle.
B00EDWF1BE|5|Great product!!!
B000KZ0Q7W|5|Works great! Easy to program!
B000FPXVOW|2|12303.12 - Passenger's side full door - 97-06 TJ and 04-06 LJ 12303.13 - Driver's side full door - 97-06 TJ and 04-06 LJ  Seemed like a good seal at first, but I'm now getting a pretty severe leak that comes in right above the top hinge on the door.  The seal is much more flimsy in that area than the OEM seal.
B00I2W1T0I|5|I purchased 2 of these seat covers for my Mother in Laws yellow bug and she was thrilled!  They look great, fit perfect, feel durable and the colors give the car a little pop.  She also found a steering wheel cover to match so she's tickled pink.
B00C26IDOU|1|I returned it cause it looks like cheap plastic.
B000EH0ORI|5|Good tool, good service, thank you.
B0002STS2Q|4|It works well and looks good on my keychain.
B005BU5DCO|1|It did not fit my 2005 Toyota Corolla
B0018JZ5ES|5|Worked great. Fast delivery!
B011MMHOPS|5|[[ASIN:B011MMHOPS OPT7 LED Headlight Bulbs w/ Clear Arc-Beam Kit - 880 (893, 899) - 60w 7,000Lm 6K Cool White CREE - 2 Yr Warranty]]<br />I purchased the OPT7 high and low (H11 and 9005) beam kits for my 2010 Prius.  I had previously tried using 2 different sets of HIDs and was unhappy with the &#34;5000K&#34; purple-blue beams.  The OPT7 bulbs are pure white and all 4 match color and output wise.<br /><br />The kits came complete and took about 20 minutes to install. No tools needed.  My first night excursion was last night and was about 90 miles of rural driving after 10 PM.  Dear and other animal strikes are pretty common on Michigan rural roads, the additional side and higher definition color of the OPT7 LEDS allowed me to drive with less fatigue and more confidence.<br /><br />Great service, complete kit and fairly priced.  I would recommend these kits to anyone.
B000C2LWUS|5|good
B00BGZ0BSE|5|I actually have two pairs of these, one red and one blue. We own two Ford cars (one red and one blue). Buy putting the remotes in these I can keep track of which remote goes with each car. Otherwise, you cannot tell them apart. They stretch to pull over the remote like a pair of socks and fit well. I have had one pair for more than a year and they wear well. There is no sign of them failing and probably have saved the remote from many dings and bangs in that time.
B001O0ZNV6|5|Awesome brake shoes, my squeaking brakes are gone!!!!!!!!
B004EKYB7U|5|Fit great and no issues, worth the price!
B00JQWEBIA|5|Impressive
B00064331I|5|As described
B003SG7PU6|4|I like the fabric and if fit good in the crv.
B001PPM6VA|4|Extract fit and works great!
B001GPZ5MQ|4|I like it.
B00IWYU0TM|5|Fit was great, does what its supposed to, great price.
B00B9DEBJI|4|Works well
B00K05KKYQ|1|Terrible quality! Buttons were crushed when I received it and it was very flimsy. I returned it immediately.
B008032ST0|1|It doesn't work.  And it can't be returned.
B00K2LHXTS|5|these look great color wise (very white, hint of blue) no more yellow halogen bulb color! much better than stock bulbs on my 2011 Tahoe. super easy install.
B011KZOE0U|4|Similar to my other review... these switches take some customizing to get the lock tab on the connector to actually engage and lock. Also on both switches I had to swap the pins on the power and accessory on because they lit up all the time when wired according to the instructions... just have a wiring savvy guy with when installing. They do look clean on the dash.
B00GSAUHB8|2|👎🏻
B0012XIV82|4|I got these for use with lighter loads and to be quick about it. They are quick and easy to set and great for small loads. I would like the switch for the release to be a bit longer or on the outside for easier acces but it does work like it should and no problems functionally as of yet. They seem to hold tension well and don't slip like I thought they might.<br />They are great for a quick and easy tie down for when you need one and they don't take up a lot of space .
B00336XFK0|5|Great, works well in the El Paso Tx sun
B0002KKIV4|3|There's mildew on my Jeep's soft top. This did nothing to remove it, but in all fairness, I probably let it get too far gone before trying to give it a good cleaning. This product did seem to clean the top well, except for the mildew. I liked the way it produces some suds, but not too much.<br /><br />I had to wash my Jeep at a car wash, so I didn't have the luxury of letting the product sit on the top for a period of time first. Had I been able to do so, maybe it would have worked better.
B001443BZM|4|These thimbles are HEAVY DUTY by the metal thickness and can accommodate the rope diameter (no pinching) as it goes around the loop.<br /><br />I do want to note that I received 1-7/16 inner loop diameter with 316 stamped on the thimble, not the promised 1-9/16 inner loop diameter with 304 stamp. Last time I checked, Sea-Dog did NOT sell 316 thimbles, so I have no clue where these thimbles came from.<br />From Sea-Dog site: 170016 - 5/8&#34; - B 2-5/8&#34; - C 1-9/16&#34; - D 3-7/16&#34;<br />I got 5/8&#34; thimbles with B 2-5/8&#34; - C 1-7/16&#34; - D 3-1/4&#34;<br />Outside diameter of the loop is ~1-5/8&#34; on this thimble.
B00V2GEMVY|5|Works very well
B000C9O5IC|5|GREAT PRICE VERY FAS SHIPPING AND A VERY GOOD BRAND
B001C4SLA4|4|Good system.  Install was ok.
B003WDMUC8|4|how much money That's much music
B00JDQ2IRA|5|Love it go here in 2 days and fit perfectly
B009DJTE6U|5|This is the one to buy. Others dont work everything. This one does!!!
B000IYNVHW|1|I was told by the &#34;Make sure it fits&#34; that this would fit my vehicle.  It did not and had to return it.
B002NF325U|5|It made my truck smell good again.
B00MU1IY5U|5|This looks great on my car!
B00G23UYAU|5|With freely fast delivery... Looks good and my son loves them
B00651C998|4|good item
B000XQ2S4M|5|used it 3 times worked great
B00MU9BYS6|5|Work fine....Not much else to say about jumper cables.  The heavier gauge works well with my older model Chevy Suburban.
