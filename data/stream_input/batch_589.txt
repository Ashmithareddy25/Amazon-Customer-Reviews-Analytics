B000301YY8|2.0|If Blunt's music is so great and if he is a military war veteran.... why does he have to grow his hair into a Beatles mop and in his video take his smelly shoes off in a ceremonial zen-like fashion? What's is all that about? We can also do without all the potty-mouth language. It's overdone and it's impact is long gone today.  <br /> <br />He has a good voice and his songs are fine.... now James, clean up your language, stop pretending to be a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders, and know it's okay to be well groomed and looking sharp... and you will get 2 more stars from this reviewer.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I had bought this album 2 months ago on backorder.  The album was released last tuesday and i recieved it that Thursday.  It is Thursday again and i can say without lying that I have listened to this album once every night for the last seven nights so i'm going to try and attempt a commentary as opposed to my opinion of the album.    I heard 46 & 2 about 2 months after lateralus was released,  little did i know what lateralus existed or what it was but when i heard and awesome song on the radio, i felt compelled to find out the name of the song and the band.  I called the radio station,  then bought Aenima.  i listened to 46 & 2 only, that song only for about 5 months.  I didn't grasp the rest of the tracks because i was younger and was ignorant to the complexity of tools music.    Then i heard about lateralus.  i listened to the whole album and when i did, immediately when i heard reflection i flipped.  i always yearned to find music that, when you heard an unbelievable riff or chord, you kinda wish it lasted longer.  reflection was it for me.  i later discovered that a wide percentage of their music tends to do just that.    At the time, i had my stereo blaring the album when reflection for the first time and it immediately became my favorite song ever and still is.       I tend to like the type of songs that Tool makes that don't really have a pattern.  They're all like an independent little journey (which tends to be the longer songs).  I love every song by Tool with the exception of \\"Hush\\" from opiate.    1.Vicarious-this song was on the radio.  It has all the complexity of Tool, i can best describe this song as solid Tool metal, kinda straight ahead, really good.    2.Jambi-its about the character in pee-wees playhouse.  Still heavy, guitar sounds more common of other rock bands.  crunchy guitar in toolish form.  Adam uses a talk box on this one, not bad at all.    3.Wings for Marie Part 1-quiet entrance, about a minute or so gradually progresses. soft and quiet at first then it leads to soft and loud then quiet again.    4.Wings for marie Part 2 \\"10,000 days\\"-i would tell you what this song is about but that would ruin the album.  This song flows from the last one and starts with that signature solo low-bass that leads to the rest of the instruments, kinda dark start.  almost like you feel like you're in a dark room for the beginning of the song and then the door opens to a beautiful clear sky.This song is one of Tools \\"beautiful\\" songs.  it opens wide to all the soundscapes, kinda like at the finale of \\"The Grudge (track 1-lateralus) except it isn't heavy like that.  kinda soft like you're floating on a cloud.  very reflection-esque*album favorite of mine    5.The Pot-a song about what i enjoy when i listen to Tool.  starts out kinda the way \\"schism (track 5-lateralus)does.  it doesn't sound like it at all but the way..all bass then guitar.  Maynards vocals start off high in this one, doesn't keep the same pattern throughout the song.  very heavy fast bass song.  kinda like cross breeding 46 & 2 with schism and speeding it up and making it lighter hearted. *album favorite    6.Lipan Conjuring-a Tool filler.  sounds like someone shaking charms on the top of a staff while people chant quietly around a tribe ceremony as you hear someone scream in the background.  perhaps a sacrificial ceremony?    7.Lost Keys Blame Hoffman-tool filler.  leads to \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".  this song is about a patient on acid that won't talk to the nurse and she's discussing it with the doctor.  creepy conversation heard over experimental guitar and a little feedback.    8.Rosetta Stoned-this song is very heavy and crazy song.  i don't like the voice affects in the beginning.  i mention this because i think there will be a people like me that won't appreciate it because it sounds like everything but tool but we've gotta keep in mind that tool crafts their songs slower in a way that is to appease THEIR desired product, not ours, what makes them happy.    this song kind of crests at the end and breaks and speeds up for the short leftover ending.  I still love this song aside of the beginning.    9.Intension-very desiposition-esque.  has some techno affect in Danny's pads (i think) making kinda techno drums, fits well. the guitar in the middle sounds very, very reminiscent to a Nirvana song but i can't put my finger on it right now.    10.Right in Two-song starts off slow.  maybe it's just me but the                 guitar kind of sounds like the album is saying goodbye, just sounds like the finale.  You can kind of tell where this song is going to end up when you play it and thats cool because where it leads to is a probable slot as the best Tool song ever.      i can definately tell that if they have this in their setlist when i go see them in concert that they will put it at the end of the concert and it will be like an explosion. everything gradually speeds up and gets gets very fast, very heavy, very tool.    11.Viginti tres-sounds a lot like \\"Faaip de Oiad (track   13-lateralus)sounds like something glowing at first then makes weird wind sounds accompanied by demonic voices.    *Overall Assessment*  this album sounds like they took undertow style and the way the guitar and bass sounded in lateralus, crossed them and then put the guitar in the spotlight with some undescribable new material.  they also threw Adam in on the talkbox, Maynard with voice distortion, and Danny with techno drums.    Usually Tool has all the members have their time in the light equally but the guitarist Adam Jones was given the green light on this one.    I can tell you now, if you liked all the Tool albums, you will love this one..i think.  If you Just liked Aenima like a lot of people out there, you will turn this off 2 tracks in.    Use your third-eye.  This album is about 60% of stuff you'd never think you'd hear from tool and 40% of older style.      Unfortunately, this album is so different from their other ones that i thinktool will lose some fans but then again, I don't care.  They OBVIOUSLY made what they wanted to make, i'd rather they lose some fans so hopefully when they come around again it will be much easier to get a concert ticket    >opiate-more simple, very angry    >undertow-still not extremely complex, head on tool rock    >aenima-trippy, experimental, trance inducing, very climactic    >lateralus-chizeled masterpiece done in a candlelit room    >10,000 days-an album done with the lights on, lot of guitar    this album will need more time than any of the others to grow on you.  even if you don't end up liking it, you'd wanna buy it for the kickass picturs that turn 3D when you use the stereoscopic glasses built into the album.      Maynard has started a wine making business called Cadacus, so they definately aren't playing for the money.  He'd be wasting his time if he was out for money because a winery, besides the album is about $13 WITH all of the cool stuff inside of it.    all my love to bud and tool
B000EULJLU|2.0|I agree with most of the reviews here, too much filler, the band don't come across as interested and I found it overly boring, yeah the packaging is awesome, and a couple of tracks rock! But it doesn't take away the fact that I just blew $$$$$$ on a cd I can't listen to. I found that the album sounds like a rejected Latarlus that was scrapped then re recorded...
0385484518|5.0|I first heard about Morrie Schwartz on a TV documentary with Ted Koppel where he interviewed this insightful man. After I watched the program, I knew I needed to buy the book and I am glad I did. I thought it was life changing because it gave me advice from a person who was not afraid to share difficult conversations. There were several statements that were particularily profound: \\"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in\\". \\"The truth is once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\".     Another important concept was \\"Detach\\". Morrie advises, \\"If you hold back on the emotions-if you don't allow yourself to go all the way through them--you can never get to being detached, you're too busy being afraid. You're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief. You're afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely... then you can detach from that emotion for a moment\\".
1400079179|3.0|The premise of this book is that Christ married Mary Magdalene and had children with her.  Their bloodline eventually ends up sitting on the throne of France.  A nerdy historian has to fight against all odds to help protect the line as well as his own life.<br /><br />This book pretty much reads like a dime store novel.  It is not the page turner people make it out to be.  In fact the whole premise of the story is a rip off of other books including Da Vinci Legacy, and Holy Blood Holy Grail.  This author keeps it just above outright plagiarism and has won a few court cases challenging its originality.  If you have read either of these two books you will wonder how it wasn't absolute pure plagiarism.<br /><br />Where does all of the controversy come from you might ask?  At the beginning of the book the author prefaces things by saying everything is factual.  Ok so nothing in it is factual, it is a work of fiction.  If you are aware of history then none of this will bother you.  However if you don't really know that much you might believe the things written inside it.  They talk about a vote on whether Christ was divine was very close.  The actual vote was like 300-2.  The fact of Christ's divinity was never in question the vote reflected how the Church wanted to define or verbalize it.  I am no fan of the Catholic Church and know that their history can be attacked on numerous fronts; however this book is not up to the challenge.<br /><br />Other facts that this book presents are that the Louvre's glass pyramid is made up of 666 panes. Again not true.  This can be refuted by the hundreds of morons that actually went and counted them and came up with 690 or so.<br /><br />No controversy would have existed had the author not prefaced that his book was a fictional story surrounded by solid facts.  No one would have taken the book seriously without that preface and that is why the author included it.<br /><br />The three star rating does not reflect this misinformation at all.  The three star rating reflects the stolen story line, poor writing, and hollow character development.  I feel sorry for all of you that think this is a well written and suspenseful book.  Perhaps you would like the Tenth Justice.  It is equally predictable and poorly written.rmation at all.

B00004RFFW|5.0|The summer of 1989 was loaded with blockbusters, yet there was only one movie that I really wanted to see more than any other. In a season that saw such blockbusters as a new Indiana Jones movie, the latest Star Trek picture and Timothy Dalton's second outing as 007, the movie that held the most excitement for me was LETHAL WEAPON 2. Not because of Mel Gibson or Danny Glover or a particular love of the original, but because the love interest came in the very lovely shape of the lead singer of one of my favorite 1980s bands (Eighth Wonder) Patsy Kensit.<br /><br />Truth be told though, there's not much to Kensit's role here, she is there simply as window dressing in the part of a secretary at the South African consulate. The movie as a whole though is a great, fun ride and is easily my favorite of the franchise.<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves drug smuggling that is being conducted by officials at the South African consulate. Back in the 1980s South Africa was largely an international pariah because of its policy of apartheid. This made it easy to target them as the villains and their position as diplomats provides them with the protective vbeil of diplomatic immunity. As lead villain Arjen Rudd (played wonderfully by British actor Joss Ackland) comments when confronting the Los Angeles police officers \\"you could not even give me a parking ticket.\\"<br /><br />Starting with a chase through the night streets of Los Angeles, the movie races from one action sequence to another rarely pausing for breath in what is a classic cop buddy movie. Both Gibson and Glover make a great team and the interplay between them provides for some really subtle humor.<br /><br />Which brings us to Joe Pesci, whose humor is about as subtle as a sledgehammer in the role of witness Leo Getz - \\"Whatever you want Leo Getz - get it!?\\" Pesci is at times annoying and at other times loveable, but he is always funny. Obviously he was also a hit with the audience too as he would return in the third and fourth movie of the series.<br /><br />As a bonus for Kensit fans like myself - in the scene where Leo is cleaning Riggs house you can hear Eighth Wonder's biggest hit \\"I'm not Scared\\" playing in the background. It's a shame they did not have Kensit's character survive until the end as they had originally planned, but I understand that her death leads Riggs to take the dramatic action that he does.<br /><br />This is my favorite cop movie (alongside \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\" and an entertaining way to spend 114 minutes or 118 minutes if you go with the directors cut.<br /><br />Scenes included in the directors cut includes Leo using numbers to remember a suspects address and Murtaugh getting some bad news from an auto-repair man after Riggs drives his new station wagon up against a guardrail. Pretty standard stuff that I felt did not add anything particularly.<br /><br />The directors cut also comes with a making of featurette, cast and crew bios and a theatrical trailer. Here's hoping that one day soon Warner will put out an ultimate edition. Director Richard Donner has already done a great commentary track on the original Suoerman movie and a commentary track here would be welcome also.<br /><br />Recommended.th movie of the series.  <br />As a bonus for Kensit fans like myself - in the scene where Leo is cleaning Riggs house you can hear Eighth Wonder's biggest hit \\"I'm not Scared\\" playing in the background.

0143036556|3.0|In his previous book, Guns Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond brought an objective, analytical framework to help understand the rise of civilizations.  Not everyone will agree with his high-level, trend driven approach, but he makes the case in a clear and compelling way.  In Collapse, he sought to repeat this approach in trying to explain why civilizations fall.  He draws on a framework of five factors, but fundamentally argues that the human impact on the environment is the driving cause of the decay of civilizations. <br /> <br />While his framework is insightful, Diamond was simply too emotionally engaged to achieve the necessary objectivity.  He would be the first to tell you how important he feels that the environment is and makes no effort to hide the fact in his book.  Unfortunately, he never stops to note or realize that this introduces bias into his position and his framework. <br /> <br />Despite some bias, the majority of the book is excellent.  I would never be considered an environmental activist, but I feel that Diamond relied primarily on sound arguments for good environmental policy.  For example, he spends a lot of time addressing the huge sums of money that the US government is spending to clean up old mines.  Even if you're not chaining yourself to trees, you would prefer that businesses paid to clean up their own mess and that the government put policies in place to try and make sure this happens.  When we fail to do this, it's *our* tax dollars which must be spent to clean it up, taxes which would otherwise have been spent on education, healthcare, or not taken in the first place. <br /> <br />If you feel that you can be objective and pick out the solid arguments that Diamond makes, this book is insightful and an excellent read.  If you're a staunch environmentalist, you'll agree with everything he says, including the bias, and probably won't get much from it.  If you think environmentalism is bunk, you'll get distracted by his limited bias and assume it's all junk (you'd be wrong!).  You make the call. <br />
0739326740|4.0|As I write this we are 7 days away to the release of the movie. It has already stirred up a whirl wind of controversey for the Christian world. This is only the beginning. I predict this book and movie will cause millions to lose their faith forever. It causes people to question things they always have taken for granted. The Jesus/Leonardo theory is very, very, far fetched and I disagree with it. I hope this leads people to a passionate pursuit of truth whatever it may be and breaks the spell the church has had over the western world for 1500 years.<br /><br />What Dan Brown has done is take the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail and put it into a fictional plot. I find the theory of Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene a bit far fetched but there are small pieces of evidence in the new testament that Mary M. did things for him that only a wife was allowed to do. Example annoint him for burial, wash his feet etc. This book is not for Christian fundamentalists because they will find it very blasphemous. It is a nice little mystery/thriller plot with religious implications that are starting people thinking about things they have always taken for granted about Christianity.The plot is a typical Dan Brown plot formula:highly intelligent man gets involved with a highly intelligent woman, after her father is murdered,lots of mystery in who the real bad guy is, secret socities come into play, and the hero and heroine are together in the end.It is Dan Brown's situational settings that make his books so good. I will definately be going to see the movie.
0743201140|3.0|This is a very useful book especially for people who are thinking about changing careers or people starting their careers. It is also a useful guideline for managers and employees in understanding people with different talents and raising awareness around how to manage them.<br /><br />The web-based test is detailed and the information useful and thought provoking. It serves as an excellent springboard for deeper inquiry or discussion. It will also help you to make better decisions that serve your real needs and help you align your talents with your work.<br /><br />I think capitalizing on a person's strength's is a wise direction to take in general. However, to say addressing deficiencies or not exploring other potential areas of creativity that might be untapped isn't very useful doesn't make sense to me. In other words, this seems like an extreme position to take and I think a more balanced approach is in order.<br /><br />Perhaps there are undiscovered fulfilling areas that have not been developed in all of us that are in our best interests to unearth.  For example, my understanding is that Michael Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team, but my guess is someone saw something in him that was undeveloped and nurtured it to fruition.  We certainly don't want to be missing the business equivalent of these kinds of buried talents!<br /><br />It also seems like the authors minimize the significance of training and oversimplify how these ideas could be applied fairly in a large organization. While there are many useful ideas in the book, I don't think the solutions are as simple as the authors make them sound.<br /><br />I also don't like that you need to buy additional copies of the book to take the test more than once. Perhaps the publishers could give people 3-5 test taking opportunities given the cost of the book.  Also with respect to cost, I think the authors could have put more information in the same space or wrote a shorter book.

B000EULJLU|3.0|While this album still maintains the melodies, rhythms and ambiance that makes Tool sound unique, nothing truly shines.  As a whole 10,000 Days falls somewhat short of the mark established by earlier Tool.<br />Two songs have enough musical substance and edge to get my mind moving:  Vicarious and The Pot.  The rest are auditory lulls that leave little to no impression on me.  It simply seems that this album lacks some manner of creativity that can be found in their previous work.<br />I have listened to this release many times now and although 10,000 Days fails to rile my enthusiasm for Tool, it is a passably satisfying musical experience.<br /><br />Having given the album time to sink into my consiousness, I would have to give it 4 stars.  While I hold to my earlier comments, the music does have longevity and enough appeal to keep me listening from time to time.

0312965788|5.0|All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot and the other books in the series have been favorites of mine since I was a teenager. I love the individual stories about the animals, the laconic farmers, the flighty Siegfried and the irascible Tristan. I feel as though Trickie Woo is a part of my family, and the story about the thermometer disappearing into the cow is one of the funniest stories I've ever read.<br /><br />These stories are delightful to read when you need a pick-me-up. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always amusing, Herriot's love of the animals he serves comes through loud and clear. The only problem is that once I start reading them, I am unable to put them down!
0553801503|3.0|When I first picked up Game of Thrones in 1997 I was expecting to read another paint-by-numbers fantasy fiction series that I could escape to and then forget when I returned to the real world. <br /> <br />GRRM shocked me. He created a world that you could believe in, much as I believed in Middle Earth when I first read Tolkien. <br /> <br />I am not here to review that, or the subsequent two books however. <br /> <br />A Feast for Crows (AFFC) has been keenly anticipated by an ever growing legion of GRRM fans.  <br /> <br />The wait stretched and stretched, but most were happy to give GRRM his due and allow him to create the best possible book that he can. As such, every day that we waited, I could feel the expectations for AFFC growing. <br /> <br />I felt the first tremor when it was announced that the draft would have to be split in two due to problems with the length. Moreover, it was also decided that the book would be split, not by time, but by characters.  <br /> <br />When I first read AFFC I really felt that we had been given most of the lesser POV characters and a great deal of filler. I still fell that upon rereading <br /> <br />The value of this book will only be determined when the other half is released. <br /> <br />Time will tell if GRRM has lost his way or if this is just the lull before an impending storm of the magnitude Westeros has never seen.
B000003CMB|5.0|This monsterpiece deserves its \\"desert island disc\\" status; it pretty much sets the bar for in-concert blues rock excitement.  With that out of the way, let's clear a path through the bouquets of roses strewn at its feet and actually look at it.<br /><br />First, ABBLAFE - the product of a perfect moment - is as good as it ever got for The Allman Brothers.  Duane Allman was truly a virtuoso, but he died shortly after it was recorded.  The in-person intensity never carried over to their studio albums, which were pretty bad.  (The good parts of Eat A Peach were simply leftovers from this engagement.)  Most egregious of all were their attempts at ballads, songs like Melissa were goopy then and downright embarrassing today.<br /><br />As to being representatives of \\"Southern Rock,\\" what does this term even mean?  ABB rock is no more overtly racist, misogynistic, or unintelligent than regular rock, and besides, the ABB originated in Florida which is an entity even more awful, and quite distinct from, the South.  Check the Fillmore East playlist.  What you have here is classic amped-up Delta blues, spun out into long, endlessly creative jams.<br /><br />Which brings me to the ABB secret weapon rarely credited or even mentioned.  ABBLAFE features a rhythmic bed created by the highly unusual sound of two drummers, and their relentless energy does just as much to propel the furious and infectious forward motion of this CD as the interplay between Duane Allman and Dickey Betts.  Give the drummer(s) some!<br /><br />As to Greg Allman, the less said the better, although his marriage to Cher - and Federal drug charges, (resulting in a plea he secured by ratting out a friend), did provide a listless nation with some much-needed diversion.  The Allman Brothers Band At Fillmore East is a fabulous, must-have CD, and it gets better with repeated listening - but it's Duane's show, and like Hendrix, Duane burned brightly and too briefly.

1582403589|5.0|Like many readers, I've been an on again/off again comicbook fan for many years... In the last couple of years (since the year 2000) I've returned to the fold, this time taking advantage of the many top-quality graphic novels out there, and Robert Kirkman's \\"Walking Dead\\" was one of the titles most frequently recommended to me since I started this reading spree.  It lives up to the hype.<br /><br />I just finished reading books 1-4, which collect the first twenty-four issues of the comic, and man, I can't wait for book #5 to come out.  The series tells the story of a guy named Rick, a small-town cop and self-described Barney Fife who wakes up from a hospital stay to find the world changed around him -- it's zombie time, but zombie time with twist.  The twist is that, unlike all the movies and TV shows we've all seen, \\"The Walking Dead\\" has a much longer, open-ended story arc -- Kirkman and co. don't have to wrap things up in a tidy, two-hour package, so there is space for the story to unfold at its own pace, with character development that's more prolonged and in-depth than the usual zombie flick allows.  By the end of Book 4, the crisis has lasted about a year and Rick and his band of survivors are about twelve strong, having lost about an equal number of family and friends over the course of the story.  It's a taut, grim, reflective plot line that keeps your interest and compels you to read. I, for one, hope this isn't just another one of those neat B&W comix that kind of fizzle out, but rather that Kirkman really gets the chance to do what he says he wants to do, and follow Rick's saga as far as he can.  Anyway, I'm hooked.  As long as he keeps writing this series, I'll be first in line to buy it. [copyright joesixpack @ slipcue.com ]
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Stadium Arcadium marks the band's ninth studio album and after a catalogue that spans twenty something years...you begin to age with the band too. There are the highs, the lows, and the mids. This album works on all the emotions: the partygoer, the hapless romantic, the sordid vigilante, and even the downbeat writer.<br /><br /> Drummer Chad Smith starts up the album with their current single, \\"Dani California\\", a song that features a running character from the groups' past two albums. While the song certainly has a hook, the rhythm and beat nearly emulates Tom Petty's \\"Last Dance With Mary Jane\\" and the lyrics are not so far either.  Nevertheless, guitarist John Frusciante offers a Hendrix-esque tube guitar that bridges the song and finishes it off with heavy, pig-squealing distortion.<br /><br /> Frusciante immediately comes off clean as the band jumps into an easy next single, \\"Snow (Hey Oh).\\" Anthony Kiedis really shines on this song and while it's mellow, the song drives and brings back an emotional curve ball that anyone should relate to (something that may have lacked from the more personal By The Way).<br /><br /> It's a song that will no doubt have you in tears.<br /><br /> Forget the Kleenex though, this double album has some very funky tracks that nearly date back to the Freaky Styley era. The very Parliament-esque, \\"Charlie\\" switches up the atypical, modern Chili Peppers harmonies and calls again to the more chanting, crowd surfing vibe that anyone whom can correctly associate the band with tube socks will undoubtedly love. \\"Readymade\\" albeit slow tunes in with some roller rink bass lines and Kiedis' sounding crude and unusual turns the song up a notch-the band at their best.<br /><br /> It seems Flea is ridiculously happy as he's all giddy over the track, \\"C'mon Girl.\\" A song that sports a fast bass line that hasn't been around since Californication's \\"Right On Time.\\" The rhythm flows nicely too, tossing and turning a Rolling Stones vibe that allows Kiedis and Smith to bounce off each other and Frusciante to keep driving forward.<br /><br /> One of the more interesting additions to the album is guitar work by The Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, whose talent is nearly wasted in the simple yet fun track, \\"Especially in Michigan.\\" Considering the talent at bay, I would have thought a more eccentric and edgier song would have been chosen, especially one that would have both Frusciante and Rodriguez-Lopez interacting with each other. Honestly, if you didn't know he was on the album, there is no telling in the song.<br /><br /> While the album culminates the band's twenty-three year legacy, they grow a bit.<br /><br /> \\"Make You Feel Better\\" is stripped down pop circa 1995 and something that would make Tom Hank's character in That Thing You Do proud of. \\"21st Century\\" offers a modern, nearly computer styled \\"wah wah\\" bass line. \\"Torture Me\\" is harmony heaven even for a Chili Peppers tune, whereas \\"Death of a Martian\\" finishes the album with nearly spoken word preaching.<br /><br /> Whether it is the placement of songs or what, this album is a work of labor to finish through. Twenty eight songs is a lot to sit down and listen to, especially when the average length is four minutes per song. I'm not going to say this would be a better album had it been chiseled to a single release, that isn't true. The album just needs a better flow, that's all.<br /><br /> Instead, there are some songs that just blend into one another and while what you're listening to is golden there are moments when it really all dissolves into one thing.  Kiedis, as surprised and stunned with the work before him, sounds bored on a number of tracks while Frusciante's solos become more and more predictable. Flea shines on a handful of tracks and in others he's the house band in the corner. Most of all, Chad Smith keeps the pace and works the beat, but the drumming isn't as necessary to the band as it were in say, Mother's Milk.<br /><br /> As a whole,Stadium Arcadium is a great album, but certainly nothing stellar or spectacular. It does however offer pound after pound of some of the band's best material in recent memory. Don't miss \\"Storm In A Teacup\\", the radio friendly jive talking song, or the mandatory, you-know-they-will-be singles, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", or even the downer \\"Desecration Smile.\\"<br /><br /> This is a strong release with even stronger songs, you just have to pick and choose. Take this as a fruit basket, some like apples, some like oranges, but we all love fruit. Perhaps then, you'll have something equally stellar in your hands.<br /><br /> Okay, I'm done..

0596000480|5.0|If you've been in web programming for a while, you're undoubtedly familiar with JavaScript, but may have dismissed it as a \\"toy language\\" for flashy graphics effects without much substance.  Although JavaScript is certainly the web professional's tool of choice for flashy graphics effects without much substance, the language itself is surprisingly substantial.  I had been meaning to learn more about it for years and tried off and on by looking at example scripts and reading online documentation here and there.  I finally decided to break down and buy a book on JavaScript, and I'm glad that it was this one.  I can't recommend it highly enough - it's especially targeted at people with programming experience.  This book doesn't waste your time with basic constructs or meaningless metaphors; it gets to the point, describes JavaScript, and lets you get on about your business. <br /> <br />As the book itself clarifies, JavaScript itself is just a programming language and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with web browsers per se.  However, since virtually all JavaScript programming is done for the purpose of controlling web pages, the author specifically dedicates one third of the book to the core JavaScript language, and another third to a thorough description of the bindings between JavaScript and the browser.  (The final third is a well-indexed reference that you'll find indispensable). <br /> <br />Since you're probably most interested in the JavaScript-browser bindings (the core language is fairly well documented online), let me say that this books coverage of it is excellent.  It covers the entire history of JavaScript, detailing compatibility issues between Netscape, IE, and Mozilla (all the way back to the very first release of Netscape) and detailing exactly the sorts of uses that JavaScript is typically being put to these days.  An example in the section on event handling shows how to implement drag and drop on a web page in JavaScript (bet you didn't knowyou could do that!) and there's even a lengthy section on the relationship between JavaScript and CSS. <br /> <br />I couldn't be happier with the book - it lived entirely up to my expectations and was well worth the money I spent on it.

As a public safety consideration, do not play this CD while driving in your car.  Easily the best debut album by anybody, ever.
B00003CXC7|5.0|For a director who once described his actors as cattle and who said the best way to direct them is to treat them as cattle (he said this as a joke by way); Alfred Hitchcock sure got the best out of his actors.<br /><br />Mr. Hitchcock never really got the credit he deserved for most of his acting performances in his films: especially with his work with leading and supporting female actresses. Part of the reasoning may be due to the fact that he did work with the best talent in Hollywood. But look at his past films and you will see characters that come alive, heartfelt, and feel lived in. There's extreme depth, realism, and complexity to most of his movie characters.<br /><br />In his 1954 classic, Rear Window, Hitchcock gets career performances from Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Both actors carry this film to heights that would not have occurred with lesser talent. The gold nugget is that Stewart and Kelly both do something that is extremely difficult for an actor/actress to achieve on screen.<br /><br />They don't act, they re-act.<br /><br />It's very difficult for an actor/actress to achieve this effect for a sustained period of time. There's always that motor or inner instinct telling the actor that they have to do something, say something, or show the motivation of the character. It basically takes trust. Trust in the story and directing.<br /><br />I see a lot of this reactionary acting in Asian cinema. In particular Japanese films. The effect is still the same, but in Asian cinema we get the reactionary shots via conversation(more so than American cinema). For example, when we see a shot of the person listening and not the character talking it creates a very compelling shot. A surprise element comes into play.<br /><br />In Rear Window the effect is different as we see Kelly and Stewart reacting to off screen stimuli. By using subtle gestures and reactions we get inside the heads of the two characters. We feel thier confusion, anxiety, and bewilderment. The subtlety of the acting is so precise in its realism that the audience feels that they are a 3rd person voyeur. It's this talent that the actors bring to the table and the set up of the story that makes this film work.<br /><br />Mr. Hitchcock was the inventor of the POV shot as we know of it today and here he creates breathtaking POV shots, wonderful pacing, and unique camera angles to create \\"pure cinema\\", but believe me it's the strong acting and compelling story that makes this film an endearing classic.lism that the audience feels that they are a 3rd person voyeur.

1594200823|5.0|Since I read Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation\\" over five years ago, I have refused to eat any fast food of any kind. Both morally and nutritionally, my position is that if I were to eat that food again, I would be tacitly accepting an industry that is abhorrent on so many levels. Knowing what I now know, that degree of cognitive dissonance is simply too great for me to overcome.<br /><br />When my son was born two years ago, my thinking about food choices returned and has become an important part of my day-to-day consciousness.<br /><br />When I first read about \\"Omnivore\\" online, I found the premise compelling. What exactly am I eating? Where does it come from? Why should I care? Exactly the kind of book that I'd been looking for, especially as I try to improve my own health and try to give my little guy the best start in life.<br /><br />I bought the book as soon as it came out and found it to be highly enjoyable, yet almost mind-numbingly disenchanting. We all know about corn and cows and chickens and how the government subsidizes their production (mainly through corn subsidies). But Pollan has given me a completely new view of corn, its processed derivatives, and secondarily, has made me rethink my view of the farmers growing this stuff and the industries who buying it. There is so much wrong with this picture.<br /><br />Corn, in the wrong hands, can be used for some terrible things, among them high fructose corn syrup (a major player in the obesity epidemic) and as feed for cows (who get sick when they eat it, requiring anti-biotics!). I can't compartmentalize anymore, just because meat tastes good. As Pollan clearly outlines, there is a very selfish reason why the beef industry doesn't want us to see inside a slaughter house. Many of us would never eat it again if we saw how disgusting and cruel the process typically is.<br /><br />In the section on the ethics of eating animals, Pollan compellingly summarizes animal ethicist Peter Singer's case against eating animals, making a strong argument for vegetarianism. Then he tries to argue for a more moderate (read: carnivorous) world view, and I have to admit, I wasn't convinced. I am a lifelong meat eater, but am seriously thinking about switching to a vegetarian diet. I can no longer reconcile the slaughter of animals with my own appreciation of them. And beyond slaughter, there are plenty of health benefits to eating a plant-based diet.<br /><br />Here's my bottom line: If you aren't prepared to question your views on food, or are afraid of what you might learn, then you really need to avoid this book. This has all made my head spin and my heart ache over the past month. Faced with the facts, I actually feel  as though I am mourning the loss of my old diet. But I am terribly ambivalent about becoming a vegetarian, not at all happy to be making such a drastic (yet healthy) change. I am embarrassed about it, and worried about how I will deal with a meatless lifestyle in the years ahead. I am glad Pollan opened my eyes to this, but secretly wish I weren't so curious about these issues. The truth hurts.ainst eating animals, making a strong argument for vegetarianism.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|Having twice seen stage productions of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and been impressed both times, I was skeptical when a friend suggested watching this in movie form.  I strongly questioned whether a musical that was intended for the stage could ever be done justice on film.  The answer was a resounding \\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />The quality of the music and vocals was superb, which is not surprising since this score is one of the all-time greats.  The movie script was true to the original stage play, and the actors did an excellent job of bringing depth to their characters, especially the Phantom.  The color and pageantry of the costumes was a wonderful treat for the eyes.  The settings and props were of first-rate quality, and were immediately recognizable and familiar from those I had seen on the stage.  Even better, there were scenes that were either added or modified somewhat, such as Raoul galloping off through the snow on his horse to rescue Christine at the cemetery, or the special effects surrounding the crash of the chandolier, to add a bit of flair that was not reproducible on stage.<br /><br />In short, the quality of this production does not suffer one iota for being done in a video format.  The only thing that lessens it at all is that it must necessarily be compared to the unparalleled excellence of the live experience, but this runs a close second.  Bravo indeed!
0792163710|2.0|When the beginning of this movie opened I was absolutely sure I wouldn't like it.  It started out so far from the book it was laughable.  First of all, the main character in the movie was Shane, however in the novel the main character happened to be the little boy named Bob (aka Joey as seen in the movie).  Bob was the narrator of the entire book and we see what happens through a little boys' eyes.  Not just as an observing fly on the wall, watching everything happen around it.  Secondly, I didn't exactly enjoy the way it was so lacking in accuracy.  When Shane first arrived at the Starrett farm in the novel he was wearing all black, and there seemed to be a lot of detail in the way Bob noticed him.  While in the movie there was very little in describing Shane through the boy's thoughts.  It seemed that the child said very little at all and had even less running through his mind.  However if you wanted my honest opinion on the movie itself, I'd have to say it was good.  I didn't have any problems with the acting in this film and found that the fight scenes were very much like the ones depicted in the novel.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who has NOT read the book!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I am a huge FF7 fan, no doubt.  I have loved and played every final fantasy game.  I look forward to FFXII and the tentative third installment of FFVII.  I looked forward to this movie.  I have seen it three times, in order to try and absorb everything I could, in the hopes that there was SOMETHING that I missed from the first two watchings. <br /> <br />Why, then, do I give this two stars?  Because there wasn't anything more to it.  Anything more to this movie you might see will be a mix due to your love of FF7 and your experiences with the game.  I could go on and on ad nauseum and repeat many of the same accolades and pitfalls that I have seen in other reviews.  It's safe to say that the majority of the pluses are indeed good points about the film.  This film is a visual masterpiece, and should define what CGI movies should be on a visual level. The music is great if you're into rock and cheesy riffs (which I am and I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack, despite the naysayers) It is also an adequate adaptation of a video game series. Most of the problems listed are also pretty consistent with my experiences.  The action is jerky and extremely unrealistic, characters are glossed over and tacitly written off as if they do not exist, much of the ending of the game is patently ignored in favor of making a half-hearted typical Hollywood-style movie but failing in most respects.  Ultimately the action is too ludicrous and takes up too much of the movie's real estate, while little things like \\"plot\\" or \\"character development,\\" which made the GAME WORTH PLAYING, suffer in this absence.   <br /> <br />The most important question I have to ask is this: if this movie's plot were translated into a game with FF7-style graphics, even as a sequel to FF7, would it be worth playing? <br /> <br />I would have to answer \\"hell no\\" to this.  Without the graphics and the Final Fantasy name, this movie reveals its total lack of substance, and is a total anathema to everything that is FinalFantasy.  Rent, but do not buy, and always remember the greatest Christmas lesson of all: crappy things can and often do come in pretty packaging.
1594200823|5.0|Here is an example on why you read books.  To read a newspaper article or watch a TV news broadcast about animal rights or healthy eating is to get besieged by politics and heated debate, but to find little thought or consideration.  Pollan takes the opposite tack, approaching what we eat and where it comes from in as open and thoughtful a manner as possible.   <br /> <br />Pollan sets out to corn fields and natural farms, goes hunting and foraging, all in the name of coming to terms with where food really comes from in modern America and what the ramifications are for the eaters, the eaten, the economy and the environment.  The results are far more than I expected them to be. <br /> <br />It is Pollan's open-mindedness and his insistence that he personally experience the entire process of getting the food to his plate from its very beginning stages before making any judgements that makes this book so good.  He brings a reasonable approach to the discussion that makes for a great book, but probably wouldn't sell newpapers or draw TV viewers. <br /> <br />The conclusions Pollan draws from his experiences tend to eschew the ideas of radicals on either side of the food argument and instead focus on coming to terms with what we eat by truly appreciating where it comes from and what it consists of.  He constantly refers back to a time when we were comfortable looking at the process by which our food got to our plates and still being comfortable eating it.  Reading this book, you can't help but come away thinking that our inability to do that today has partly to do with the path the food takes to our plates today, a little to do with our becoming strangely uncomfortable with our true nature, and something to do with what we choose to put in our bodies. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great book that will leave you thinking differently about eating and probably eating differently because of it. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Im am a 16 year old guy from Texas, I have barely heard Johnney Cash much less about June Carter Cash, after watching \\"Walk the Line\\" I had a new respected for Both Johnney Cash and June Carter Cash and what they went threw as well as how they lived there life. \\"Walk the Line\\" is a wonderful story of both of them, put together and fully adapted by Director, James Mangold.  <br /> <br />Honestly the acting by Reese Witherspoon & Joaquin Phoenix was simply astounding, Neither Withspoon or Phoenix looked anything like the people that they were playing... yet they fought threw that slight disadvantage to pull of some simply exceptional acting performances. I thought that Phoenix did just as well as Jamie Foxx did last year playing Ray Charles,... It was dissapointing because I really thought that he deserved an Oscar for his performance in this role BUT Philip Seymor Hoffman also did a knock out job playing Truman Capote, bad luck for Phoenix.... Witherspoon also did an awsome job playing the up-beat country singer, June Carter Cash, though she says she really had to battle with singing and not breaking any mirrors while doing so, I really thought she sang rather well, that goes for Phoenix as well.  <br /> <br />The screenwriting was also pretty while written as well as just about every other type of production for this film. After all these wonderful comments on \\"Walk the Line\\" I am sure you are wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, ... the reason comes down to age, as I said I am 16 and I really dont care about the Cash's so I cant say I loved it because well ... I didnt ... BUT it must be a pretty good movie for me to like even though I dont much care for the topic! haha! <br /> <br />Great film for all adults as well as teens that somewhat care about Cash (which is highly unlikely...) <br /> <br />Overall: B+

B000003TA4|5.0|What do you think of the Beatles????? They are overrated and old. But they have made a couple really good songs such as Hey Jude, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Birthday. But they are still old. Nirvana is much better than the Beatles because they <br />atleast play more hard rock and heavy metal and this is one of <br />the greatest albums containing 4 really terrific songs such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium. <br />Don't get me wrong, I was born when this came out 1991 and this goes better together when you buy Metallica Black Album, Dire Straits On Every Street, and the Use Your Illusion anthologys by Guns N' Roses. Those just match this one. Go buy it with every album today...and one more thing, why did Kurt Cobain kill himself in 1994???????????  <br />Please buy it everyone. <br />Nirvana is just as great.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is 369 pages of why I love Batman. It starts off on a good premise. Batman is in about as close to a straight up detective role as I've seen him in. The opposition includes gangsters, several of his more psychotic and dememted foes, and even the people he believes in. <br /> <br />The story is very interesting and entertaining but maybe not quite brilliant, similiar to the other Jeph Loeb stories I'm familiar with. The connections with Year One were interesting, however a comparison would be futile, these are two very different stories. The fact that so many villains appear inside of a year is possibly not the most commensense idea ever, but like Loeb's Hush story it's justified if you enjoy the way they handle it and the art. <br /> <br />Tim Sale's art is, in my opinion, incredible. Very unrealistic in many ways, even for the world of comic books, but nonetheless very pleasing to the eye. Certain panels were just gorgeous. I love his interpretations of all of the characters (with the exception of Poison Ivy, which also happened to be my least favorite part in the book story-wise) and his backgrounds were very effective. <br /> <br />If you love Batman, read this book.

Of course, it's obvious by how poorly written his reviews are that he's nearly illiterate. Add to that a penchance for reviewing things that he clearly has no experience with and, therefore, no business reviewing. <br /> <br />I'm not a big KISS fan but to say that their lyrics are illegible is as ludicrous as his 75 pages of reviews elsewhere.  <br />The words to the average KISS song are very easy to make out. It's just one more 50 year old irrelevant cliche about rock music in general. Hmmm.... 50 year old irrelevant cliche. I'd be willing to bet that may apply to the reviewer himself as well. <br /> <br />Please, in the future only review items you're qualified for, namely comic books and Star Trek.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I am 52 years old. I grew up (and still am growing up) listening to some of the finest rock n' roll ever produced.  <br />Jet is the only new rock band I've understood in years. <br />What does that tell you about the sorry state of music right now? <br />Buy Jet's CD. Get their next one as well.  <br />Listen to real rock n' roll.
031286504X|5.0|I Am Legend is surprisingly great!  You would think that something written in the era that Richard Matheson was was writing would be dated and well.... be ready to be taken off the shelf.  Actually Matheson hits the nail on the head with a timeless classic that transends beyond horror and becomes in it's own way a statement of society itself.<br /><br />I am legend should be at the top of any readers list if they haven't yet read it.  It's light and short but delivers ten fold what a book 30x's the length can.  It goes to show you that great things come in small packages.  You also can't help but relate to Matheson's main character if you are no stranger to isolation or the feeling of being well, different.<br /><br />A surprise ending worth every page... I can't say enough and I don't want to give the story away.... This should be on your \\"To Read List\\"  today... and I'm not a heavy reader but, if there were more stories this interesting, I'd quite my job and sign up for foodstamps, haha.<br /><br />=====================<br />Movie Alert<br />=====================<br /><br />There are now 3 versions of this book in film.<br /><br />Latest was with Will Smith.  Fun, big budget, not close to the book, disappointing ending.<br /><br />70's with Charleton Heston... Wow Daddy O' this is just too cool for school.  If you dig the 70's you'll Dig this flick<br /><br />The last Man On Earth with Vicent Price, Closest to the book.  Very slow moving but very Entertaining, I feel this is the best representation of the book.  I would suggest this over the others.  I like will smith and I think he did excellent in the modern one but those vampires were CGI and were not scary at all.  The old one was limited and didn't have the better set and budget but it's just a better film, a better adaptation to the book.
B00000JHAU|4.0|Many self-proclaimed \\"indie people\\" will tell you that this is hands down, the best album by Belle and Sebastian.  I've concluded through years of dealing with people like this that they purposely choose obscure and odd-sounding music and claim it is \\"awesome\\" to try to showcase themselves as more understanding and knowledgable about music than you could ever be.  Those are the people that love this album more than the other ones.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good album.  But it is much softer and, at times, simply weirder than the 2 albums that I enjoy, \\"The boy with the arab strap\\" and \\"Tigermilk.\\"  The people that love this album will tell you those records are bad, and their reasoning basically boils down to the fact that those albums are instantly accessible and enjoyable on their face.  You get immediate gratification listening to those albums.  This one, I feel like I am straining to enjoy it in the way that I enjoy those.  I shouldn't have to feel like that.  Musical elitists will tell you otherwise.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Bought the Cream 2005 DVD. I recall running home to my digs in 1968 to see the final Cream farewell concert.  So, didn`t know what to expect.  What a risk they took in 2005...to just appear with basic instruments, no back up musicians, no backing tapes, keyboards etc..  In other words, no safety net!! <br />The result...OUTSTANDING! A terrific album.  The playing is probably better than in ` 68.  I love to hear the instruments without the clanging mess that you get from so many modern live bands.  And, this was always a `killer` band. <br />Great moments...for me, ` We`re Going Wrong` ...even better than on Disraeli Gears.  Bruce`s mourneful vibrato at its best...Baker`s tom tom effect so apt and Clapton`s lead playing, beautiful yet restrained near the end.  One of the finest live pieces ever performed by any band. <br />`Sunshine of Your Love`  really impressed me.  I had played this tune to death in the ` sixties but the live version brought back great memories and what a riff to lead into any song...all the other succeeding metal bands were hugely influenced by ` Sunshine`.  `Badge` worked really well...I loved the power chord groan before Eric went into the George Harrison guitar passage. <br />`White Room` was slightly laid back but grew as the tune progressed and sharing the vocals was a good idea...I think Bruce sang it all back in the `60`s??   You knew that he needed to take a few breaks. <br />A pity that `I Feel Free` was omitted. Most of the tunes were played at a medium pace so it would have been fun to hear a belter like ` I Feel Free`.    <br />Also, it might have been a laugh to hear the boys sing the opening piece, acapello...BA, BA, BA, BA, BA,BA..I FEEL FREE and so on!! <br />`Crossroads` could have gone at a faster pace...You can do it, lads!! <br />Anyway, to conclude, one of the very few reunions to really succeed and what a great idea to just play without any gimmicks.  Eric said that he knew that they were capable of doing this and how righthe was! <br />Wonderful to have this DVD and how satisfying it all must have been for the three guys involved, and their families. <br />Hey, there`s no reason they can`t reform every so often to remind us how great they were and are. <br />WONDERFUL! <br />Billy, Donegal, Ireland.
B000003TA4|2.0|But personally, I didn't like this album as a whole. Yes, it's a NIRVANA album, probably one of their best records ever made. But I listened to it for what it is without thinking about Kurt Kobain or the hype that the band got, which you have to admit would've been non-existent if it weren't for him. At the end, all i got was a mediocre rock record. Apparently, it spoke for a certain time and place in teen culture not too long ago, but it didn't speak for me. Also, Kurt Kobain's image also empowered the message of this album. The only song I liked on it was Smells Like Teen Spirit, while the rest to me either sounded the same, or just didn't have the same affect as SLTS. Sorry, I understand the big hype and praise for Nirvana, but not their music.
B000EULJLU|2.0|We sat and waited 5 years for a new Tool CD.  Held over superficially with a couple Perfect Circle CDs, but not satisfied, just waiting for Tool to put out a new masterpiece. <br />The result....another Perfect Circle CD.  This is NOT TOOL!!!  <br />The songs have no distinction to separate them, they dont drill into your head like the last couple Tool CDs, which are without a doubt, two of the best CDs ever written.  Ultimately what throws this cd off is the anticipation.  If someone takes 5 years to release new material, you build it up in your head that it is going to be incredible and when you finally get your hands on it and it sounds like a b-side album for Lateralus???  Come on!!  That's the problem with bands with huge success like Tool taking on side projects.  It cuts out your edge, you blend styles and lose your uniqueness.  Thanks for making a new CD, next time you decide to make one like this, change your name again.  If you still want to be the Tool we all have grown to love, SOUND LIKE IT!!  And come up with a better Tool-esque album name.  10,000 days?  Hmmmm??  Not very creative.  But then again neither was the album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Everyone wants a heavy, catchy, easy to listen to pile of crap. <br />If you want that go buy a album from all the nameless metal core bands or a boring heavy pop radio album like rob zombie seether.  When the term \\"alternative\\" started years back, it meant that most people did not like it because it wasn't predictable and nice sounding. If you want something creative, heavy and mood invoking buy this album. Tool write because they like to scratch an itch-  <br />not to make an album that sounds good in your car. They are musicians that obviously don't care what everyone thinks.
1400079179|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is like the movie National Treasure on steriods.  It is the ultimate page-turner.  It begins with a murder in the Louvre and you are hooked for the rest of the book.  I wasn't really bothered by the book's premise: that Jesus and Mary Magdalen were married and had a family, but this \\"truth\\" has been covered up by the church.  That is why the book is so interesting: its about the ultimate conspiracy theory. I don't really see how anyone could be \\"converted\\" to Brown's theory, it is just too fanciful.  Its easier for me to believe in the Virgin Birth than in the \\"history\\" Brown proposes.  But in knowing its a work of fiction, its quite enjoyable.<br /><br />I was, however, annoyed a bit by some of Brown's arguements for this theory.  For example, one of the characters says that the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950's and tell of the true story of Jesus.  They were found in 1947 and say nothing of Christianity.  They are strictly Jewish texts.  Brown's characters also demonstrate how the Church has downplayed the female by looking at stories in Genesis.  Hello Mr. Brown, the book of Genesis existed for hundreds, maybe thousands of years before Jesus or the Church came along.  Likewise he says that the Church called Mary Magdalen a prostitute to defame her.  Maybe, but the Church has also done much to promote her.  After St. Peter, more churches and schools are named after Mary Mag than any other Christian figure.  In addition, being a converted prostitute has precedence in the Bible and seems to be almost a badge of honor to go from the lowest to the highest.  Rahab the philistine (book of Joshua) helped save the Israelites and is part of Christ's geneology in the Bible.  So the NT doesn't even care that Jesus came from a prostitute.<br /><br />I also didn't understand why Brown chose to say Leonardo Da Vinci was a homosexual.  Da Vinci was accused of this by an anonymous person in his lifetime, but the charges were dropped when the person would not come forward.  This is the only evidence that he was a homosexual (and possibly the fact that he never married).  But if Da Vinci is suppose to be the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, and this society is built around the idea of the divine feminine, how does Da Vinci being a homosexual fit into this?  Sex between a man and woman is suppose to be the ultimate form of worship for this secret society, yet Leo, its head, didn't even engage in it?  Overall its a great read.  Just read it as a work of fiction and enjoy it.  Get your history somewhere else though.ould not come forward.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|As you are aware, listening to the chili peppers in the late 80's and listening to them now can only strike curiosity as to how they're rock has weakened.  After giving this much thought, the rock hasn't at all weakened, only mellowed to a different and more mature rock.   <br />This album is an incredible leap in the lives of the chili peppers, and a musical milestone.  John Frusciante's guitar etiquette and humble playing style turns vicious this album.  Not letting anybody get away with saying he only plays slow, emotional parts... he establishes dominance over technicality and speed with both discs of this album.  Thinking one can play any chili peppers song on guitar, this album could very well change your view. <br />Flea is toned down much more while Anthony sings more.  Basically what I'm trying to get across to you is that this band is turning into something they want to become, and what the music wants them to become.  With the harmony Frusciante gives off to compliment Kiedis' voice, and rhythymic drum scores played by Chad, this album is a must buy for the avid music lover and the average to greather red hot chili peppers fan.  It may take some listening to get used to, but it's worth the time you put in to absorb the fullness this album has to offer.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Given Interpol's several universally agreed-upon influences, one might immediately assume that they are too derivative. This accusation is a bit unfair, because its influences are as little of a secret to the band itself as they are to fans and critics. However, it is not completely inaccurate. The disembodied vocals and ghostly soundscapes are obviously homages to Joy Division. The shiny staccato chords are echoes of The Bunnymen and Television, so the Velvet Underground must be lurking somewhere beneath the surface. (Incessant downward strumming? Check.) Finally, the broad guitar strokes recall Johnny Marr's work with The Smiths. (\\"Say Hello to the Angels\\", in particular, bounces along in a fashion similar to \\"This Charming Man\\".) And I would never miss a chance to shamelessly plug The Feelies, and the intro and outro to \\"Untitled\\" definitely bring this underappreciated band to mind.<br /><br />So no doubt, Interpol is a sponge of influences, and damn good ones at that. Thus, they are a pretty good band. But like many bands who soaks up its musical heroes, Interpol ends up sounding not quite as interesting or exciting as any of them. They are not as unsettlingly raw as Joy Division, as fresh as Television,<br /><br />nor as energetic as The Smiths (nor as dynamic as that other group of contemporary New York hipsters). Then again, very few bands live up to such standards, and the fact that such comparisons can be made favorably is a big compliment. Moreover, many of Interpol's fans may be (with all due respect) too young or of too limited a musical frame of reference for the comparisons to matter, for better or worse. Interpol is certainly to be admired for aiming for such a sound, even if the results aren't as impressive as those aspirations would suggest.<br /><br />The individual tracks on \\"Turn On the Bright Lights\\" are all at least pretty good, and occasionally brilliant. Strangely, however, listening to the CD all at once can seem a bit of an arduous task. Some critics I have read would counter that this is not meant to be a good time rock 'n roll record. I agree, but a CD can be no fun, a downer, or whatever without being a chore to listen to. The centerpiece of the CD is clearly track # 3, \\"NYC\\", a beautiful somnambulist of a song. But as great as it is, it stops just short of being exhilarating, which is an important part of its - and the whole album's - appeal. \\"PDA\\" speeds things up, but the slow to mid-tempo pace re-emerges on the excellent tracks \\"Hands Away\\" and the crypto-sexual \\"Stella Was A Diver and She Was Always Down\\", as well as \\"Obstacle 2\\". The CD picks up the pace a bit with \\"Roland\\" - another of the disc's best songs - and \\"The New\\", before closing with the somewhat creepy \\"Leif Erikson\\".<br /><br />One of the best things about this CD is that it reminds us that great rock music of the past quarter century can be resuscitated and hopefully gain some new fans among the younger generation. I guess that I can understand why this CD has received the praise that it has, but in my opinion, it is simply not as great as all that.\\"Turn On the Bright Lights\\" seems more like a promissory note rather than a payment in full. But it is a debut, and in that regard, it is certainly one of the best of 2002. And in simplest terms, it is great that there is a band out there who made a record that sounds like this. Give it several listens. I won't blame you for a second if you like it more than I do (and you probably will).Some critics I have read would counter that this is not meant to be a good time rock 'n roll record.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|This collaboration between Cee-lo and Dangermouse is absolutely incredible, and it effectively showcases the musical genius of each artist without sounding forced. There are aspects of soul, rock, R&B, hip-hop, and even a little pop mixed into each of the 14 songs that pleases the ears. Particularly enjoyable to me were the different and impressively diverse drum tracks, each of which perfectly matched/melded to the songs. Cee-Lo's raspy, soulful voice is like the icing/candles on a well-baked cake (which, of course, is Dangermouse's awesome production). There was not a song that sagged; each are important, and pleasently surpirse the listener. The duo also doesn't take themselves too seriously, like on tracks such as \\"The Boogey Monster\\" and \\"Necromancer\\", poking fun at themselves/others, and bringing a genuine smile to the listener's face. Not even the rapping sounds corny or half-assed; it's wonderful in its own way. This album is an excellent contribution to music history, and will perhaps inspire more artists to break the chains that specific genres ensnare them with. I want more!
B00003CXTG|2.0|After having read the reviews, I thought it would be bored out of my skull for three hours. This was not the case. <br /> <br />Yes, this movie wants to be an action/chick flick combination. The advantage of choosing pilots as main characters (other than the obvious heroic nation-building) is that you get to see lots of special effects and root for the good guys to try out their childhood tricks on a real enemy. The Pearl Harbor battle scene is spectacular and it is the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br />The downside of choosing pilots and nurses for a movie about \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is that these people are simply too low on the foodchain to have any influence on the events. There are plenty of plots to be had in World War II where the screenplay is already written, but if you want to go with an average Joe story, you must come up with a plot, which the producers have indeed forgotten to do. <br /> <br />Plots are also available wherever human emotions are in play, which does not happen in this movie, either. The neat solution of the love triangle is repulsive in a Hollywood sort of way. <br /> <br />The way to a topic like this should have been a large ensemble cast, with at least three major storylines (one in Japan, preferably with likeable complex characters) and relatively unknown actors. Forget about the big-name stars and installing patriotism (\\"we will win this war because of them - volunteers give this country its strength\\" etc.)and leave the plot to history.  <br /> <br />Perhaps next time around. Two stars. <br />
1592402038|4.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss is a funny book. It makes punctuation so exciting; I can't help but completed it in one sitting - well, two actually.<br /><br />This is NOT a grammar book. As a reader [of this book], your grammar is probably already in a respectable state. \\"It's about how we got the punctuation we have today; how such a tiny but adaptable system of marks allows us to notate most (but not all) types of verbal expression; [...]. But mainly it's about making sticklers feel good about their seventh-sense ability to see dead punctuation [...] and to defend their sense of humour.\\" (P.34)<br /><br />Sounds good to you? It was for me. I was laughing out loud at times, emitting pleasurable hisses at another. Didn't know that punctuation has such a colourful history. There are also plenty of examples of what went wrong and the right way to do it.<br /><br />I too have committed some punctuation sins, but it won't be long because I've repented (and hopefully stay that way). How can one not take action after enlightenment, right?<br /><br />I'd like to quote a reviewer, BookMan from Rancho Santa Margarita, CA who rated the book 1-star and said this: \\"I just returned from a bookstore where I happened to see this piece of drivel prominently displayed. The fact that there are punctuation errors on the front cover should raise significant warning flags to those who are interested in the topic. [...]\\"<br /><br />I think BookMan had jumped into conclusion too quickly as the title serves the purpose of showing an example of bad punctuation and not an error in itself. It's creative presentation. Do check out this little story about the panda, the book's mascot, found at the back cover. It will explain the title of the book. (Notice on the front cover how the panda is erasing the comma between 'eats' and 'shoots'?)
0316172324|4.0|This is a page turner. The book consists of several exciting stories on very interesting material (fake art, police brutality, marriage counseling, etc).   The author shows a bunch of scientific trickery and experiements designed to demonstrate the power of _blink_ - split-second. <br /> <br />However, there is hardly a moral to the story, or a coherent message in the book.  The book isn't about \\"thinking\\" of any kind, and it certainly does not teach the reader how to think.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|this sounds like a solo knopfler album, a bit more sparse than usual, with emmylou harris singing. it's not necessarily bad, it's just ?convenient?. knopfler never sang this good (quitting smoking does wonders) and he even sings some difficult parts. I think he's starting to like himself as a singer (something that started with shangri-la) and that is really something. you never heard him sing this high before - just hear his backing on the bridge of ?this is us?. of course, emmylou is the better singer and has a self-assurance that matches knopfler in a charming way.  <br />this is a combination that can work, especially live (i'd really like to see those shows...) a bit on the safe side, but beautiful nonetheless. it's interesting to note that guitar heroes are getting old and don't have anything more to say. david gilmour, for instance, whose last album is decrepit. but knopfler still maintains that charm in songwriting, that a lot of us love. the 2 songs that aren't his fit very well here. i just wished emmylou harris made a stronger mark on this. <br />the lyrics show that knopfler still has the old inspiration.  <br />i have to say it again, although the album is really cool, the real test for them has to be live. i hope this collaboration doesn't end here. <br />
B000E6GBV2|4.0|I was introduced to Band of Horses when I caught an Iron & Wine show which they opened. They blew me away! Ben is so charming, so talented, a great singer live.  <br />I got a CD from the show and it stayed in rotation in my CD player, but I was thrilled to hear the more polished studio release. <br />Nice guys, great album, great band.
B000002VQQ|5.0|When it opens with a line like, \\"Jesus died for someone's sins but not for mine\\", you know you're in for something good. Sure enough, that one line launches you into a forty-five minute album filled with graphic descriptions of sex and violence. (Listen to my personal favorite, Land, if you want proof). She sings her dark verses with so much intensity, so much feeling that it makes Jim Morrison look like a raving drunk. Yes, it's that intense, people. And she somehow manages to turn a brutal tale of murder into the R&B nugget Land of a Thousand Dances, not to mention an even rawer version of Gloria, the album's signature song.<br /><br />Best tunes include Gloria, Free Money, Kimberly, Break It Up and Horses, though every song on this album is thoroughly amazing.
015603252X|5.0|A Tale of Love and Darkness is a dense, beautiful memoir about the youth of the well-known Israeli writer, Amos Oz, and of his country, Israel. By telling the stories of his parents and grandparents, Ashkenazi Jews, who fled Eastern Europe for the Holy Land when Hitler rose to power, he tells a story of the history of the Jewish people from the nineteenth century to the birth of modern-day Israel. But the story is also intensely personal, focusing on the devastating effects of his parents unhappy marriage and his mother's depression and eventual suicide on this young, sensitive and precocious artist. A remarkable book.
B000002KZ6|5.0|Like many others, I believe the Stop Making Sense concert video is the ultimate Talking Heads moment. But in terms of studio albums, Speaking in Tongues is their best.<br />1. Burning Down the House: 10/10. A classic, my favorite Talking Heads song. Ominous synth, fine lyrics, highly danceable, and nice use of African rhythm. Who can resist?<br />2. Making Flippy Floppy: 8.5/10. The Talking Heads at their best: Paranoid, danceable and synth-driven. Especially noteable are the Eastern-y synth lines in the instrumental break.<br />3. Girlfriend Is Better: 10/10. David Byrne's disjointed narrative, set to an irresistably funky bat, never gets old. \\"Stop making sense! Stop making sense!\\" is practically the group's battle cry.<br />4. Slippery People: 10/10. Another one of the album's high points, similar to the previous three songs (not like that's bad, of course) but still it's own song. And if you aren't dancing like a fool by now, I don't know who you think you are.<br />5. I Get Wild/Wild Gravity: 7/10. Good song, but never was a favorite of mine. Sort of Talking-Heads-By-Numbers.<br />6. Swamp: 10/10. A menacing, bluesy tune with great antiwar lyrics and perfect delivery.<br />7. Moon Rocks: 7.5/10. See I Get Wild/Wild Gravity.<br />8. Pull Up the Roots: 7/10. Used to love this one, but now I don't as much. Weakest songo n the album.<br />9. This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody): 8.5/10. Damn, does the title suit it well or what? Though it's a bit too naive (on purpose, I understand) to be Talking Heads, I still like it.<br />Speaking In Tongues is one of the better Talking Heads albums, though I'd also recommend Songs About Buildings and Food and Stop Making Sense. (Keep in mind that I haven't heard Fear of Music or Remain in Light)
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers since the mid-'90s when my older brother became obsessed with their cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\" for a few months.  I heard the song what seemed like thousands of times and I never got sick of it.  I ended up buying \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way\\" for myself and found both to be intricate, emotional, wonderful albums.  I like both the funky, rocking side of the Peppers and the more visceral, slinking balladeers.  When I heard the first single from their new album \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" I was instantly in love.  I watched the video for \\"Dani California\\" at least three times a day in the weeks leading up to the release of the album.  I bought the album the day it came out.  Here I am, three days later, having listened to this album all the way through 11 times.   <br /> <br />This album is incredible.  Absolutely, no-holds-barred transcendent in every sense of the word.  I can understand why so many fans of the '80s incarnation of the Peppers are angry, I guess.  I just don't agree with them.  This band has proven time and time again over the last ten years that they are much more than the rockers who recorded \\"Freakey Styley\\" almost twenty years ago.  \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" presents every side of Anthony, Flea, John and Chad that they have yet discovered.  It is playful one minute, rife with pain the next.  It is experimental.  In the grand tradition of classic double albums, it stretches the band to their limits, while never forgetting about the hook.   <br /> <br />Both the \\"Jupiter\\" first disc and the \\"Mars\\" second disc are tens on their own.  Every song has its own atmosphere--whether it is that brilliant opening single \\"Dani California\\", the funky \\"Charlie\\", the nocturnal \\"Slow Cheetah\\" or the rambunctious \\"Torture Me\\"--these songs all deliver in every way you hope they might.  The fact that the band has written 28 classics, all potential singles in my mind, while most of their contemporaries are struggling tocome up with one good single, is staggering.  I always knew that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of the last great hopes of rock 'n' roll, but \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" has proven that they are currently one of the greatest bands on the face of the earth.   <br /> <br />I was going to end this review by pointing out my favorite songs on the album, but I really don't think I can because as I look at the back of my copy...I really want to list every single name I read.  I mean, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\"?  \\"Wet Sand\\"?  \\"Tell Me Baby\\"?  \\"Readymade\\"?  \\"So Much I\\"?  \\"Turn It Again\\"?  These songs are SO GOOD.  I haven't been able to listen to anything else since Tuesday.  Every time I put in a different album, I can't help but think things like \\"I wish I was listening to Desecration Smile right now\\" and this album goes right back into the stereo.   <br /> <br />In summary, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" right NOW.  Some might say that the band is being pretentious by releasing such a long album--but I could never blame them.  I'd want everyone to hear all of these songs too...And please buy the actual album and don't download it, if not for the sound quality then for the absolutely gorgeous packaging.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers have just released an album that is in competition with Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" as the best album of this decade.  You'd be a fool to deprive yourself of such an incredible experience.
0790731509|2.0|when it was called 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.' They are basically the same story, except one is timeless with depth and nuance while the other is cheap drivel. A further juxtaposition...<br /><br />Plot: a man against the man or THE man (Nicholson) versus 'the system'.<br /><br />Protaganist: the no nonsense Nicholson or Newman's own over and under acting (he gets nothing right)<br /><br />Villians: the peerless Nurse Ratchet or the nonentity some-boob in-mirror-glasses (snoooorrrrrrrre)<br /><br />Sidekicks: Chief, the classic strong and silent type, or some bumbling blowhard Lennie wannabe<br /><br />Literary and cinematic devices: Its just too much of an embarrassment to even bring this one up; I feel so sorry for Luke's inadequacy<br /><br />And whose ever heard of the hacked novel ripoff of Keseys masterpiece? Seriously, its like a backwards 'Of Mice and Men'<br /><br />One of the most overrated movies and performances (Newman) in cinematic history. An absolute ridiculous movie with only two valid points: \\"I never planned anything in my life\\" and \\"Quit feedin' off me.\\" Everything else was blotched literary theft and visually nauseous.
B000002LKF|5.0|Words can't describe how much I love this album!  Paul Simon's amazing ability as lyricist shines on 1990's Rhythm of the Saints, a beautifully crafted journey of sound.  For me the songs evolve, opening like a flower, meant to be heard one after another -- almost like a rock-opera that tells a story.  Most of the album is perfectly dance-able.  Many times I have lit candles, donned something flowing, and danced with a girlfriend around my room to this lovely, soul-lifting music.  I am grateful to Paul Simon, for his music has soothed me when my spirit was low and helped me \\"dominate the impossible in my life.\\"  All of his music is this way for me, but none so much as Rhythm of the Saints.  Like medicine for the soul...it's THAT good.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have anticipated the new album for five years now and after having read the reviews posted on here I wasn't sure if I wanted to hear the new Tool album. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and confounded as to why people don't find this album as good as the other ones. Packed full of classic Tool riffs, every song creeps along in its murky depths while Maynard croons in his anguished, but melodic vocals like some kind of prophetic seer come to warn us of an impending apocalypse. Every song on here is incredible. In a music industry full of bands that have nothing to offer except for mediocrity and cheap meaningless lyrics that reflect the current degenerate mental state of our increasingly commercialised and commodified society, passionate, agonizing, and nonsycophantic music such as \\"10K Days\\" is not only welcome, it is needed.
B00000294R|5.0|First of all I'd like to send a posthumous apology to Big L, like a lot of people I didn't really check this album out until after he'd been killed, and what a talent that was lost.  If you have even a slight interest in hiphop and you don't own this album, just follow all the advice on this page and pick it up now.  I see a lot of reviews on here claiming Big L to be the G.O.A.T and there is real evidence of that on this album, though sadly this was his only release while he was alive.  L is basically the king of punchlines and there are so many quoteable lines on the album, my personal favourite is,<br /><br /> \\"A tech nine is my utensil<br /><br />Fillin' niggas with so much led they can use they d**k for a pencil\\",<br /><br />thats taken from Da Graveyard and there are so many others I could mention on the album.<br /><br />The production on this album is typical mid 90's East Coast beats, and for the most part it's not bad, though it's never as strong as L himself.  Some people have been critical of the beats and it's true that a few of the songs sound similar beatwise, however there are some nice beats particularly on Put It On, Street Struck, M.V.P and Fed Up With The Bullsh*t.  If your into that mid 90's sound you'll probably like the production, but as I said what really stands up throughout is Big L.  I always think that the mark of a true great mc is that they can make an ordinary beat sound good with tight rhymes and flow and L has this ability, along with the likes of Nas, Tupac & Biggie.<br /><br />Every track on here is superb, my favourites are Put It On, No Endz No Skinz, Street Struck & I Don't Understand It, where L attacks all wack emcees.  A classic album that's been slept on by most people for way too long, when I picked this up I couldn't believe how good L was like I said if you have any interest in hiphop, buy this now.  If he had only put out more albums he could have been a serious contender for G.O.A.T.<br /><br />R.I.P Big L

B000E6GBV2|5.0|Horses does indeed sound like quite a few other bands, and really are un-orginal. <br />HOWEVER <br />There songs sound great, and put an ear to ear smile on my face. And honestly thats all I, and most other people, care about. This is one of a few albums that i can listen to start to finish and enjoy it all. I could care less about how much they sound like other artists.
0393327655|2.0|I suspect that nothing I say in this review will dissuade prospective readers from buying Sam Harris's popular attack on religion and its adherents.  The current atmosphere of sectarian violence, school curriculum debates, limitations on biomedical research, and other affronts to sensibility that are attributable to religious faith makes this too tempting a target not to exploit.      My concern is not that someone has asked the hard questions about religion.  Why do we believe what we do?  What do we really know about spirituality?  What is the basis of faith?  How do faith and facts interact?  Is there any reason to believe in a personal God?  Harris's challenge to those of faith is legitimate and timely.  It is not, however, original, nor is his critique particularly well thought out or carefully developed.    My concern is that Harris has compounded the problem of bad theology with bad history, bad politics, bad science (actually no science), and mediocre philosophy.  What is advertised as a thoughtful critique of modern faith and exploration of the science of knowledge and belief is remarkably short on both.  Instead, Harris focuses on a narrow range of conservative belief as representative of the whole of religious faith and attacks it with articulate vehemence.      Harris repeatedly asserts that neuroscience holds the answer to life's great questions, particular regarding what we know and why we believe what we do.  I was terribly disappointed that he did not explore this neuroscience at all.  Nor was there a discussion of pertinent studies in cognitive psychology or related fields, not even one reference to a scientific study or review article in his extensive footnotes, most of which were narrative, rather than referential.  I was interested in this work, anxious to delve further into it, but I was left with no leads to pursue and no hint of what the science actually shows or how far it has developed.  This was a marked contrast to more thoughtful works, such as Eric R. Kandel's In Search of Memory.    His exploration of the basis of interpersonal and institutional violence was similarly superficial and often simply wrong.  This was unfortunate and avoidable, since there is a large body of sociological and psychological studies, and a smaller body of neuroscience on the topic.  Even the historical evidence is at variance with his hypothesis.    I suspect that the popularity of Harris's book is based on the quality of writing and stridor with which other people's beliefs are dismissed as irrational and, frankly, stupid.  In debates as heated as those about religion sometimes get (along with those on politics, health practices, financial issues and others), there is a primal appeal to this sort of writing.      For readers looking, however, for a reasoned critique of faith, a review of the neuroscience of consciousness, or insight into the origins of violence, better can be had elsewhere.  There is a lot less here than meets the eye.

0553801503|5.0|Many reviewers here seem to be in agreement that the fourth book in Martin's series is a shark-jumping, tedious, overblown, unedited bore. The near-consensus seems to be that nothing much happens in the book, and that it takes an awful lot of pages for nothing to happen. Several Amazon reviewers have commented that two-thirds of the chapters could be removed with \\"no impact\\" to the story.    Horse-pucky.     It's tempting, in the first volley of my response to these assertions, to point out that these reviewers haven't yet SEEN half the story, so it's a bit presumptive of them to pronounce threads of the story extraneous. However, I will set that obvious reply aside for the moment, for I realize it smacks of the sort of unthinking fandom response that I kept hitting when I complained about the last three Star Wars films.     Instead, I would like to point out that what we're seeing here should be familiar territory for anyone who enjoys epics. Epics always start out tightly -- with the forming of a fellowship, or all of the Stark kids together, or a kingdom intact, for instance. They then, rather rapidly, fray out into a zillion little threads as people get lost, split up, encounter new characters, get sidetracked by apparent irrelevancies and so forth (recall the splitting up of the fellowship of the ring, the splitting up of the Stark children, and knights getting lost in Orlando Furioso). But then all of these apparently wild, untamed threads ultimately converge in the final act into a single plot again.     It's a story pattern, like boy-meets-girl.     Thus, the toughest part of an epic is always the middle. And most epics aren't as long as Song of Ice and Fire. (Not even the Faerie Queene, though, granted, Spenser died before completing that one. Hang in there, Mr. Martin.) We see this in everything from the Italian romance Orlando Furioso, to Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, to Lord of the Rings, to Shakespeare's Hamlet (which opens with a clear revenge motive, slows down while the king and Hamlet play mind games and move their chess pieces, wanders a bit with apparent irrelevencies, and then resolves itself).      In most such epics, it's easy to get lost, because it's not always easy to tell where things are going, or whether they're going anywhere. Oddly enough, I ENJOYED A Feast for Crows because I'm not too sophisticated, and I liked the fact that I could almost immediately see where things were going -- I could see ways in which these apparently irrelevant threads might converge later. Apparently I and these other reviewers read different novels!    I had, in fact, logged on to read the Amazon reviews, convinced that the literati would rip it to shreds for being too obvious in its deployment of subplots. After all, Martin isn't exactly hiding the fact that many of the storylines (the iron men, Sam, the kingdom of Dorne, even Cersei's retainers, and possibly Arya) are going to be converging fairly soon with the dragon queen plot. We're still in some suspense about what is going to happen when all of these storylines meet up, but it's pretty clear where they're headed. This argument that half of the book is dead weight seems to be missing where half of the book is going. I have similar problems with the argument that nothing happens -- a great deal happens. Something significant happens in virtually every chapter, which is a pretty good pace, actually. They don't happen to Jon, Tyrion, and other beloved characters who don't appear in this novel, but they happen nonetheless.    I think readers are simply attached to characters who were introduced earlier, and are grumbling because they didn't get to find out what is happening to them -- and, disappointed by this deprivation, they have no patience for new, equally interesting characters. (Yes, I think the new characters are equally interesting.)     I'm not an uncritical reader, of course. I would, for instance, have liked to see some sort of summary of previous events atthe beginning of the novel -- after five years, I couldn't remember enough of the previous plotlines to fully enjoy this novel without doing some homework. And, though I enjoy cliffhangers, having three in near-rapid succession felt a little like the end of a \\"24\\" episode, which, granted, is a fine little guilty-pleasure show in its own right, but frankly, is amateur hour compared to Martin's work. So in this case, it was fleetingly irksome.     Not irksome enough for me to drop the rating below the 5 threshold, though; this is still an exquisite series. And I say that not out of knee-jerk fandom. I'm a huge fan of Tim Powers and Neal Stephenson, but I think the former has become a bit too complicated for his own good in recent novels, and the latter DOES sometimes need an editor. If someone were to accuse my idol Stephenson of having irrelevant chapters, I'd have to grudglingly agree with them.     But Martin? Not yet. Not even close.
B000002KIK|5.0|It's astonishing how people have discredited this album or treated it like a piece of Rock N Roll/Black Sabbath history that should be forgotten.  <br /> <br />The gem that is Never Say Die! to me, has one of the most well rounded collection of songs to be found on a Black Sabbath disc. Ok, perhaps i could attribute that to the over-playing of Sabbath's earlier material, but there is little (if any) filler on this album. I urge you to take a listen to it with an open mind. Songs like \\"Shock Wave\\", \\"Never Say Die\\" and \\"Air Dance\\" just bewilder the listener from start to finish. Considering Black Sabbath material up to this point, the songs on this album are written with such skill that each segment ties in so well together. Where I can say the old Sabbath material lacked in good transition from one moment to the next in a lot of songs, Never Say Die clearly made up for that.  <br /> <br />1 -- \\"Never Say Die\\" just breaks out in one of Ozzy's most compelling moments as he urges you to never say die. You knew this was their last effort together when you hear this song, and it comes out as such. As one last jam together so all that pent-up frustration, overwhelming sense of breaking up and the emotions the band was experiencing at the time come through full throttle. And that's what i love about this album (and title track in particular). <br /> <br />2 -- \\"Johnny Blade\\" starts with a weird synth, I'm actually a fan of these 70's synthesizers, so Johnny Blade starts off really well in my opinion. I think Bill Ward really carries this song and Geezer backs him up so well in this task, the song gets inside your head and demands it to bang. The infamous cold and bone-chilling Ozzy vocals deliver in the way you would expect. Take listen, it may not be the sound that made Black Sabbath a household name, but it rocks as a well written and hook-laden track. I can't remember when Sabbath ever consistently had this much synergy on an album. <br /> <br />3 -- \\"Junior's Eyes\\" carries on where Johnny Blade left off. You can't help but bob your head to the rhythm section while Iommi just wails whimsically on the guitar when the song starts. From there it progresses into a standard mid-paced song. I wouldn't call it filler at all. In fact, it brings you right along through the disc with a narrative a lot of head-bangers could identify with. Bill Ward reminds me a bit of Bonham in parts of this song, and it's just well done by all members of the band, it ends pretty damn well too. Good enough for an 8.5 out of 10 I'd have to say.  <br /> <br />4 -- \\"A Hard Road\\" keeps up in pace with where the album is going. Not one of my favorites because Ozzy's moaning and groaning is a little drawn out. Perhaps the closest thing i would consider filler on the disc, but eh... it has moments its own, such as a nice part in the middle with weird vocals which leads up to a pretty descent Iommi solo. That's character of a standout album, when a song you don't particularly like does it for you in certain parts. It's really Iommi who delivers the goods here, a nod could be given to Bill Ward too. The song surprisingly ends quite well with some weird but effective singing from Ozzy with other vocals: backing + overlapping elements (discounting the fade-out ending, no one respects those *shrug*).  <br /> <br />5 -- \\"Shock Wave\\" picks the glitz right back up. Its another one of the stellar moments on this album. And perhaps thus far, i can see why fans of Sabbath wouldn't be very impressed. The doom and gloom is basically non-existant here at 5 songs in. Yet these songs still rock, so what's going on? ------------ It's just a different facet of Black Sabbath, and this is perhaps the seminal song showcasing that fact. This is one you just need to hear for yourself, it really delivers excellent musicianship from start to finish.  <br />**(Could have done without the Doowop \\"woo woo\\" backing vocals 4:30 in because this part of the song is one of the only throwback to Sab's doomy guitar sound on the album! 9.5 of 10 for that.) <br /> <br />6 -- \\"Air Dance\\" moves along in the same damn fashion as Shock Wave in that it highlights the album, but just in an even lighter way. The guitar sound reminds a bit of the \\"wah-wah\\" sound in Sab's \\"A National Acrobat\\", so that is very much welcomed in my book. The keyboard/piano playing in this song is simply mesmerizing. Sounds like a rainy night or imagining a quiet ice crystal landscape. It has that ethereal quality and surpisingly fits into the song seemlessly. I love this tune. It's another fine moment in the band's career... peaceful, and that kind of sound that could evoke tears of happiness. Not typical of them, but done really well. It breaks up with a harder, more typical Sab guitar sound and finishes nicely with a 70s-era key-laden segment thats up-tempo a bit.  <br /> <br />7 -- \\"Over To You\\" sounds slower than most of the songs on the disc, it reminds a little bit of the sludgey Sab guiatr sound but quickly introduces those etherial keys and gets complimented by light-mood rhythm from Geezer and Ward. Another decent song like \\"A Hard Road\\". You can't help but appreciate this song either if you're a fan of this lighter Sabbath sound. <br /> <br />8. -- \\"Breakout\\", to me, really ties up the loose ends of the Sabbath-Ozzy era and sends it out with a celebratory \\"bang\\". You get a track that reminices of \\"Earth\\" and moments on the first Sabbath album, but instead of a harmonica you get a saxophone. This is a nice progressive-rock instrumental. If you know of bands like Ulver Or even Pink Floyd (the album Wish You Were Here) then you kind of get an idea what direction this song takes. From there it ties right into... <br /> <br />9 -- \\"Swinging The Chain\\", the final song of the album. Sung by some butthead i presume, who is likely to be Bill Ward (sorry, Butt err Bill Ward), but who knows? It's definately a tribute to the break-up with Ozzy with such lines like \\"we're soo sorry, sorry thatit happened this way\\" and other instruments involved sound like a harmonica. So again, you get that reminiscence of the band Earth and Sabbath's early beginnings. I would have liked this a lot better with Ozzy but then I guess it wouldn't be \\"right\\" saying i'm sorry.  <br /> <br />And that sums it up, an era is over. It's tear jerking, because both Ozzy and Sabbath did poorly as far as I'm concerned when they parted. It's a celebratory disc though, in my opinion. I believe Ozzy had already split from the band but then was called back to sing on this one, if i remember the story right. I think they ended things properly. It was well put forth effort and I appreciate it for everything that it is. I rank it highly right with Paranoid, Vol.4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Spielberg's MUNICH is a brilliantly made movie, with superb direction, cinematography, acting and music...but it is not a pleasant movie to watch.  Inspired in part by true events that occurred after the tragic terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich olympics, the movie offers the difficult question of just when does revenge become simply murder?  As in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg has some deeply disturbing and realistic scenes that are uncomfortable to watch in the sanctity of your home.  But the film is powerful indeed.  Eric Bana is marvelous in the role of Avner, giving us an honest portrait of a man who questions his ethics; Geoffrey Rush is great as his deceptive boss; and the underappreciated Ciaran Hinds glows in his role as the team's \\"worrier.\\"  Surprisingly, future James Bond Daniel Craig's role is the least developed, but he does an okay job. John Williams does one of his best scores, and the movie is certainly a cinematic achievement, if not totally an entertaining one.
B000002KHH|5.0|hmm, think about it. it's probably the most notable sabbath album; it contains their most noteworthy and acclaimed songs.  <br /> <br />The real deal is truley on this disc though. Even if you're an old fan and find this album terribly boring now (Iron Man / Paranoid maybe even Warpigs). Really go back and listen to the latter half of the disc after a few years of having the old cd/tape/lp shelved and tell me Master of Reality topped this with After Forever or Sweatleaf... or Self/titled did with The Wizard or N.I.B. Ok that's like compairing apples with oranges because the songs Children of the grave, Into the void and Black Sabbath all rocked! But you could easily compaire those with War Pigs, Iron man and even Paranoid and you still get Hand of Doom and Electric Funeral. I'm glad that's settled--though you could argue, why? I'm actually right. <br /> <br />Now, if you're new to the album, the whole thing is a classic metal godsend. If not, you know you can count on songs like Electric Funeral and Hand of Doom as I mentioned before. In fact, Hand of Doom is one of my favorite sabbath songs of all time. It reminds me of parts of \\"Thrill of it All\\" on Sabotage, poignant in a way where Ozzy and the band just come together and make you feel the weight of the words and axe-work going on.  <br /> <br />As a matter of fact a lot of this disc comes off as such but mostly \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Hand of Doom\\". Electric Funeral delivers the doom and gloom too, it picks up right where the song \\"Black Sabbath\\" leaves off really.  <br /> <br />Basically you can't go wrong with this disc. If you don't know, Iron Man is a sick psycho-blahblah-thriller. And planet caravan delivers that dreamy, rainy night traveling quality. Kind of lonely but peacefully carrying on (maybe a heavy-metal truck driver favorite? *Laughs*).  <br /> <br />Faeries wear boots basically sends the album off in a decent way, kind of lack luster compaired to rest of the album when i think about it. Maybe a foreshadowing of what was to come for the first half of Master of Reality (which thankfully came together towards the middle and finished strong in the end).  <br /> <br />That's what i have to say for it, but you be the judge. No doubt this tops their early collection as the most well rounded album. But then again all Ozzy-era Sabbath albums are essential in my opinion, and I do mean all right up to Never Say Die. Forgive me all you snobs and critics, i care not what you think.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|The initially frightening thing about this movie is when the teacher, previously stabbed in the leg by an unruly pupil, gets a knife out and throws it into a kids head once they are on 'Battle Royale' island.  The room goes quiet, it's not a game, although a perky lady on the TV guiding them through the rules prompts them in a manner rather like a street fighter manual.<br />The kids lose their lip, its real.<br />They have to fight to the last man standing, only ONE out of the whole class of over 40 souls will be allowed to live.<br />The kids, whether they be good, bad or ugly have one choice, kill, or be killed.<br />They are sent out with backpacks into the vastness of an island, they are warned that every four hours a different part of the island will be a hot spot, bombs etc will be dropped, this is to avoid the kids all holing up, to keep them moving and exposed.<br />As a further kick to the children, every morning and evening their teacher reads to them over the loudspeaker the names of all the children who have been killed during that time frame, each kid is wearing a heart monitor around their necks which cannot be removed so their last hours and movements can be tracked.<br />The ultimate kick comes from a few of the children and the way they took to killing.  Ducks to water.  They were each supplied with weapons in their backpacks, some got guns, some got knives and some got pans!<br />A few comic elements of the darkest variety and well sketched 'kill' scenes made this a very memorable movie.  It's quite long by todays standards but I wasn't left feeling it was TOO long.  It was action packed, sometimes heart breaking and sometimes darkly funny.<br />Great movie.<br />FIGHT!
B000002KET|4.0|2 -- \\"A National Acrobat\\" what amazes me about this song is how it seems to melt and ooze over you yet careen, rock, glide, chug and pull through.  This is clearly evident when you hear A National Acrobat. It's singularly the quintessential Black Sabbath acid-tab dropping favorite of mine. It says so much, and has such a timeless, deep and dark (secret) quality to it. Though, for a moment, it does break into a happy hip-swaying swagger... I think this was meant to give you the ride through Heaven and Hell like the concept/artwork has encapsulated for you. This song takes on many moods, i have to label it as the standout cut next to \\"who are you\\" and \\"fluff\\".     1 -- \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" keeping in the iconic Sab Sound, is kind of, dare i say over-worked? It's by all means an instant Sabbath classic, but i think it attempts to do what early Sabbath did without such the same impact. In all honesty i feel it was meant to help fans of albums 1-4 make the leap toward this album, and a lot never did whence the song ended.     3 -- \\"Fluff\\" is the most essential acoustic/instrumental Sabbath song of the 70s era. It's pure magic, melancholy, and more. It's Fluff for crying out loud! It'll possibly bring you to tears in the middle of an acid trip, so be careful. This is a very personal album that, fortunately for us, was made public and therefore, unfortunately, has its moment of filler.    4 -- \\"Sabra Cadabra\\", which picks up the pace in swinging carefree move-on-through-with-your-hip-first vibe. It's cool, i like the breakdown of it more in the middle though. Reminds me of parts in Technical Ecstacy before getting back to a swinging groove but this time in a little better way. You can hear the sweat of Sabbath coming through on this song so i give them much credit for it, though it's not what you'd typically call a Sabbath song. It works well enough for me, but there are better gems on this album.    5 -- \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" starts in much of that same middle of the road vibe, not dark, not too happy... but quickly it takes a dark turn. Now this song, i think, is more of an atavism to that Old Sabbath sound. Whats nice about it though is that it also has an airy/echoey/mystic vibe that Led Zeppelin later embraced, however, done in a very doomy Sabbath way (evident in the chorus). Ozzy's vocals are great and Iommi features with a wonderful solo. The song crescendos up to a speedy, kind of groovin but very hard rocking finish. An all in all great Sabbath song.     6 -- \\"Who Are You\\" marks an groundbreaking moment for Sabbath. It's dark like their early work but Iommi is not responsible. If you're like me you'll still appreciate this track for all its \\"bells and whistles\\". At the heart of this song is a very creepy, mind-bendingly trippy Sabbath song. It's meant to be overly \\"other-wordly\\" and i think it executes the mood perfectly. It's quite a ride, and it belongs with the best of any Sabbath work.    7 -- \\"Looking For Today\\" chugs its way into the mix, and though i like the way it begins, it takes too much of a St. Vitus vibe to it. The hand-clap is annoying and even one part makes me laugh because Ozzy has to sympathize with the listener in the song's message but he sounds a bit purposefully whiney and condescending to me. Makes me laugh, but he does pull it together and tries to genuinely deliver the message when he says \\"when was the last time you cried?\\".    8 -- \\"Spiral Architect\\", Finally. Aside National Acrobat, easily the most grown up and ostensibly wisdom-filled song. It's supposed to be poetic, maybe it's a little pretentious but it has the sound. The warm evoking vibe that does indeed sound graduated. So maybe where national acrobat excells in everyway as the albums best song this song probably wraps up the disc in much of the same way. It starts with a lovely acoustic piece, that could have set the groundwork for an even better song, but it still went in a direction not entirely bad itself. It's chock full ofgood feelings and peaceful tidings. Iommi axe-work ties it together with the orchestration. At times it has been a favorite of mine, but it depends on the mood. Probably not for the narrow minded Sabbath fans on any day.     Kind of weird review for me, because i felt the album deserved to be listened to while reviewed. Take \\"A National Acrobat\\", \\"Fluff\\", \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\", \\"Who are You\\", and \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\"... and you have an awesome head-smashing, hardcore sabbath EP. Throw in \\"Spiral Architect\\" for good measure, and then you pepper it with \\"Sabra Cadabra\\" and \\"Looking For Today\\" for time, packaging, and the balance of \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and you have an essential Sabbath release. ------ More cohesive than Volume 4 and maybe less polished than Sabotage, this is right where it belongs, as a great progressive concept piece. You need it because you won't hear songs like this anywhere, i really believe that. And most of I all i think its absolutely necessary to experience it. The songs just have a quality about them that you know the average listener just hasn't been exposed to. It's that dark mystique about it that makes it sacred in your collection.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam had been fading fast ever since the \\"Yield\\" album.  I remember the 1st Pearl Jam song I EVER disliked came from \\"Binaural\\", and with \\"Riot Act\\", I disliked nearly half the album.  I didn't know what to expect with the self-titled \\"Pearl Jam\\" album, but I was hoping for some sort of a miracle comeback.  Jackpot!  That's exactly what I (we) got.<br /><br />When I first heard the single \\"World Wide Suicide\\", I was skeptical.  Pearl Jam has never been the best at selecting the first single to an album (\\"Who You Are\\", \\"Nothing as it Seems\\"), so I held out some hope.  WWS was a decent song, but no great shakes.  I purchased the album, and upon listening, I was glad my first impression was incorrect.  The album is an absolute masterpiece, from beginning to end.  It's undoubtedly Pearl Jam's finest work since \\"Vs.\\".<br /><br />Stand out songs on the album are, \\"Unemployable\\", \\"Gone\\", and the epic 7+ min masterpiece \\"Inside Job\\", which is unlike anything Pearl Jam has ever done.  It has a cosmic, almost trippy feel to it, and is damn near flawless.  Another song on the album which is unlike PJ has ever done is \\"Parachutes\\", which sounds like a Beatles song.  It's a hit or miss song, which I just so happen to love.<br /><br />Eddie lyrics are as brilliant as ever, and I really came to appreciate \\"World Wide Suicide\\" after I learned the lyrics to the song.  Puts the entire thing in a new light when you're reading the words along with the song.<br /><br />All in all, terrific album, and certainly the best work Pearl Jam has done since the early to mid 1990's.  While this album might not yield many radio hits, it's muscial brilliance in almost every regard.  Pearl Jam has totally redeemed themselves, and I'm looking forward to future material.
0920668372|5.0|I just heard this book for the first time today at storytime with my son.  I was so touched by the song the mother sang to her son and the sweet story that it \\"almost\\" made me cry.  I say \\"almost\\" because as the tears was dwelling up in my eyes, I had to pull myself together so I wouldn't look like a big goofball.  After the story was over I looked around and saw several mothers crying.  I loved the book so much I bought it!
B0002EXH54|5.0|Ah thrash metal in 1986! What a terrific year for the genre! First we had Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\". Then we had Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\". And now we have Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\"!<br /><br />This was Megadeth's breakthrough album and their best one along with \\"Rust in Peace\\". Dave Mustain and Marty Friedman are an awesome team of guitarists! Only a complete idiot would give this one star (*cough* \\"I Love Fall Out Boy\\" *cough*). Every song here is awesome but the title track really stands out. It may be my favorite Megadeth song ever! I mean every metalhead should like this song! This is almost as good as Metallica and Slayer! Luckily just like Slayer and unlike Metallica, Megadeth are still doing really awesome today! However if you're looking for some classic thrash metal in thrash's golden year(1986) then buy this album immediately!
B000002GVO|5.0|This album was absolutely huge in 1976 and 1977 and still is today. Hotel California;according to Eagles drummer/vocalist Don Henley was a concept album about the dark side and dangers of the life style of money,sex,and drugs that singers and actors were living in Los Angeles/Hollywood at that time. Many of the songs on this album center around this theme;especially,Life In The Fast Lane,Hotel California,The Last Resort,and Victim Of Love. The addition of Joe Walsh replacing Bernie Leadon was a big improvement for the Eagles. Joe gave them a harder edged sound on this album, and The Long Run which followed in 1979. This was also the last album for bassist Randy Meisner as an Eagles member,before he went solo a year later.Most of the songs on this album have become rock classics and are still played on a regular basis on radio today. The music is a good mix of rockers and mellow songs. Definately,one of the biggest album released in the 1970's.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Not the Pearl Jam of the 90's this CD SUCKS bad, there are no good songs on it..highly disappointed
B000EULJLU|4.0|TOOL is a band that has a huge following and they are a loyal lot. I like TOOL for their atmospheric music and their interesting look at life. The lyrics are very though provoking, but in the end don't mean that much. This band has certainly developed it's own niche in the rock world. It's vision and sonically correct tunes are a worth while listen. However, they are not a drive your car to music style of band. What I mean by that is they are a well thought out story telling band. They are not a kick ass metal outfit with hooks and grooves a plenty. You need to sit in your living room to listen to this stuff to get the most out of it. It does not suite the party atmosphere like most metal head banging stuff does. It's mood music and nothing more. Lots of quite stuff that just kind of rolls along for endless periods of time it seems. Again, TOOL does not lend itself to fist pumping hell raising metal.<br /><br />This cd starts out rather well with well crafted tunes and then gets gentler as it gets further into it. The mix is excellent as all instruments are well defined and the lyrics are indeed thought provoking, but again it's just a cd people not the meaning of life.<br /><br />Overall it's a good offering and well worth the price. I just wish they'd add a little more umph from time to time as those slow passages take forever to get through at times.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|With a band of such reputation it is hard to say that anything they have done or will do is mediocore simply because of the staying power they have shown thus far. Enter Stadium Arcadium to blow the doors open and slap you on the face with pop funk and lucid ballads.<br /><br />Very much in Chili Pepper style they have come with thier best in hand as an offering to loyal fans.  Every track catches you the first time through with such songs as 'Danni California' and 'Ready Made' getting you ready to jump through the wall and other songs like 'Hard to Concentrate' (my personal favorite) and 'Slow Cheetah' making you realize just how wonderful and tragic front man Anthony Kedis' life has been.<br /><br />If you have been or were ever a RHCP fan this cd is right up your alley bringing what they do best in the form of a double disk cd.<br /><br />Anyone just catching on to one of the hottest bands in the last 10 years should find this just as enjoyable.<br /><br />There is something here for everyone, be it the hardcore Blood Sugar Sex Magik fans, or the softer By the Way listners.<br /><br />An enjoyable cd worth every cent paid and then some.  You'll come away with a diffrent point of view.  This is one of those rare cds that will change the way you think if you listen to the lyrics.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1594200106|3.0|Daniel Sempere is a young boy who inherits his father's fascination for books. Being a teenager, he comes across a book, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", that cautivates him. He tries to find other works from the author, Julian Carax, and that task becomes impossible. No books can be found. He then starts to investigate about this man and the mistery of the dissapearance of his books. But he finds out that his own life and Julian's have very much common.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album has to be one of my favorites of the Peppers. Each song has its own unique feel, style, and beat. Needless to say, I liked every song on this album, which isn't the case with many other CD's I've bought. I also feel that every member of the band has really stepped up in their talents, especially Anthony's singing, not to mention John's amazing guitar solos. <br /> <br />One of the best things about this album is that they've, contrary to what some believe, have really brought back the funk that they had during BSSM, though that's not to say that By the Way or Californication fans won't like this album. Top hits (though I enjoyed all of them) include: Turn It Again, Readymade, Hey, Wet Sand, Animal Bar, and Desecration Smile.
B00026W82U|4.0|I heard bits from this album on a quicky review after 'Fresh Air' on NPR.  I bought it, gave a quick listen and put it to the side.  I find myself repeatedly throwing some of these songs in many months later and really enjoying them.  Their subtleties in the designs of the songs gives me a little of the goosebumps on the back of my neck.  Little strummy sounds hear and there, put in on purpose, damping cuts on the strumming at particular choosen spots...it's very interesting!  The quality of the recording is delicious too!  They're a different styles of recording through the album, I think 'feel' three...the most obviously different style is the first cut, sounds like completely different equipment.  OKay, enough of the technical, what about the music?  Acoustic, driven, subtle 5th harmonies, cool lyrics, cello here and there, many rythms driven by the strumming sound which I really like, just listen to it!
0312335164|1.0|You forgot them! <br /> <br />I met you when you were studying here in Seville. You have forgotten a lot of things you show here. For example.Don't you remember what we did after mass? We went home to change our black clothes for bullfighter clothes, the men, and for flamenco clothes, the women. Went to have canas (beer) and tapas. Siesta afterwards, and to the bullfigth arena, where every man had to face at least one bull. And the most thrilling wasn't to finish in the smelling hospital, but missing the wines and fiesta after the bulls. <br /> <br />Seriously now. The problem is not the lack of research. You can find a lot of them in lots of Hollywood blockbusters (do you remember the beginning of MiII in Seville, by the way?) The major problem is the lack of respect for other countries. <br /> <br />- Guardia Civil is a rural police force. They don't do their labour in a city, only in villages. <br />- Prostitution is not illegal in Spain. <br />- Public hospitals are no name 'Clinica...'. <br />- Public Health Service in Spain is on of the bests in Europe (why people with private insurance go to public health service when they need surgery? why people from other European countries simulate illness of injures in Spain to be treated here insted of in their own countries?) <br />- Spain's currency is EURO as part or European Union. <br />- Christopher Columbus is not a saint, althought is believed (not for sure) to be buried in Seville's Cathedral (Winston Churchill is buried in Westminster Abbey, London. Is he a saint for the Britons?) <br />- Spain is not the most Catholic country in Europe. Ireland is, and I can assure you the don't even act to go to mass as you say. <br />- What do you have to say about the country with the record in organ transplants?. Somebody with shot in a lung would get another lung in hours. How many time do you need to get a new lung in the States? (Providing you have money) <br />- All the historical and geographical data are false. Forexample, Giralda was a moorish tower, part of an ancient mosque, rebuilt in the 15th century, to become belltower of the brand new Cathedral, which wasn't built in the 11th century. The city council isn't loated in Plaza de Espa?a, but the Government Delegation is. <br /> <br />I don't remember much more fakes, but in any case, it is siesta time, and you know, nobody works in Spain after 3pm. <br /> <br />For all citizens in the States, you are welcome to our beautiful country, where you'll only find frieds, even Mr Brown. Of course, like in any other country in the world, you'll find pickpockets

0553801503|3.0|The most inventive, intriguing, literate, and engrossing adult fantasy to be written in thirty years, has, unfortunately, hit a rather large road bump with this, the fourth volume. As I don't follow Martin's web site I was not aware that this volume only presents half of the main characters of the first three, leaving out some of the most interesting and loved ones, their portion of this time period relegated to the fifth volume, whenever it will be published. This alone is not that much of a problem; Martin's tapestry is so large that there is plenty of story to be told even within the remaining subset.<br /><br />The real trouble is, he doesn't tell that story for the first five hundred pages! Instead, we are treated to seemingly endless descriptions of heraldry; new viewpoint characters whose stories are definitely peripheral to the original story arc - and this is in a story that already has so many characters that it takes sixty pages of appendix just to list them, definitely posing problems for the poor reader trying to keep track of them all; and way too much scheming and talking rather than action. Very possibly a good half of this work could have been cut without losing any of the important story details, and the net result would have been a much stronger work, better paced, where anticipation of impending action could have been sustained until things actually start to happen, which is about the last one hundred pages of this.<br /><br />That last hundred pages do a fair amount to redeem this volume, where things finally coalesce into definite story lines, and the complex interweave of characters, each with their own desires and schemes to get what they want, which was the overriding trait of the first three volumes, becomes evident again. Jamie at least starts to become an interesting person; Cersie, the person everyone loves to hate, looks like she may have boxed herself into a corner; Sansa, it appears, will be forced out of her safe cocoon and back into being a player in the game of thrones; Arya has, perhaps, the most interesting change in life style and circumstances.<br /><br />If the fifth volume can maintain the pace and interesting events of the last one hundred pages of this work, the full story will be back on track as one of the best fantasies, ever. However, if it too gets bogged down in too much unnecessary detail and non-happenings, I think it will spell the end to this series, and volume six won't be purchased by me at least.<br /><br />Edited 06/12/2011:<br /><br />I just concluded re-reading all four volumes back-to-back. Doing so keeps everything (and everybody) fresh in your mind, and it helped considerably with this volume. Much more of the details seem to have relevance; and at the same time, having seen the long lists of lords and heraldic devices in the prior volumes, made it easier to just skim this material here. I still believe that much of verbiage of this book could have been safely eliminated, and I hope he has made this type of adjustment in the final book, which is finally going to be published on July 12 - a much longer wait than I ever thought would happen. But given my current re-read experience, I'd up my rating a half-star for this volume.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)r in the game of thrones; Arya has, perhaps, the most interesting change in life style and circumstances.

B0009K7QZ8|1.0|I dont want to see these yuppie kids on this ignorant TV show. This is crap. How can you stand to watch this garbage?
B000EOTAM6|5.0|<br />From the start I didnt have high expectations from this DVD. I never saw the series, and read all the horrible reviews the movie got when it came out. But I rented it anyway, because I like scifi, even BAD scifi. <br /> <br />From the opening scenes Im starting to pick cynically at it : why would these people live on this little \\"island\\" surrounded by a huge wall and not want out? What happens when the population gets too big? Etc. etc... Im just waiting for the movie to fall flat on its face because of all the plot holes. But then it started sucking me in, and Im wondering what the flashbacks are about, and the other oddities, and Im thinking ok, this is going to be a case of the \\"huge letdown\\" when the plot is finally revealed. <br /> <br />But it wasnt. <br /> <br />Then I realised that all the bad reviews were just that - BAD reviews.  <br /> <br />This is a good, and suprisingly thought provoking movie. :-)
B00005MAM2|5.0|In most anime, as many fans know, anime has violence, gore and inappropriate images that factor into the film or series, of course, that is why many people like anime. That being said, this movie takes extreme dives off that concept.     For example, from the start of the movie, a biker gang lead by Kaneda, a boy of about seventeen are shooting at each other and trying to ram other bikers into the sides of a highway road. And then there's the abuses the girlfriends of the boys face when the other biker gangs seek revenge. Then the loyalty of the gang kicks in to protect their fellow member's girlfriends.     But the loyalty doesn't last. Kaneda's best friend, Tetsuo is tested on by scientists after being captured by the police for a shoot out. Then Tetsuo is dragged into a series of experiments that melt together his bizzare dreams and reality. And the other patients of the experiments try to kill Tetsuo, only letting loose the worst inside Tetsuo, the jealousy of the strengths of his best friend, Kaneda. Tetsuo acquires a deadly power to blast beams from his hands and body to blow up the whole city, and what's worse, is Tetsuo seeks to strike not only the whole city, but namely, Kaneda.    Akira is one of the first anime films to be released, and master director, Katsuhiro Otomo, who is right at the top with Miyazaki, spins a master tale of friendship and the tests of loyalty. I also reccomend Otomo's \\"Steamboy\\", another brilliant film with breathtaking art. This film is awesome!
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Yes, I must admit I liked this movie very much, even though I was supposed NOT to like it, after friends had set me up against it with the old, stale phrase: \\"oh, the book was so MUCH BETTER than the film.\\"  Well, different.<br />This point may not be popular, but I really liked the slow sections when the characters were driving around the beautiful Ukraine.  But maybe it's just my nostalgia (I'm Eastern European)... I also appreciated the special kind of English Alex spoke (been there...).  In this movie language becomes almost a separate character, just like Eastern European love for \\"Amerika\\" does.  The mix of the old and the new Ukraine is juicy - it makes me want to go there (again).<br />The movie is an energetic leap into the present, complex, \\"globalized\\" Ukrainian-Jewish-half-and-half-and-who-knows-who-is-who-at-the-end  relationships sixty years after the Second World War. It's hard to leap with your feet cemented in the heavy ground of the war and the Holocaust, so the courage and creativity needs to be appreciated.  The young people in the movie are doing their own thing (and going for it), while the last survivors are still alive, watching, making their last (strong) points, fading away...  I think this movie is very important not just as a movie (that is entertainment, to put it crudely) but also on some other level. Risking to sound new-age, I'd say that there's something healing about it.<br />Illuminating?<br />While watching,  I was surprised how few scenes from the shtetl were included.  I thought it was a  big loss, since the shtetl scenes were such a strong and beautiful part of the novel.  Now, on the next day, I think that the movie was just fine as it was. Even the difficult ending was handled well.  Again, I would call it an energetic (and colorful) leap, even though the plot trickles down slowly, there are periods of silence, and driving around Ukrainian dirt roads in a Trabant takes time.
0743454529|1.0|I am a guardian ad litem so this book appealed to me.  That being said, I can't imagine why she wrote about a legal topic when she clearly knows nothing about it.  Her depictions of the lawyers, including the guardian ad litem, as well as court procedure were utterly unbelievable.  The relationship between the Guardian ad litem and Anna's attorney was completely unethical and no lawyer I know of would have engaged in such a travesty without at least letting the other parties and the judge know of the circumstance.  They probably wouldn't be disbarred but they would certainly be risking serious discipline by the bar.  Given that a child was a party, there is no way the judge would have allowed those lawyers to represent her.  At the least, another guardian ad litem would have been appointed.  The mother was referred to as \\"opposing counsel\\" but a lawyer REPRESENTS the client  - the mother didn't REPRESENT the defendant - she WAS the defendant!!  That was simply annoying.  And her representing the husband was  just brain dead material, especially since she clearly didn't talk to him and they had conflicts of interest.  That sort of behavior could get her disbarred.  Calling the guardian ad litem as a witness was ridiculous.  She could give her opinion but not under oath like a witness.  The lawyer being able to get Jesse on probation with one hearing (and no parents around) was in the realm of never land.  Like I said, did Picoult do no legal reserach at all??  And what sort of fantasy would allow the father to take a 13 year old on a fire run???  There was so much wrong with that scenario, legally and other wise, that I don't know where to start.  I don't know enough about the medical aspects to know if that was realistic, but the legal part was wrong 99.9999999 percent of the time.  Quite irritating and something that any lawyer could have corrected if asked.  The legal errors were glaring and saturated the novel. <br /> <br />The ending was just as bad as others have described.  All in all, the most disappointing book I've read in years.
0425188809|5.0|The very best of Dean Koontz, the dog steals every page. Even the creature garners a small bit of compassion, being the result of bad science. Can be very creepy at times, like the darkened construction site, and those eerie tapping of claws approaching. I'm much more a lover of Non-Fiction, but Mr. Koontz novels can be habit forming. He also knows how to hold ones interest, without the raunch and filth that's common with so many other writers today. A good place to start with the endless list of Dean Koontz books available.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It may sound redundant at this point in Tool's \\"legendary\\" career, but the anticipation of their latest Album, 10,000 Days, was worth the five year wait since their last album of Lateralus in 2001.  It's another musical masterpiece to add to the repertoire of sensational albums that the band has released for us all to experience.  These guys clearly understand the importance of quality in the art of music vs. taking their audiences money to create snappy singles that get stuck in our mundane minds for a month or two only to re-appear on some game show ten years later in the \\"one hit wonders\\" category.  10,000 Days proves, once again, that Tool albums are meant to be experienced in their entirety for a lifetime.  No matter what alternative music is doing at the present time of a Tool album releasing, they still rock harder and are more musically talented than any other band around hands down.  They're done proving themselves at this point, so if you are a Tool fan, buy this album, sit back and enjoy the latest installment that is TOOL!  If you've never owned a Tool album, but appreciate true artistry in music, buy all their albums, experience them, be blown away and never look at alternative music the same again!
0316172324|5.0|I loved reading this book. I am fascinated by psychology and this book definitely fed my fascination (for awhile!) I felt like I was sitting in an open-roofed train and the author was guiding the rails. It was an awesome trip, pieces of this and that, and other things I never would have thought of. It was very interesting and actually educational.<br /><br />The book really makes you think (yes, think!!) about issues in a new way. For example, how simple signs, and comments can signal whether or not your marriage will last, why cops shouldn't have partners, I could go on and on.<br /><br />Blink, is a worthy read, for anyone, for any reason.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|The 1974 prison movie is remade AGAIN. The first remake was the 2001 film called `Mean Machine' staring soccer player-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, and now here comes another `The Longest Yard' with Adam Sandler. Both remakes are reasonably amusing, with the original story kept basically intact, plus the reasonable supporting cast, but I still don't know why the four film companies Columbia/Paramount/MTV/Happy Madison had to remake this film now. <br /> <br />Adam Sandler plays the role of ex-NFL player Paul Crewe, who is sent to the jail in Texas after being arrested for `stealing' his girl friend's car and his reckless driving. The warden of the prison Hazen (James Cromwell) asks - or orders - Crowe to organize a football team for the inmates. The warden's idea is, the inmates' team must be so horrible that the guards' semi-professional football team can beat them easily, feeling happy and more confident.  <br /> <br />But you know, the inmates refuse to be losers. After enlisting a help from `Caretaker' (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), Paul Crowe's team named `Mean Machine' get stronger than he had expected. <br /> <br />The director is Peter Segal, whose approach to the material is alarmingly silly at times (inmates' cheerleaders, for example), and as a result the tone of the film is at best very uneven. William Fichtner appears as sadistic prison guard, but his violence is soon forgotten in the following slapstick scenes with supports like Bob Sapp. All in all, the actors supply funny moments and the sports stunts are convincing. Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds are good, if not great, and the brief cameos from Cloris Leachman and Rob Schneider provide amusing scenes, but Sandler is least interesting, far cry from '50 First Date.' <br /> <br />The overlong remake has little to offer except several funny scenes and amusing cameos. In the final chapter the film delivers the goods, but you have to go through the long road to reach that.
6300182282|1.0|I may have once considered this movie to be somehow romantic, like so many other reviewers.  But, that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that I thought were happy and stable.  However, after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter.  Now I have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost.  I was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger, happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters - can they ever really be content with their spouses?  It's a sad reflection on the human condition.  Yes, bitter sweet indeed.
0893860220|5.0|I AM THAT takes the reader beyond the words and the mind into Understanding. This is a remarkable book in that it communicates the REALITY beyond the mere words. Sri Nisargadatta hails from the Navnath Sampradaya lineage of gurus. What makes this lineage so unique and dynamic is the simple method of transmission they employ via the instrument of the mind through Understanding or the recognition of Self. Another way to look at it, is the mind which is the illusory root of ego and separation, is actually used to undo or vanquish itself as a thorn is used to unembed another thorn to use the analogy. The illusion of mind when turned inward or introverted dissolves itself through the Power of Pure Intention and Awareness. This IS Understanding! What makes this Book so Powerful? The Grace of the Guru and the Power of Truth! Together through Compassion/Love and Wisdom, they have the Power to liberate the \\"seeker\\". The Truth that Maharaj transmits through the Grace of His Guru, Sri Siddharameshwar is sublime and subtle. If the aspirant's mind is sufficiently ripe and subtle through meditation practices etc., then these Teachings can facilitate the Final Understanding of REALITY: that there is indeed no/thing or no/body to realize; that Realization is our Natural State, already existing as who we are and ultimately the only REALITY that truly IS. Maharaj's teaching is nisarga yoga or revealing to the \\"seeker\\" one's own innate \\"Natural State\\". Since REALITY is all that truly exists beyond duality and the illusion of the mind, then we are already THAT! Simply our awareness has not been sufficiently purified of concepts, ignorance and conditioning to allow us to merge into Pure Awareness Itself. Enter this Book.Maharaj's Teachings are based on the precepts of Advaita Vedanta and the practice of cultivating Self Awareness through Self inquiry and abiding in the Awareness of I AM. An introverted mind leads to recognition and realization of the Supreme Self or Parabrahman, wheras, the extroverted mind leads to perception of an illusory world revolving around the concept of a \\"doer\\". Once this concept dissolves into nothingness, Nothing remains beyond the REALITY of Self or Parabrahman.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|To be fair I've listened to this CD five times in a row--you know, to see if it's one of those CDs that grow on you.  NO!  Listening to this is like being trapped in an elevator with MUZAK playing continuously.  Hung up and sorry are passable.  Your high and Push are just shy of potential-and that's it.  What happened to my 80's icon? What's with the Jane Fonda 1982 workout outfits? It's not doing anything for me.  While she still has the moves and the body, I'm just not feeling this one.  The extra star is just because she's Madonna.
B00005JOWR|4.0|Big tobacco is of course an old, broad and very deserving target, but the real bullseyes of the satire in Thank You For Smoking are the people in those institutions -- mainly Washington pols, Hollywood and the media -- that assert with a straight face that they are serving the public interest instead of, as Nick Naylor (an excellent Aaron Eckhardt) is happy to admit, paying the mortgage.  Watching that skewering -- which is aided and abetted by the fine performances of Rob Lowe, William H. Macy, and Katie Holmes -- provides most of the fun in Thank You.  It's also amusing that the only remotely human and appealing characters in the movie, aside from Nick and his son, are Nick's fellow Merchants of Death and Robert Duvall as the tobacco company mogul.  The movie goes badly wrong just once, when Nick is kidnapped by anti-smoking vigilantes who almost kill him by covering his body with nicotine patches and make him momentarily an object of sympathy.  Otherwise, Thank You For Smoking is quick on its feet, bright, and often very funny.
B000002IGP|5.0|One of the best Hard Rock records of the 80s. <br />Stands right up there with Shout at the Devil, <br />Long Cold Winter and Appetite for Destruction. <br />No f'ing around, this album is killer.  Just <br />listen to \\"Lack of Communication\\" if you don't <br />believe me... <br /> <br />- cRAIG
0062502182|5.0|I wrote an extensive review... and my heart told me not to do so.  Instead, I felt that my heart wanted to share with you the following message: <br /> <br />\\"Read this book, if you are willing to make yourself happy.  Realize the book won't make you happy, but it *may* come to show you how to go about it...\\"
0060934700|4.0|Gaiman is a wonderful writer, I feel that his talent shines best in full length novels.  However, I adored most of the short stories in this book.  They are twisted and unpredictable.  There are a few pieces, however . . . well, they just didn't do it for me - they were not \\"typical Gaiman.\\"  The best way to approach this book is to read the intro first (there's a \\"suprise\\" in there!), then read each story, and, if you have a short term memory like myself, reread the background/intro to the stories again! This book is especially great if you want something not to involved or indepth.
B000EULJLU|2.0|On May 12th:<br />As a loyal fan of Tool myself, I bought this CD on backorder so that I can get it delivered to my doorsteps the day it is released. The packaging blows your mind away. Maynard is competing with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails to be crowned the High Pope of Rock n' Roll. Imagine my disappointment after the first listen - and no, it does not grow on you after several times of listening to it. If it does grow on you, you should have a doctor check you for some kind of malignant cancer on your head. The first time of listening is enough to reveal which songs you will hate from that point on. I liked Vicarious and The Pot but they cannot be compared to the greats like Aenema, Eulogy, H, Prisonse*, and of course, Lateralus. Many Tool favorites I will not list here. But this album is very spiritual and will only aggravate the true Tool fans. To say the least, Maynard has decided to retain his softness from A Perfect Circle and give the fans who will not leave Tool a shove to that side. Like most people, I resent being forced fed something I didn't like to begin with. As an artist, Maynard needs to express himself and they will come in many forms. Unfortunately, his increasing spirituality does destroy the soul of Tool and makes 10,000 Days sound like a wannabe Enya. There, I said it. The guitars are wonderful. The drums and bass are undeniably Tool. But Maynard's style is shot. He even skips his trademark hi-low style of singing but it does re-surface from time to time on different songs of 10,000 days to make us mourn for Tool's lost soul. I hope the band makes a public announcement that 10,000 days was created b/c Maynard's voice was recovering from laryngitis. The album sure has enough shi**y filler sounds to cover-up to some great problem within the band. I was suspicious when I first learned the band was doing some heavy promoting for 10,000 Days when they never did it before for other releases. Maybe Maynard really did find Jes** (research this story on your own). I'm praying to G** this is a fake album and that Maynard hasn't lost his mind. Here's a break down of the songs:<br /><br />Vicarious - you've heard it on the radio. Yes, this is good but far from great. Maynard accuses us for being TV junkies and cowards. No problem, Adam Jones' guitar makes up for the shortfalls and forgives Maynard's pettiness.<br /><br />Jambi - nice but very personal to Maynard. Message is unclear but some of his talented lyric writing can be sifted through to break our hearts for what Tool was before this album. Yeah, I'm dimming my eyes and holding on for one more day to Tool as well...<br /><br />Wings for Marie (pt I) - here comes the first of many wannabe Enyas. This one commits the unholy act of using the rock n' roll guitar to put you to sleep. Tool sounds like Santana on this song while breaking out a riff in order to kill you quietly as you see the band's soul go under.<br /><br />10,000 Days (Wings pt II) - unbelievably boring. Tool has never disappointed on the Title track but this album has broken the golden rule. I dare anyone to stay awake listening to this song. First time you hear it - yawn. Second time - yawn to tears. Third - deep slumber.<br /><br />The Pot - this song breaks my heart. Dying struggle as Tool appears to make a comeback on the album. The topic is funny and for days you can still hear echoes of \\"You must've been highhh...\\" singing in your head. Maynard's singing this? No longer the trademark hi-low singing but music made by rock musicians who wannabe great. His singing style makes a comeback and the guitar is properly restored towards the end of the song but it will not last long. Just like a dying man trying to breathe his last breath.<br /><br />Lipan Conjuring - this is Tool?!!! Navajo singing style - this intermission song is best used to conjure rain in the dry desert.<br /><br />Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) - Tool's trademark weirdness is stylized by their dialogue tracks. This is a dialogue track. But whereas other dialogue tracks on the previous Tool albums help to entertain, this one again breaks my heart at seeing such a great band go down. A reminder of what could have been.<br /><br />Rosetta Stoned - the guitar follows and constantly reminds you of Tool. The background riff is from Schism, can Maynard revive this song to make it climax like Eulogy at the end? \\"Godd***, should've known, don't know, can't remember what he said...\\"<br /><br />Intension - this song puts you in a trance. Kind of like Reflections from Lateralus but nowhere near as catchy.<br /><br />Right in Two - climax is too short and towards the very end. Song sounded better with the guitars and drums before the meaningless lyrics. But what would Tool be w/o great messages (think of \\"Do unto others what has been done to me, yeah...\\" or \\"We are eternal all this pain is but an illusion...\\")? I just wanna scream \\"Come back to us Maynard!\\"<br /><br />Viginti Tres - could've been a part of greatness like Ions belonged to Aenema or Triad on Lateralus but nothing. A whimpering of an ending to a wussy album.<br /><br />This album seals the victory to Trent Reznor as High Pope of Rock n' Roll. If Maynard beats up Marilyn Manson, we can forgive him for 10,000 Days - but only if there's blood...<br /><br />Update May 15th - 3.5 stars:<br /><br />I hate to say it but : Godd***, the album really does grow on you. I have to adjust this review to tell you a little more about the album after several listening sessions. I had been tearing open the packaging of the case to see if there could possibly be a hidden secret CD compartment somewhere because I really did not like 10,000 Days. As many of you know, there isn't a secret CD and like other loyal Tool fans, I had to give the CD another listen. Well, here's the secret: you need to catch Maynard's lyrics. Some have called the lyrics cryptic and impossible to decipher. As a loyal Tool fan, you learn to understand his strange way of singing and figure out his words. Here's what I think the content of the songs are but keep in mind my ideas are yet to be verified by the Tool Army:<br /><br />1. Vicarious - still the same song about us being TV junkies and cowards. Adam Jones is still excellent on the guitar. Later on in the song, Maynard tells us the \\"universe is hostile, so impersonal, as its always been\\". Vicarious gets cute after a few listens, even though it sounds good the first time you hear it (and I don't like cute).<br /><br />2. Jambi - very much like Tool and Maynard. Still unclear if he is directing this song at us or about someone personal to him. \\"If I could, I would wish it all away/ If I knew I would lose you one more day...\\" ??? The high point in this song are the lines: \\"breathed(?) like the fire dust to dawn, begged like a hooker all night long/ enchanted the devil with my song, and got what I wanted all along\\" -  which says Maynard is aware of his songwriting talents. Frankly, I am too but you might disagree after this album. At the end of Jambi, Maynard says \\"Breathe in...and survive another day, and season/ silently just take your poison/ Silently and run my way...\\" ? What does this all mean? I think Maynard is trying to inspire us much like he did on Lateralus. He has a way of moving you without becoming sappy about it. I still don't know why he would write a song like that - maybe he's trying to become a parent to us? (And if so, Maynard, if you're reading this, go easy on the idea) Jambi is still a very catchy song and I really like it.<br /><br />3 & 4. Wings for Marie I & II - songs are about religion and its ability to deceive both its followers and preachers. It's pretty deep and Maynard adds a twist into the lyrics to say that we have more than one alternative to decide on while the preachers do not. He tells the listener we have choices and that eventually we'll make the right one: \\"10,000 days and the fire's been burning long enough, you're going home...\\" I'm not going to type upthe lyrics here but listen to the song close enough and you'll be able to pick up his meaning. I have to say the mixing on this track could use some work - it's still too slow. But Maynard gets some points for the subject material.<br /><br />5. The Pot - this song is probably the first to stick in your head. He decries the hypocrisy of both drug users and their accusers. This song is the most difficult to decrypt because it's hard to understand what Maynard is saying and what his position is. So just sing along if you don't know and contemplate about his words if you do.<br /><br />6. Lipan Conjuring - native Indian chant song. Call it the spiritual voice you hear when you're high (right after Track 5).<br /><br />7. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) - dialogue between a nurse and a doctor. Nurse has found a patient w/ some problems she doesn't understand. End of Track 7, doctor is speaking to the patient and urging patient to talk to him, \\"Tell me everything.\\" Prelude to Track 8 - Rosetta Stoned. Same guitar notes playing in the background as Track 8.<br /><br />8. Rosetta Stoned - this song is trippy but very fun. It's about an alien abduction and the patient is telling the doctor to write down everything he is telling him. He's describing his abduction, how scared he is, and how ET told him he was the \\"chosen one\\" but he can't remember what they told him. It's important because it will make him a hero but he's so scared that, in retrospect, he should've asked them for mercy. \\"Strapped down, feet cold, and eyes red... Godd***, should've begged.\\" Hilarious song - raging good music with a hilarious story. You get the storyline from the beginning when he's just speaking rapidly about parachuting down Area 51 and seeing some lights. Funny and catchy and my most favorite song on the CD.<br /><br />9. Intention - song about the cruelty of humanity. \\"Pure is as we begin/ Here we have a stone/ Throw this thing at strangers/ Swear to crush his bones...\\" And again \\"Spark becomes aflame/ Flame becomes a fire/ Spark this flame at strangers/ Take what we desire...\\" Not a gripping message but you got to give Maynard credit for trying...<br /><br />10. Right in Two - another song about the cruelty of humanity. This time Maynard plays heavily with religious imagery: \\"Why did father give humans free will?/ Now they're all confused\\" and then he calls humanity silly monkeys that fight each other over every little thing. I'm touched that Maynard can be so sentimental but this song is too touch-feely for me. I like him more when he's cold-hearted and with wicked ideas (Prisonsex, Stinkfist, Aenema, Ticks & Leeches). This song doesn't really help me grow, it annoys me.<br /><br />11. Groaning song is very creepy and ends the album to make you restless. I'll sleep fine but you might have a problem.<br /><br />I will continue to like Tool after this album and I still think Maynard should consider my suggestion for him to beat up Marilyn Manson. But I think Tool and Maynard are heading for retirement. They've just lost their edge after so many years of being in the limelight and their softer side is touching, however, it's no longer Tool.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
B000089RVX|5.0|Deep lyrical prosed delivered over pop/rock and a voice of angel.  Though it been a few years this CD is timeless and still one of my favorites.  Pick this one up.  You won't be disappointed.
0440224764|4.0|This was a very entertaining read with great twists and turns. Some have called the story unbelievable, which it may be, but its Fiction so I had no problem with Patrick's many talents. This is definitly one of Grisham's best, but, as many have reported one here, the ending is terrible. You almost wish you had just left the last few pages to your imagination instead of being thrown into this terrible ending to a fabulous story.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I really enjoy the comic book movies.  Some of have been done very well like, the Spiderman movies, and the X-men movies, but then some have not exactly hit the mark like, The Fantastic 4, and Daredevil.  Batman Begins absolutly deserves to be in the class of super hero movies that have been done well.<br /><br />I confess that I was a little leary about watching this movie.  I really enjoyed the original Batman movie with Michael Keaton, and I thought the second movie (michael keaton as well) was quirkey but enjoyable.  But after these two the batman movies were honestly not that good.<br /><br />The cool thing about the first two batmans was the fact that they did not try to hide that these were comic book inspired films.  They were kind of like live movies that resembled animation.  It wasn't believable, but I don't think it was suppossed to be.  The last two Batmans, took the comic book animated look to a new level, and it just didn't work.<br /><br />Recently with the X-men movies we saw a new style of comic book movies being made in a more believable, less comic book style format, and that format for the most part has created a better movie.  With the creation of the Spiderman movies I believed the format hit perfection.  The super hero movie wasn't going to get any better.<br /><br />After watching Batman Begins I have changed my mind.  I think that this movie edges out Spiderman 2, by a hair.  The action and story is just as good as Spiderman, but the evil enemies in Batman are scarier than Spiderman.<br /><br />The cast in the movie is great.  Katie Holmes, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neison play great parts.  But my favorite actor in the movie was Michael Caine, who does a superb job as Alfred.<br /><br />And the most surprising role in the movie was Gary Oldman.  Until this movie I had never seen Oldman in anything but the villain, but he plays a great supporting character to Batman.<br /><br />The only thing I disliked about the movie, was the fight scenes were a little confusing to watch.<br /><br />This is a great movie!t the movie, was the fight scenes were a little confusing to watch. <br /> <br />This is a great movie! <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really don't watch tv anymore.... ok, except for Law & Order (I tivo this constantly) and Monk (occasionally), but nothing else has been able to grab my attention in years. It's all crap. But Firefly? Wow! It was worth something. Great writing, great acting.... the only thing I can think is because most every other show out there is crap (don't get me started on \\"Reality TV\\"), Fox must only run crap.... if they get a good show on of course they have to cancel it. <br /> <br />Fox, guys, do something right for once. Read these reviews and bring back this series. It's a no-brainer... and since you guys have no brains... well... you get the picture.
B000000OAN|5.0|I sincerely agree with some of the points on the previous reviews....but i think what makes the album an even BETTER buy for some is that those arent the only underrated songs...Any person that claims a love for anthem rock appreciates.... <br />\\"The prophet song\\" Freddy's chanting combined with a sick guitar riff makes this song immortal....I actually think that this song is my favorite on the album....especially in terms of the playlist...this being towards the end....and totally prepares you for bohemian rap. without being \\"filler\\" or \\"a weaker song\\" I also have to note, \\"sweet lady\\"....combined with all of the other songs mentioned above...that doesnt leave one song unaccounted for in terms having mindblowing intensity, with an uncomprimised Queen sound....at the full hieght of thier creative power maybe....maybe.....nonetheless a must for anyone claiming to enjoy thier music.....
B0000033P2|5.0|This 1972 release is a fantastic group effort and is a little bit softer around the edges than the comparatively aggressive and edgy Tarkus album (1971).  The album opens with the lengthy two-part The Endless Enigma suite that features a full-blown fugue sandwiched in the middle.  Greg Lake (bass and vocals) contributes a pleasant ballad with From the Beginning that provides a nice contrast with the complexity of the Endless Enigma suite.  Continuing the tradition of including lighter pieces on albums, which ELP started on Tarkus, there is the Sheriff.  This is actually a good song and features some excellent drumming by Carl and great Hammond organ work by Keith. With the opening of the instrumental rendition of Aaron Copland's Hoedown, the pace picks up a bit and features some searing Hammond organ work and trumpet-like fanfares on the mini-moog by Keith and great drumming by Carl.<br /><br />The three remaining tracks include the long-ish Trilogy (8'53\\"), the shorter piece Living Sin (3'12\\"), and the synth-heavy closing track Abbadon's Bolero (8'07\\").  I guess it's worth noting that the piece Living Sin was ELP's token song to the topic of sex - this is pretty rare indeed, not only for ELP, but for prog in general.  In fact, Greg adopts an uncharacteristically low, growling and husky tone for the piece - just to emphasize the subject matter.<br /><br />Rhino did just an OK job remastering this album and I have to admit that it is substandard when compared with the remastered Yes albums.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb group effort by ELP and is a fine album of progressive rock. Trilogy is highly recommended along with Emerson, Lake, and Palmer (1970), Tarkus (1971), and their crowning achievement Brain Salad Surgery (1973).
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I've read the negative reviews on here and they all say the same thing: This isn't like BloodSugarSexMagic! I too was taken aback because I read a pre-release review that said that this album was back to the old-style of the Chili Peppers and was their best album since BSSM. That reviewer must not have listened to BSSM before because this album is nothing like it. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is an incredible album and would've been a perfect follow-up to Californication (instead of the awful \\"By The Way\\" - which was easily their worst record since Frusciante joined). SA shows the Peppers growing and evolving into a mature rock band. While this doesn't get funky like BSSM, it's hardly a snoozer. The musicianship has never been better and it sounds like they've figured out what worked so well on Californication and what didn't work on By The Way. <br /> <br />I've given the album 4 out of five for two reasons: (1) I would've liked to have seen a few more of the funk/rock/rap tunes that they built their career on, and (2) while this is a GREAT double-album, it may have worked better as a single. It's almost as though there is WAY to much good material for a single album but not quite enough to justify the double. <br /> <br />This is definately a classic album and deserves to be mentioned right up there with the Chili Peppers other classics: Mothers Milk, BloodSugarSexMagic, and Californication.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Having read some of the reviews, I wanted to put in my 2?. I simply feel that it is not fair to knock the movie on the basis that it does not give you enough background or you needed to have seen the animated series. As I watched the film I felt the disorientation of Aeon, \\"What the heck is going on?\\". Yet we the audience discover the secrets of the city as she does. In the end, everything is crystal clear. <br /> <br />Now it may not be like the animated series. I remember seeing about 3 or 4 on Mtv years ago. However, this movie is entertaining with the element of making you think about science, nature, and what happens to men with power. I would say this movie is cyberpunk, but it is a little too glossy and well lit [Blade Runner is Cyberpunk].  <br /> <br />Final Note: this movie is worth 2 hours, and I find myself saying this less and less. It is unique in some of its ideas, and classic/elemental in others. The action is well balanced by good character relationships. It is not going to make you cry or challenge your thinking, but it will be better than most Summer Fluff. <br /> <br />That is the way I see it; I could be wrong. <br />
1582403589|4.0|What happens when the world we know is gone, possibly forever, and every day is a constant struggle for survival? Would we still fall in love, write poetry, decorate things, take time to read a book, or make plans for the future? How would a world gone mad affect the contemporary family unit or a religious organization? These are the types of things looked at in detail in \\"Days Gone Bye\\", the first volume in the Walking Dead series of graphic novels. Most contemporary media dealing with the subject of the apocalypse focuses on what occurs immediately before or after the great event that ends civilization (in this case, an infestation of zombies taking over the planet). The Walking Dead, however, is more of a long term project, focusing mostly on characterization. While there is certainly both action and horror present, these things are a vehicle to display the characters and how they react to the situations they find themselves in.<br /><br />The artwork is very good, and a welcome change in a genre that is mostly saturated with Japanese Anime style art. The main artist, Toni Moore, has gotten facial expression down to a science. It is readily apparent when any given character is sad, or joyful, or full of fear. An absolutely priceless facial expression is on the first page, in which an enraged (and probably drunk) escaped convict is screaming about never going back to prison. He has a very \\"I'm a crazy country bumpkin, don't mess with me or I'll chainsaw you\\" look about him. My one gripe is really about all graphic novels in general, although it definitely applies here. The use of emphasis on words is always completely off in comics. Either too many words, or the completely wrong words, are bolded (indicating emphasis on that word), which throws off the flow of the dialog.<br /><br />The story revolves around Rick, a police officer who awakens in a hospital after being shot on duty. The world has somehow become zombie infested, and he's all alone. This chapter of the saga is about Rick's search for his family, and his decisions on what to do next once he does actually find other living people. Several subplots pop up, mostly having to do with the backgrounds of the various minor characters, and hopefully they are explored further later on in the series, as these are all characters you can imagine actually being people you know and care about.<br /><br />If the first installment is any indication, this series is just going to keep getting better. Highly recommended to fans of zombie mayhem and standard drama fare.ut Rick's search for his family, and his decisions on what to do next once he does actually find other living people.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is hands down awesome. 28 tracks of pure bliss.  I can honestly say that there's not a single song on this album that I don't like. The guitar riffs are deep and intricate.  The nothing-short-of-phenominal bass lines from Flea compliment the guitar beautifully and Chad isn't lacking in the drums department.  All in all, amazing album.  Definitely one of the best of the year.
B000E1155E|5.0|Ive just spent some time looking over the reviews and I disagree with what I have read, although I am not suprised. This is one of the best british albums that has been released in years. Unfortunately for American listeners you have the disadvantage of not understanding the irony within the lyrics or the many british references that Alex Turner incorporates into his songs. He is a Yorkshire Lad and sings about the local pimp and 'Novas' and 'burberry' caps all of which fall onto deaf ears for an American audience but as a british listener are relevant and hillarious. I agree with Richard Ashcroft when he says that Alex Turner is one of the best lyric writers that he has ever heard. All I can say is pat yourself on the back If you are an American and got this album. Roll on the second album!!
B00005UW9T|5.0|~*~MESSAGE FOR THE GROWN UPS:~*~ <br />First of all, of course the grown ups know that this movie of Anastasia isnt the true story about what REALLY happened in real life.  ITS A KIDS MOVIE--IF U DONT LIKE IT PLEASE MOVE ONTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MORE ADULT-LIKE TO YOU.  But anyway, though this movie is false, not like the real details of what really happened in the early 19 hundreds, this is a kids movie.  I know the kids would probably question of the movie and compare or disagree with what really happen as they get older...that is the point.  A movie like this will strive them into learning more and more in school so they ask questions to know what REALLY HAPPENED.  Thats all i have to say.  Anyone agree? <br /> <br />~*~MESSAGE TO THE KIDS:~*~ <br />Enjoy the movie!!!
1932100385|2.0|Where is the study?  I have to agree with other reviewers in that this work is short of substance and a lot of ramblings.  Much of it was repeated over and over and over.  I forced myself to finish the book.  I found some things of value in the book but I was hoping to see more hard evidence about the health and life expectancy of the people in China.  I did not see that at all in this book.  I had a mild heart attack a couple of years ago at age 63 even though my Cholesterol is in the 120's.  I eat no red meat.  I do eat some poultry and fish.  They make up about 10% of my diet.  I eat a lot of fruit and veggies.  No dairy products. No junk food.  No sugar, salt, or soda pop.  Use soy milk over my high fiber cereal.  This has been my diet for the past 10 years.  Still I had a mild heart attack and a stent was put in place.  Go figure. <br />My best advice is this - if the food is man-made don't ever put it in your mouth, choose your parents wisely and live on a farm. You may live to a ripe old age but why?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Many people were hypothesizing about this album long before it was released. The rumors circulating settled that this album would be more \\"back to RHCP's roots\\". In fact, it's not. This album shows the band's maturity after having been performing and playing for over a decade. Flea comes through with excellent bass riffs, and every songs seems to fit in the cd. <br /> <br />Despite other's reviews of 1-star, I believe they don't understand that it's possible that RHCP has moved on. Although you won't find much funk/rap on this cd, there are some tracks featuring some downright groovy hooks. Mostly the album is just great rock. Enjoy!
B000003TAL|5.0|Before I say anything about the album, I just want to make clear that I don't know anything about Sonic Youth's early work (pre-EVOL era) so I can't make comparisons to it and this album. <br />At Allmusic.com, they recommended Sonic Youth's album \\"Sister\\" so I purchased it and was very impressed when I played it.  They also said \\"Daydream Nation\\" was even better so I purchased it as well.  I must say that I have never heard anything quite like this album before or since then.  The first thing I notice as I played the opening track \\"Teenage Riot\\" is that it had alternative and Indie Rock written all over it.  Kim Gordon, the group's bassist, began singing indecipherable lyrics to a soft yet somewhat abrasive electric guitar texure.  The pace then picked up and Moore entered in, singing lyrics that one could just barely make out under the greatly distorted guitars.  There was really not much of a melody but instead a surrealistic landscape of jagged guitars and the groups trademark feedback techniques.   <br /> <br />The second track \\"Silver Rocket\\" is really where the lion is let lose, however.  A very punkish attack with Moore once again yelling out inaudible lyrics and then an incredibly abrasive aftermath of atonal white noise that mimics the effects of bombs going off.  As the album continues through its tracks, the atmoshpere changes but the theme remains the same.  Often you're just recovering from the barrage of one song when your thrown into the fury of another.  There are many suprises along the way such as the avant-garde track \\"Providence\\" which cotains a rare use of a piano set in the background of a constant and almost unbearable rumbling noise. <br /> <br />The horrifying sounds continue throughout the album until it all comes crashing to a halt on the last track.  There's not much melody and no pop hooks whatsoever.  Instead everything relies on texture and creating a mood and feel to the music.  This is not an easy album to last through a whole uninterrupted listen.  You may find yourself listening to this like you would read a book; listening to it up to a certain point, stopping, and then picking up from where you left off.  This group was clearly inspired by the Velvet Underground and, like the Velvet Underground, they mostly had just a cult following, though this album helped them gain some critical respect and exposure to the mainstream.   <br /> <br />Summary: <br />This is a critical piece of Indie Rock and Alternative Undergroud music.  It may take you a few listens to get used to it (and don't expect to make it through the whole thing on the first listen) but you will be greatly rewarded in the end.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|this album rules, Turn It Again, Hump De Bump, Desecration Smile, Wet Sand. are the best on it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums ever made by any band at anytime in the entire world! I love this cd and i will recomend it to anyone no matter what type of music you like. Everyone should experience this cd. I felt moved and shaking at the end of every song. This is the most consistent album i have ever heard, every song is pure genius. <br /> <br />This album has some of RHCP's best guitar playing yet. John frusciante really kicked but. This double album has thier most complex and best guitar solo's i have ever heard from them. If you don't believe me, then listen to the song called \\"Hey.\\"
0060763280|5.0|I've been looking over some of the other reviews and wonder if some of those people are missing something.  This book is fantastic.  It's one of the best \\"wealth attraction\\" books out there.<br /><br />I believe that the problem with the negative-review people is that they are looking for some kind of Magic Pill in one book.  My belief is that if I get one or two workable things out of each book then the money I paid for the book is well worth it.  The only time I ever feel like I wasted my money is if I get nothing out of a book.<br /><br />I got many good ideas and pointers from this book...much more than one or two.  I definitely felt that this book was worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />If you're one of those people like me who likes to build a solid wealth library for current and future reference on life-changing strategies, this book definitely needs to be a part of that library, as it is something that you will go back to time and time again.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|Aside from Neil Young, few atrists have so drastically changed there sound as this band.  From the Sex Pistols cum Jesus and Mary Chain that was \\"Take Them On, On Your Own,\\" they've now landed straight into Guthrie-ville.  The songs are mostly acoustic, with the lyrics drawing the attention, as opposed to the noise.  And it works.  The change is kind of like that from \\"White Light/White Heat\\" to the \\"Velvet Underground.\\"  The songs stand on their own, and work.  Lyrically, they have never delved deeper into themselves than with this album, Musically this showcases their talent, and if nothing else, you gotta respect these guys for the balls to go a completely different route.  Old fans may be pissed.  New fans may get there older stuff, unaware.  But there's no denying this album doesn't rock, but rather rolls into the soul, in a way not scene since the passing of Joe Strummer.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|Okay, here's my addition.    I was wrong. After seeing the show live, and giving it a few months to sink in, the songs translate much better. The energy that I purported to not have heard, showed up with amps blaring.     My only comment is that this album requires repeated listens,  maybe two or three before it sticks. After that the songs become pretty memorable. But that seems to be the case with PJ these last few years. Of course that just means that I'll be listening to it far longer than some of life's more easily digestible, and far more easily disposable rock and roll.    In closing I would only say to give it a chance IF you don't get it on first listen.    If you did get it right off the bat, I'm catching up with you.        Original review......    \\"Another Pearl Jam CD with great words surrounded by uninspired music. This band just doesn't seem to get it. They put together two great CDs (Ten and Vs.) a pretty good Cd (Vitalogy) and then commence to create some of the most boring music available.   It's not bad, it's not good, it just kind of lays there.   Eddie Vedder, at times, doesn't even seem to bother to try and create a melody, he just kind of let's his voice wander around the chords hoping to hit on something plausible.  Die hards will love it (though I have no idea why) but if you're just starting out with their music, try any of the above mentioned releases.\\"
6305079811|4.0|Who would've ever thought one of the best bad movies of the 80's would sell for around 80 bucks?! The world is sure coming to an end. This movie is awesome the effects are crappy, the lines are some of the stupidest things no real person would ever utter, the plot is flimsy and simple, the acting is horrible and the costumes are cheesy cool. That means this movie kicks righteous ass. I'm telling this movie will have you in stitches and put you in a good mood. 80 bucks what an insult to this movie its priceless and belongs in a mueseum it is a piece of art gone horribly wrong! I gurantee this movie is not bad crappy film it is good crappy film with a kick ass Queen score. Trust me its worth  the money.
B000002JS6|5.0|I have to agree with the Kid's Review below. I read many reviews stating that AC/DC only played 3 chords on this album, (laughs), well, I use to play in bands in my teen years and played many of these songs, PLUS solos and I can tell you right now, there is WAY more than 3 chords.       Angus Young is a very underrated guitarist and solos like MAD. I know, because I seen AC/DC in concert a few times. He's one of the best guitar players in the world, despite what some think and say. His brother Malcolm is also a good soloist but has always let Angus have the spotlight.       Sure, Brian Johnson may not be the greatest singer, but his voice for this album fit into AC/DC's music like a gemstone. No other singer in my opinion could have or would have sounded as good as Johnson. He did an excellent job!       I grew up on these guys and their albums. I cannot even imagine what my life might have been like without their music.       One of the best, if not THEE best album ever recorded. I mean, come on, the album is TWENTY-SIX YEARS OLD and still sells. What does that tell you? :)       Buy it today!
B000087DRK|5.0|I know that's a pretty massive claim, but I can more than back it up.  Take everything that should be great about an album, then look at this one.  A good album should musically be good.  AD has some of the best music you will ever hear.  Not this 3 chord bs, nor the hubris of Phish.  At the same time, the music itself is part of the brilliance.  Solos (insanely fast ones at that) dot the album.  They're literally everywhere.  Yet, at the same time, that's the point.  The solos are meant to be humorous, as they go where they don't belong.  Think of a more talented version of Spinal Tap.  At the same time though, they have enough originality and pop sensibilities that they never fall into self parody, even though you couldn't tell looking at a lyric sheet, which brings us to point number two.  Lyrics.  They fit into the music, adding to it.  When you hear the epic intro to Age of Pamparius, you expect the lyrics to come and be some life-affirming apocalyptic grand poetry, but instead they're about pizza.  Once again, Spinal Tap.  But once again, they work, and have enough to stand on their own.  They're funny, but at the same time not stupid, and fit into the overall mood of the album.  As far as influence goes, just look into the tribute CD.  Everything from techno to black metal.  As rock and roll, it's what rock and roll was always supposed to be: fun and dangerous.  Think of Alice Cooper fronting the Ramones, produced by the Village people and you'll get a good idea of what this album is about.  Way better than Sgt. pepper's.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|It may look like it on the cover, but not!!!, I watched this & could not help but wonder if Natalie Portman & Julia Roberts were smoking crack when they signed on for this, this film is about four people(Jude Law & Clive Owen, being the other two) who get together with one another, & break up with one another, none of them are very likable, in fact, all four are downright distasteful, the dialogue is outrageous, I thought for minute I might have been watching a porn movie, Owen & Roberts, who are very talented utter some extreme dialogue, that you can't actually believe they are saying it, only in a porn film do you here this kind of talk, not that it offended me, but surprised me is more like it, Portman even gets raunchy toward the end, you can't help but wonder if all four should get together at once & get it over with,  I found it very hard to watch, but did see it till the end, & yet the ending is confusing, If you want to see Portman, Roberts, Owen, & Law in somthing different & distasteful, this is your movie!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|There are so many reviews complaining about this album not being \\"heavy\\" or not being different enough. Even more so, they complain about no climax to the music.  Yet, have you listened to it with the intent of hearing the music and lyrics as a whole?  Tool has always been heading more into the realms of the subconscious and trying to bring it forward; if you listen to this album with the intention of picking it apart stylistically, you won't ever find the depth of it. <br /> <br />Granted, I am sure they prefer that their albums have a high sales rate, but I don't believe that the band is really looking for uber popularity.  Most of their lyrics talk about expansion of the mind and trying to \\"unhook\\" from being a mindless, soulless blank face that is no different than all of the others.  If you stop patting yourself on the back and just _listen_ to what Maynard is saying, it isn't gibberish. There are clues to the paths they follow hidden in Maynard's riddles. You just have to be determined to track down the sources from which he is bringing his message. This means doing a bit of research... <br /> <br />If you aren't the curious sort and you don't want to understand what Maynard is trying to say, just sit back and let the music roll over you. You'll find in yourself a new place anyway.  I know it sounds like a bunch of spiritualistic, metaphysical hogwash but music has transported people into trances since the first drummers started drumming.  The layers of music that they weave aren't just for show, but to disorient you from everything that you are surrounded by and to help guide you away... <br /> <br />Stop trying to pick apart everything and analyze it to death, sit back and listen for the sake of the album. Don't ruin the magic of Tool's albums by trying to categorize, name, and summarize.  That is the beauty of their music, they are going beyond all of that. <br /> <br />I'm done. Thanks. Bye.
0930289528|5.0|This is an early example of the graphic novel, and it is really amazing how quickly the form of the graphic novel matured. There are some important points in this story that most politicians or Hollywood filmmakers still have not grasped: a fascist government does not appear overnight, and it most often enjoy great public support - at least in the beginning - since it brings order; we don't need masked heroes, they are just a mirror of ourselves; the collapse of a totalitarian government leads to a new chaos, which can easliy lead to a new totalitarian government; the rulers do not see themselves as evil - they think they perform a public service, and servants of the government are not necessarily evil, they might just see the alternative as worse. <br />The novel has a quite complex structure, with plenty of flashbacks, a sudden break in the narrative about two-thirds into the story, and a an end that is not so much an end as a the beginning of a new story.  <br />The story is more believable because of its strucure: we get to undersdtand the society the protagonist live in, and how it began. The characters are really three-dimensional, except for some deliberately shallow ones. The pain, madness and suffering of the masked fighter are very carefully developed. <br />I have not yet seen the film, but the directors appear to have tried to change the story a bit to keep the message intact, but more applicable to our own age and times.
B000EGCITG|5.0|This album is as strong as Try This and Misundaztood. I like this CD. I put it on this morning and just let it play like you are having a party. This album is her most confessional work to date. Whether discussing heartbreak, childhood, doomed romance, fake friends or the cult of celebrity, She states her mind with open-eyed candor- and two tons of attitude. This album has it all: rock and roll, soul and funk, and 100% Pink. She is a true pop icon. I am sure this album will go PLatinum.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Yesterday I bought Stadium and listened to all of it on the 3 hour drive home from college. And I'm almost certain that as I listened to this awe-inspiring, metaphysically breathtaking, phenomenally conceptuallized masterpiece of these 28 heaven-sent, jesus self-proclaimed, variegated tracks of pure genius, i felt my soul leave my body.
6300267881|4.0|We all know the plot. A 12 year old normal girl slowly turns into a raving, supergirl agent of the devil, a freak so outrageous that she , and the movie, are really more science fiction than horror! If anyone really believes this stuff happens, well that is up to the viewer, not to mention the ideas of Roman Catholicism. Ellen Burstyn does a great job as the very bewildered, near celebrity actress/mother /recent divorcee thrown into this very ugly vortex of surreal primitivism. Also note the very antiquated medical equipment in the hospital. Definitely, 2000's medical procedures have improved in 33 years! The special effects are excellent, if you don't mind some rather disgusting bodily excretions! Also some interesting Georgetown,DC scenes. Worth a look if you can hold your nose, and forget reality for about 90 minutes!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have been waiting years for this movie to be on dvd again! <br /> <br />It's my favorite Disney movie and I think is the better. <br />It has everything, a story, wonderful characters, music, colors. <br />Is a movie to watch and watch again! <br /> <br />Is a shame that Disney made the sequel, that sucks. But the original Little Mermaid is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. <br /> <br />How many red haired heroines do you remember before it?
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Largely the work of an ambitious youngster named Zach Condon, Gulag Orkestar is an indie rock album filtered through the mind of a teenager who dropped out of high school to travel across Europe and soak in as much culture and music as possible. The result is something that sounds a bit like the Microphones crossed with Neutral Milk Hotel. It might be the only rock album you hear that doesn't contain any guitars, and it conveys an emotional and worldly power of the likes I've not heard in some time.<br /><br />  Largely inspired by Balkan folk music, the album moves through mournful ballads and more upbeat tracks (that sound more like the work of a 10-plus member ensemble) with ease, layering horns, stringed instruments, ukeleles, mandolins, glockenspiel, drum, organs, piano, and other percussion under the soulful vocals of Condon himself, who has a similar range and style as Andrew Bird. The disc opens with the album-titled track of \\"The Gulag Orkestar,\\" and after some warbling horns and cascading piano, the track turns into a shuffling march that finds Condon soaring over the top of it all with his rich croon.<br /><br />  The album really hits stride with the gorgeous \\"Bandenburg,\\" which finds deft mandolins playing out over heaving drums and percussion as accordions wheeze and the track builds gracefully with delightful horn sections and layered vocals. \\"Postcards From Italy\\" follows, and it may very well be the best track on the disc, moving along with a playful opening section that mixes shuffling mandolin, piano and horns before shifting halfway through to a more delicate (and reflective) section that completely tugs at the heartstrings before bursting into a celebratory ending that's absolutely stunning.<br /><br />  The second half of the album finds Condon taking a few more chances, and amazingly he pulls things off just about every time. \\"Scenic World\\" uses a programmed casio-beat that sounds straight out of Magnetic Fields, but layers horns and accordion over the top for something completely unique while \\"After The Curtain\\" takes the non-traditional instrumentation and runs it through some filters, giving the track a slight electronic tinge without making it ever feel out of place. It seems like every year there's an album that comes completely out of nowhere and really stuns me, and this year that title is easily held by Beirut with Gulag Orkestar. An outstanding debut album, and easily one of my favorite releases of the year so far.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)for something completely unique while \\"After The Curtain\\" takes the non-traditional instrumentation and runs it through some filters, giving the track a slight electronic tinge without making it ever feel out of place.

B000002LRX|5.0|It's been said many times before, but this album truly is a classic.  It's creative, original, bizarre, unpretentious, and utterly perfect.  I love every FNM album (well, all the Patton ones, anyway), but in my opinion, this one stands out above them all.  In fact, I'd say that this is probably the best album Patton's ever done, in all his myriad projects (even if it's not the most artistically daring).  Here, everything just really came together, and the result is remarkable.<br /><br />While not as cutthroat in its diversity as Mr. Bungle, this album still covers a lot of musical ground.  You've got dark, nightmarish metal, like \\"Malpractice\\" and \\"Jizzlobber\\", funk-tinged tracks like \\"Crack Hitler\\" and \\"Land of Sunshine\\", raprock like \\"Kindergarden\\" and \\"Midlife Crisis\\", smooth, lounge-esque balladry like \\"Everything's Ruined\\", and \\"RV\\", which I can only describe as something like a deranged clone of Johnny Cash.  Then you have songs like \\"Be Aggressive\\", \\"A Small Victory\\", and the instrumental \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", which seem to forge styles all their own.<br /><br />This album is just plain fantastic.  The keyboards complement the music in a very special way, and Mike Patton proves to be one of the great vocalists of our time (plus, he heavily influenced other great singers, like Devin Townsend, Daniel Gildenlow, and many others).<br /><br />Simply put, you just can't be without this album.  It is truly a force to be reckoned with.
0062502182|1.0|While scanning through the reviews, I saw that one of the reviewers mentioned that the story about how the boy finds the treasure is one that seems familiar to him because he may have read it elsewhere. \\"Good\\", i thought. I am not the only one. I read a tale a long time ago (almost 13 years ago) in an Indian fairy tale book about a lazy village man who keeps getting this recurrent dream about going to a big city. He ultimately \\"follows his dream\\" and ends up in the city. Penniless, mind you, because he gets robbed. He ends up sleeping on the sidewalk when he gets picked up by a policeman and is taken to court where he recounts his story about the dreams to the judge. The judge takes pity on this guy and says \\"I, too, have had a recurrent dream about treasure in a well in a small village but you don't see me act on it. I will let you go this time.\\" And what do you know, the well happens to be in this guy's backyard.  <br /> <br />The treasure hunting BS is a straight up lift by this \\"magician\\" coelho. Do not disregard my review. I have nothing against Coelho and this is, in fact, the first book of his that I have read. I am an avid reader and I have never before felt like throwing up when reading any book. But the amount of cheese this book force feeds down your throat is absolutely unbearable. The entire section where the boy is having a conversation with his heart? come on... <br /> <br />It required an incredible effort on my part to actually pick this book up and finish it every time I put it down. It's THAT bad. If it is this easy to create multi million copy selling bestsellers then maybe its time I told my 10 year old cousin to write me a few tales that I should be able to sell for millions of dollars.  <br /> <br />You guys are eating out of this guys hand thinking this is a piece of literary genius while this crazy loon is laughing his head off, wiping his as$ with 100 dollar bills.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|The character of Aeon Flux in this science-fiction future drama has such a serious and displeased look on her face most of the time that one can hardly see anything human going on there.     They should have lightened up a bit just to make the character alittle more accessible. It would have made a big difference.    Simply put, the basic attitude of the movie was ill-humored and uptight for lack of any humor or real heart to speak of. This movie is mostly style and in the realm of the mental.
0446577383|3.0|As one who has really enjoyed several of Baldacci's books in the past, I am very disappointed with 'The Camel Club'.<br /><br />It combines several ridiculously absurd 'coincidences' with bizarre 'heros' and throws in lots of 'Blame America for all the world's woes'.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that the author of 'Absolute Power' has fallen to this.  A couple of the totally unbelievable parts are 1) A plot by Islamic terrorists to kidnap the president of the United States where they make sure that they don't kill any Americans, and 2) A group of conspiracy buff misfits (The Camel Club) who just happen to have a relationship with the Secret Service agent investigating a murder that they witnessed.  The  strange story lines do not end there either.<br /><br />In addition, the author seems to have fallen into the mold of the Richard North Patterson of recent books by turning a piece of fiction into a propaganda piece for his own leftist views.<br /><br />I recommend that you save your money.  If you've really liked Baldacci in the past and want to give it a try, I'd suggest at least waiting until it comes out in paperback.
B000001FS3|5.0|Cut 1: Have you been where the Streets Have No Name? Thousands of us have been in the places that are SO far beyond the end of the road that Egypt looks like civilization.  Cut 2: Searching, to put it all together, but still havn't found what you're looking for ... here, our angst is given voice and made noble.  If this album doesn't bring tears to your eyes, your eyes aren't open and you heart has not yet known pain.  U2 is truely outstanding in this work.
B00005JOYA|3.0|This film wasent that bad. As a horror film Silent Hill falls flat, I thought they could have done a better job on that. As an adaption of a game they did well. They basically combined all the elements from the first three Silent Hill games. Some characters, plot elements, music from the games, and you get some really good cinematography. I think that is the only thing that saves this film. The begining was done well you really get the same kinda feel you did when you were playing Silent Hill. As for the next 45 minutes or so I thought it was poorly done. You get alot of running around and pointless dialoge and not enough of Silent Hill. The monsters or whatever they are were too computer generated and Pyramid Head sucks and is only in 2 scenes. I acually thought the ending was very good. The gore effects were nicley done and the ending is very similar to Silent Hill 2. Anyway I doubt this will inspire anyone who hasent played the games to decide to play them. But if they do decide too this movie might acually make there gaming expierence a whole lot better. Being a fan of the series I was satisfied with the movie, It was a whole load better than the Resident Evil movie.
B000099T2L|1.0|Please ignore the rantings of the previous crazy five star reviewer who needs to be reported for being inappropriate for using vile and hateful language against other reviewers.Beyonce is awful and is not recommended to people who like good music.Get any Led Zeppelin album instead.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is masterpiece of filmmaking and people who dont like it  probably dont understand it for what it is. Coppola put alot of heart in this film and showed she got skills like her father. The cinematography and music were perfect for this type of film. This is alot more than your average love story, There was alot of symbolisim and subtext in alot of scenes. For example when Charlotte was given the flower to put in the pot, How each flower they put in was carefully done is a way of saying everyone has a place in life without acually saying it. Its obvious The movie had alot to do with soul searching and loneliness but it all comes together as a love story. Bob or Charlotte were never really happy when they were around anyone but eachother. Coppola showed a connection between two people in a unique way. I understand why this film won so maney awards, and I think it can definitly be called art in a movie form.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|Here is a package where one gets their money's worth!! Loaded with 30 deleted scenes, TV & movie spots, and so much more, one cannot pass up such a deal. <br />Here is a film that up to that time (1974) disaster films were in the hands of people who had to work with actual special effects. Not like now where most effects come from a computer, this film is a special event for those who are tired of CGI and like to see the actors get wet. The film is packed with action after the first malfunction occurs, and is also filled with some of Hollyood's most respected actors. <br />I too remember seeing this film during it's debut in the theaters, and was blown away from the film's scope. You really need to have a rather tough fanny to sit through it, as it is longer than the normal 2 hour film, but is worth it, as time actually flies while watching one peril after another. <br />Again, this package is worth the price, as you get alot more than you normally get from a 2-disc set, and is interesting to watch how the film was actually made, a testiment to those who worked very hard in making what you see as believable as possible without cheating with the effects. <br />You'll be amazed, like i was.
0385732554|5.0|Lois Lowry is one of those unique authors who has won the John Newbery Medal for children's literature twice. Once for the first book in this trilogy and once for a book about the Holocaust called Number the Stars. (Just as an aside only one other author has ever done that Madeleine L'Engle who I would also recommend highly.) I would begin by recommending any of her books; they are all worth the time and the effort.  This trilogy is set in a post apocalyptic world. The first two books each focus on different community's who have recovered from the devastation differently, both have strengths and both have weaknesses. And a young boy must heal them both and the land if either is to survive.<br /><br />The Giver<br /><br />Lois Lowry<br /><br />Laurel-Leaf Books<br /><br />ISBN:0440219078<br /><br />Jonas is a young boy who lives in a community with a lot of technology and many rules about it.

Children of the same age are raised together and each December they move up a grade, when the reach the age of twelve they are selected for occupational training Jonas in talking to his friend states about selections: \\"Jonas Shrugged. It didn't worry him, how could someone not fit in? The Community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\\" However all the other Twelve's were assigned and Jonas was skipped then at the end of the ceremony it was announced that he had been selected he was chosen to become the `receiver of memory.' He was to learn all the history and story of the people and become an advisor to the council that ruled the village. It only happened every so many generations and only 1 keeper of memories was installed in each village. Jonas and his family take in an infant who is not maturing and growing quickly enough. The child is given a year extension, when the child is marked to me replaced (abandoned and killed). Jonas takes the child and runs away. Through the winter Jonas knows he will not make it and pours all the memories he has learnt into the child. But can he save the child? What will happen to him and his community? Jonas thought his world was perfect, that the elders had everything under control, that there would never be war again. But also a world without choices.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I am a long time fan of the chili peppers but I don't think that biases my review of this product. <br />Stadium arcadium runs the musical spectrum and is one of the deepest albums in the last 30 years.  There is plenty of funk for the old school fans but also a fusion of melody that was lacking in many of the blood sugar sex magic tracks.  The title track, stadium arcadium, is so beautiful that it could have walked off of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark side of the moon.\\"  Other tracks, my personal favorites \\"torture me\\" and \\"hard to concentrate\\" display a range and depth far beyond most bands.  I challenge anyone to play both CDs through and not lose themselves in the music.  Arcadium is a testament to the RHCP's ability to continually create excellent music and it may be there best effort to date!

B000F3AAUW|5.0|Somebody wake me.  I think I'm dreaming.  This music will so far surpass anything you have recently listened to.  I am listening to the album right now and it definitely induces an other-worldly feeling.  The other reviews below echo what I have to say.  The album is seamless, glowing, amazing.  Its sort of genre-less...probably can be classified as R&B and funk but infused with elements of jazz and hip-hop with delicious avant-garde lyrics.  Its that good.  Wow!
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Ok, Obviously The Towering Inferno is a bit dated and does show its age.  Several of the top cast members (Steve McQueen, William Holden, Fred Astaire) have passed away, and we won't even get into O.J. Simpson, but this is still a great movie.  Many have probably forgotten just how big this movie was some 32 years ago.  This was a mega-blockbuster, earning well over $100 million which is quite a sum today, let alone in 1974.  Back then Hollywood was in love with the disaster film with movies such as Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake, and Airport, all having big name casts.  It's a clich? but its true...they just don't make them like this anymore.<br /><br />The Tower is a new state of the art mega-skyscraper built in L.A. by wealthy James Duncan (Holden).  Paul Newman was the building's architect Doug Roberts.  A huge gala black-tie event is going on to celebrate the opening of the new building on its top level.  A fire breaks out on one of the lower floors and Roberts suggests to Duncan that the party be stopped or at least moved to one of the lower floors for safely.  Duncan is incredulous and tells him that there is nothing to worry about.  Well we soon find out just how wrong he is!  It turns out that Duncan's son-in-law Roger (Richard Simmons) oversaw many of the details and he went against Robert's specifications by using substandard wiring to save money.  Soon the building is engulfed by flames and the party-goers find themselves trapped on the top floor where no ladders are tall enough to reach them.<br /><br />Steve McQueen, in one of his final roles, is Fire Chief O' Halloran who is charged with not only containing the fire, but somehow rescuing those people who are trapped and is probably the strongest character in the film.  Simpson actually makes a pretty good accounting of himself playing a heroic security guard.  Of course knowing what has happened to him makes watching him onscreen a bit uncomfortable.  Other co-stars include Susan Blakely and Robert Vaughn.<br /><br />Of course the real star was the special effects led by legendary effects pioneer Douglas Trumball who worked on such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Blade Runner.  Without the benefit of modern day CGI, the special effects team truly convinced the viewer of the harrowing ordeal that these people faced.  Even the rescue attempts where they transport people in the basket is quite thrilling.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with special features including several short featurettes, deleted scenes, commentary by film historian F.X. Feeney, and more.  Definitely more goodies than you would expect to find on a film that is over 30 years old.  It looks and sounds great as well.  Still packs a punch!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonbert Vaughn. <br /> <br />Of course the real star was the special effects led by legendary effects pioneer Douglas Trumball who worked on such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Blade Runner.

B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Okay here's the poo! I'm 23 and as previously stated collect movies(DVD mostly) and this is a classic.If you want to know what it's about scroll down and there's a hundred reviews explaining it. That being said this is a classic!!. Horror,comedy,and Bruce Campbell what more should be said, but seriously this has some of the most twistedly funny scenes I've ever seen plus it's modern history this is one of the top ten cult classics ever,If you don't believe me about it being twisted check out dead linda dancing or the moose/hand scenes it's beautiful gore/comedy at it's artistic finest.I am NOT some dumb punk kid,I'm educated and a public servant (City Employee) so don't write my views off.For as cheap as this is especially on amazon used or new,it SHOULD be purchased.This movie does not dissapoint(although a little demented!!).Thanks for your time,Now buy this sucker and JOIN US! (deadites that is).
B000078DOH|4.0|Before they were international superstars known for their soothing, mellow and soulful ballads, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were four poverty-stricken L.A punks making some of the funkiest music known to man. In the spirit of P-Funk recordings from the 70s, Freaky Styley is laden with springy bass lines, funkdafied guitar, and edgy, uneven drum grooves. Far from accessible, Freaky Styley is nonetheless an interesting, unique, and extremely original white-boy funk album. <br /> <br />The most intriguing prescence on the album would most certainly be guitarist Hillel Slovak, whose funky guitar dominates almost any track, lifting all of them to new heights. Tracks such as \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Jungle Man\\" are guitar heavy, with super-charged funk-laden riffs that are as musically complex and interesting as much of John Frusciante's work. His noodling will no doubt be respected by listeners of all ages and backgrounds, even if it's not necessarily their kind of music. The virtuoso bassist Flea has some interesting pieces here as well, but don't be expecting any of his genius that comes through on Mother's Milk or BloodSugarSexMagik. He was surely one of the most talented bassists of the eighties, but he had yet to come into his own as a songwriter, as some of the basslines are repetitive and are consistently dominated by the outstanding guitar; Slovak and Flea are both extremely talented, but don't have the chemistry that the Frusciante-Flea team display. <br /> <br />Anthony Kiedis also had yet to become the lead singer he is today, his voice has very little range on this album, and his lyrics are seriously undeveloped. Tracks like \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" are fun, but will leave the listener wanting more after five songs in a row witht he same lyrical content. His charismatic and confident voice however, makes up for many of its shortcomings, and he definitely connects with the rest of the band. Cliff Martinez gives very strong work here as well, easily rivaling anythingcurrent drummer Chad Smith has done over the years. <br /> <br />If you've heard Californication and By the Way and are looking for some of the funkier Chili Peppers, I would suggest starting with BloodSugarSexMagik. If you enjoy tracks on that such as \\"Mellowship Slinky in B major\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy,\\" Freaky Styley would be a great second purchase. Drenched in L.A cool, it's a unique, funky and outright weird experience you won't soon forget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I don't understand why some people don't like this recording, oh well... everybody have their own taste. :-) <br /> <br />But for me this is a great journey that we must have a special time to listen to this CD without any interruption. <br /> <br />After the introduction, you will hear the main theme and they keep moving on from improvitation to improvitation to other theme... etc... etc... with interesting chords progression or beat progression. If you're a composer, you can see that Pat and Lyle really carefully to put the piece together so it doesn't sounds like 'medley'. At the end of the song, you can imagine and feel like you're really going up to sky and I love the 'imagination' when listen to this song. <br /> <br />Pat, you're the man. Thanks for the unforgettable journey.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I was very impressed with \\"Hypnotize\\", more so than \\"Mezmerize\\" anyhow. <br /> <br />1. ATTACK: It's okay, but probably the most forgettable track on here. It's quite an enjoyable listen, nevertheless. 3/5. <br /> <br />2. DREAMING: Really impressive, I don't understand why this song has received so much abuse by a lot of reviewers. The vocal overlap in the chorus is a little off-putting at first, but it grew on me a lot. And the \\"Dreaming of screaming...\\" part is totally awesome. 5/5. <br /> <br />3. KILL ROCK 'N' ROLL: Very short but very sweet. 5/5. <br /> <br />4. HYPNOTIZE: I'm not quite as in love with this track as a lot of people seem to be. It's a little ordinary and didn't really stand out so much. Very nice intro though, and I like the verse, although I found it a little repetitive towards the end. In fact I usually skip it after the second verse. 3/5. <br /> <br />5. STEALING SOCIETY: I really liked this one. Serj's part at the beginning is repetitive, although quite impressive nonetheless. This is the only song that Daron has ever improved in my opinion. This song would be nothing without his vocal part in the middle, which is quite phenomenal. 5/5. <br /> <br />6. TENTATIVE: To begin with, this was one of the standouts on the album for me, if not THE standout. It's kind of gotten a little old now though, but it still impresses. 4/5. <br /> <br />7. U-FIG: Now here's one that stands out for all the wrong reasons. What the hell is up with that outrageously dumb chorus? And the verse is pretty moronic too. The guitars are very good, but I never listen to this one. 2/5. <br /> <br />8. HOLY MOUNTAINS: If this wasn't so reminiscent of \\"Aerials\\" from the \\"Toxicity\\" album, it would be my favourite by far. As it stands, it's a little derivative, and takes a while to get going, but I have to admit that I was stunned after Serj sings the last chorus. That part is excellent. I just don't care for the incongrous \\"Liar! Killer! Demon!\\" part. 4/5. <br /> <br />9. VICINITY OF OBSCENITY: Love it. Words cannot describe it (quite literally). It's extremely bizarre, but cool at the same time. 5/5. <br /> <br />10. SHE'S LIKE HEROIN: This song sucks for the first half, but when Daron and Serj duet at the end, it picks up a whole load of much-needed momentum, and you leave with the feeling that it's actually a pretty good track. 4/5. <br /> <br />11. LONELY DAY: I don't think this is over-rated at all. Admittedly, the (intentional) grammatical error in the verse annoys me a little, and I try to block it out as best I can. But the guitar solo is something truly special. 5/5. <br /> <br />12. SOLDIER SIDE: Absolutely nothing not to like about this track at all. It's very powerful, and sung magnificently. Great closer. 5/5. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXSP|3.0|I saw this movie just because I had to write a paper for school, and I have to say that I did'n like it very much, I liked \\"Silence of tha lambs\\" more. Maybe this one has more dialogue and less action, you know figthts and exciting scenes, but the few ones this movie has are incredible....the best one is the one with Pazzi's death... Whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, personally I wouldn't see this movie again, but if you asked me if it was good, it was just fine
B000A0GYD2|4.0|First off, let me say that the mini-series itself will probably never be equaled. It is truly spectacular - realistic, engaging, and thorough.  <br /> <br />I have to say, though, that for the huge price, I expected more from the extras. The two featurettes were great, but why not include the entire live broadcast of Kennedy's 1961 speech? I could get the transcript from a variety of sources and not have to pay for it. The same is true for the list of famous astronomers. I felt ripped off when I saw that everything else was just text and some still pictures. I don't buy DVDs to read or look at still art. That's a waste of the medium.
B000EULJLU|2.0|Okay, the most anticipated CD of the year is released and we get ....this????  What happened. <br /> <br />From its album title to its opening chord - I never thought I'd say this - it's a colossal bore.  Enough has been written about this album being primarily filler.  Less has been written that half the riffs and all the chord progressions seem to be ripped straight from Aenema and Lateralus.  At least they won't have to pay a royalty for ripping themselves off. <br /> <br />Clearly, Maynard and the boys are more interested in the side projects.  Oh well, Tool is dead.  Long live the old Tool.  <br /> <br />I'll give it a 2 only because I'm comparing it to the rest of their oeuvre. Otherwise, I'd give it a 3. <br /> <br />Far more interesting than this CD are the reviews of it here on Amazon: <br /> <br />\\"I didn't like it at first, but upon the 8th listen...\\" <br /> <br />Brother, please. If a CD doesn't interest you on the first listen and catch you by the third or fourth, it just isnt worth listening to.   <br /> <br />\\"Tool is the most creative band out there.  You folks don't get it\\" <br /> <br />Brother, please.  There is nothing to get.  It's a band of formerly creative musicians who seem far less interested in their product than you folks out there praising it and more interested in filling out a 30 minute record with filler and making a buck.  It cracks me up how so many reviewers think the band's \\"mysterious\\" schtick somehow makes them more intelligent or \\"deep\\" than other bands.  It's a gimmick for pete's sake.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000F1IQN2|1.0|this movie, isn't the truth, mister spielberg, havent spoken to the people (jews..) this movie is a wrong history
B000AP04NI|1.0|Like several others, I agree that the Cinemascope version was well presented, but what a disappointment as far as the Todd-ao digital transfer! The original release I bought in 1999 gives a much clearer and brighter Todd-ao version that gives you a much better idea of what the original may have looked like.         I enjoyed seeing \\"The Miracle of Todd-ao\\" again, but similarly the realism that was present in the original was lost, either due to poor quality of stock or inabilty to be able to digitally correct and sharpen the image. (I find it hard to imagine that Fox couldn't resore it better).There was an apology printed on our Region 4 version. <br /> <br />
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Transamerica is not only an outstanding drama but it also manages to reach a peak level of direction. The introduction of characters, their realistic sides, the adventurous zig to the story, the way the story unfolds, the music to the film and the awkwardness which is made to look easy going is where the film masters.<br /><br />With every passing minute, this film adds to it's intent. The acting is crisp and their is no conscious effort at the hands of the director to deliver the message to the audience. Obviously, this film deals with a sensitive issues for those concerned. Felicity Huffman (I didnt know her name until after I watched the film) does a good job. Her seventeen year old son,the character, Toby somehow was the best character of the film. His laidback quiet stupid self,whether you agree or disagree, did add a lot of calm to the film.<br /><br />My absolute favourite scene in the film involves Toby kissing a teenage girl who's licking a lollipop. No, I havent spoilt your film yet so don't worry on it. It's strange yet beleivable how Stanley's family deals with his/her sex change operation. Typical characters who did a great job at being typical.<br /><br />What is even more strange is that this film had no Thomas Newman. This film had no end monologue like American Beauty to add to it's credit. This film has no real tearjerking scenes. This film does not make you feel bad for any of the characters. Transamerica is not preachy yet manages to clinch the five star category of films. I don't know if it deserved an Oscar or not but I do know I stand by everything I just said.<br /><br />If you're thinking about watching this 100 minute long film, don't delay, just do it.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I read many reviews before i bought this album.  I was under the impression that this cd would be similar (in energy and emotion) to Ten, Vs, and Vitalogy.  I was wrong!   The album has many \\"mainstream\\"-type songs which lack in screaming and originality.  I miss the Pearl Jam of old.   <br />Save your money and just download a few songs like Wasted Life, Worldwide Suicide, and Marker in the Sand from the internet (pay sites of course).  The album as a whole is not a must buy.  Sorry, but it's the truth.
B000EULJLU|5.0|this is music to be felt as much as heard. the central theme is clearly death in various forms: as entertainment, as salve and  salvation, as being brain-dead and simply as crossing over into the unknown (hence the much maligned \\"filler\\" tracks). most everyone will like vicarious, jambi,the pot,wings and right in two. the other songs are up to your personal taste. anyway, this is art and not just your standard fare of song after song. it is a progression from their previous albums and i love it.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|I am being generous with my two stars, in deference to the man who wrote Harvest. <br /> <br />Simply put, Neil needs a lyricist, and perhaps a muse.  Listening to this, it seemed Neil looked around at what was clearly in view from his chair-his daughter, his guitar, his memory of the guy who sold him his ranch-came up with a tune and a hook, and then stuck with his first draft.  In acting, they call this mailing it in, and Neil mailed these lyrics in-or at least that's the better view to the one that suggests he has become lyric-deaf after all his years. <br /> <br />This could've been a four.  It just needed some words.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|During my first viewing of this new adaptation, it was a little bit difficult to get over how fast they speed through the story and what a completely different movie this is, however after my first viewing, I couldn't get the movie out of my mind. The inward struggle of both Darcy and Elizabeth is portrayed so well. There are a few elements that were explained in this adaptation that were not addressed in the Firth/ Ehle adaptation. Charlotte Lucas's reasoning for marrying Mr. Collins for example and the mother's obsession with getting her daughters married off. The father was much more loving to all of his family and over all; the characters and situations were more realistic. The scenery, music, and filming were beautiful. I own and love the first movie however to get the complete story I think it is necessary to view both. If you haven't seen the Firth P&P or read the book, don't watch this until you have. You would be missing out on too much background.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Comparing albums by the same band (or by different bands for that matter) seems worthless.  Is the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" really better than \\"Meet the Beatles\\"?  Is \\"Abby Road\\" more of an accomplishment than Led Zeppelin's first album or \\"Velvet Underground & Nico\\"?  Will we ever know?  I guess it just gives people something to discuss to sell rock music magazines.   <br /> <br />What IS amazing to me is that The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Velvet Underground could progress with each release, and while I wouldn't say that Pearl Jam is on the same pedestal as these bands, I will say that they ARE a great band.  The sign of a great band is that each recording they release is 1) comprised of meaningful songs and 2)a little different (and progressive) from their previous recordings...which brings me to \\"Pearl Jam.\\"    <br /> <br />Unlike other reviewers of Pearl Jam, I have enjoyed ALL of Pearl Jam's music.  Each album contains eight to 10 great songs with another three or four that you might love one day, hate the next.  \\"Pearl Jam\\" keeps up with that notion.  After several listens, those eight to 10 songs are revealed.  \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" \\"Life Wasted,\\" \\"Unemployable,\\" \\"Big Wave,\\" and \\"Comatose\\" are my favorites.  Is this better or worse than any other Pearl Jam release?  No.  Oh...and for the record...my favorite Pearl Jam album:  \\"Binaural.\\"
0060234814|3.0|\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is quite an enjoyable book, which is considered a classic by most fantasy connoisseurs. Being that I began my journey into the world of fantasy with reading the Harry Potter books, I did not grow up with The Chronicles of Narnia like many of us have. <br /> <br />After seeing the movie version of this book, I decided to read these books in chronological order (starting with \\"The Magicians Nephew\\"), and my first journey in Narnia was a pleasant one. When I picked up the second issue of The Chronicles of Narnia, the renowned classic \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" I was interested to see if it lived up to the constant praise it received. <br /> <br />Again I insist, this book is very enjoyable-- it is not, in my mind, worthy of being called a classic. Narnia is a refreshing world that is beautifully described... when Lewis takes the time TO describe it, that is. This book could have easily spanned 300 or more pages, but instead it is crammed into 189 pages, which do not have enough room for the words needed to thoroughly describe the beautiful world of Narnia. The characters suffer as well, for we hardly get to know any of them or their motivations, and the climatic battle of Aslan's army against the White Witch's lasts for only about one page! This may be the only time this sentence will ever apply, but the MOVIE has a great amount more detail then the book, and allows you to get to know the characters much better. <br /> <br />However, I am not saying this is a bad book. While Lewis's use of the word \\"presently\\" becomes so often that it grows to be annoying, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and I plan to keep reading The Chronicles of Narnia in hopes to one day have the whole collection. I definitely do recommend this book, but I also warn the readers not to expect a classic like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />While I don't enjoy Lord of the Rings as much as Harry Potter, I see why it is a classic, from the beautifully descriptive writing to the twisting plot, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" falls short of this. One last time, I will restate that while this book doesn't live up to the hype, it is ENJOYABLE and makes the reader smile often. <br /> <br />PS: It is a great story to be read aloud!! <br /> <br />6/10 <br />
1594481938|1.0|This book was completely unrealistic. I was so excited to read it because of a good review I had read on it and when I was finished, I was left feeling confused. What was the point of all that? A bunch of people feeling sorry for themselves, having nothing in common and having this weird relationship together. Huh?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I adore this album, and can't wait to see which songs are going to be fmaous, i hope all of them are but i think Hump de Bump and Turn It Again. <br />They are my favourites.
0375701427|4.0|American Pastoral is initially concerned with tracing the psychological roots of that elusive Jewish unconscious oneness with America. In a neighbourhood in Newark, the somehow unprobable myth of the all-American Jew is embodied in Seymour \\"Swede\\" Lebov, a blue-eyed blond Jewish adolescent, the local sports hero. The Swede?s personality becomes a riddle: as a thoroughly Americanised Jew, where was the irrationality in him, where the conscience? The supposed subjectivity of the Swede is initially conceived of as \\"unimaginable\\" in the eyes of the literary narrator of the novel, Nathan \\"Skip\\" Zuckerman. The novel itself is Zuckerman?s attempt to recreate the events in the life of his boyhood hero so as to bring to the surface the dark shock that befell him and transformed his ideal life into a nightmare.  <br /> <br />Was it possible for a Jew to have lived a life fully devoid of consciousness? As Skip is going to discover, the apparent blandness of the Swede does not hide a perfect happiness but a terrible tragedy at the core of his family life, his most valued asset. How can it be that the daughter of the football captain and the beauty queen could have grown up to become involved in the bombing of the local post office in Old Rimrock, their small town? Was this tragedy the result of the Swede?s suppressed conscience? <br /> <br />The Swede is initially puzzled by the seeming thoughtlessness of the revolutionary world that he gets to know through his daughter: \\"How does a child get to be like this? Can anyone be so utterly without thoughtfulness as Merry Lebov and the extortionist Rita Cohen appear to be? What kind of criminality, megalomania and insanity has possessed her and other seemingly angry anti-war protesters to set off the bomb? How could Merry hate America when she had no conception of America? The Swede is as terrified by their rash \\"act\\" as by the emptiness apparent in their bogus ideology. How can anybody save the world?s oppressed by disseminating death?  <br /> <br />Merry Lebov?s main preoccupation since childhood had been \\"the extremes to which gentle people have to resort in a world where the great majority are without an ounce of conscience\\". Her father anguishingly searches her past in the hope of finding clues to account for her deviation. Is this the way to find his own lost values? Or is he too lost for that? Why can?t he just continue to be the neighbourhood hero?  <br /> <br />But his life acquires an increasing complexity because he gradually stops regarding his self as blameless. Perhaps inter-marriage is not such a good thing after all (his wife being a Catholic). Perhaps his mistress was not at all that likeable. Perhaps they should not have moved to a WASP neighbourhood, where their backgrounds did not fit... As a result of his ordeal the Swede has come to realise that one?s personal life is not a playground or the culmination of the fantasy of the so-called American dream, but a site of deep responsibility. Yet, is it too late for him to change and undo his daughter?s crimes? Can she really be called his daughter when she has only inherited his failures? The story of birth and succession, of generational history, becomes utterly improbable: \\"He had seen that we don?t come from one another, that it only appears that we come from one another\\". By the end of the novel Zuckerman?s tale has become so absorbing that we seem unconcerned to retake the narratorial voice. <br /> <br />  <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|EASILY one of the contenders for best of 2006, no doubt.  You wouldn't think so, but K and Emmy are more similar than most people think, and that's why their collabo works so well.  Totally unexpected but making complete sense; that's why this record works so brilliantly.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Emmy's work for a long time, but K, I got out of his stuff eons ago, maybe after \\"Brothers In Arms\\", but this album made me reconsider.  My biggest problem now is how to file his work solo and with DS...separate???  Together with Emmy???  I don't know, but with an album this good, I'm happy to have this dilemma, haha.<br /><br />Every song is memorable, melodic, haunting, unpretentious, sublime, with slightly offbeat lyrics that never devolve into cliche, and K's guitar work is great here, on par with Emmy's classic, beautiful, soulful, graceful voice.  The writing is great, both his 10 and her 2, all killer, no filler, it's awesome how well Emmy and K compliment each other here.  Love it, truly something special.  It's not boring either, and the moods are varied, from fun (\\"Red Staggerwing\\", \\"This Is Us\\") to sad (\\"If This Is Goodbye\\"), and everything inbetween.  TOTALLY alt-country/country-rock with some folky touches thrown in, and this is what so-called \\"country radio\\" SHOULD be playing!!!  Not the cookiecutter crap that's an excuse for \\"country\\" that dominates their playlists.  NOTHING they add is as memorable, true, or soulful as this sucker.<br /><br />No centerpiece???  Perhaps, but there are soooooo many highlights I lose track, but if I had to choose one, it would be the title track, which seems to reflect life in a circus or a rock & roll band, or something else, I don't know or care...just great.<br /><br />Oh and they DID play some shows together for this album, I don't think it's a long TOUR, just a handful of shows, and with each ticket, each attendee gets a copy of the album, kinda like how Prince did his \\"Musicology\\" tour, which is a brilliant idea really.<br /><br />Anyhoo, great work all, Emmy and K.  Bravo!!dea really. <br /> <br />Anyhoo, great work all, Emmy and K.  Bravo!!
B00005QAPH|5.0|Or maybe more precisely, a daydream. A man is stuck in heavy traffic. Not a car is moving. It's utter gridlock. It appears that most everyone in close proximity is deeply focused on him, with the exception of a car or two and in short order, his car begins to fill with smoke. He begins to choke and tries to escape the car but cannot. He struggles with the latches, but has to crawl out a window. Then he proceeds to float above the gridlocked traffic and into the sky, where he notices a rope tied to his ankle and a man below is basically flying him like a kite. The man is actually trying to pull him to the ground. The man in the sky reaches to liberate his leg from the rope, wishing to float away free. But the dream ends.<br /><br />Guido is a mollycoddled famous director who we find, in the beginning of the film, being pampered and who's \\"well being\\" is being scrutinized by a room full of attendants. I'm tempted to do a straightforward account as if this were a simpler film, but 8 1/2 is a film about the making of a film and simultaneously, what seems to be, a real-time documentary about said film about a film. But I don't think that's complex enough. A fourth dimension to add might be the context of Fellini's actual life is being played out above and beyond that. Fellini does a pretty fine job at intertwining those threads, with an emphasis on his self-examination. He lays it all out there. He may have benefited more from a Freudian examination.<br /><br />The tortured and eternally frustrated director seems to be at a crossroads in his career. He's on the cusp of his biggest film to date. The only problem is he doesn't seem to be inspired or motivated to make it. He seems willing to play the roll of director, but hardly seems to enjoy getting his hands dirty anymore. All day, everyday, he carries a pained look on his face as he has to fend off his anxious producer or evade countless wanna-be actors or has-been actresses. It doesn't help that the perfect lead actress isn't the one he's been seeing behind his wife's back. On top of juggling his mistresses (of which he's alternately tired and inspired to do), he's constantly getting his ass kissed by staff who have relatives sprouting from everywhere to get in on the film. It begins to pain him to have to meet with his staff, his producers, or longtime friends in the industry who find it difficult to associate with Guido because \\"he's changed\\".<br /><br />What's amazing about 8 1/2 is that it's extraordinarily well thought out and meticulously planned. For all the soul searching going on and questions being raised, the film uses Guido's past and several delusional/male fantasies to answer them. Just as a something to ponder comes up, it's addressed. After all, it his his film. But, as segmented and, dare I say, somewhat dissatisfying as that aspect is, it comes off as clever and insightful. I love how Guido seems to always be in a state of reflection, but at the same time, he conducts himself as though the past doesn't exist. He comes off quite self-centered and arrogant; which to those around him choose to accept as charm. But his closest friends & family have become weary of Guido's childish exploits. In a twisted sort of way, I think that's what motivates and inspires him.<br /><br />Those first few minutes of 8 1/2, in my opinion, is essentially the entire film encapsulated in dream form. I found that fascinating. For the entire movie to be fully effective though, it might have dispensed with what I consider to be an ending that may have appeared to be the allocution the film built up to, but was actually as evasive and nonchalant as Guido was to his wife. I believe his wife was the voice of reason in the film, but was once again, patronized and handed a bill of goods from her husband. Which makes his revelation all the more disingenuous. The journey of Guido (Fellini) into absolution has him remaining the self-centered person he truly is and at the risk of losing his marriage and career, conjures up a moment of lucidity to pacify his wife's contempt. It would be a beautiful thing indeed if it wasn't just a defense mechanism which only enables Guido's ego. Sadly, his revelation is for the benefit of himself, and maybe also for his adoring audience. The irony is, that I didn't (or wouldn't have) expected anything less. How could I?<br /><br />A brilliant and deep film that is resolute and steadfast with it's content, but can surely mean many different things depending on the viewer.his marriage and career, conjures up a moment of lucidity to pacify his wife's contempt.

B000000W5P|5.0|To start off with, if da stones hadn't made one other song besides \\"beast of burden\\" they would still be one of my alltime favorite bands.  That song alone is worth 100 gs.  Many of my other favorite stones albums like \\"tattoo you\\", \\"sticky fingers\\", \\"emotional rescue\\" and \\"black and blue\\" just don't have that same through and through down-in-the-bones good feel as this lp does.  The continuity and integrity of this album can't be beat, cuz.  I always feel a little lighter on me feet after listing to this one.  Mick seems really loose and there ain't no darkness here like \\"sister morphine\\", \\"tops\\", \\"down in a hole\\" or \\"memory motel.\\"  It's all just feel good rock.  \\"before they make me run\\" is unquestionably richards' best recording ever, m'kay...a lyrical masterpiece and loosey-goosey jam fitting well with the mood of jagger throughout the rest of the disc and then it slides right into the best stones song of alltime.  I like some of the stones early rockers from the '60s and early '70s, but \\"lies\\", \\"respectable\\" and \\"shattered\\" dropped some political and sociological commentary in without taking themselves deadly serious like \\"sympathy for the devil\\", \\"star, star\\" or \\"dead flowers\\".  Great classic rock that more than survives the test of time (it darn near transcends it).
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Is there going to be a good horror movie this year? Hostel sucked. It wasn't scary in he least, and it hastily became violently predictable. Another movie that goes way over the top to shock, but lacks the intellectual side that really should drive a movie like this (imo). What it does though, is flaunt the female body in full force. Complete, full-on, full-frontal nudity, and one point there's a full-on rear-view of a chicks \\"sneepur\\". The first 30 minutes is wall to wall tit & ass. I can say I've never seen anything like it before in a modern, widely-released film, and I looked around the room and noticed the ladies in the room moving around as if uncomfortable. I saw that a few theaters aren't showing it while skimming the showtimes yesterday, and thought it was for the extreme violence. Wrong. Let me predict huge dvd (& lotion) sales... Barbara Nedeljakova is hot. In fact, nearly every girl is smoking hot in Hostel. *makes travel plans*<br /><br />I mention this partly because I had to chuckle due to some lady walking out of the theater w/ her 8-9 year old daughter...about 45 minutes into it! Timing is everything if you ask me. She may have well stayed. Truth be told, I thought about walking out soon after that. Not because of the nakedness, (that was the best part), but because of the poor quality of Hostel in general.
B000EQ5TSI|3.0|Let me begin by telling you two things.  One: I really liked the 1996 film adaptation of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Two: John Woo is one of my favorite directors.  It would seem to me, and to countless others, that John Woo directing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II would be a dream come true.  Perhaps it was because of high expectations that audiences were so disappointed with Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II. <br /> <br />While the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was deep and jumbled enough to throw many people off, the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is so miniscule that it's nearly non-existent.  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), an IMF (Impossible Mission Force) spy, is ordered to recruit a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and work with her in a mission to destroy \\"Chimera\\", a genetically-modified disease that could kill millions.  Hunt and the thief, named Nyah, become romantically attached to each other, and things begin to get complicated. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting things about the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series is seeing how each director handles the material.  Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was filled with shady characters and conspiracies.  J.J. Abrams' MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III was an energetic, action-packed thrill ride.  John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is substantially different from each of those films.  It has nothing in common with De Palma's film at all.  It is, however, loaded with intense action sequences.  This will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with director Woo's previous films. <br /> <br />Indeed, there are some scenes in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II which only John Woo could pull off.  The movie is loaded with Woo's trademark slo-mo action and over-the-top stunts.  Memorable scenes include Ethan Hunt wielding dual pistols (something done by numerous other characters in legendary scenes from Woo's Chinese films) and a scene in which a lone white dove emerges from a line of flames.  As an operatic bit of Hans Zimmer's very fine score begins playing,Ethan Hunt walks past the flames, glaring in at the film's villain - who is, by the way, played by Dougray Scott.   <br /> <br />Any movie directed by John Woo is sure to blow away most action fans, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II should really knock their socks off.  The plot is small enough to give Woo time to focus on the action scenes, while keeping the film a few steps away from mediocrity.  (Screenwriter Robert Towne has said that he based his script on action scenes which John Woo told him that he wanted to direct.)  Cruise's Hunt comes off, at times, as an American James Bond.  His performance conveys a strong sense of urgency and, occasionally, desperation, which really adds to the overall intensity of the film. <br /> <br />What John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II lacks in depth is made up for with perfectly-executed action sequences guaranteed to satisfy the action fan.  Despite a primarily-negative audience response, this is a good sequel that very narrowly misses the mark.
0790729377|5.0|Without putting the adaptation into historical context, (because I haven't researched the movie's history or the play itself), I have to say A Streetcar Named Desire is one of the most realistic and honest acted (by all involved) films around. Brando himself seems to disappear into the role of the down-to-earth Stanley. Stanley and Stella make the quintessential Orleanian couple, for their time, as they live foot-loose but deeply in love with each other, and they know each of the other is the only one for them. They quarrel now & again but the fights are usually either rooted in fun or serve as foreplay. Things change for them when Stella's hoity-toity sister Blanche shows herself and begins living with the couple. Stanley clearly doesn't enjoy Blanche's elitist attitude and how it's beginning to rub off on Stella; or maybe more precisely awaken Stella as she may have been before her time with Stanely. It would be interesting to know the time when Stanley and Stella met. I can imagine Stella being just as aggrivated if one of Stanley's relatives suddenly began staying in the apartment with no prospects and no plan to leave anytime soon, but in this case, Stanley is at his wits end when Blanche's story (of the past several years before showing up) doesn't check out and Stanley exposes Blanche's past. Let's just say it's a sorted past and whatever the road she traveled to get to the point where she hopped from hotel to motel, depending on the kindness of strangers , she's a bit used and a little lost in the mind to say the least. We do know some of her story about Stella leaving Blanche in a troubled situation at home as kids for New Orleans, but it comes off as patronizing Stella and more than a little selfish...the very thing Blanche believes of Stella! As a matter of fact, I can identify with Stella somewhat in that respect. Blanche meets a would-be gentleman and the entire situation blows up in many areas; with Stella & Stanley, Stella & Blanche, Stanley & Mitch, Blanche & Mitch...it's a regular royal rumble of sorts. Throw in some card playing buddies and a close-knit, cheeky neighborhood and 'Streetcar' stands as maybe the best adaptation from a play out there (with Glengarry Glen Ross way up there also).Blanche & Mitch...it's a regular royal rumble of sorts.

0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden's critically-acclaimed bestseller BLACK HAWK DOWN tells the tale of the famous Battle of Mogadishu, which occured on October 3, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia.  100 American Army Rangers were backing up a group of Delta Force commandoes in an attempt to capture two senior lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  The mission was supposed to take an hour and be relatively simple.  Instead, the soldiers found themselves under attack by much of the city's population, which consisted of thousands of furious Somalis.  18 U.S. soldiers were killed in the fierce firefight which ensued; it's estimated that more than a thousand Somalis were killed.  During the firefight, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down.  The troops already on the ground rushed to save those in the downed helicopters, while Somali troops closed in on them.  After the battle, President Clinton ordered the U.S. troopers withdrawn from Somalia and the whole bloody mess ended.    The author of BLACK HAWK DOWN, Mark Bowden, is a journalist who has worked on the Philadelphia Inquirer since 1979.  Part of what makes this book so very impressive is the fact that, prior to working on BLACK HAWK DOWN, Bowden had hardly any experience with the military.  He interviewed those involved in the Battle of Mogadishu, read official reports, listened to recorded radio transmissions, and watched video footage in his attempt to recreate the vicious battle between the Americans and the Somalis.  Yet this book, which - as far as style goes - has more in common with a work of fiction than a historical piece, makes it seem as though Bowden was right there alongside the troops in their fight.  Bowden pays attention to the details, and it pays off: this book really puts you in the moment.  BLACK HAWK DOWN seems even more vivid due to Bowden's description of each person involved.  I felt like I knew these brave men, and because of that, it hit me even harder every time one was in trouble.      I was surprised by just how riveting BLACK HAWK DOWN is.  Bowden's writing is truly superb, and quite moving as well.  He tells the story from the viewpoint of the soldiers involved, the strategists and politicians back home, the families of those killed, and the Somalis present at the scene of the battle.  Each side is treated equally.  Bowden's descriptions of the grisly firefight are horrific, and his descriptions of the aftermath are extremely touching.  BLACK HAWK DOWN is a very impressive work of non-fiction.  Highly recommended.
B00004U2G4|2.0|Jeff Beck is a good blues rock guitarist, not great.  What Jeff Beck may have started with this album, Led Zeppelin vastly improved on.  Beck may be good, but there is no question that no one had more overall lyrical, instrumental, and production skills than Jimmy Page.  Led Zeppelin completely outplays Beck's inferior supprorting cast, and the layered riffs and intricate melodies created by Page and Zep are untouchable.  Don't even try to compare this album to Led Zeppelin's works of the late 60's and early 70's.    Oh yeah, by the way, Rod Stewart isn't even in the same league as Robert Plant.  Robert Plant's banshee wails could blow Rod STewart out of this universe!  There is no way you can question the intensity of Robert Plant.  His vocals could peel the paint off of walls.  Rod Stewart is Tom Waits compared to Robert Plant (if you don't know who Tom Waits is, then don't even respond).  You know, I don't even have to say anything.  Just pick up Led Zeppelin I, II, and IV.  Then come back and try to defend Rod Stewart's crappy vocals.
B00009V7T2|5.0|From the opening notes of this one, a listener knows she is in for something far outside of the ordinary.  It only gets better and better from there.  I'm torn between which of their studio full-lengths is better.  This one is more compressed (although that is perhaps difficult to conceptualize when the entire CD is mostly a bunch of 6+ minute songs that flow almost seamlessly into one another).  There aren't any \\"peel off all of my skin\\" meandering jams like there are on _Frances the Mute_.  Truth is that they are both great and each has its own charms.  _De-loused_ is simply seventy + minutes of solid euphoria, with no song really any less euphoric than any other.  Add the fact that Flea holds down bass here (the best they've ever had), and the only way you can be disappointed is if you don't like adventurous music.<br /><br />\\"Son et Lumiere\\" starts you out in the midst of Volta's strong suit: a deep sense of mystery.  \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" provides what may be the ultimate battle-cry for Volta: \\"No one knows,\\" which is sung ecstatically over a rush of some of the best guitar you'll hear in the history of rock courtesy of Omar Rodriguez (see my reviews of his solo albums and _Frances_).  \\"Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)\\" has all of the dynamics that the band are famous for and Omar sounding quite a bit like Santana.  That is one of the amazing things about this band: they manage to be completely innovative while also incorporating some of the best elements of not only classic rock, but also salsa, jazz . . . one of the few influences you are likely to never hear in Volta is country and western.  I'm waiting for them to do Stravinsky's _Rites of Spring_ one of these days, they are just that good: real musicians' musicians in the vein of prog greats like King Crimson and ELP.<br /><br />\\"Tira Me a Las Aranas\\" is mostly a spooky and dissonant folk line played on an acoustic Mexican guitar.  It then proceeds to segue into one Volta's most wicked salsa beats in \\"Drunkship of Lanterns.\\"  By the 1 minute mark of the piece the band is all over the place, Flea sounding as mobile on his bass as Jimmy Garrison did behind Coltrane in his classic line-up.  This song is especially mind-numbing live.  One can only imagine where they will take salsa in the future.  Right here, it is almost as voodoo-istic as one could imagine it being with Jon Theodore's voodoo-inspired drums flailing in a manner only equalled by Brann Dailor and Neil Peart in the history of heavy music.  Witness the band's collective pummeling of your id at the two-minute mark (an infectious figure they return to and vary several times in \\"Drunkship\\"), with especially fervor-inspiring results at the 4:30 mark where they embark on one of the most complex jams ever captured.  Keyboardist Isaiah Ikey Owens also shines in the last jam of this song.  Simply put, this is experimental music at its best.<br /><br />The pace never slackens after this point, but I'm going to leave it at this and let you parse the album a little on your own.  That's the joy of Volta: you can just feel them on an intuitive level and have one of the most transcendent artistic experiences imaginable.  The joy doesn't abate when you dig in and really analyze the music and lyrics, though.  Like any other classic work of art, your intuitive enjoyment of the work is amplified when you go in and deal with its parts.  The same cannot be said of lesser works.  That's because these lesser works don't possess the depths and heights of meaning, emotion, and skill.  _De-loused_ is the whole package, not meaning over skill, skill over emotion, or anything like that.  It is uncompromising on artistic integrity.  As you can see, I could write a dissertation on Volta, but if I do that, I won't actually write the dissertation I'm supposed to write in literature.  Fortunate for me, analyzing Volta actually amplifies my understanding of what is great in all arts, including literature.  It will do the same for you if you just allow yourself to feel it.just allow yourself to feel it.
B00005JOVN|4.0|It all started with Paul Gallico's novel, \\"The Poseidon Adventure,\\" which I found fascinating due to the way it presented a fairy tale disguised as a modern survival story. I say this mostly because of character development; each person was assigned a given personality that never faltered and often times created great conflict as they made their way through the bowels of the capsized S.S. Poseidon, a luxurious but aging ocean liner. Despite most being unwilling to band together, they were still drawn to the leadership of an obsessively driven reverend, and in an almost supernatural way, they continued on their journey.     Then came Irwin Allen's 1972 film adaptation, something that focused more on the action than on the humanity of the situation. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of this version; I guess I was too bogged down by the original novel and the way it banded a group of one-tracked characters together. It did succeed in providing some good visual material (even though the special effects are cheesy looking by today's standards), and it gave audiences a lot of familiar faces to root for (Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, and Jack Albertson just to name a few). But on the whole it felt flat, emotionless, and shallow.    Now we have Wolfgang Petersen's remake, simply entitled \\"Poseidon.\\" Petersen--perfectly capable of handling nautical tragedies (\\"The Perfect Storm\\")--has crafted a much more entertaining adaptation despite the fact that character development is seriously lacking (meaning that it bears little if any resemblance to Gallico's novel, other than the capsized ship). There's really no need to describe the basic plot; anyone who's read the book or seen the original film will know what to expect. And even if they haven't done either, the trailer for this new version pretty much says it all: on New Year's Eve, a freak title wave hits the ship and flips it over, leaving precious little time for a handful of survivors to work their way to the keel and escape.     The aspects of the story created just for this version focus only on special effects and character names. Gone are the Reverend Frank Scott, Mike and Linda Rogo, Manny and Belle Rosen, Susan and Robin Shelby, and James Martin. Instead, we have: Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a former navy officer; Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former Mayor of New York; his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), secretly engaged to the love of her life, Christian (Mike Vogel); Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfus), an architect reeling over the breakup with his boyfriend; Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son, Conor (Jimmy Bennett); and Elena Gonzales (Mia Maestro), a stowaway desperate to reach New York and visit her hospitalized brother.    In terms of the special effects, I think it's obvious that the model-ship-in-a-tub quality shots of the original film don't hold a candle to the work put into this remake. The destruction scenes are absolutely amazing, and for that we can thank computer generated imagery. The overall design of the Poseidon itself is striking, looking more like a streamlined, modern luxury liner than a cheap imitation of the Queen Mary. It's the kind of look that lends itself better to the moments of action, which are numerous to say the least; certain sections of the ship can't seem to stop flooding, and there are enough explosions to keep thrill junkies on the edge of their seats. It takes the action to a level the original film didn't dare explore by making it fast paced and adrenaline pumping.     Of course, I can't forget that because this takes place in the present day, the technology is much more advanced. Is this an improvement? Not necessarily, although it does make the danger they're in more realistic (because, as we all know, technology doesn't always ensure survival). In both the novel and the original film, the characters made the perilous journey with only the hope that they might be rescued.But in reality, they had no way of knowing if they had any chance of survival. In today's world, there are GPS satellite tracking systems and automatic distress signals. In \\"Poseidon,\\" help is definitely on the way for these people. It's just a matter of time. It's also a matter of who makes it and who doesn't (and you probably already know that not everyone does).     In this sense, it's almost symbolic that the characters are forced to encounter death on their journey (just as it's symbolic that the ship is named after the destructive ancient Greek god of the sea). They frequently pass dozens of dead bodies that are strewn throughout the wreckage, signaling a kind of cinematic foreshadowing. This aspect of the story was prominent in the novel but barely alluded to in the original film; in that version, the dead are shown sparingly, making it seem like the characters were traveling through a deserted ghost ship. It wasn't plausible because an ocean liner holds thousands of people during a voyage, not just in passenger friendly areas, but in the lower decks, as well. The remake did a better job of showing that the people are trying to escape from a tomb as well as from a sinking ship.    It's interesting that I found \\"Poseidon\\" so much more enjoyable than \\"The Poseidon Adventure,\\" considering the humanity of Gallico's story still hasn't been explored. Maybe I went into the remake knowing that his Disaster at Sea fable wouldn't be taken into serious consideration; it's an upgrade of the original film, not the novel. That must have enabled me to turn off my feelings for it and focus only on the new material. Everyone always says an original is better than a remake, but apparently, that isn't always the case. I will say that \\"Poseidon\\" isn't better than the novel; that was far too unique to be overshadowed by a film adaptation. But as a film and as a remake, it works.     Take whatever you will from this upgraded movie. It delivers exactly what it promises in a relatively short period of time, and it definitely isn't boring. I'd recommend it, even to the diehard fans of Irwin Allen's 1972 film. Maybe it's time they get upgraded, as well.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I love Pearl Jam's old stuff and I was really excited for this album, but it's really just kinda blah. There werent any great guitar parts, no exciting vocals.

0060763280|2.0|Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is terribly disappointing, lacking sincerity, and is NOT going to bring you a genuine understanding about what creates true and LASTING wealth.<br /><br />The text divides people based on social class, judges people who may be temporarily short of funds, and reads much more like a sales pitch than a real guide to help you prosper from the inside out.<br /><br />The book is heavily laced with try-to-be-catchy tease phrases and NOT ONE showed a \\"secret\\" of a millionaire mind. When I read, \\"Rich people admire other rich and successful people. Poor people resent rich and successful people\\" my stomach turned.<br /><br />Personally, I don't admire people based on their bank account balance, or status in society. I admire people for their hearts and who they are inside. ANYONE can have a lot of money and lose it. ANYONE can also go from flat broke to prosperity. I've seen both happen many times. I have also never resented people who were wealthy, even when I didn't have money for food.<br /><br />This book just left me feeling cold.<br /><br />If you're looking for books to help you create lasting wealth, change your consciousness about money and abundance or overcome obstacles to wealth, I highly suggest:<br />\\"Think and Grow Rich\\" and \\"The Law of Success in Sixteen Lessons\\" both by Napoleon Hill<br />\\"The Science of Mind\\" by Ernest Holmes<br />and \\"Failing Forward\\" by John C. Maxwell.<br />All four are excellent books and available here on Amazon.
0790729407|3.0|I think this movie can be summed up in two simple words: long and violent. But fascinating nonetheless. Neal Jordan takes a somewhat biased look at the life of Michael Collins, and I think he tried his damnest to keep to history. But something missed it's mark in the movie, I can't quite sum it up. It may have been a couple of cliches I could have done without. Example: an impending death. Cut to a loved one either wandering around ignorantly or rushing to the aid, although we know it's in vain. Collins' death scene, in particular, was ruined by cutting back to Julia Roberts trying on wedding dresses, and then suddenly staring in the mirror. SHE KNOWS. Or it may have been Julia's run of the mill performance with her VERY BAD irish accent. And surprisingly Aidan Quinn slipped quite a bit, though his acting was passable. Other than Ms. Roberts, the casting was stellar, Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and the always wonderful Alan Rickman. The extras aren't too bad, the always present biographies, and filmographies, and a nifty documentary on the real man himself. Wasn't disappointed, but wasn't overly impressed, either.
B000002J09|5.0|I would request everyone to ignore the one star reviewers who cant appreciate good music even if they heard it.I do agree that bands like The who,Black sabbath,Queen,Rolling stones and Deep purple are good but Led zeppelin are much better than all these bands.Led Zeppelin's Zoso has sold more than 23 million copies to date and still sells strongly in all countries.This masterpiece has the greatest rock classics in Black Dog,Rock and Roll music,When the Leevee breaks and Stairway to heaven.Hugely and strongly recommended. LONG LIVE LED ZEPPELIN.
B000002IGP|5.0|What makes Ratt so special to me, aside from the fact that the band is common ground for my brother and myself (who are ten years apart in age), is that they were the eighties to me.  While they have a unique sound all their own, they can be compared to other Los Angeles glam rockers, like the Scorpions, and singer Steven Pearcy's voice can sometimes be reminiscent of W.A.S.P.'s own Blackie Lawless.  Two trademark songs on 8191 to listen for are \\"Round and Round\\", perhaps Ratt's most popular hit and positively the catchiest beat I have ever heard, and \\"You're In Love\\" where Warren DeMartini's and Robbin Crosby's guitars compliment each other almost perfectly, Bobby Blotzer makes magic happen with his drums, Juan Croucier holds it all together with his bass, and Steven Pearcy's voice is the icing on the cake for this awesome tune you'll find yourself playing over and over.  As my second choice for Ratt album, I would have to recommend \\"Out of the Cellar\\", which is the record that made Ratt world famous in 1984.  You'll find some of the same songs on \\"8191\\" as \\"Out of the Cellar\\", because most of the songs on \\"Out of the Cellar\\" characterized Ratt and were instant hits, like \\"Round and Round\\", \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"Back for More\\" (which has Crosby playing a great acoustic riff at the beginning), and \\"Lack of Communication\\".  If like me, you are a product of the 1980's, you won't be disappointed in buying music by Ratt!
B000001AKM|3.0|There are often times where a decent artist can make or break the best reflection of their career with a greatest hits record. While it is often desired as well as it could be, it is often declared as a miss. That has been the case with so many artists like Whitney Houston, Melissa Etheridge, and the late Luther Vandross. They've had a very wonderful reflection of music, but it wasn't that way with their greatest hits records. For Lionel Richie, he has been another example. His era of his solo works, and his success with The Commodores in the 60's and 70's, is arguably some of the most elequent works ever in the history of the Motown era, and his first greatest hits is a mixed reflection of good works.<br /><br />Back To Front, Lionel Richie's 1992 greatest hits record, tries to do a good job at reflecting Lionel's solo works with his efforts with The Commodores in a convient package of music. The collection does have a lot of great songs that still remain defiant towards Lionel, and what has made him one of the most elequent singer/songwriters ever. The collection includes a lot of great songs from his career including Endless Love with Diana Ross, the Oscar-winning Say You Say Me from White Nights, All Night Long, Easy, and the tender ballad Hello. Although the album does include some great songs, there arguably could've been more added on that was overlooked from not just Lionel's solo works, but also The Commodores as well. The collection overlooks tracks like Love Will Conquer All, the soft and soulful Stuck On You, and Commodores tracks like Lady (You Bring Me Up), and Brick House.<br /><br />All in all, Back To Front fairs well as a good hits collection reflecting Lionel Richie's career, but there just could've been a whole lot more to have been desired that should've been shown. I absolutely suggest you purchase the 2003 Lionel Richie Definitive Collection instead. It is a much better greatest hits record than this one.<br /><br />Album Cover: B 1/2-<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+br /> <br />Songs: B- <br /> <br />Price: B- <br /> <br />Remastering: C+ <br /> <br />Overall: C 1/2+
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols were a very influential band. They were not one of the first punk bands but they helped the punk movement evoolve. For anyone who says they were fake or made up by \\"Bald cigar smoking record executives\\" you are sorely mistaken. They were formed by Malcolm McLaren to promote his shop, a small shop that sold sexual devices like gimp suits and the like, not record executives. The Sex Pistols were in fact dropped from two record labels, later writing EMI, the last song on the album, about one of the record labels,before they could even publish a record ( to learn more about the band get the great movie The Filth And The Fury). They weren't the greatest musicians, especially when Sid Viscious joined the band in the later years of the band, but punk rock didn't have to be too complex, that was kinda the point. They showed how people with little experience could start a band, and launched numerous bands. Their songs are sung with true anger by John Lydon who was a great frontman but not so great a singer.  All the songs are great on this album especially bodies, Holidays In the Sun, Anarchy In The UK, and God Save The Queen. They are all good moderatly lengthed songs that aren't too long and have a good rhythm. This is a great CD from one of the first and most infamous punk bands ( for a long time they were banned from the radio in England. This CD is a must for any true punk fan.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|This is quite possible is one of the most boring and tiring albums ever released, there is absolutley nothing good or exciting about Pearl Jams eighth album. Who would of thought \\"like most bands end up doing\\" they went commercial, this album will stay on peoples minds for about the length of the record playing time, and then forgotten. <br /> <br />For people unfamilair with Pearl Jam start with Ten then work your way down to Yield or Binuaral, after that they sounded completley bored and so will you be if you listen to this album. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|At First I didn't like this album from the first listen, but hell I didn't like any of the tool Albums on the first.  I thought Lateralus was crap the first time, but grown to love it.   <br /> <br />10,000 days does the exact same thing, after listening to it many times, I feel this has become there best CD and is my favorite Tool CD.  They are only getting better with every album.   <br /> <br />I don't understand how people hate Wings For Marie/10,000 Days.  Yes its long, but thats whats awesome about it.  10,000 Days is the best song on the CD follwed by Vicarious, Right In Two, Jambi, then Rosetta Stoned, Wings For Marie, and Intenstion as the non-filler songs.   <br /> <br />10,000 is so good with the thunderstorm in the Background and the climax at about the 8 minute mark.   <br /> <br />Words can't describe this album but amazing. <br />You will not like this CD on the first Listen, but find the lyrics on the internet and following along with the CD, you'll love it and find out this is an epic CD waiting to happen.   <br /> <br />And what is this \\"They sound like A Perfect Circle\\", not one song comes close to APC on this album.  This is Tool and you can tell its still Tool.  Your not going to get another Undertow album because they are not all Hard Rock anymore, they are trying something new, unlike every other band in the world. <br /> <br />And everyone saying its to long, what you want the average 40 minute CD that you have to pay $15.  Yes the CD is 77 minutes long and I love it.  Tool is one of the few bands in the world that can make a 7 minute or longer song and turn it into a Mystical Journey. <br /> <br />I rate this CD in my own opinion as their best CD followed by Lateralus, Aenima, Undertow.  This is finally what I expected from Tool and they delivered to Perfection.  I hope I have helped in anyway and go out, buy this CD and just let your mind go when listening to this album
0440237688|4.0|I am currently reading this as part of a class study on utopia and dystopia. My, but it was good! I'm supposed to read the book 45 pages at a time, but I read the whole thing instead, with chastisement from my teacher. At first Jonas' community seems like a fun place to be. You don't have to think for yourself, and, strangely enough, you don't want to because you're having too much fun. It is only when you see the truth behind these lies that the community seems only like a place to run away from. The book was very good. The characters were three-dimensional in a one-dimensional world, and the story was very well written. The only thing that really put me off was the description of what it really means to be released. That passage was horrific, gave me nightmares. The author could have made a milder statement that, while still making the point, didn't involve a newborn baby being murdered.<br /><br />Overall a very good story and worth reading.
B0000AUHPG|2.0|Sergio Leone got it right with \\"Fistful\\" and \\"Few Dollars more\\".  \\"Good/Bad\\" was at least good for goofy music you could make fun of for the rest of your life. <br /> <br />Then there's \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\".  This movie starts out with an intense openeing, leading you to believe that the entire movie is going to be that cool.  Tragically, this is not so. <br /> <br />What you get is nearly 3 hours of dialog, little action whatsoever, virtually no suspense, horribly confused music (a love song plays while the woman makes love to a man she hates for just killing her entire family) and the sappiest acting ever.   <br /> <br />Nearly every single sub-plot that develops in this movie turns into a letdown with virtually everything being abandoned as loose ends.  Nothing comes to fruition or finality.  There's not even a decent showdown between the hero and the villain - it was like swatting a fly with a Cadillac.  Further, none of the characters make any heroic decisions that allows you respect any one of them, all the way down to the widow who sleeps with her husband's killer for....oh yeah, no reason at all.  This movie is 100% pure screwball confusion, from the dimestore soundtrack to the plots to the characters.   <br /> <br />The music alone in this movie is nearly unbearable.  The same echoed harmonica tune is played over and over by the hero (Charles Bronson).  It's not even a tune of any kind, just some strange notes that make no sense at all and are supposed to instill some kind of mysterious aura around the hero. It not only doesn't work, but it annoys you to death.  The only scene in the entire movie that made any sense to me whatsoever is when the woman shoots in the direction of the harmonica in the dark at night for no reason at all.  A sound that annoying certainly deserves a bullet.  But then again, the harmonical player was the hero of the movie, and the woman knew it.  So why did she shoot at him in the first place when he didn't do anything wrong?  Again, another one of the movie's abundant and ridiculous loose ends. <br /> <br />Then you've got the villain, played by Henry Fonda.  This is the worst role he has ever played, and I'm shocked he took the role.  Even Fonda's acting couldn't save this script.  The villain he played was a dimwitted idiot who couldn't even think straight and had to be saved by the hero from his own men, who had turned against him because.... well... oh, that's right - you never find out.  And the archvillain \\"evil boss guy\\" on the train was a helpless criple who couldn't do anything but look weak and embarrass himself by falling down all the time.  How does he die?  You just find yourself back at his train to watch him wallowing around on the ground because he's stricken with teberculosis.  Talk about anticlimactic.  Absolutely no value whatsoever as villains, either of them.  This is supposed to be a western?   <br /> <br />Missing in this movie are all the classic elements that make a Western enjoyable - a good story, respectable or at least interestingly cool characters, a difinitive good guy, a difinitive bad guy, a good showdown and at least tolerable music.  None of those are present here. <br /> <br />I have to ask:  What's the purpose of a bonus DVD full fo extra features when the main feature sucks this bad? <br /> <br />You have to be pretty starved/desperate for any kind of western you can get your hands on to be able to give this movie any kind of favorable rating.  5 stars?  Are you kidding?  I was doing something during this movie that I NEVER do during a western - falling asleep. <br /> <br />The only thing that makes this movie a western is all the dirt. <br /> <br /> <br />
0783232039|2.0|First of all let me say that after watching Child?s Play 2 and 1 I got to say that Chuckie was one of the dolls that used to freak me out back when I was a kid. When I heard a new movie was coming to a release I thought I had to see it. <br /> <br />Let me tell you that this isn't an horror movie. Sure it has blood but is nothing special or better than the first movie. Why? Because Chuckie itself is dishonoured this is more like a typical summer flick, it sucks, chuckie in this movie is not even scary anymore.  (OMG HE HAS A BRIDE!) Big deal? NO! some of the dialogue in this movie made me laugh and same thing happened with the kills, it just didn't feel like an horror movie.  <br /> <br />The final sequence of the movie was very well made so that's why my two star rating. If you are a fan of Child's Play give it a rental, but remember that this is not an HORROR MOVIE. Is laughable. Just what the directors had in mind? (Money).  <br /> <br /> <br />
076781326X|5.0|\\"Oliver\\" is a remarkable achievement for a musical.  Each scene expertly envelops the listener and viewer into a feast of a visual and audio masterpiece.  For those who hate musicals or are at least less partial, the Dicken's story will quell some of the sentimentality associated with this genre.  The rough atmosphere helps with some of the songs and invites those who would have a cursory interest to join in for the fun.  The characters are engaging enough to begin with, but the performances are superb.  Ron Moody's Fagin is masterful, especially that he can take a hardened character and make him seem likable.  An emotional connection is easily made with every character:  We like Dodger (Jack Wild), love Nancy, root for Oliver (Mark Lester), and sneer at Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), a nuanced and menacing enemy.<br /><br />The technical achievements are also hallmark.  It is no small thing that the camera angles are expertly framed for the wide view as well as for the intimate, closer shots. (Take a look at the first \\"Annie\\" movie and see if you don't agree.)  The editing, too, is great, making the scenes unfold with grandeur and a timing that is as close to perfect as a musical movie gets.  The songs are great, also, even if they sometimes linger too long, especially  \\"As Long as He Needs Me,\\" but at least it gives the audience a moment to pause and catch its collective breath.  Some are sing-alongs, like one would expect at a lively pub, including \\"Oom Pah Pah,\\" \\"Consider Yourself\\" and \\"It's a Fine Life\\".  Then, there are songs with the grandeur of \\"Who Will Buy?\\" Variety is enhanced with other songs, like \\"Boy for Sale,\\" which seems rooted in opera.<br /><br />This movie makes one believe it could be made today; it is so timeless.  Yet, it draws so much from the old musicals and innovates with new elements, that it could only have been made in this place and time (England, 1968).  It is hard to find anything (except maybe \\"The Sound of Music\\" or \\"An American in Paris\\") that matches the quality of this film.  It is heart-warming, suspenseful, and engaging throughout.the quality of this film.  It is heart-warming, suspenseful, and engaging throughout.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|By far one of the best DVD's in my collection. Its played in my home everyday. The sound these gentlemen produce is second to none. In fact I think they song better now, than they ever did. If you like the Eagles, this is a must have.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Munich asks many questions about the difference between right and wrong.  It asks the veiwer to decide whats so different between what happened at the 1972 Israli Olympics and what the Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team did in responce.  In 1972 Palestinian terrorists held Israli athletes hostage, eleven of them, and then murdered them all.  This group of terrorists went by the name of Black September.  After the aftermath a group of Jewish nobodies was formed for the soul purpose of killing the men resposible for planning the murders.  This movie follows their story.  The team leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a married man expecting child and within moments his life is put on hold and put in danger.  As the movie progresses you can see that Avner battles moral issues, trying to decide whether what he's doing is worth all that he could be giving up.  There's a scene where he's talking to his child on the phone and he breaks down because he's missing so much, and for all he knows he could miss everything.  As we learn more about the conflict between these two people, the Jewish and Arab people, we begin to see there may not me much difference between them at all.  Is their revenge that much different then their reason for such?  \\"Thousands of years of hatred doesn't make you decent.\\"  Besides asking such moral questions, that aside, this film offers a thrilling story, a thrilling, fast past and engaging film that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Through flashbacks we see what exactly happened on that fateful day at the Olympics.  The morality really plays key here as each and every man on the mission battles feelings of guilt and a lack of morality as they carry out this mission for their country, for their people.  It's a story for all to see, about revenge and the act of and how it affects us as a people but also as individuals.  Acting on all fronts is brilliant, Bana especially.  Spielberg is genius.  Remember...  \\"All this blood comes back on our heads.\\"
B000EMGAGW|4.0|A very great return of mobb deep, this album is not at the level of the first two album (the infamous & Hell on heart)but it is a solid album. My favorites songs are: Smoke it, Stole something, Backstage pass, The infamous, It's alright.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Pink takes no prisoners on this cd. Shes raw, edgy, emotional,  and blunt, even more so than usual on certain songs. All the songs are good and some of them make you think and take you to a deep place. I love \\"Dear Mr President\\", she spoke the absolute truth about Bush, something alot of people are scared to do. She didn't bite her tongue, she just stuck it to him straight Pink style. My favorite song would have to be, \\"Nobody Knows\\". Her vocals are nice and you can really hear and feel her emotion throughout the song. This is definitely something that music lovers everywhere should own but only if you can handle the edge. This was a huge improvement from the \\"Try This\\" cd.
B000051YEG|5.0|The first time I heard Melody Nelson, it was in Paris, year 1977 at a friend's home. My friend pointed how \\"funny\\" were some of the lyrics (\\" tandis qu'hurle la radio\\"} but all i remember is how I loved the music...Some years went by and one day I decided to get the Integrale Gainsbourg, which is the cd collection of all he wrote and composed ( A LOT !!! ) and then I could listen to Melody Nelson in full....At that time of my life I was a DJ in a disco in Cannes in the south of France and some mornings after work I used to play Melody Nelson to help me falling asleep or just to relax. My 2 favourite parts were (and still are) the 1rst and the last songs, although I LOVE the album. Actually if you think about it Serge Gainsbourg was \\"rapping\\" ahead of his time (if rapping is talking on music!...)and that was on the first song but on the last song (Cargo Culte) the words, the music and the choir gather together to lift us  almot to Heaven and THAT is what it is all about : getting high drug free!!!!! This is no mystery, just look at all the feedbacks : 5 stars everywhere! Serge Gainsbourg was someone really special and thanks to his music, he will live forever.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Being a die-hard Floyd fan. I was skeptical at first. The album is truly wonderful. The sound quality is stunning. Not in an \\"Absolute Perfection\\" kind of way. But in a \\"on the Island with him\\" way. The best new album I've heard in a long time.
B000002LQR|5.0|This album covers alot of Funk including songs like Mellowship slinky, If you Have To Ask, Sir Psycho Sexy and Funky Monks, as well as great hits like Suck My Kiss, Breaking The Girl, Give It Away and Under The Bridge. A highly recommendable album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Con muchas expectativas, esperaba este nuevo album de Pearl Jam llamado \\"Pearl Jam\\" o como quieran \\"The avocado album\\". Realmente es un muy buen disco y uno de los mejores discos mas consistentes despues de mucho tiempo.  <br /> <br />Partiendo con \\"Life wasted\\" (mejor apertura de un disco desde \\"Brain of J\\" de \\"Yield\\") y \\"World wide suicide\\", dos grandes canciones cuyo eje principal es la guerra de Irak y el mal desempe?o del presidente de E.E.U.U., George W. Bush. \\"Comatose\\" es un tema punk con introduccion a lo AC/DC, me parece que es buen tema, al principio no me llamo la atencion, pero despues pienso que hace tiempo no sacaban un tema asi y creo que era el momento. Despues \\"Severed hand\\", para mi personalmente, un sonido Pearl Jam muy nuevo y fresco. \\"Marker in the sand\\" tal vez es uno de los mas comerciales del disco, pero igual es una tema eficaz, aunque el coro sea muy popero. \\"Parachutes\\" un tema que suena muy a The Beatles, y tiene una eficacia muy profundamente sonora y por excelencia. Luego \\"Unemployable\\", un tema bastante Pop, influenciado por R.E.M. y Bruce Springsteen que suena muy bien. \\"Big wave\\" tiene gran dosis de rock, principalmente en el final, no es de los puntos altos del discos, pero tampoco que es debil. \\"Gone\\" es uno de los puntos altos de este disco, ya que tiene una intensidad emotiva y profunda por parte de Eddie Vedder. \\"Wasted reprise\\" el organo se parece mucho la melodia de \\"Red mosquito\\", pero creo que era innecesario ese preludio. \\"Army reserve\\", a pesar de que tiene muy buena letra, pero lejos es el tema mas debil del disco. \\"Come back\\" un blues triste y que funciona muy bien. Y al final, \\"Inside job\\", un tema que al escucharlo me emociona bastante; por la intensidad y abrupto cambio en la cancion, de hecho esta escrito por Mike McCready, que lo hace muy bien, y ademas pienso que es el mejor final de un disco de Pearl Jam desde \\"Indifference\\" en \\"Vs.\\".  <br /> <br />La voz de Eddie Vedder espectacular, agresivo, potente y llega mucho. Matt Cameron en este disco suena muy agresivo la bateria. Gossard y McCready, como siempre imprescindibles; y Jeff Ament solido en el bajo, pero muy bajo perfil.  <br /> <br />Al principio dije que este disco no era de los mejores de Pearl Jam, pero creo que hay que escuchar mas veces este disco y se daran cuenta que a estas alturas del año, es uno de los mejores discos del 2006. Ademas, suena muy potente y agresivamente el sonido que va para mejor.  <br /> <br />Rating: 4.5 estrellas. <br />

B000008ERZ|5.0|This album thrust DAD into the hard rock stratosphere. What happened after is a story for another review. However on the strenth of this disc they were on the crest of a wave.<br /><br />Danish nutters to the core, this band stood outside the North American hard rock scene and it showed. While so many bands circa 1989 were overblown and in for a good time but didn't quite realise how silly they looked, DAD came across as knowing just how ridiculous the whole business was. I mean, this is a band that used to have stuntmen perform mock fights on stage in their early days and pay weird country tinged rock with various 'country' props on stage.<br /><br />But to the heart of this album. The main theme here is driving simplicity. In fact their bass player famously used just two strings for much of the music. The riffs here are great and driving and the singles went straight into the charts in a number of countries. Tunes like Sleeping My Day Away capture youthful zest for partying all night brilliantly. ZCMI and Lords of the Atlas are whimsical with enough bite to keep your toe tapping.<br /><br />Other gems would be Girl Nation, sort of the flagship of DAD's attempt at world domination. Ridiculous lyrics, crazy video and the whole thing just gels somehow. The heaviest track on the album, Ill Will is a right stomper, a couple of minutes of blazing and driving madness, the closest this album comes to outright metal.<br /><br />The vocals of one Jesper Binzer sound suitably beer stained and he certainly attacks these songs with conviction. Production is good, as the record company had thrown a chunk of cash at this band in order to sign them and so didn't stint in this department.<br /><br />This is an album that you can play from one end to the other, perfect for parties with your mates or chugging down the highway. It always brings a smile to my face whenever someone throws it on.
0765309408|5.0|Taught, concise and fast-paced.  I read OMW in one sitting, it's THAT good.  I'll leave the \\"character development\\", \\"plot\\" and \\"pacing\\" comments to the mechanics . . . for me it's just a darned good read.  OMW may make it all the way to my coveted \\"Read over repeatedly\\" category.  Only time will tell.  This book is heartily recommended.
B00005JOVN|2.0|Think you've had a bad day?  Well, you haven't been on board a gigantic ocean liner that's been hit by a rogue tidal wave, capsized, and then is subsequently flooded while the few survivors try desperatly to escape before the big boat plunges to the bottom of the ocean. <br /> <br />Poseidon was (along with the as-of-this-writting, unreleased \\"Snakes on a plane\\") the one big movie that I was looking forward to in 2006.  It had everything going for it.  An incredibly cool trailer, a great concept, state of the art CGI effefts, and a director who has had more then his fair share of water films.  It had everything going for it, and had all the elements of a blockbuster summer action movie. <br /> <br />Alas, it was not to be. <br /> <br />What went away here?  Perhaps it's the pacing and the timing.  A common complaint for Titanic when it came out way back in 1997 is that it took too long to get to the actual sinking.  Here, we get to the sinking in what feels like ten minutes.  In no time flat the boat has been hit by the wave, is upside down, and the escape attempt beings.  After that it's just bang, bang, bang as the film moves from one scene to another, barely giving you any time to catch your breath.   <br /> <br />This is probably the films greatest weakness.  It just moves far too quickly.  As an aspiring film editor, i'm aware that all the elements that don't add to the plot or the action at hand need to be cut out, but I just couldn't help but feel that a LOT of good material was cut out to try and keep the movie going as quickly as possible.  And when you cut out such material, your movie may go faster, but it looses  lot in the process, and I think that's what happened with Poseidon. <br /> <br />One of my favorite aspects of James Cameron's Titanic is that it took the time to introduce it's charachters, build thier relationships and make us care about them.  By doing so, the movie was more gripping as the ship was sinking because we cared about Jack and Rose as the ship sank (I admit it, I cried when Jack turned into a popsicle).  Here, your charachters are nameless generic people (old guy, mom and kid, rouge anti-hero) who's names you forget five seconds after the credits start rolling.  Although the film does try to do some development, it just doesn't work.  I diddn't care for any of our heros (save for Richard Dreyfus, because it's always cool to see elderly people rise up to escape disaster), and I wasn't really sad when any of them died.  I will say this however, Poseidon does bend the rules a bit when it comes to charachter deaths.  Just like the shark film Deep Blue Sea, you never really know who's going to die.  One death in paticular, is given to a charachter who I thought for sure was going to live, and it suprised me when he/she died. <br /> <br />The film isn't helped by the dialogue.  Now, to be fair, it is hard to write dialogue that doesn't sound expositional and i'm sure the scriptwritters tried hard, but the dialoge just sounds...well...artificial.  It's structured in a way that gives us the charachter's background and thier stories while trying to make us care about them.  Sadly, it doesn't work.  There are a few moments where the dialogue is actually silly.  When one of our heros says (in repsponse to the dad heading towards the disco room), \\"What?  You got an urge to dance now?\\"  I couldn't help but raise my hand in the John Travolta disco style, much to the laughter of other people in the theater.  When people in the audience are giggling and laughing at some of what is said on screen in a disaster movie, that can't be a good thing. <br /> <br />In a way, Poseidon is just an excuse to go and watch big things happen on screen.  And this is the film's greatest strength.  It's a visual movie.  It's not a charachter driven epic, rather, it's a big action movie that spent the time and money on the visual effects, and it shows.  From the very cool capsizing sequence to the final plunge of the liner, Poseidon does hit the mark when it comes to great visuals.  Unfortunitly, the best moments are scattered throughout the film (such as the capsizing at the beginning and the final sinking at the end).  The rest of the time, we get pretty good visuals, but these just aren't as spectacular as the big stuff. <br /> <br />Now, inevitably, comparisons are come up between Poseidon and Titanic, and in a way they are to be expected.  Both films are about sinking ships and the people on board.  The sad thing is, Titanic is just better then Poseidon in almost every way.  It's bigger, it has a more epic feel, and it has charachters we care about.  It takes it's time building up to the big event and keeps the flow going nicely without being too quick or too slow. <br /> <br />Sadly, Poseidon has everything backwards.  Poseidon is full of charachters we don't care about, it moves far too quickly and relies more on big visuals over a good story.   <br /> <br />I really don't like giving this movie a low score because I had high hopes for it, and it is clear that Mr. Peterson and his crew put a lot of effort into making it (the design of the sets and the movie are quite good), but it just moves far too quickly and pretty much ignores charachters in favor of big effects. If you do want to see it, go in expecting a (very) fast paced movie that's big on visuals and don't go in expecting gripping charachters and complex relationships.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I bought the CD the day it came out.  I loved it on first listen, but some of the songs did not connect.  I have listened to it many times since and it was still just a great CD.  9 days later now I just listened to the full CD straight through focused with a few drinks in me.  Something has changed.  The drinks helped but it takes time to \\"get\\" any Tool CD.  Listen to all tracks in succession. <br /> <br />I just wanted to say that when I first listen to a new Tool CD I don't pay attention to song names, I just listen. That's why I just reference track #'s in my coming review. <br /> <br />Wow.  Track 7 and 8 blow me away when listened together - didn't get em on the first through the 4th listen.  Now they have come together to form a beautiful, dark composition. <br /> <br />Track 2 and 5 blow the roof off.  These are the songs that keep you involved while you try to figure out the rest.  But they keep you interested intensely as you listen to the rest, waiting for the light to come through.  <br /> <br />Vicarious - Track 1 - still is showing me something new. <br /> <br />Track 10 - Beautiful, intense, surprising <br /> <br />Tool is completely unique, 1 of a kind, and not a band you judge immediately.  They are moving, innovative, and they continue to completely outsmart me.   <br /> <br />You can't pin this CD down, no way, it's too big.  Don't even try to label it.  It doesn't fit a category or a label. <br /> <br />All I know is it is fantastic. <br /> <br />
B00005JLSE|5.0|until I saw this film. And after a hearty viewing with a tummy full of skittles and diet fanta, I have to say this film made me like them a whisper less. Why Navy? you ask. Well, I just don't think Renee is all that. I do love Latifah so I'll give her a pass, because she was probably forced to do this by her agent.<br /><br />Gere is sly and charming as usual. And Zeta Jones is a doll. Man, I wish I could meet her after Michael Douglas passes on. She has everything I like about an actress. That voice? And the figure? What a knockout!

B000002LEM|3.0|I have been going through a renassance as of late really getting back into Sammy. I had this disc when it first came out, sold it, so I rebought it recently. I had made myself a copy of the songs I liked which was only 3*, so I thought maybe after all these years the others would grow on me; well, yes and no.<br /><br />1. Mine All Mine- a good opener, glad to have this song again! Really weird sound through out. The lyrics are forced but can be clever. 8/10<br /><br />2. When It's Love- In a word, yuk. This song is in the vein of Dreams and Why Can't This Be Love, sadly it pales in comparison and has the disadvantage of just being to slow to be the second song. Should have been nearer the end, it drags down this cd set! Regardless,  still isn't a winner. It WOULD be good if the chorus wasn't so damn sappy. 5/10<br /><br />3. A.F.U. (Naturally Wired)- This one is fun but sort of unfocused. I'm not moved but I wouldn't skip it either. 7/10<br /><br />4. Cabo Wabo- I'm going against the grain here but I really hate this song. It's WAAAAY toooo long and says the same thing over and over. IN fact you have heard all it will say in the first minute of this SEVEN minute song. Never dug the whole \\"Mexico drinking scene\\" the Halens got into either. 2.5/10<br /><br />5. Source Of Infection*- Kick it! Blow out! Still love this one! Eddie is almost in 1984 form and Sammy is in there riff'n. Love IT! 8.5/10<br /><br />6. Feels So Good- This one was a pleasant surprise I really like this song. I had forgotten all about it. Love the riff Eddie does through out, MUCH better song than When It's Love. 8/10<br /><br />7. Finish What Ya Started*- Instant classic. Strange about this incarnation of VH. There isn't much in betweens with songs either they work or they don't. This DOES!! Eddie is all over the place, the style is memorable too!! 10/10<br /><br />8. Black And Blue*- Another winner here. Another classic. The lyrics tend to be a bit on the silly side but man, the groove will knock you OUT if you aren't paying attention. I reccommend this while driving:) 9/10<br /><br />9. Sucker In A 3 Piece- Instant throw away. It is \\"fun\\" and Eddie does jam it up, still the song is like something a high school kid would write. Sammy has done MUCH better. 6/10<br /><br />10. A Apolitical Blues- were they under contract to have 10 songs? This song not only is no good but it is difficult to make it through it. I remember hating this one way back when but I thought maybe time would be kind.

B00006879E|2.0|I liked Maroon 5 when I heard \\"Harder to Breathe.\\" \\"This Love\\" was good, just severly overplayed. \\"She Will be Loved\\" is absolutely awful. It's just more of the same boring, bland, pop \\"rock\\" with three or four ok to good songs with the rest as simple, bubble-gum slow pop crap. I've only listened to half of the CD's songs (the rest on the Amazon 30-second samplers), and it's bad. Trust me. It doesn't quite deserve 1-star, because some of the songs aren't terrible. <br /> <br />But only some. <br /> <br />Avoid.
B000EDWL82|3.0|I defy anyone who says they don't sound just like Interpol to play a single to someone who hasn't heard this album, and ask 'em who it is. I have, and both persons asked me where I managed to get ahold of new Interpol. The only differences are the slightly more U2/Edge-like sound of their guitarist, and their tendency to favor more upbeat (that is, dancier) tracks compared to Interpol's unfortunate fondness for boring, dirge-like anthems. But at the same time, the best tracks on this album never come very close to the high-powered creepiness that Interpol occasionally conjures up on their best tracks, such as Roland or PDA. The two lead singers especially sound uncannily alike, right down to their lyrical tendency to intone the same single line over and over again in the hope that it will thereby acquire some kind of poetic gravitas through sheer stubborn repetition. For example, I tried to count the number of times Editors' singer repeated the oft-quoted line in \\"Blood\\" (\\"Blood runs through your veins/That's where our similarity ends\\"), but I lost track around thirty; compare Interpol's \\"Untitled\\" (\\"I will surprise you sometimes...,\\" ad infinitum). Anyway, it's not a bad album overall, but anyone who claims it isn't derivative must be willfully delusional.
B000002TYX|5.0|The Beatles need no introduction when it comes to the elite of Rock/Pop music.   When trying to \\"rank\\" the greatest artists of the Rock/Pop era, there is no doubt that the quartet from England ranks number one on just about every list.   Going even further, the Beatles might be the top act in the history of modern music - among any genre.   Some quarter-century after their breakup, the Beatles began to consider their place in history.  This impetus played a key role in the release of the three volume, \\"Beatles Anthology\\" CD set and corresponding television documentary.    One of the main attractions of this project was that it would bring the three surviving Beatles together for the first time since the famous breakup.    Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr would collaborate together on two unfinished John Lennon songs: \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" - creating a \\"virtual\\" reunion among the four band members.    This three volume set would not be an ordinary greatest hits collection - it would provide a historical retrospective to the band through rare and unreleased material.    It is the first volume, \\"Beatles Anthology 1\\" that covers the early days of the Beatles from their days as the Quarrymen through their material in late 1964 found on their fourth album, \\"Beatles For Sale\\". <br /> <br />As mentioned, this CD serves as a historical retrospective to the band.   The material is arranged in chronological order.    Some of the material is prefaced with spoken words by Lennon, McCartney, and Brian Epstein.  The spoken words help set the stage for the material that is to follow.  Included with the collection is a 46 page booklet that describes each of the tracks.    As for the tracks themselves, these consist of demo cuts, alternative cuts, live cuts, and bootlegs.  One thing that helps is to follow the material in the booklet with the music - using the booklet and music hand-in-hand helps complete the historical experience that this collection provides.   This should not be confused with a traditional \\"Greatest Hits Collection\\".  This is no greatest hits collection: Some of the material consisted of covers and songs that were never heard before.  At the same time, the \\"name\\" songs are all different versions from what is heard in the mainstream.  As a result, this helps enhance the listening experience. <br /> <br />Here are 10 things to look for - in no particular order: <br /> <br />1) \\"Free as a Bird\\" is a good song - it isn't a great one.   There probably wasn't much to choose from to sustain a \\"virtual\\" reunion between the four members of the Beatles.   The engineering of the song isn't bad.   The song will grow on you as you hear it.   It would have been nice if Ringo Starr had gotten a vocal since the other three Beatles got vocals.  It is also worth noting that Harrison's \\"Wilbury\\" partner Jeff Lynne produced the song.  I didn't think this song belonged as the first song, but given the fact that this doesn't fit in with the early material - I'm not sure where this should have been put. <br /> <br />2) George Martin does a masterful job at providing continuity and fusion to the collection.   While he didn't actually produce \\"Free as a Bird\\", he produced the Anthology series as a whole. <br /> <br />3) The \\"Pre-Beatles\\" material is very interesting.   This isn't going to have the best recording quality.  In fact the 1958 Quarrymen cuts from the Phillips studio are going to have some pretty bad quality.  Yet, this is going to add to the whole \\"historical\\" listening experience that this collection provides.    <br /> <br />4) The Quarrymen and early Beatles material consist of a large number of covers.   Some of the more common covers include \\"That'll Be the Day\\" (Buddy Holly), \\"Aint She Sweet\\" (Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps),  and \\"Shout\\" (Isley Brothers).  But perhaps the best one is the Beatles cover of the song made famous by the Coasters - \\"Besame Mucho\\".  This cover stands out and shows a Latin sideto the band that was rarely seen. <br /> <br />5) I was also surprised about the instrumental pieces that were included.  \\"Cayenne\\" and \\"Cry For a Shadow\\" are two instrumentals that are included on this collection.  Both instrumentals stand out. <br /> <br />6) The Tony Sheridan song, \\"My Bonnie\\" is included as well.  It is on this version that features Sheridan on lead vocals and the Beatles supporting him as his band.  Only some shouts by McCartney can be heard on background vocals. <br /> <br />7) There is a very funny comedy skit featuring the Beatles on the British comedy show,  \\"The Morecambe and Wise\\" show.   I can't get enough of when Ringo is referred to as \\"Bongo\\".    This skit has a segue into a very funny version of \\"Moonlight Bay\\".   This shows a lighter side of the band. <br /> <br />8) I would have liked to have seen more of the Ed Sullivan material included on this CD collection. I'm disappointed there isn't Ed himself providing the introduction   It would have made the historical perspective \\"complete\\".  The only \\"Sullivan\\" song included is \\"All My Loving\\". <br /> <br />9) As for the spoken words, I actually would have preferred if more spoken words were included.   The spoken parts that are included serve as a great lead-in - but there are parts that don't have the spoken word add-in. <br /> <br />10) I love some of the unfinished demo cuts.  I heard a disc-jockey in \\"New York\\" so impressed with this collection as he said \\"...and this is the junk!\\"  It's amazing how stuff that didn't make it through editing could sound so good, but in this case it works. <br /> <br />Overall, this is one terrific collection.   I've heard that this collection is not geared toward the novice fan, but I think anyone with an interest in modern music history will appreciate this collection.  This collection is best listened to when you listen to it from start to finish.   I wish more groups would follow this formula for producing retrospectives.  This collection is highly recommended.
B00003CXGG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  True, some of the fight scenes can get cheesy - with too many special effects and fancy camera shots (I'm a fan of just letting 'em duke it out), but in general Jet Li's superb martial arts ability gets fully showcased.  There is a very fun scene of Russell Wong and Jet Li sparring that thankfully doesn't give way to gimmicks.<br /><br />Aaliyah is great.  She had very good chemistry with Jet Li and you can tell they enjoyed working together, plus her songs definitely add to the soundtrack and the movie instead of being distracting (AKA Beyonce's Check on It in the Pink Panther re-make)<br /><br />Isaaiah Washington is great, and while I know he's had several interviews speaking out against playing the stereotypical 'gangsta' role, he does it well here, with a smoothness not often seen.<br /><br />Russell Wong is Awesome.  Enough said.<br /><br />In summary, it's a good movie and well worth the time and money spent.  I very much recommend it.
6304936303|4.0|The Last Boy Scout, is one of the last and greatest 1980s-style action movies.  In my mind, it is to 80s action movies what The Wild Bunch was to Westerns: it's a marks the end of an era--with a bang.   <br /> <br />Bristling with gunfights, explosions, wisecracks, vulgarity and testosterone, it's definitely a guy's movie, the kind of movie that probably couldn't be made today due to Hollywood's obssession with \\"girl power!\\" and political correctness. <br /> <br />Featuring 3-dimensional main characters who struggle with their inner demons while struggling with the bad guys, The Last Boy Scout remains an entertaining movie, even upon multiple viewings. <br />
B000069KGM|5.0|Listening to this would make me want to protest to have all the acetates, and possible recorded material they may have had when they started out as \\"The Big Thing\\" in 1967. This is probably what Blood Sweat and Tears would've wanted to sound like. I feel that they sounded good without the guitars being at the forefront, but it really makes a positive first impression. This is free form rock, blues, and jazz at it's best. From the beginning of \\"Introduction\\" to the finale of the epic \\"Liberation\\". Some do stand out for special merit with me though such as their cover of \\"I'm A Man\\" which blows the Spencer Davis version off the stage, then there's \\"Free Form Guitar\\" What would Hendrix say if he had heard this? \\"Listen\\" should've been top 40, but I guess it was too rock for the pop squares. Not knocking \\"Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?\\" because it has a beautiful introduction that gets axed, so it could be made into a single, and \\"Beginnings\\" has a terrific jam in the middle where about 3 and a half minutes got hacked off, so another hit single could be done. However, with \\"Listen\\" nothing was sacrificed, and it lasted long enough to be a single, but labels what do they know? Finally I would give \\"Prologue Aug.29,1968\\" the final recognition as it sounds like the band used actually recording of the democratic convention that went on there that year, and made it sound ominous with the music, and words that were penned to this track. Chicago is a great band, but this was the best of all the albums released.
B000002P5R|4.0|\\"In 1994, Hendrix's own handwritten track selection for First Ray surfaced and was reprinted in the french magazine Folk & Rock (November 1994).  Surprisingly it was never used when attempts were made to complete the unfinished project in the years that followed.  Hendrix only completed a song list for three sides of the double LP, and wasn't sure where to place the track \\"Night Bird Flying\\".  With a darker-colored pen, he seemed to indicate that it should be the second song on side A.  Hendrix's track selection for First Ray of the New Rising Sun was: <br /> <br />Side A: Dolly Dagger, Night Bird Flying, Room Full of Mirrors, Belly Button Window, Freedom. <br /> <br />Side B: Easy Rider, Astro Man, Drifting, Straight Ahead. <br /> <br />Side C: Drifter's Escape, Comin' Down Hard On Me, Beginnings, Cherokee Mist, Angel.\\" <br /> <br />The above and any other quotes in this post are taken from the book, \\"Black Gold the Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix\\" by Steven Roby. <br /> <br />The album is refered to above as First Ray instead of First Rays because Jimi at first was going to call it First Ray of the New Rising Sun.  Another quote from Black Gold: <br /> <br />\\"Billy Cox worked on the unfinished album, and recalled the time when Hendrix asked him about the correct wording: \\"He asked me, 'Is it the first ray, or the rays?'  I said, 'I don't know.  He said, 'What do you see when you get up in the morning?  When you look over the horizon do you see one ray or rays?'  I said, 'I'd have to check that out.' <br /> <br />Hendrix would seem to have had a cover for the album in mind too...another quote: <br /> <br />\\"There is also evidence that Hendrix may have had a cover in mind for the release.  On September 17th, 1970, he sketched out various faces to form the shape of a cross, with his own face in the middle.  The right arm of the cross had faces of white people, including J.F.K. and Hitler and two women and a baby.  On the left arm of the cross was Martin Luther King, Jr., a black woman with a crown, an African woman, and a baby.  On the bottom shaft, Crazy Horse, Geronimo, Cochise, two women and a baby represented Native Americans.  Above Hendrix's head, the top shaft of the cross showed Buddha, Genghis Khan, a Japanese woman, and a Chinese baby, representing the Asian Peoples.\\" <br /> <br />I like this CD and gave it 4/5 stars.  But knowing that there are existing track listings by Hendrix out there I tend to wish they had tried to stay closer to the song orders he had chosen (Of course Jimi might have made many changes to those song orders before the album was completed). <br /> <br />Since these days most people can make their own CDs I would probably arrange a version (for my own listening pleasure) to look something like this: <br /> <br />Dolly Dagger  <br />Night Bird Flying <br />Room Full of Mirrors <br />Belly Button Window <br />Freedom <br />Easy Rider  <br />Astro Man <br />Drifting <br />Straight Ahead <br />Drifter's Escape (Can be found on the CD South Saturn Delta) <br />Comin' Down Hard On Me (Can be found on the Hendrix box set) <br />Beginnings <br />Here He Comes (Lover Man) (Can be found on South Saturn Delta) <br />Angel <br />Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)  <br />Stepping Stone <br />Izabella <br />Earth Blues <br />In From The Storm <br /> <br />Approximate CD time = 79 minutes <br /> <br />Since the only version of Cherokee Mist I have heard is on the Box Set and has simliar patterns to that of In From The Storm I left it off.  I left off My Friend since it was a leftover track from 1968.  For those who are into having an instrumental open the album there is a spacey guitar instrumental called The New Rising Sun on the now deleted Hendrix CD compilation Voodoo Soup...I just wasn't sure how to fit it in due to space limitations.  Pali Gap is also a track that could have been on the album as it was recorded during the same time period.  Of course everyone's version of this album would probably be different (including Jimi's). <br /> <br />I could go on and on about this but I guess the bottom line is I like the music on this album very much I just wish it could have somehow stayed closer to Jimi's vision... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira caught my attention a few years back with \\"Laundry Service\\" and I also got into her Spanish music.  This new cd \\"Oral Fixation 2\\" is simply amazing.  It is very very unique and heart felt.  Some people say her emotions aren't always present in her English albums but I beg to differ.  I also really enjoy listening to this music/lyrics because I know Shakira wrote the lyrics/music herself.  This makes an album more emotional and worth buying.  Haunting music and backgrounds as in \\"How Do You Do\\" are outstanding.  I recommend this album for anyone who is willing to try a new category in music.  Here is a breakdown: <br /> <br />How Do You Do- 5/5 <br />Don't Bother- 4/5 <br />Illegal- 3.5/5 <br />The Day and the Time- 4/5 <br />Animal City- 5/5 <br />Dreams for Plans- 3.5/5 <br />Hey You- 4/5 <br />Your Embrace- 3.5/5 <br />Costume Makes the Clown- 4/5 <br />Something- 3.5/5 <br />Timor- 5/5 <br />Hips Don't Lie- 4.5/5
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Little Sam below might need to clean the poop out of his ears, but 1st he might need to pull his head out of his tush. What does a fourteen year old kid know anyway? ;-). This band, with this record, not only single handedly revitalized the hard rock/ metal genre (which was on life support at best), they raised the bar considerably. Additionally,  it is widely considered gospel that Edward is one of the most brilliant guitar stylists to ever practice the art form. Nothing distinctive?? This band had massive raw talent -  buckets of chops, character & attitude...all the natural gifts that make for truly great bands; enough so that they were emulated by scores of bands in the 80's & still have a tremendous, lasting impact. The tunes; the guitar sounds; the ferocious, soulful playing ; the showbiz saavy...please! This is just as classic as it gets. Of course Hendrix & Page are brilliant musicians but to many, MANY fans & players, Edward & Co. RULE.
B000002LCD|3.0|Who's That Girl?...well was a very diffirent movie and soundtrack.....the only reason I purchased this was for Who's That Girl?,Causing A Commotion,and The Look Of Love......Who's That Girl is Madonna's greatest song she has ever recorded...I wish she would still sing this one at her shows..following Causing A Commotion as well.........This is the type of material I wish Madonna would still make.
B000000OU0|5.0|Hell Freezes Over has to be one of the best reunion albums ever made.  After a band breaks up, it is rare to get \\"the sound\\" back.  The Eagles not only still have their \\"sound\\", but have added a distinct maturity to that sound.  They did have a few new recordings on this album, \\"New York Minute\\", \\"Learn To Be Still\\", \\"Get Over It\\", \\"The Girl From Yesterday\\", and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" that were pretty good.  I don't care for \\"Get Over It\\" as an Eagle song, not that it isn't good, it is just a new sound for the Eagles.  \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" was more of the Eagles style - a smooth ballad type song.  In comparison would be \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\", also the smooth flowing ballad type song. <br />Their (the band's) other songs from the past were done in their usual excellence.  \\"Hotel California\\", their most famous song, is probably the best on the album.  I really liked the instrumental music they added before going into the song.  It gives one a \\"taste\\" of what is to come.  And just when you think a song is flawless, it gets better - Now THAT IS TALENT!   <br />Many of the lyrics are consistent ballad type songs on this album.  And it is a must for any Eagle/ballad music lover.  Just for the simple fact the band said they would never get together again is reason to give this album a listen. <br />Another release by the Eagles, \\"The Long Run\\" is an excellent album as well.  A song that became a favorite from this album was \\"Sad Cafe\\" because of the sultry sound of the saxaphone. <br />In trying to compare another group to the Eagles, I found few.  But a band from the 70's come as close as I can find - \\"America\\".
B00004D3C1|5.0|King of The Road, is an album that you don't once stop and think to press next song. Every track on here is at least half decent. The first track \\"Hell on Wheels\\" basically sums up what you're about to hear, and thats good if you like old school metal guitar solos, and super enthusiastic, mediocore vocals. Scott Hill does a great job matching the garage rock sound with his, very unpolished singing. After the first track, \\"Over the edge\\" is the second song, and if their was to be a weak track I'd have to pick this. The next two tracks are \\"Boogie Van\\" and \\"King of the Road\\". \\"Boogie Van\\" talks about those old shag-carpedted vans, and has a pretty sweet riff. \\"King of the Road\\" is a pretty good track, and one you dont want to listen to while you're driving, unless you want a speeding ticket. The next three tracks, carry the sound of the disc well, until the song \\"Weird Beard\\". Probably my favourite  track, it has a super catchy riff, and from what I can tell is about a weird beard. It also pauses throughout the song, to an old man just saying \\"Weird Beard\\" which is kinda different. \\"Drive\\" and \\"Hotdoggin\\" are the third and second last songs, before the final track, a Devo cover \\"Freedom of Choice\\" which is a pretty decent interpretation of a good track. Overall this is an awesome CD and I suggest \\"buying 2\\" and putting one in the car for long road trips across the freeway.
B000000NN1|3.0|I suppose that with a title like HEAVEN AND HELL, one should expect some ups and down. I did in terms of enjoyment and in terms of interest.  <br /> <br />I am not a stranger to long pieces. I like classical music. I got turned on to Mike Oldfield in 1979. I even remember having a Vangelis 8 track back then but I don't remember what it was called. Vangelis too, seems to specialize in long, symphonic type compositions. With any such long work, though, the artist is bound to hit ups and downs in terms of interest. This one certainly does but the ups are not very far up. <br /> <br />Criticism aside, the artist is effective at capturing his \\"theme\\". He manages to portray, musically, the tension between good and evil. There are even a few delightful tidbits in which they might be confused for a few brief moments. <br /> <br />This will appeal mostly to those who like electronica. I do, sometimes. I am willing to give him another try sometime but he is not at the top of my list. <br />
1592401791|4.0|Just when you thought every book about the Beatles had been written Geoff Emerick's excellent summation of his career working with the band Here, There and Everywhere appears. Emerick as many long time Beatle fans know was an engineer at EMI and replaced Norman Smith as George Martin's right hand man after assisting Smith on such recordings as \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week\\". Focusing much more on the music and the way the Beatles classic recordings were made, \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" will delight many Beatle fans. Filled with trivia about the creation of the band's albums and singles Emerick's book provides an insider and outsider perspective of working with the Beatles. The book begins with Emerick's interest in music as a child. A talented piano player Emerick gravitated towards music engineer and earned employment at EMI working as an assistant in many different departments.<br /><br />Emerick doesn't hold back on expressing his opinion about the band's members, how they treated him and how he, Martin and the band came up with all the unique approaches to recording their music. George Harrison is in the crosshairs on occasion. Emerick points out that Harrison wasn't a confident guitarist and would flub his solos having to re-record them over and over again. He suggests that George was a dedicated player as well becoming better with time. He also points out that George's early songs couldn't compare to Lennon and McCartney's originals. Nevertheless when Harrison is in top form such as his stunning solos on \\"Abbey Road\\" or the top notch song \\"Taxman\\" Emerick is generous with his praise. Likewise he expresses his opinions about some of the other engineers he worked with including producer Chris Thomas (it's pretty obvious he didn't care for him all that much).<br /><br />While you could question some of Emerick's observations about Harrison and Starr they are his opinions right or wrong with time's errors filling in the cracks of memory. Overall Emerick does a credible job with providing us insight into the band's work in the studio. It's clear he got a long better with Paul than anyone else (he's appeared on many of Paul's solo recordings as well as having McCartney be best man at his wedding)and that's probably shaped his perception but it's the info on the band's studio recordings that's the most fascinating.<br /><br />It seems that Lennon for all his brilliance could be a pain in the rear and a jerk. He could also be the most sensitive guy in the room when he was in a good mood. McCartney despite his controlling tendencies kept the group as defacto leader while Lennon fell into the grip of drug use and increasing disinterest. Emerick doesn't discuss the White Album sessions all that much because he was absent for much of that and \\"Let It Be\\" when as the relationships within the group deterioated.<br /><br />There are many mistakes in the book however and I'm not sure if this is due to issues with Emerick's memory or the co-writer of the book. Beatles engineer Ken Scott (who worked on everything from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" to \\"The Beatles\\") noted some of these mistakes in his online blog and notified Emerick about some of the mistakes. Emerick also makes some pretty nasty comments about producer Chris Thomas who worked on \\"The Beatles\\" as well while George Martin was on vacation which seem unnecessary. That said, Emerick does still share a number of interesting tidbits.<br /><br />Emerick also discusses working on McCartney's \\"Band on the Run\\" as well as the Anthology sessions. It's a fascinating book and puts to rest some disputes (Emerick sides with Lennon stating that Lennon came up with the idea for the backwards vocals at the conclusion of \\"Rain\\" whereas Martin stated it was his idea)and opens up others (Emerick claims that \\"I am the Walrus\\" can't compare to \\"A Day in the Life\\" or even \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and is quite ponderous). It's an enjoyable book and also relates working with Judy Garland and other music giants but the main focus is, not surprisingly, the fab four from Liverpool. There aren't any photos outside of those that decorate the jacket of the book. I was hoping for somemore rare pictures of the band working in the studio. A fine book with a insightful introduction by Elvis Costello (Emerick co-produced EC's \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" and \\"All This Useless Beauty\\")Emerick's book is a welcome addition to Beatles lore.cus is, not surprisingly, the fab four from Liverpool.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are growing up, and, like fine wine, they have only approved with age.  There is a maturity about this album that was touched in Californication, experimented with in By the Way, and brought fully to fruition in Stadium Arcadium.  There is also funk, something that many complained was lacking from their previous two releases.  No, it isn't the \\"rocking the socks\\" funk-punk of the late 80s and early nineties; it is a fuller sound that pulls you into a groove and supplements your mood with elation.  John Frusciante shows what years of practice and learning can do to a musician.  We've always known him as an amazing guitarist, but he really outdoes himself on this CD.  There are solos enough to satiate the hunger of those harking back to the 1960s revered psychedelia, but they never go on to long and are always in good taste (they are not there just to say, \\"look at me, I'm a guitar solo\\" - the have a point and drive the song somewhere).  In fact, the solos should leave you feeling satisfied and yet wishing you could have more - much like a good dinner where you eat your fill and know that one more bite will be too much, but you still want that extra bite because of how tasty the meal was.  What is more amazing, however, is John's development as a vocalist.  He adds a warmth and depth that perfectly compliments Anthony's voice, and his harmonies verge on being symphonic to epic extremes.  You will at times be knocked over with a barrage of sound, and at other times stroked with the faintest quiver.  On that note, Anthony Kiedis is amazing.  His voice has really grown and his words are beautiful and inspiring.  No, you aren't going to here anything as blatant as \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" or \\"Special Secret Song Inside\\" (although, if you listen carefully, he does use some metaphors that are definitely referring to actions that are usually done in private in a bedroom), but his poetry is full of wisdom and hope.  Flea is flea.  His bass is solid, his groove is steady, and his blend with Chad and John is like a tight stitch.  He is a master of his instrument.  He is always tasteful: the perfect lick, the exact right amount of notes.  He shows on occasion that he hasn't forgotten how to slap; he would just prefer express himself using the idea of \\"why use a thousand notes when one is enough.\\"  Chad is solid.  He locks into the bass guitar with his kick drum, accenting the beat so that it is hard not to move your body.  He has an understanding of the music and is not seeking to stand out as much as he is seeking to make the music fit together like a well made lock.  This CD should be listened to in its entirely and it should not be used for background music until you are familiar with it.  There is so much to hear.  Listen with good speakers or good headphones.  Don't use 128kbps mp3s.  It is beautifully recorded (all analog tape) - unlike many CDs that are quickly thrown together and the fastest recording/mixing techniques are used, this one was obviously crafted like a sculptor works his or her clay.  Stadium Arcadium takes the best attributes of the previous Chili Pepper's CDs, matures the sound, adds new lessons learned to it, and ultimately leaves the listener feeling elated and fulfilled.  This CD is worth buying.  It is worth having for your very own.  It is the best the Chili Peppers have done to date.
B0002S947K|5.0|I first heard this CD playing at a bookstore/ multi media store which will go unnamed. I stopped in my book buying tracks,convinced I was hearing Terry Reid singing an obscure Van Morrison out take from Astral Weeks with David Lindley playing fiddle . For maybe the second time in my life I actually asked a counter person to find out who the singer was playing over the store's sound system. That's how I came to buy this CD. Now...It's damning with faint praise to say I love this record because it sounds like (A) Terry Reid {circa 1972} (B) Van Morrison {circa 1970} (C) The Band with Richard Manuel (circa anytime). I don't care if Ray's not \\"exactly original\\". This is great stuff ,and it's \\"exactly\\" the kind of soulful folk/soul ,that the artists I've namechecked above did so well themselves. Very few current recording artists can pull off this kind of music with the style and ease Ray La Montagne so effortlessly does here. One suggestion for his next effort might be to ,maybe just for fun, rock out a bit,since this cat\\"s got the pipes to do anything. Hihgly reccommended. Derivative? Sure! But he's pickin' cherries from a fine old tree.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I gave up on them after Yield.  Even then I was just buying them because I didn't want to let go of a band I thought was incredible.  Well this is the cd I have been waiting for.  I liked the first single and read the reviews, bit the bullet and well...I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />This is a great cd.  The first half is heavier than the second.  But unlike some of PJ's more recent offerings, the heavy stuff is much more melodic and catchy.  The second half is even better in my opinion.  And that last song...WOW.  It's beautiful. <br /> <br />This is a great cd that gives me what I thought was missing from the last 4 PJ releases.  It has the vocals.  And I think a few of the guitar parts are some their best. <br /> <br />I think it's a great cd.  Welcome back Pearl Jam.
B00005JOVN|3.0|I must say that the acting is average at best, though Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell try to elevate it, and the dialogue is below average. Emmy Rossum is pretty bad here, but at least she looks good. If you go to a movie about a ship that flips over due to a 100 foot wave that pops up out of nowhere, leaving people trying to make it the top (actual bottom) of the ship, are you really expecting good acting and dialogue? The special effects are good, but I still can't figure out where the 160 million dollar budget went. It is fast paced and entertaining at times. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back when I left the theater, but then again I knew what to expect going in. Can't wait to see The Da Vinci Code, X-Men III, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2. It's gonna be a fun summer at the movies!
B000EHRVPQ|1.0|I give this \\"movie\\" one star just for big director's struggle to make it as dark as possible. <br />Other than that this piece of junk will give you nothing because it is about nothing and is a complete waste of time to watch or waste of money should you decide to purchase it. <br />You can not expect anything out of it except perhaps mixed emotions. <br />Nevertheless it is very hard to not to believe that this movie is just a dumb propagandistic outrage. Especially for those to whom Slovakia is the mother land. How otherwise would one explain why most of the shooting was done in Czech Republic while the movie says it is in Slovakia? It may also convince less knowledgeable audience that once foreign visitors make it through the border they will most likely get laid by horny domestic females waiting for nothing more than western cocks. Not to mention kids begging for the treat and butchery being done legally under supervision of police. <br />Politicaly this movie is completely out of track and from film lover's view it is trying hard but failing in all aspects of good film-making. Or perhaps it is failing fading star of film-makers who are not capable of creating anything better than this. <br />Should you not believe you are welcomed to come see for yourself. Do not worry no one will have you for the dinner! And girls? Sure they have lot more cultured things to do than hunt for horny foreigners. <br />Oh, and movie? You can forget about this one! You will get to see lot more enriching and cultured piece at one of the many Slovakia's film clubs!
B000C65Z1G|3.0|This movie is not for a person who has a short attention span. It does take a little time for this story to develop. If you are short of patience, you may be aggravated by the time it does. All in all the conspiracy of the drug company and the twist at the end of the movie made it a decent movie despite there being a lack of interest in the first 40-50 minutes.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" on stage three times--in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, the latter being one of Michael Crawford's last performances.  For some reason, I did not catch the film version when it was in theatres, but saw it a week ago via On Demand on HBO.  To be honest, I had been aware of some of the negative reviews, but I must say, this film is utterly amazing!  In my opinion, the only negative is Carlotta, the diva, whose part I felt was TOO over the top. I do not recall this part being so overblown in the stage versions.  I do not necessarily blame Minnie Driver, as her performance is probably what the director wanted.  All the rest of the roles were cast, acted, and sung to perfection. Emmy Rossum is perfect as Christine.  She brings an appropriate aura of naivet? and vulnerability to her role, and her vocal quality is also appropriate: youthful, promising, but not yet fully operatic.  We can really believe that she has the potential to blossom under the Phantom's tutelage.  Patrick Wilson's lyric tenor is ideal for the romantic hero role of Raoul.  But the movie truly belongs to Gerard Butler, who is an absolute revelation as the Phantom.  Director Joel Schumacher's decision to make the lead actors young (to attract a more youthful audience, as he and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber admitted) works very well indeed on film. Butler's edgy, passionate, and emotional singing, as well as his strikingly masculine looks makes the contrast between him and Raoul clearer for both Christine and the audience.  In every scene with Gerard Butler, he is the irresistible focal point, which is as it should be, since The Phantom is the titular character.  Because Butler plays up the Phantom's magnetic sensuality, we can really believe that Christine is mesmerized by his seductive powers.<br /><br />  The film looks fantastic.  The device of opening and closing the story with the grainy, black and white sequences with the aged, wheelchair-bound Vicomte Chagny works well, and the dramatic change from B&W to color as the theme music plays and the chandelier rises at the beginning is thrilling, to say the least. The Phantom's lair and the tunnels and catacombs leading to it were wonderfully conceived and lit.  The flickering candelabras emerging from the water were an impressive effect.  The huge orchestral accompaniment sounds marvelous.  Because I missed seeing the movie in a theater, I feel fortunate that I was able to watch it on our big plasma screen and hear the score on our surround speakers.  Yes, it's true--after having seen the movie on HBO's On Demand, I ordered the 2-disc DVD set from Amazon.  I recommend this version to anyone who has not bought the DVD yet, since the extras are quite interesting.  Schumacher and Webber discuss the musical's original conception and the casting for the movie version.  It had been a number of years since I last saw POTO onstage, and now as I watch clips from Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, I can really see why Schumacher insisted on casting younger actors for the lead roles.  In fact, as the clips of Crawford/Brightman played, I could hear how different their voices were, and how differently they acted the lead roles and to be honest,  Butler/Rossum bring a new flavor to the movie.  Their chemistry simply sizzles, and when they light up the screen together, you can see why Webber and Schumacher chose them.<br /><br />I have owned and played the London cast recording of the stage POTO for many, many years, but now, I find it disconcerting to listen to the discs, as Butler, Rossum, and Wilson have truly put their mark on the well-loved music of the night.  Kudos and Bravo to all!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|So, every Pearl Jam album since \\"No Code\\" has been accompanied by some media blitz of indeterminate size proclaiming that the band sounds 'refreshed' and 'ready to rock again.'  With this, the release of their 8th album, the buzz has been a little bit different.  As anyone who follows such things has probably already heard, this time the blitz has been tagged with phrases such as \\"comeback album,\\" effectively saying, \\"no really-this time we mean it!\\"      Fortunately, the rumors are true.  After the disappointing \\"Riot Act,\\" I was ready to write the band off for good.  If this album was as mediocre as its predecessors, I was done caring and done listening. I'll just say up front that my faith in the band is renewed.    For most, the band's first 3 albums are considered the gold standard when it comes to Pearl Jam.  I'm more a fan of their Jack Irons-era material.  While their passion and power on the first two albums is undeniable, I find the production to be hit or miss, and the lyrical content to be mostly a self-centered, self righteous rehashing of melodramatic teenage baggage.  Like I said, still powerful, but its magic starts to fade after a while.      Anyway, enough context: on to the music.  Probably the best compliment I can give this album, then, is that is makes me think of all the best elements of each of pearl jam's various phases.  The raw power and amazing soloing of the first two albums; the classic-rock-meets-punk-rock hooks of vitalogy, the lyrical introspection and maturity of No Code, Yield, and moments of the later albums, and the musical complexity of Binaural and Riot Act (though more restrained, here).  It's fitting, then, that the album is self-titled: the album sums up and plays to all of their various strengths.    And yet somehow surpasses them, in the process.  It's wonderful to see the band members writing *together* again, and the collaborations turned out many of the best tracks, such as the mccready/gossard guitar fury of \\"Comatose\\"(featuring probably the best 'speed metal' solo mccready's ever done), or the surprinsgly powerful closing tune \\"inside job,\\" with lyrics penned by McCready and the music co-authored by Vedder and McCready (and featuring a glorious closing guitar solo by the latter).  There's a real synergy between the lyrical themes and the music on this album, the band showing a greater attention to dynamics.  McCready's soloing, in particular, shows an amazing combination of lyrical flourish and virtuosic flair.    Lyrically, Vedder tackles many of his favorite themes (love, loss/death, war, and, uh, republicans), but hasn't sounded as empathetic doing so since, well, ever.  The killjoy self-superiority of \\"bu$hleaguer\\" has given way to songs that identify with protagonists feeling the effects of the bush presidency.  Pardon the stereotyping, but the fact that many of these protagonists are people likely to vote republican (the 'jesus saves' ring-wearer in \\"Unemployable,\\" or the soldier/reservist's families in \\"Army Reserve\\" and \\"World Wide Suicide\\") isn't lost on the listener.  Rather than firing shots at the right with tired quips and cliches that never get more specific that condemning \\"greed\\" (especially laughable for a band now charging in excess of $50 for a concert ticket), vedder's lyrics simply paint portraits, most of the time leaving the conclusion drawing to the listener (not so fast \\"World Wide Suicide!\\").  While I think Vedder's a first-class songwriter, I think sometimes in the past he's let his considerable charisma do a lot of his heavy lifting.  Here he shows real development as a writer, using imagery and character sketches better than he has before.  Whereas a song like \\"Marker in the Sand,\\" that (quite literally) calls god out, could fit thematically with the joyless sounds of a band receding into itself (as on other recent albums), here it's an affirmation, a declaration of intent for a band intent on re-engaging with the world (complete with church-organ backing by Boom Gaspar).     Likewise, Vedder pours himself into his vocal performances in a way he hasn't done since Vs. or Vitalogy.  The telltale sign of this is the return of his signature \\"whoa\\"s and \\"yeah\\"s (this can be either a blessing or a curse, but at least proves that the dude's passionate about what he's singing, once again).  Vedder's voice at 41 certainly isn't what it was at 27, but he comes close.  While Riot Act had vedder staying mostly in baritone or 'do the evolution' growl, here you'll hear him attempt the timbre and passion from songs like 'Alive' and 'Given to Fly.'  Again, the range and force isn't quite the same, but Vedder has learned enough in the intervening years about how and when to use his voice that it more than makes up for it.  Furthermore, utilizing his (more captivating) upper register makes his baritone, when used, more effective (as in the Pete-Townshend copping \\"Gone\\").    To sum up, this is easily Pearl Jam's finest effort in a decade, and perhaps ever.  Not just for hardcore fans, I hope everyone gets a chance to hear this record.
B000255LNE|5.0|One thing is for sure. Phil Collins is the most talented musician of our time.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|all I can say is that i was blown away by these two disks upon first listen. Im not the biggest chili peppers fan in the world, but this is some damn good music thats better than californication, and up there with blood sugar sex magic. im not going into an in-depth review, but all i can say is that this is the best music release this year thus far. and prob will not be topped. this made me a bigger fan of the chili peppers. what a  great record
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes are an excellent part of the New York music scene. There first album, \\"Is This It\\" is one of the best debuts of all time, in the vein of Ten, The Clash, and The Ramones.  <br />   Room On Fire is the second album from the Strokes, and manages to improve on Is This It in nearly every way. The battle of lead guitar vs. rhythm guitar rages throughout the album as Casablancas' vocals echo melodically over the dueling strings. Lead and rhythm play extraordinally well off of each other throughout the entire album, with melodies echoed by one another and contrasting riffs coming together to almost paint a picture.  <br />   With help from singles \\"Reptilia\\" and \\"12:51\\", the Strokes have put together a solid album, full of catchy riffs and rhythms. Tracks such as \\"Meet Me In the Bathroom\\" combine deep guitar with resonant vocals to create a song that sounds like a cross between the Killers and the Clash. \\"The End Has No End\\" commands attention with a raucous intro, building to an energetic chorus. <br />   If you aren't a fan of the Garage Rock genre, you my find a lack of variation. Most songs on the album follow a formula of intro, chorus, solo, but they do it so well. Room On Fire is a modern classic that should be enjoyed by everyone.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|First off, Nobody, and I mean NOBODY should be reviewing this album if you havent listened to it at least 4 times through. Pick any one of the last 8 albums they've put out and think back to when you first purchased it or started listening to it. I know for me I generally like a few songs on the album at first, then a handful, and sometime later I love the whole thing in its entirety. Furthermore, my favorite songs on a fresh RHCP album when i first start listening to it are the ones I most rarely listen to a year, a month, and even a week down the line. By that point, I have evolved, if you will, with the album. <br /> <br />Those of you who have purchased even their last 3 albums know this feeling. This is what makes this group so f*cking good, and particularly what makes their albums so good, respectively. If you think about it, the songs that you like instantly (regardless of the band) are the songs that don't stand the test of time for you. The songs that you always used to skip over or the ones that took you as many as 50 listens to like are the ones you end up loving the most down the line. This goes for albums too. My point is that, like every other one of their 7 PLATINUM ALBUMS, you evolve with the album. A lot of these negative reviews are speaking in the moment, and lack the proper hinesight needed to see that they too will LOVE this album in as soon as a couple weeks if they continue to listen. Great bands and great albums do not strike you as amazing at first. To me, what makes a great album is one that you can listen to 5, 10, 20 years after you first heard it. IF an album is good enough to keep getting played, then you get to the sentimentality part of it, a point that some of these reviewers have unknowingly hit on and that I'd like to address... <br /> <br />BSSM and Mother's Milk, amongst other past favorites are amazing to those of us who have been listening to them for so long, NOT ONLY because they are amazing albums, but because the music is so good that we have continued to listen to the album--many of us frequently--for so many years. The level of sentimentality an album such as Blood Sugar Sex Magik has to us simply cannot be attained in even as many as 3 or 4 years, in my opinion. Perhaps that is why Californication, By The Way, One Hot Minute don't strike as much of a fancy for me than does BSSM. But in my case I also don't listen to these 3 as much as BSSM (I've been listening to that album quite frequently for 15 years). This still amazes me. Is it the music I love so much or what was happening while it was played? Probably both. <br /> <br />The reviews of this album are going to look a lot different in a year from now than they look today. I think they'll keep getting better (if at all possible). Will we still be reviewing this album in 15 years? I think so. I just went to the BSSM page on Amazon and it continues to get reviews by those who bought it 15 years ago (there were 5 reviews this week alone). Amazing. <br /> <br />I have been listening to Stadium Arcadium continuously for the past 3 days, for an average of 5 or 6 hours a day, so I 've heard it now probably 7 times through. My favorite songs 3 days ago are not my favorites now. I'm hearing things in songs I didn't hear 3 days ago. AND THIS IS JUST AFTER 3 DAYS!!! I can't seem to stop listening to it because each day I'm finding 3 or 4 more songs that I like a lot, and everything else in between continues to get better. You get my point. Based on what is happening so far I'd guess that in a month I will love the entire album song for song. <br /> <br />Regarding the actual content, I've read a lot of reviews that interpreted many of the songs on this album as \\"ballads\\". THERE ARE ONLY 4 BALLADS ON THIS ALBUM. The album seemed a lot softer and melodic to me as well at first, but let me attempt to provide one explanation for this... <br /> <br />AK's voice has gotten BETTER and BETTER over the years, and is best on this album. It has always been good, but now I think it carries many of these songs more so than it did before. I'm not sure of the degree to which the production has influenced this (no doubt some). The production alone emphasizes his voice (volume in proportion to other inputs, etc...) on a lot of this album. I think this is why many of us are getting the ballad effect. Some of these songs come across more as ballads because his voice has more range and tone now, as opposed to the more monotonish, almost rapping that was prevalent on many of the earlier albums, but also because of the production emphasis on his voice now. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there are songs on here that rock just as hard as The Greeting Song and Naked in the Rain, they are just fewer in ratio to the total amount of songs. And there is SOOOOO much material here. I dont think we realize this either. I'm starting to realize the depth of this album more and more now. They could have made an album that rocked a lot harder and louder by picking a certain 10 songs on here and making an album with just those songs. On the other hand, they could have taken a different 10 songs and made a completely different sounding album. It's too early for me to even comment on the variance of style here, but I think it is substantial. There's quite a range of different sounding stuff on here, and I believe this will become more and more apparent with time and more listens. <br /> <br />On a final note I'd like to comment on the lyrics, which I believe regardless of the musical group, often take a backseat to the music itself. Will you all please take a little time and listen particularly to the lyrics? If you cant hear them, go to a site and read some. The poetry is fantastic, and the content and message screams Red Hot Chili Peppers. I have'nt heard enough to even comment on any particular themes, but theres interesting stuff being said here. <br /> <br />PS- \\"She's only 18\\" might be the best name for a song I've ever heard. <br/> <br />Be patient, don't jump to conclusions, and keep listening...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Science Fiction genre of movies.  They usually feature terrible acting and cheap special effects.  Fortunately, Serenity does not suffer from either of these problems.  Serenity has a great plot, good acting and great special effects.
B000002BFZ|3.0|What to make of the record that started Pearl Jam's commercial downfall? Did they artistically rise above previous commercial fare to create a record just to challenging for mere mortals to understand? Or is No Code just a weak Pearl Jam record compared to previous releases? The answer is yes to both.<br /><br />On No Code, songs such as Present Tense and Off He Goes present Pearl Jam stretching, ripping apart and putting back together their sound, showing the band had the balls to grow as musicians after a long period of commercial success. But while creative growth is impressive it also does not ensure a good album.<br /><br />The Pearl Jam on No Code seems to shrug off one of the band's previous greatest qualities and that was there passion to play. Even on supposed rockers such as Red Mosquito, the band's previous energy seems lacking, as if in the process of trying to be impressive while recording the album they forgot how to rock.<br /><br />The best example of this is Hail, Hail, on the band's live record Live on Two Legs the song jumps off the speakers with a brimming energy that makes it a highlight of a record chock full of early 90's Pearl Jam hits such as Daughter. The recorded version however seems sludgy and uninspired and doesn't hint enough at the rich guitar-riffs being played.<br /><br />Throughout No Code the band seems to be striving for creative breakthroughs that sometime work, but has the overall impact of tampering with the energized spirit a great rock record needs to have.

0446525537|5.0|\\"A Walk to Remember\\" by Nicholas Sparks is one of my favourite books of all time. This book has brought to me both tears and laughter, and the plot is so hooking and addicting that readers aren't going to be able to put it down; I ended up finishing the entire book in one day. Sparks really knows how to tug at a readers heartstrings in this moving story about young, everlasting love.The main characters, Jamie and Landon, takes us all on a spiritual journey, and along the way, teaches us about love, compassion, and faith. <br />If any of you haven't read this book and are considering if you should, take my advice and READ it. You wont be dissapointed, particulary if you are someone that loves romantic and sweet stories, then this book is a must-read, you'll certainly enjoy it.  <br />And a little friendly advice, keep a box of tissues nearby; tears WILL come.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|so at first i also figured that mobb deep goin over to 50's label would be a good thing for them...but apparently i was wrong.  comparin this album to their older ones, mobb is definitly 10x stronger on the old ones -- just like almost everyone is sayin.  they do have a couple decently good songs on the album, but thats it, just a couple. <br />if mobb wants their money, they got it, and they'll keep gettin it -- but if they want to keep their respect and quality albums goin...well, this direction so far hasnt taken them there. <br /> <br />50 is a nice rapper, ill give him that, but he as well is slowly goin downhill and ruinin too many talented rappers along the way.  g-unit was quite fine with just 50, lloyd banks, young buck (the man), and yayo (actually, forget yayo, g-unit was better when dude was in jail), but now it seems like theres too much goin on to make quality g-unit albums. <br /> <br />underground mobb deep is where it is at -- remember that
B000ETQRCM|5.0|After 3 1/2 years, Pearl Jam return with their critically acclaimed \\"Avocado\\", one of the best, if not the best rock album I've heard since that time.

0307263118|2.0|For much of this book, while enjoying the line by line gems that Banville throws our way -- he does have a masterful command of language -- I was left wondering if it was all worth it. <br />Max seems like a nobody to me. He seems like a nobody to himself. No one in the novel is the slightest interesting. What is interesting is watching how a man's thin life dissintegrates near the end (although he's not really that old). He's caught up in memories (notice how in most of his memories he rarely says anything -- but memories are like that). So Banville does take us into the psychology of a pretty boring and empty person very, very well. But, all along, except for the ending which finally involved me emotionally -- I finally cared a little bit for Max -- I was left scratching my head why Banville would ever write such a novel. Pity the people who he was modelling his story on!

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|You definitely have to be a fan of Final Fantasy VII.  I loved the game.  I really did.  I bought it in 1997, and I've yet to sell it.  I still play through it more than most of my other games.  To be honest, Final Fantasy VII is truly one of the greatest games ever made.  A sequel to Final Fantasy VII comes off more as fan service than anything else, however.<br /><br />There's a new virus going around.  Geo-stigma.  Most of the people affected by this virus happen to be children.  There's little that anyone can do to stop the spread of this virus.  Even worse, for Tifa, Cloud has run off and is the lone wolf he always was.  Kind of strange, actually, considering how he turned out at the end of the game.  There's more to the plot.  A group of people are looking for mother (Jenova).<br /><br />Fan service isn't always bad, mind you.  Here it isn't bad, but it is, for the most part, something that will only satisfy the fans.  When you step back and really look at Advent Children, it's a really \\"cool\\" movie, but a sequel that really didn't need to be made in the first place.  Had Final Fantasy VII not been so popular, this sequel wouldn't exist in the first place.  Say Final Fantasy VI was more popular than VII, Final Fantasy VII would not have a sequel at all.<br /><br />The fight scenes are magnificant, that's for sure.  They look really glamourous, but they eventually become all that the movie is about.  I love the fight scenes, but a lot of them began to drag on longer than they should've.<br /><br />The story, about halfway through, takes a backseat to action.  Even worse is that the characters have little to no development at all.  When all the charactes from Final Fantasy VII reunite to fight a battle against a monster (a \\"boss\\" fight, to put it into perspective for RPGers), this is about the only time you see most of them, and when you do, they hardly utter any lines.  Even Cloud and Tifa don't have a whole lot of development to them, and it's Cloud's story.<br /><br />Another asset of the story that begins to suffer is that for those who loved the game as much as I do, there are plot points that happened in the game that most of the creators of this movie either forgot or ignored completely.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the return of Sephiroth.  Another chalk up to fan-service.  Sephiroth just has a huge cult following, that's it.  The way he's even squeezed into the movie is just strange.  The fight scene that ensues between him and Cloud is breathtaking, but it was just really hard to understand why he actually needed to be there in the first place.<br /><br />Another thing that really hurts Advent Children is that the story doesn't even take itself seriously.  It relies more on glamourous fight scenes and slap stick humor by supporting characters rather than actual storytelling.  The game was all about story.  The movie is about glamour and satisfying hardcore Final Fantasy VII fans like myself.  Unfortunately, when I saw the sequel, I was actually expecting it to be done for more than just fan-service.<br /><br />To its credit, though the CGI is fantastic.  Almost humanistic.  Far superior to any CGI that has ever been used before.  Even better, is that for those who love games, the CGI really makes it feel like a video game at some points.  That's exactly how this movie should feel.  It is, after all, a sequel to a video game.  The voice acting also isn't so bad.  Never are dubbed voices as good as their japanese counterparts, but for the most part, the voice work isn't bad.<br /><br />The music is also satisfying.  Most of it is remixed from the game and series as a whole.<br /><br />Fans of Final Fantasy VII will be absolutely stunned by it.  Those who haven't played Final Fantasy VII at all would probably do best to stay away from this movie.  However, those who watch the movie a couple times and then sit back and take a look will realize that this movie isn't really serious.  It's mostly about satisfyingfans, and it does that.  When you look at it as a movie, though, and not as Final Fantasy merchandise, it's a letdown.  It really should've been better than it was.  It should've done what the game did.  That is: give your own story and characters a little more credit.<br /><br />Advent Children isn't a bad movie.  Not at all.  I'm sure Final Fantasy VII Fanboys (and girls) will be absolutely pleased by this movie.  But I'd rather just stick with the game I've had for nine years and can never seem to grow tired of.  As fan-service, the game works.  Fan service isn't always bad, but for me it was just unsatisfying.  If they'd made the movie for more than just to satisfy the desires of fans, it would've been so much better.<br /><br />Finally: Why only Final Fantasy VII?  I understand it's said to be the best in the series but every Final Fantasy has it's own cult following.  I hear it's even getting a remake on the PS3.  The Final Fantasy games before VII (with the exception of FFIII) have gotten nothing but ports despite that the fans devoted to other Final Fantasy games like IV and VI show so much more devotion than fans of FFVII do.  It would be nice if other Final Fantasy games got some share in the credit as well.  Instead Square seems to be using Final Fantasy VII as a cash cow, now.<br /><br />It's a good movie, but it's hit or miss for fans.  If you like a lot of beautiful action and don't give a rip about story then you'll absolutely be stunned by Advent Children.  If you want a little more from you movie... story development, character development and emotional involvement then Advent Children can't and won't fulfill these desires.

B000EHSVOG|1.0|I don't give 1 star reviews very often, but I was a little upset about the lie on the back of the Special Edition box where it said 5.1 soundtrack. All I had was a 4.0 & a 2.0 surround track.  <br /> <br />That being said, the movie is great, and the bonus features are top-notch, but the 5.1 soundtrack should have been there.
B000A158TC|1.0|I was looking forward to enjoying GitS in all its widescreen glory on my PSP. What I got was a letterbox view inside a 4:3 box, using I'd estimate 60% of the screen display. No extras, not even the japanese language (original) soundtrack.<br /><br />I will be taking this back to the shop tomorrow and demanding a refund. Considering this disk only plays on a PSP its a travesty that they didn't use the whole screen.<br /><br />Most disappointed and the copyright owners have once again let me down. For background info, the original Region 2 DVD of this film had a 1 second audio delay which rendered it pretty much unwatchable.<br /><br />Its such a shame to see such beautiful work being mangled like this by people who clearly couldn't care less about the consumers who want to enjoy it.<br /><br />The film itself gets 5/5. This implementation gets 1/5 and that's only because there is no 0/5 rating. If you want GitS on PSP I recommend you buy the DVD and rip it yourself. Its the only way you will be able to enjoy it in full-screen on your PSP and in its original language.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There realy are no words to describe that which is Tool, they are one of the most technical sounding bands out there and are an absolutely amazing experience to see live. Vicarious is my current favorite off this album, Pot comes in next. Of course I love all the songs on this album as do I the other Tool albums.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been a Chili Pepper fan since Mother's Milk came out 17 years ago (what?) and have yet to be disappointed by anything they've done.  I bought their older work which was raw and exciting and have purchased every album of original work since then.  Yes they have gone through a number of changes in personnel, style and musical personality, but they still put out quality music year after year, album after album.   <br /> <br />Blood Sugar was their White Album when it came out, and it's held up as probably their best work to date.  Stadium Arcadium approaches that level of genius while incorporating their personal and musical maturity, in my humble opinion.  The tracks fit together smoothly, with each member of the band showing incredible individual virtuosity as well as the ability to blend their souls together for a communal sound.  One of the most impressive aspects of this album that continues the trend started on By the Way is the voice work.  Swan sounds better every album with remarkable range and sensitivity that would have been a joke on earlier albums like Uplift Mofo, but it works perfectly here.  Add the beautiful vocal harmonies of Flea and John (Hendrix-like guitar work) and you have excellent music.  Whether you like their style or not, you can't deny the talent and feeling these four put into their work.  Whether it's the Clinton-esque funk of 21st Century, Warlocks and Hump de Bump, or John's delicate fretwork on Snow or Slow Cheetah, these guys have progressed light years since they were younger, and they were awesome then, too.  In the album art, Chad has gray hair for crying out loud, but he still controls the rhythm and tempo like no one else around. <br /> <br />I bought the discs yesterday and have pretty much listened to them continuously since I left the store.  The only problem is that with so much fantastic music, it had to be broken up onto two discs.  I recommend burning this extraordinary double album onto your computer or iPod so you can do as John suggests in the liner notes.  LISTEN to the whole shebang from beginning to end and let the sound completely fill your mind, body and soul. <br /> <br />This band has 21 years of experience and seems to keep getting better.  I'm already looking forward to their next effort.  And with Frusciante and the rest of the band clean and inspired, there may not be any limits to what they can achieve.  Buy the album and marvel at the band these guys have become.  Simply Brilliant.
B000002MTR|3.0|I'd give it 3.5. It's really a respectable album, but if you like every song and reaaaaaally love the album, you probably don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers that much. Take in the fact that the current boys refuse to play anything from this album, A.) Dave Navarro is no longer in the band (buuuuuuuut he was insulted they won't/don't play any, which brings me to point \\"B\\") B.) RHCP doesn't support these songs anywhere as close to the other albums; it's not their style. So if you like the music, buy the album. I give props to \\"My Friends\\", \\"Tearjerker\\", and parts of \\"Aeroplane\\" because they sound the most like standard Chili Peppers.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Director John Frankenheimer gained notoriety for his several critically acclaimed intelligent actioners and political thrillers of the 1960s, most notably his films \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" which was held back for 30 years for its controversial plot and recently remade, \\"Seven Days In May\\" (a Rod Serling Script), and \\"The Train\\" with Burt Lancaster; and, for his critically acclaimed serious drama, \\"Birdman From Alcatraz\\".  \\"Ronin\\" is one of Frankenheimer's last films before his death in 2002 and it is his last intelligent actioner, except for his BMW-produced short car chase film following \\"Ronin\\" entitled \\"Ambush\\".  \\"Ronin\\" is the summary and mesh of his talent as an action director, and lies in the wake of his 1966 Cinerama/Ultra Panavision 70 film on the international race of Formula 1  entitled \\"Grand Prix\\", his 1975 thriller and car chase sequel<br /><br />\\"The French Connection 2\\", and also \\"The Train\\" for its several train crashes, political espionage, and explosion scenes.  As an action director, newer directors should pay close attention to Frankenheimer's films because they provide a great education.<br /><br />The title, \\"Ronin\\", has no direct meaning to the plot of the movie, except in its parallel of meaning which is basically a statement that says the age of warriors never dies, that all people at times resort to an existential code above themselves.  I've heard a coined phrase of relevance, \\"old-school\\", or simply meaning a resort to an old way.  This film is about this contemporary version of existential honor and loyalty.<br /><br />To show a direct example of this correlation, consider the film's middle scene with Robert DeNiro and Michael Lonsdale when they speak about the miniatures of the 47 Ronin.  Lonsdale describes the 47 Ronin miniatures to DeNiro by talking about the need to serve something outside of one's self, a man without a master.  After the death of the Samurai's master, the samurai has to revenge the responsible party.  If the samurai completes the mission of revenge, he then commits sepaku in order to end living with the shame of losing his master.  Sepaku is a form of ritualistic suicide where the samurai slices open his own abdomen and painfully dies from this wound.  The reason for it is that, once the samurai completes the task of revenge for his master's death, he has appropriately fulfilled his life.  He can then end it in this ritual manner.  Lonsdale picks up an Exacto knife with which he sculpts his miniature ronin, points it at his own belly, and moves it from camera right to left to describe this suicide.  Instantly after this motion with the Exacto knife, the movie cuts to the next scene to a passing car flashing across the screen in the same direction.<br /><br />My theory is on the relevance of ancient times of history to modern contemporary times, that somehow they are connected to each other, and that this is the key to developing significant meanings from this movie.  It is about this logic pattern of evoking the past and ancient ways to handle personal crises.  It is about \\"rite of passage\\".  In some ways, this Frankenheimer film is very developed in symbolic value, even though very little of it bothers to describe its purpose.  However, this key scene deepens its subconscious waters.  The rest of the film, when seen through this metaphor on warrior codes, gives significance to understanding not only the characters, but the plot itself.<br /><br />The several car chase scenes can and should be read as a contemporary version of ancient battles with swords.  In this way, the cars become symbols of the action scenes just as swords in a movie like \\"Spartacus\\" or \\"Gladiator\\" (2000), or any film with a duel.<br /><br />Therefore, the act of knowing the contents of the briefcase, a holy grail to some, is not as important to define as the reason for living, to serve a cause.  When the film is read in this way, knowing what's in the case becomes less relevant than the acts a personwill go through in achieving it, to which the film is actually about examining, questioning, and understanding the logic, reasons, and necessity for those acts.  A briefcase cannot be as significant of an object as an ideal, which is exactly why the movie ends the way it does.person will go through in achieving it, to which the film is actually about examining, questioning, and understanding the logic, reasons, and necessity for those acts.

B000ENWKN8|4.0|I am not really a big Rob Zombie fan. Casual fan would be a better listener but I have always liked whatever songs I would hear on the song or saw on tv as a solo artist or when he was with White Zombie. I always liked his fusion of metal and industrial music. He also knew how to write a good hook to attract fans.<br /><br />On a casual whim, I decided to pick up Rob's new album \\"Educated Horses\\". In general, \\"Educated Horses\\" is no \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" (my favorite Zombie album) but it still very good. I wasn't too keen on the slower tracks but songs like \\"American Witch\\" and \\"Foxy Foxy\\" reminds me why I have always liked Rob's music. His music is incredibly melodic yet he manages to maintain an aggressive metal/industrial edge to please those who like heavy, aggressive music. I especially love \\"American Witch\\". I have to listen to it as loud as I can. It is the closest thing to classic Zombie like \\"Dragula\\". As I have said before I wasn't keen on the slower songs. I prefer it when Rob growls than actually sings. My other beef with the cd is that it clocks under 40 minutes. A bit short for my taste. Overall \\"Educated Horses\\" is a lot of fun I think, especially when it is cranked up on the stereo.
B000EULJLU|5.0|As a band, Tool has always prided itself on making certain types of fans/observers \\"tools\\" in their own right.  I view this album as no exception as I read reviews written by \\"tools\\" furious that they didn't hear the particular sound that they were wishing for in the much anticipated new album. <br />10,000 days continues the spiritually explorative nature of Lateralus while implementing a much welcomed use of the same dark and piercing types of riffs that litter Undertow and Aenima.  The shift to a more progressive style of rock apparent after the release of Lateralus is prevalent throughout this album as well.  I find this heartfelt and meaningful shif appealing, as it seems to demonstrate authentic \\"real life\\" reflection in the compositions on 10.000 days. <br />Any true Tool fan will appreciate this album for exactly what it is.  As for the rest, ....well...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I purchased this album today on a whim and have to say that I am pleasently surprised. \\"Pearl Jam\\" is truly a great cd that rocks hard yet still has a couple of beautiful softer songs that complement the rockers. To anyone contemplating purchasing this cd, go out and buy it today. You will not be disappointed!
6305212112|5.0|Now there's an alternate title. A beautiful movie, and a very worthy film version of Fannie Flagg's beautiful novel. <br /> <br />While the lesbian relationship between Idgie and Ruth is far clearer in the book (the character Idgie was based on a lesbian aunt of Fannie Flagg's) it is still portrayed both sweetly and intelligently in the movie. <br /> <br />It's hard to go wrong when you are starting out with such a stunning novel, and the cast were just flawless in the way they brought this beautiful story to life. <br /> <br />The semi-controversial ending to the movie is such because it seems to suggest that Idgie and Ninny were the same person, whereas the book indicates they were not. I tend to suspect that the graveside note from The Bee Charmer (Ruth's affectionate nickname for Idgie) and Ninny's comment about Idgie still being seen around, are a reference to the timeless, faerie-like spirit of Idgie, as a final underscoring of the main spiritual message of the book and the movie - the transforming power of the Divine Feminine.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I wish i could say that this cd was excellent but so far its only average.  Though i am an extreme PJ fan i dont feel that this cd is their \\"best work in 10 years.\\"  The entire cd but the last 2 songs are pretty blan but I know that more i listen to it ill start to like the other songs alot more.  The cd is good if you have the patience to listen to it and i recomend it to anyone who is a PJ fan because they will definetly respect the cd as whole over time.  Good cd but not great.  Cant wait for thier tour.
0780020685|5.0|Despite the tempting price on this classic movie...The Criterion Collection has announced that it will re-release Akira kurosawa films in Hi-Def transfers including \\"High and Low\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Yojimbo\\", new transfers and new supplements...
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The only objection to this cd is that now I'm not going to listen the new PJ as much because this cd is amazing.  This cd is now the securing proof that the Chili Peppers are in a class of elite artists and are able of producing great music at any point of their carrers. I found that all 28 of the songs are ear pleasing, though some songs better than the others, I did not turn to a different song while listening to the cd's strait through.  I want to thank the Chili Peppers for making such a great cd so I now have some new good music to listen to.  A-freaken-mazing.
B0007GADZO|5.0|(Bear in mind, this album grows on you a bunch. You just cant flip through the songs quickly, ya gotta take yer time if you think its wierd, because it is.)  <br /> <br />After all this time, Steve really knows how to bring it together and write another amazing album. Each song is unique in its own way and presents a different tone and feeling from the last one. There is no best track on here, they are all good. Firewall is pretty funny, Steve's vocals have gotten a little better, I guess. All in all though, if you love great guitar melodies and the Vai genre, get this album.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Flawed, but meticulously-composed and highly-intriguing, \\"Firefly\\" was cancelled by Fox clearly before it had a chance to grow into its own. On DVD, these 14 affecting, and somewhat strange episodes manage somehow to get under your skin, and the look and feel of this nicked series has stayed in my thoughts for a while now--which, in this day and age of media saturated flashpoints and quick-buzzing soundbites, is kind of saying a lot (at least for Primetime).    Having never been a true fan of sci-fi, I was surprised by how much this show [...]me in. What I like most about \\"Firefly\\" is how un-TV the whole enterprise seems. The nine main characters are all diverse enough and genuinely troubled enough to keep anyone interested in their complex moral waverings and internal struggles (plus all the actors are wonderfully appealing, and several other actors manage to shine in well-crafted Guest Star roles throughout the season). There is a slanted, not-always-successful streak of sardonicism peppered throughout the series, and of course Joss Whedon's risky, ambitious, but oddly successful creation of an entirely new genre: The Sci-fi Western.    500 years into the future, the world has seemingly come full-circle, and after some sort of intergalactic war (we never really know too much about that), lawlessness wages across the new terraformed star system, and we're smack-back in the Wild Wild West. Captain Malcolm Reynolds can't exactly fly his own space ship (Serenity, gorgeously designed, and home to this lovable lot of misfits) but he ably presides over his crew (a sweet, bubbly mechanic named Kaylee, a sexy futuristic Geisha, a somewhat mysterious minister, a white-hot She-Warrior and her nerdy pilot husband, a thick-headed thug, a young doctor, and his \\"touched\\" sister who, with her psychic tendencies and perfect aim, turns out to be the #1 fugitive of the universe, and seems to be the mystical lynchpin of this ever-evolving story).    The crew steals and smuggles, drinks and brawls, but that's just the ways of this world, and they stick together and fight for each other and by the end of the show  you feel you understand them, and know their world, and sadly that's just where this show should have just gotten going. But this boxset is worth checking out because with Greg Edmondson's touching score, the show's colorfully visceral look, and unconventional filming techniques (vibrations, zooms, and hand-held cameras matched with spacey sci-fi are a distinct rarity) you definitely feel like you've come across something quite new, which actually, you have.    I didn't quite follow the core-thrust of the plot, involving the sinister governmental force, The Alliance, and undertones of the under-explained corporate villain, The Blue Sun Corporation, but none of that really mattered. I found the show funny, strangely moving at times, and utterly transporting. I would say it was \\"mercilessly overlooked\\" if it weren't for the hordes of obsessed fans who have formed fully-functioning support networks for each other in the wake of \\"Firefly\\"'s cancellation, organizing fundraisers, role-playing games, and costume parties all in the hopes of cementing pop culture's latest subculture.     The great bonus features on the DVD pay loving homage to to these people, but I would always say, don't judge them, check out the show! Anything that inspires that level of devotion is always worth checking out anyway.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|One Word: Awesome.  Buy it. Love it.  Put either disc on random and you're guaranteed not to be disappointed.  Well worth the wait.
0671578642|5.0|Someone is not playing with a full deck.  Honor Harrington obviously is inspired by Horatio Hornblower (a character created by C. S. Forestor (sp?).  But Horatio came on as \\"Mr Midshipman Hornblower\\" Whereas Honor was introduced to us as a full commander who came on as already educated and squared away.  Honor loosely follows Horatio but  both are great fictional characters and \\"The Honor of the Queen\\" will back me up on that.  Weber has the ability to make one believe the hardware is feasible and all of us would love to have the skill and courage displayed by Honor and many of her accompanying characters, both good guys and bad guys.
B000B8QF00|5.0|A decade ago, Alanis went through an incredibly angry phase, and it shows up in her music to the extreme. I like to call it her bitch music phase. \\"The Collection\\" mixes her sorrowful, angry lyrics with more joyous, redemptive works such as my all-time favorite \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Simple Together\\". She explores the depths of human agony and haunts the listener with her brilliant phrasing. I've never heard a singer belt out the word \\"Dev-a-stat-ing...\\" with such conviction.<br /><br />What makes her even more believable is her grasp of the female condition. \\"Would you love me if I wore ten more pounds\\" and life in \\"8 Easy Steps\\" thumb-noses mainstream media for its poor grasp on what women truly want: to love and be loved just as they are.<br /><br />I'm grateful for Alanis' latest collection of inspiring musicality. To her I simply say, \\"Thank You\\".
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This album maybe be a little too mellow, but it still has some of the fast songs that we all enjoy from the Chili Peppers. I was disappointed that many of the songs weren't very loud or in your face rock.  INstead there are alot of mellow chill out songs.  The few loud songs are very good, but the lack of the in our face rock gives this album a 4 outa 5.
B000AADYYO|5.0|As I write this, Ghost Reveries has been reviewed and rated 177 times and the average rating is 4.5 stars. So, there's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.    In short, it is extreme music at its most brilliant. I really hate tossing around the word \\"brilliant\\" even though I use it frequently. But \\"brilliant\\" doesn't even begin to describe Ghost Reveries.    The opening song, \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", is so powerful and innovative I would buy this CD if it were the only song on the entire album. It's over 10 minutes long and it is well worth a dollar a minute.    There are few heavy bands that have a unique sound and a unique style. Opeth is one-of-a-kind. There's no band on the planet that even comes to Opeth as far as marrying harsh, roaring death metal elements with beautiful, inspired acoustic melodies so effortlessly and seamlessly.    It is truly ground-breaking music. If you are someone who can listen to a Lamb of God CD and immediately after pop in a Mazzy Star CD, then you owe it to yourself to buy Ghost Reveries and every other Opeth disc.    I thought Opeth hit their creative peak with \\"Damnation\\". \\"Ghost Reveries\\" shows their creative abilities knows no boundaries. I am truly in awe. Un-be-liev-a-ble.
B000007WNN|2.0|I remember buying \\"Love\\" when it first came out and I fell in love with the Cult.  There was this raw and wild edge to their music.  But \\"Electric\\" was just not up to the same standard.  It sounded like \\"AC/DC Meets Marc Bolan\\" (and I am a T.Rex fan!)
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool wouldn't stoop to something as lame as another Aenima or Lateralus clone. Don't get me wrong I love those albums too but Tool is a unique and I feel refreshing in that they always explore new sounds and new musical ideas with each album. To say 10000 days isnt yet another step in their evolution is crazy. Too many people want to hear a morphed version of 46x2 or aenema with a new name and I think it's sad. Like others have said this song takes a while to digest and to get into.    )Vicarious- rocks with the best of em, the lyrics like most of the album are a little less metaphoric than usual a la hooker with a pen*s  )Jambi- rocks as well but From the intro you get the impression that the song is going to be very hard hitting which is hardly the case except for the riff before and during the talk box solo.  )wings for marie pt1/ 10000 days- Sounds slightly Pink Floyd influenced which is one of Adam Jones's biggest influences, iv'e found that most people who like dark side of the moon or the wall will love this album. To get the intended effect you shouldnt sepperate the two but listening to 10000 days alone is what initially got me hooked. The first listen thru I was like wtf! then I listend to again a couple of times and loved it. If you still dont like this album listen at about 3:45 on pt 2 the part where maynard starts singing a couple of times:     Ohh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down   without you to guide them all to Zion?   What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun   other than tremble incessantly?     the melody alone is enough to make you shiver in musical joy but then consider the context of the lyrics and Maynard's relationship (or lack of) with God and actually pleading that his mother should have a place in heaven for her devoted christian life even though he's a non believer and has even cursed God ex. Opiate  Howerever you feel about the issue the lyrics are interesting and make you think a little more than your typical top40 song     The rest of the album rocks too but I type slow and I got to go. O yea and the so called \\"fillers\\" kick [...] especially when listening to the album in order as intended. Viginti Tres would be my one complaint if I had one which I don't. It's little more than noise but if you've ever heard any of their other albums its not exactly uncommon for Tool.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Been waiting for this one since I played \\"By the Way\\" to death.  I first wondered how they could possibly fill a double album with the excellence we're used to from a RHCP album.  I had to face it though...the RHCP with Frusciante had never let me down.  This time was no different.      Folks, people are always asking, \\"what will be popular decades from now?\\"  Something comparable to the Beatles, Zeppellin, Stones, etc today.  THIS is the band that people will listen to 50 years from now.  Every member contributing his own musical genius.  Frusciante is wicked on guitar from fuzz to funk, Flea's bass grooves, Anthony's harmonies and raps, and Chad... is he perfect for this or what.  Its a strong thread that runs in all the greats...not a weak spot to be found.  I think this really shines through this album more than ever.    As for the record, well, if you didnt like their last 2 albums, dont bother.  If you like to bang your head against a wall for hours...never mind.  This album rocks harder than either of the last 2, though its not quite a BSSM.  All of these haters should have figured out 7 years ago with Californication that the band had changed.  At that point, they should have either embraced it, or cast it aside.  Its just useless whining at this point...and Im tired of it.  Get over yourselves.  Stadium Arcadium is full of the usual great dynamics and contrast of heavy moments with soft ones....very effective.    In response to the prior 1-star reviewer, every damn one of those bands/artists you listed went through major changes.  If you cant see that, you're probably too ignorant to be reviewing any music at all.  But than again...your nickname was \\"Fidel Castro\\"...    Nobody makes music like the RHCP. Period. Buy it.  Its bound to be one of the great double albums of all time. For some reason this feels like a closing statement...but I hope I'm wrong.
B000002L80|4.0|They returned in 1985 with this really catchy album.Probably their most accessible in terms of songs..half of the songs definitely sound like singles....
0553801503|3.0|I actually liked this book much better than the last book. It is basically a group of adventures surrounded by intrigue. Martin's simple adventures are very enjoyable in my opinion but the forced plot events of the last book still linger. Unfortunately, the further revealing of his world's history and the looming story of Daenyrs and her dragons foreshadow the descent of this story into a D&D type faerie tale not a dark new myth struggle like LOTR. Too bad. <br />Still, as a stand alone this book shows Martin's talent for story telling. I don't blame Martin for milking this cash cow and like a friend who is a much bigger fan said, \\"I wouldn't mind if Martin just kept writing these.\\"
B00005JO20|1.0|Peter Jackson has gone from talented visionary to presumptuous director with this pile of gorilla dung.  The only thing good about this movie was the acting.  This movie was overblown, over the top and reached new depths of eye rolling.  I never thought that action could be so boring.  I (a wanna be artist) never would have guessed that I (also a fan of directorial artistic freedom) could make the following statement...  A producer that could have reined Jackson in a bit would have only benefitted this picture.  This film was an extension of the problems that surfaced in the vastly superior Lord of the Rings (few, but they were there and more prevalent as the trilogy went on).  This film was also a victim of the LotR success. It never seemed to finds it's rhythm with me and never could figure out what it wanted to be.  I also think it's incredibly pretentious to hear so many people praise the great character development in this film, as if time was all that is needed to \\"properly\\" develop characters.  Sorry, there are many movies that do as well of a job at character development in much less time.  Another reviewer wrote that this film was not as good as the sum of it's parts.  Aptly put because the film is filled with fantastic scenes, unfortunately it's filled with just as many over the top scenes.  This movie did not live up to expectations at the Box Office, 51st overall currently at IMDB in total US with approx. $218mil, while seemingly respectable were not good considering the $200mil this movie cost to make.   Obviously not everyone could have enjoyed it.  Or is it that they simply didn't bother?  For my money, I'm still sticking with the original, it's still the archetype of action/adventure movies as cinematic art.  Jackson's version was just too much to stomach and I think it was a presumptuous imitation of the original by an otherwise talented director.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album rocks.  I have no idea what everyone's complaining about with the whole copyright issue...I imported the songs onto iTunes just fine.  Listened to them on my iPod just fine.  Oh well sucks to be you if you can't I guess. <br /> <br />Anyways the Album great, I enjoyed both the \\"Hard\\" side and the \\"soft\\" side.  I thouroughly recommend if you've ever liked anything the Foo Fighters have done, pick it up as soon as you can.
B000002KHH|5.0|In and throughout the 1970s, EVERYBODY was making it big: Led Zeppelin started to sell millions of records, Pink Floyd defined a generation with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and Queen was establishing themselves as one of the most diverse 70s band, etc. To make something truly memorable was a pretty great feat...and that's what Black Sabbath did. After the earth-shattering debut album came this: No, they didn't fall into a sophomore slump, no they didn't become \\"sell-outs\\" and no, they didn't become forgotten: This was the establishment for heavy metal that would inspire countless hopefuls. As you've heard before, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and some other, forgotten greats (Iron Butterfly, Vanilla Fudge, Blue Cheer) played what would become metal, but true to the word, Sabbath is considered the first actual heavy metal band. <br />To describe this album without the actual music is a difficult task, but I'll try best I can to convince you what a landmark gem this is. <br />\\"War Pigs\\" is an eight-minute anti-war song. The first minute starts off jazzy, with some of Iommi's power chords in between Geezer's cool basslines. And the lyrics...unforgettable, to say the least. Some of the most Sabbath-esque lyrics and one of their greatest songs ever. Great jams and great closing. <br />     - \\"Politicians hide themselves away <br />        They only started the war <br />        Why should they go out to fight? <br />        They leave that role to the poor\\" <br />\\"Paranoid\\" is almost a living definition of that recipe for an infamous heavy song. The bluesy, opening riffs, the power chords, tempo and lyrics, and all in 2:47. <br />     - \\"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy <br />        Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify\\" <br />At four and a half minutes, \\"Planet Caravan\\" demonstrates a landscape of rainy, midnight music and a gentle touch to this terrific album. <br />     - \\"We sail through endless skies <br />       Stars shinelike eyes <br />       The black night sighs <br />       The moon in silver trees\\" <br />\\"Iron Man\\" is one of the most well-known Sabbath songs of all time with one of the greatest riffs of all time...and opening with that unforgettable robot voice: \\"I am Iron Man\\". Plus, there's this sped-up, top-notch jam right in the middle of this masterpiece! And with that, we finish Side A. <br />     - \\"Has he lost his mind? <br />       Can he see or is he blind? <br />       Can he walk at all <br />       Or if he moves, will he fall?\\" <br />\\"Electric Funeral\\" has an unforgettable, wa-wa guitar riff, sludgy (in a good way) rhythm, and of course, a delivery of lyrics sung in Ozzy's keening voice. Another great track you must listen to! <br />\\"Hand of Doom\\" is one of the longest songs on the album, at more than seven minutes. This is half low-volume, mostly jazz bass and drum instrumental during the verses with classic Sabbath jams featuring of course, Tony Iommi's guitar work. All in all, this is a fabulous work of heavy music that deserves to be listen to. <br />\\"Rat Salad\\" is a two-and-a-half minute instrumental, featuring something memorable from Tony, Geezer and Bill. While Ozzy doesn't play the harmonica on this (as he does on a couple Sabbath tracks) it shows that these guys are true instrumentalists. <br />The closing track, a six-minute plus leviathan of a Sabbath song, \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" starts off, in the first twelve seconds, somewhat like a Van Halen song intro. (Listen to the higher, chugging riffs and gradual come-in of the drums and you'll see what I mean.). The opening jam lasts about a minute and a half, and though there's limited lyrics, the song, in its entirety, will make you want to listen till the bottom side of your CD is almost totally scratched-up. <br /> <br />There I go...I've described \\"Paranoid\\", the greatest, and one of the first, heavy metal albums of all time. It wasn't easy, but if you don't already have this and want not only a 70s classic, but one of the original building blocks of all hard rock/heavy metal, you WILL want this...and I strongly recommend buying it!
B00005JOVN|3.0|Make it better than the original, or offer something new!  Unfortunately, we don't see that here, but the pace was breathtaking, the effects were stunning even if the character development and script were thinner than rice paper. <br /> <br />Several reviewers have said that the characters were two-dimensional, and one reviewer I read even said the movie was racist because of something that occurs right after the action gets tipped on its head.  I found that the show held a bit more than what I had read before going in, and that the critics were unable to do what I did--unbridle their sense of entertainment and let it gallop around the theater for an hour and a half. <br /> <br />While I won't add this movie to my personal collection, I enjoyed seeing it and it begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible.  I tensed up as the action heated up, and breathed a sigh of relief when our intrepid group made it through obstacle after obstacle, and ultimately, I was entertained in spite of the baggage I carried into the film.  The movie came up short of the original by a long mark, but the editors had the good sense to end it before the two-hour mark and **spoiler alert** sink the boat so we can't have a sequel. <br /> <br />Go.  Get popcorn.  Keep the armrests clear for something to hang onto.  Be entertained. <br /> <br />Score=67/100
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Truthfully I've always really loved Pearl Jam, so I'm biased, but this IS THE GREATEST CD OF THE DECADE! Never has anything grabbed me quite like this! Come Back makes me cry every time I hear it.  Pearl Jam never went anywhere, but now people know that for sure! THIS SHOULD BE THE BEST SELLING CD ON AMAZON!! <br /> <br />Tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone <br /> <br />THE BEST ROCK & ROLL CD OF OUR TIME IS HERE!
B000EULJLU|2.0|I think this disc is absolutely terrible. It nearly bored me to tears, and not because too much time was spent on \\"soundscaping\\" and all of that. I love ambient music and post-rock and 20 minute songs. The problem with \\"10000 Days\\" is that the band sounds uninspired and completely disassociated from their own music. Maynard especially seems to phone in his performance. Buy \\"Aenima\\" instead and don't let Tool think they can get away with taking 5 years for tedious garbage like this.
B000002MJR|5.0|Dire Straits are one of my favorite bands of all time with lots <br />of talent. And this is one of my favorite albums, period. Some of the best songs on here are 'Calling Elvis', 'Heavy fuel', and 'Money for Nothing' and they are total rocking. Buy this album if you don't have it., <br />Dire Straits were always talented <br />which make great music. <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|wow <br /> <br />i always thought pearl jam were good, but i never bought one of their albums until now, & wow im so glad i did. this cd is so amazing & emotional, it took me 3 hours to get through it the first time i heard it because i just kept putting all the songs on repeat.  this might be my favorite cd ever
B00004Y6NV|5.0|To the idiot below me, <br /> <br />Your opinion about this great band is not needed. The ones you <br />hate like Green Day, and Nirvana are absolutely great and the <br />ones you like such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, & The Who are ok but not great. I like both Brothers in Arms too, but please grow up and listen to this. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a really great album and one of my favorite albums of all time, period. It contains some really great songs, <br />'When It Comes to You', 'The Bug', 'Heavy Fuel possibly the greatest song ever written', 'My Parties', and 'Planet of New Orleans. Please don't listen to that 1 star reviewer below me who says it is BORING and get this album right now with Making Movies, & Love Over Gold. Dire Straits will always be the best band of all time.
B00019074O|4.0|Police Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition)~ G.W. Bailey is the only good movie of them all. Guttenberg plays an amazing role, and the script is not as paper thinn as the rest of the sequells. This makes the rest of movies look look the winner of the nobel prize. The dialogue is not as horrid as the later sequells either but is kind of well developed. I love tackleberry the Vietnam craze and all the other steroetypical charachters in this movie. I also love the blue eyester bar scene. The rest of the movie is filled with typical 80's stereotypical view of society which was normal at the time. It is also a time capsule for the music (Frankie Goes to Hollywood is played in one scene), the fashion (the tacky clothes) and everything else that was like \\"in fashion\\" during the 80's. Highly recommended indeed.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After reading some negative reviews I've concluded that there are a lot of RHCP \\"fans\\" who don't have a clue. I mean my opinion has always been that music/movies/etc is all subjective and effects different people on different levels. I've always respected peoples opinions and never questioned them. <br /> <br />However this album has proven to me one thing: That people who can complain about a beautiful piece of work like \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" just don't know WHAT THE &%@$ THEY WANT! <br /> <br />Seriously, isn't it funny that almost all negative reviewers mention something about Blood Sugar Sex Magik? GIVE IT UP PEOPLE! That was 15 bloody years ago! Get with the times, man! <br /> <br />Anyways, on to Stadium Arcadium. This truely is their best work yet. They've combined certain elements from all their previous work to create a masterpiece. I wouldn't skip over one song on the entire album, its that good. And dude, 28 SONGS! This album won't get old for a long time, if ever. Anthony, Flea, John and Chad are definitely at the top of their game on this one. <br /> <br />That said, if you're a narrow-minded fan who is expecting BSSM or Californication or BTW you will be dissapointed. But if thats the case, you shouldn't even consider yourself a true RHCP fan. These are people who need to evolve and accept the music as they grow as musicians and we grow as fans. <br /> <br />If you are into bands that don't ever change, go listen to AC/DC or Motley Crue. Of course they haven't released a new album in over 10 years, but hell their music is better than this, right?
B000EULJLU|5.0|I honestly can't understand why there are negative reviews here. This album is absolutely brilliant. I just listened to Aenima, Undertow, Lateralus, then 10,000 days in that order...10,000 days is just as good as any other album. <br /> <br />Also, I saw them live in Seattle on May 2, the day this album came out. The new songs blew everyone away live- they played Rosetta Stone, Jambi, Vicarious, and The Pot. Those songs sounded so good live...Just like with Lateralus, I appreciated the material much more after hearing it live. This album is the same way... <br /> <br />I take this album as four acts: <br /> <br />Act 1: Vicarious and Jambi <br /> <br />Act 2: Wings for Marie 1 and 2 <br /> <br />Intermission (Lipan Conjuring) <br /> <br />Act 3: Lost Keys and Rosetta Stone <br /> <br />Act 4: Intension and Right in Two <br /> <br />Closer (Vigniti Tres) <br /> <br />All four \\"acts\\", as I call them, are brilliant separately or all listened to together. After many listens, this album paints a powerful picture- one that is fragmented yet coherant as a whole... <br /> <br />And for those who keep saying, \\"There's too many perfect circle moment, etc, etc...\\" Melodic does not mean a \\"perfect circle moment\\". If Aenima came out today people would say it sounds too much like a perfect circle. Tool has a totally unique rhythmic sound that is nothing like a perfect circle. Some songs are quite melodic and Maynard extends his range but this is still very much Tool.  <br /> <br />For your own sake, let go, and enjoy this brilliant piece of music!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|\\"Pearl Jam\\", the first studio album since what sounded like a band beginning to wake from of a long sleep on \\"Riot Act\\" several years ago, is amazing.<br /><br />It's impossible to deny how energized the band sounds here. This could have been released after Pearl Jam's legendary sophomore album, \\"Vs.\\", except that they weren't as focused or technically proficent at that point in their career. \\"Pearl Jam\\" sounds undeniably like a starving young band with musical and lyrical maturity beyond their years; it's hard for me to believe they've been at this for over 15 years, and even harder to believe ANYONE could perceive this album as sounding \\"tired\\" or \\"boring\\"! Pearl Jam sounds hungrier at this stage than the vast majority of young bands on the radio - check out \\"Severed Hand\\" or \\"Big Wave\\" for immediate proof!<br /><br />\\"Life Wasted\\", the album opener, sets the bar high and each successive track delivers. A total of 5 unapologetically hard-rocking tunes kick the album off (although \\"Marker in the Sand\\" does break into a beautiful, mid-tempo chorus that sticks in your head long before you can really make sense of Eddie's trademark mumbling vocals) before pausing for air with the mainly acoustic, Beatle-esque, melodically all-over-the-map \\"Parachutes\\".<br /><br />Things kick back into rock mode with the ultra-catchy (though strangely reminiscent of \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\"-era Sheryl Crow) \\"Unemployable\\" - I may be the only one to get that comparison.<br /><br />\\"Gone\\" follows with what may be the clearest echoes of early Pearl Jam - a tune that would have fit comfortably (and quite possibly as a standout) into the 2nd half of their debut album. The track \\"Army Reserve\\" could, as well, fit nicely onto \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\" That is not to say that either of these tunes shows the band regressing; the musicianship is at a level well above their early days, and clearly demonstrates how possible it is for a veteran rock act to continue to grow and improve while losing none of their energy or passion.<br /><br />\\"Come Back\\" is a beautifully bluesy ballad & \\"Inside Job\\" is just an amazing closer.<br /><br />I would not have believed I could be so excited about this album - my interest was mainly just to see where these former 'grunge' gods, who helped completely change the musical landscape just as I was heading into high school would take things after the sleepy, though impressive \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" albums. Honestly - and not to knock anything they've done since \\"Vitalogy\\", because I absolutely love \\"Off He Goes\\", \\"Given to Fly\\", \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" and \\"Save You\\" - I would trade all four of those albums for this one, any day of the week.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear more of this from Pearl Jam!!!ng none of their energy or passion. <br /> <br />\\"Come Back\\" is a beautifully bluesy ballad & \\"Inside Job\\" is just an amazing closer. <br />  <br />I would not have believed I could be so excited about this album - my interest was mainly just to see where these former 'grunge' gods, who helped completely change the musical landscape just as I was heading into high school would take things after the sleepy, though impressive \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" albums.

158799190X|5.0|This guy made his fortune in the crash of 1987 because he maintains positions of far out of the money options. A recent interview with him in Active Trader magazine was quite interesting, as he expounded on that experience a bit and recounts telling his superiors not to bother him for a while because he only needs to hit one out of every 64,000 trials to be profitable with his approach.<br /><br />But he also admits that now he trades butterfly spreads instead, in order to finance these positions which hit only once a decade or so.<br /><br />The book itself is not so much an endorsement of his trading style as it is a justification of it. It's written in a technical style that still somehow is delightfully entertaining. The theme is the large role that random chance plays in life and in probability games (such as actively trading in markets). I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />There is a moral to the story in there somewhere, and it's a very good one, a wise one to remember if you are a speculator at anything. Something about how long run results are more important than the win vs. loss count and not counting your winnings until the game is over, or something. In any case it's a classic and must-read in the trading literature.<br /><br />[...]
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I buy around 100 albums every year, so far Pearl Jam's self-titled eighth studio album is by far the best. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder's vocals & melodies are tremendous & the guitar playing is the best guitar playing you'll hear from a mainstream band today.  \\"Pearl Jam\\" manages to be very creative aswell as easy to listen to.  This could almost pass for a greatest hits album.   <br /> <br />The best songs <br />\\"Come Back\\" <br />\\"Unemployable\\" <br />\\"Inside Job\\" <br />\\"Severed Hand\\" <br />\\"Parachutes\\" <br />& \\"Life Wasted\\" <br /> <br />The new Tool album was disappointing & so was Stadium Arcadium.  This alone makes up for both albums.  Pearl Jam are phenomenal & the best band of our time.
B000002H6C|5.0|I am a long time metal fan that probably has about 700 or more cd's  mostly all hard rock or metal of some sort. Of all those cd's ....And Justice For All is my favorite. Its the first cd that got me into aggressive heavy metal. Of course the first song I every heard was \\"One\\". This is by far Metallica's heaviest and I love the  double bass on this cd. My favorite tracks are \\"Blackend\\" and \\"and justice for all\\" along with \\"eye of the beholder\\" or tracks 1,2,3. I like all of Metallica's cd's but I wish they would make one more cd like ....And Justice For All.
B00005JOVN|3.0|I extend sympathy to any movie coming out within the next few months that bears any signs of death, destruction, or disaster related chaos.  It is bound to be compared to 9/11, the overseas tsunami, or Hurricane Katrina.  Yes, it is a particularly sensitive time within the world today given these disasters that happened.   However, everyone has different tastes in movies and some find escapism in action/adventure films. Some, like me, are fascinated with the element of survival and how individuals fight to get out of difficult situations.  Yes, some like myself also like special effects and disaster movies.  Second, while movie critics have every right to share their opinion in hopes we will all listen to them and follow their advice, my advice is to see the movie if you want to and formulate your own opinion.     That said, I observed the film \\"Poseidon\\" today and found it a very suspenseful action adventure film.  I saw the original and to this day it is one of my favorites, therefore felt drawn to see how it could be remade.  As expected, the computer animated effects were excellent, although at times a bit unrealistic (in the original Poseidon Adventure, the wave actually looked much more realistic). However, the destruction within the ship was breathtaking and shocking, depicting just what might happen if a large luxury liner nowdays capsized.  I agree with the critics that not much character development was present.  I'm not for sure if director Peterson meant to rush the film's opening sequences along, but it was here's the ship, a few characters, it's New Year's Eve, here's the wave (out of nowhere with no explanation as to how it developed) and bam-the ship's upside down.  I for one tend to disagree with the film's 99 minute running length; more shots of characters withinin the ship's surroundings to get to know them better prior to the disaster would have been more sufficient, but that's just my opinion.  However, Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, and Jimmy Bennett who played the young boy play their roles well and I found myself caring more about the characters as the movie went along, despite the lack of dialogue within the non stop action.  The surprising thing I found within the film is that the survivors, while making their way through the ship, saw no other survivors, only multitudes of dead bodies which I found strange given the ship's huge size.  Encountering others or picking up another survivor along the escape route would have added to the realism.  All in all, Poseidon was worth the money.  My advice is that if you are not in the mood for a disaster movie with realism when it comes to death (movie critics have criticized the carnage-what do you think is going to happen if a ship capsizes?  People are going to die, some will survive, it's a fact), find another film you will enjoy.  However, if you're like me and enjoy disaster movies with special effects, action/adventure (plenty of explosions, suspenseful escape scenes abound here, the what is going to happen next factor keeps the adrenaline pumping) and some good acting especially by Lucas, Russell, and Dreyfuss, it's worth your money.
B00005QG9J|5.0|\\"Morning View\\" is by far my favorite Incubus album to date. With tracks <br />like \\"Wish you were here\\" where they celebrate the wonderful feeling one <br />has when they are completly satisfied in the beauty of their own <br />paradise and wanting to share that with some one.  This album truly <br />stands out. Each track gives the audience a bit of motivation to stand <br />up for what you believe in and mostly for yourself.  Anyone who takes <br />the time to truly listen and understand the lyrics will honestly <br />experience a life changing epiphany.  The music that the band combines <br />with the lyrics will leave you wanting more...
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Kudos to Tom Hanks for bringing a genuinely lavish production, historically based (and accurate) dramatization about the Space Race, and during Project Apollo, how the NASA eventually beat the Russians to the Moon.  A fitting tribute to the famous JFK speech with a personal introduction from Mr. Hanks at the beginning of each episode, this DVD series will bring an almost spontaneous swell of American pride to anyone who watches it.<br /><br />The historical story lines, writing, actors' real people history maker protrayals, set decorations, stirring theme music and production qualities, are all truly terrific.  A lot of previously heretofore unrevealed, behind the scenes, manned space program trials and tribulations go beyond merely the highlights into much deeper detail.<br /><br />This is movie making at its very best for both contemporary American history buffs as well as space afficionados with a penchant for all the  technical aspects of Apollo.  Well worth the DVD boxed set price for this superlative, albeit \\"TV\\" miniseries, the newly re-released, \\"Signature Edition\\", in High Definition (widescreen format) with DTS sound audio transfer, promises to be even better than the original.<br /><br />Come the third week of each July, this will be the only thing to watch on anyone's home theater system, as a traditional annual event, with episode #6 reserved for the 20th day of that month.  This is the day in 1969 of the incredible first lunar landing, which should be a National Holiday to celebrate when men first set foot and saluted the American flag on the Moon.<br /><br />BRAVO to Tom Hanks and HBO for bringing us a fascinating story of for which ALL Americans can take great pride and enjoy for years to come!
0307277674|5.0|I read the book when it first came out and had everyone talking, but only just got around to reading all the hulabaloo about how Dan Brown's facts are either wrong or skewed or based on conspiracy theorists' essays. Which is all fine and dandy, should one forget that it's a fictional story. It doesn't claim to be the end all, be all on the subject.<br /><br />It is what it is - a wonderfully engaging story with tons of twists and turns, lots of 'Ahah!' moments, plenty of action, and (albeit, not facts) intersting notions about the artists, the meanings of artistic works, and of course, the mystery that shrouds the life of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />You can walk out of a movie theater thinking, \\"Wow, totally improbable but STILL a lot of fun to watch,\\" and this is how you'll end up feeling about this book. Definitely pick it up for a fast paced page turner you won't be able to put down.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Peppers have done it again.  Except this time they have given us 28 songs of pure bliss.  This is the soundtrack to your summer of '06.  After being accused by some of not being \\"as funk\\" anymore, they have proven everyone wrong w/ songs going back to the sounds of albums such as Mother's Milk.  Plus they still incorporate their stellar sound of today in which they  have evolved over the last ten years or so.  Don't ask questions, just go out and pick this one up.
006054094X|5.0|I was truly enthralled and fascinated by this book. It was insightful, eye-opening and so well written. Although much of the text was academic in content, it was easy to enjoy and understand on a layman's level.     I never in my life thought I would be reading a book on 15th century Chinese navigators! so this book pleasantly surprised me - I love the concept of this knowledge totally rewriting history. Menzies backs his theories impressively (in this layperson's mind, anyway!) and I adored his enthusiasm and passion.    I highly recommend this if you want to learn some new, refreshing and fascinating concepts about the formation of the world's countries... and how things could have turned out somewhat differently.
B000FIMG68|4.0|I was one of those people who last year in September took the chance to watch a little show called Lost when they aired the pilot and since then I've been hooked. This is one of those shows that is addictive. Usually, shows like this don't attract that many fans and it ends up getting cancled but Lost has gotten a huge fan base which will most likly keep this show on for five seasons.  <br /> <br />The first season was great, the second season has been a downer because it's not near as good as the first season but when it's good, it's great. Lost is now #2 on my best TV show (Prison Break has taken the #1 slot) but the show is not going downhill! Every TV show has a downer season and it usually comes after the success of the first season. Then there are shows that don't do well in the beginning and then do great later on. Remember Seinfeld? The first three seasons were nothing that special but once it hit the fourth season it became a great show... and then it got a little dissapointing towards the end. I can't complelty review this series since there's still two more episodes left, but knowing Lost they will pick up the pace for those episodes. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, most of the features that were there in the first season are back for the second season. Including bloopers, deleted flashbacks, deleted scenes, lost on location, and also includes the new lost connections, and anatomoy of an episode. So the extra features are a very nice plus. It'll also have commentary on selected episodes. Overall, if you're expecting this to be as good as the first season, you're in for a dissapointment. Last seaosn was all about the characters and this season is all about the mysteries of the island. There's some new characters and some of the old characters change the way we look at them, but overall it's a great show with only a good season not a great one.
0307236722|5.0|Joy joy joy joy joy. Not very informative a review, I know; but what more can be said? If you love baking, then this is just about the only compendium you'll need. Where else can you find bagels and brioche with cobblers, crackers, cream puffs, meringues, cookies, muffins, pies, galettes, tarts, baguettes - even focaccia, ciabatta, pizza dough and pissaladiere! COME ON! Who else stretches herself beyond the (already impressive) shores of the United States and sources those indescribable delicacies we can find all over this world of ours. That's our Martha. And of course, the layout and design is divine, and the book is of that delicious size - not too big and easily propped up while travelling, on the couch, treadmill, or tucked in bed for the night. Love it.
B000001FMX|1.0|I saw the NY Dolls at Mercer Art Center back in their first year. Frankly, they were amateurish at best; simply awful on a bad night. And time has changed nothing. This record is tedious bordering on unlistenable noise. What time HAS changed is the reverence and \\"importance\\" people have attached ot them. In reality they were and are at most a footnote on the glam and pre-punk scene. WIth other bands like the Miamis, they tried to be something that they simply wer enever competent or creative enough to be. So despite all the posturing and pontificating about their alleged importance, instead, I suggest you listen to anyone of the clips provided and see for yourself that this is a record not worth buying.
B000006TRV|2.0|Okay, since I first wrote this review, I've gained more of an appreciation for Pink Floyd. But this still doesn't do anything for me. The concept (about a rock star who slowly goes insane and blames said insanity on everyone but himself) is about as pretentious and heavy-handed as they come, unlike those of Dark Side or Wish You Were Here. And there are far too many minute-long link tracks that do nothing but pad the album out to two discs, though to be fair some of the full songs (Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 1; Goodbye Blue Sky; One of My Turns; Don't Leave Me Now; Nobody Home; the disturbingly Queen-esque Waiting for the Worms and the overblown Trial, arguably the worst song in Pink Floyd history). And while the best songs (Mother; Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 2; Young Lust; Hey You; Run Like Hell; Comfortably Numb) are easily worth repeated plays, they're scattered across the album, which may leave you hitting \\"skip\\" more than you'd care to admit. To make things worse, Roget Waters sadly confines Dave Gilmour (an excellent guitarist) to the background, though his solo on Comfortably Numb blows me away.<br />I can't see why The Wall is so revered - get Piper at the Gates of Dawn; Meddle; Dark Side of the Moon; Wish You Were Here or Animals instead. All are far better.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|This album is a very big shock to the system......... <br />this may apear a different band the formula disapeared <br />but give it time... its worth it <br />gone is the intensity drive passion and poetry however........ <br />For the first time PJ apear to have made a very friendly album -almost- happy <br />You wont quite want to go out and change the world with it ...... nor will you continue hating your parents.....a good car in the summer album <br />Tracks like WWS and Severed Hand are truely great songs and should be amazing live as will unemployable and Gone  <br />basically <br />disjointed and drifting .........still great fun and will keep lots of people very happy ...............looking forward to the future.......but dont think theyre in as much a  rush to  change the world sadly anymore... do buy it by any other bands standards its really great but for pearl jam i am a bit disapointed.  <br />if you want to be inspired or motivated  buy any of their other albums esp Yield or Binaural, If you want a good time buy this...
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Meg Ryan is one of my favorite actresses to watch in movies.  The opening scene of her in the airplane is worth watching the movie, it's so hilarious!  Kevin Kline play the great Frenchman and the scenery was really great. <br /> <br />My neice is getting ready to go to France for a year this fall on a student exchange program and we are buying this movie for a part of her high school graduation present.  It will be interesting for her to play this in French to see what they think of this movie there.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This Tool CD is freaking amazing - their best ever.  Saw them in concert 2 nights ago and was a religious experience for 3,000 people - no words to describe it!  Tool is just awesome and this CD is amazing.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|heres the deal, deal or no deal! well im not pushing the button! RHCP have been my favorite band for a while.  They have a lot of talent but they aren't taking many risks. the entire album could have been predicted by a baby knowing that the angry old man was going to take his candy!  <br /> <br />While most of the tracks are uninteresting I especially like Johns solos. Its too bad he relies on tired four chord progressions. The harmonies are great as well but kiedis kinda sucks (lyrically and sometimes vocally)...i tried being in a band who idealized kiedis and he never sang on pitch.   <br /> <br />Dani California is pretty good for a pop song but we're all gonna pay for it when thats the only song in our heads for the rest of the summer. <br /> <br />Listening to this album, I learned that they're a great ballad band. I guess whatever it means to you, good for it.  I do like \\"Hey\\" and \\"Strip my Mind\\"  <br /> <br />
0316168815|4.0|Alice Seabold's Lovely Bones is a mesmerizing take of tragic loss and forgiveness. This book contains a well thought out plot, intriguing characters and many deep themes. <br /> <br /> The story is told through the eyes of the deceased Susie Salmon, in 1973. Susie is a fourteen-year-old girl who is now adapting to her home in heaven, which is not anything like she thought it would be. She watches life on earth as it proceeds without her. She sees her killer trying to erase the details of her murder and watches as her devastated family falls apart.  <br /> <br /> In this novel conflicts occur between Susie and her murderer, during her rape. She also has conflicts with herself coinciding with her not being able to let go of her family. There are some life changing themes in Lovely Bones, which may cause you to rethink your outlook on life. The themes that really caught my attention were that not everyone can be trusted and that letting go is more satisfying than seeking retribution. This novel has influenced me to re-look at some of my relationships in life. <br /> <br /> I think this novel is very well written in the sense that Sebold takes many grim and tragic subjects and makes them quite humorous. I strongly recommend this novel to people who like meaningful novels, especially females, as it is a novel full of difficult but rewarding situations. One of the most intriguing parts of this novel is the fact that it is told from the deceased Susie's perspective. Lovely Bones is one of the most compelling novels I have read because it captivates the reader's attention page after page. I guarantee you won't be able to put this book down.   <br />
0743277708|5.0|romping across the English countryside may seem like a walk in the park for us humans, but for the rabbits in Watership Down it's a life-and-death struggle to start a new life after the destruction of their own home. their travels grip the reader by vividly illustrating the dangers they face, from deadly foxes and weasels, to man-made hazards, or even facing off against fellow rabbits.  <br /> <br />Adams creates an entire culture around the rabbits, outlining their success (and failures) through the tales of heroic figures from the rabbits' past. these stories compel the rabbits to take risks that will allow them to secure a new home, and ultimately continue their peaceful way of life. <br /> <br />the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the other rabbits are described through the distinct personalities and traits that Adams gives them. while their actions may seem anthropomorphic, their physical reactions are rooted in how real rabbits act in the wild. <br /> <br />not for the faint of heart, this lagomorphian expedition will make you look upon common rabbits in an entirely different manner from now on.  <br /> <br />
0385338686|4.0|I was reading this book while waiting for my son's braces to be adjusted, and I laughed out loud in the very first chapter, when she is at a spa and she has smuggled in her BlackBerry and her cell phone!  It is a wonderful, lighthearted read.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|On first listen the album dosent quite catch you. But this is a similiar experience that has occurred with every other PJ release. After a few more listens the quality of the album really becomes apparent. The album has two distinct parts, the hard rock driven first half and the ballad building second half. <br />My favourite songs are comatose, army reserve and the beautiful \\"inside job\\" which is up there with the best that PJ has done. <br />Brilliant vocals by Vedder and great music from the rest of the band. No other band in the last 15 years has a back catalogue of the quality of pearl jam. This adds to the legend.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Incredible.  Pearl Jam have come out with the best album of the year & probably the decade. Pearl Jam are the best band on earth.
B0002KRTUW|4.0|Because of the mixed reviews I had read, I didn't know what to expect before watching the movie. I was impressed from beginning to end. Though disturbing in several areas, the film kept my attention and engaged my mind. Ashton Kutcher gave an excellent performance, as did the other actors. The plot was unique, so this wasn't a run-of-the-mill psychological thriller. Character development was superb, making the storyline that much more engaging and important. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and checked it out for myself. It was worth the watch.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This was one of the worst interpretations of a classic novel that I've ever seen. If you have seen the Collin Firth - Jennifer Ehle characterizations of Darcy and Elizabeth, you'll probably not even sit through this DVD.  The leads of this abbreviated version of Pride and Prejudice are just not believable.  Knightley giggles her way through the Elizabeth role and doesn't really seem to understand the character at all. The script is choppy.  If you didn't know the real social commentary of the novel you certainly wouldn't get it out of this movie.  Don't waste your time!
B0009QBLA8|3.0|I am a David Lynch fan. His bold deviation from the norm is the draw of his work for me. Eraserhead is definitely a film that fits right in with the rest of his work. Its 'entertainment quotia' is not high, though. The piece is thoughtful, odd, of course, and memorable. But the film is not one to enjoy with friends. You will notice the lulls and lack of editing if you watch with others. It's more like a wierd book to read quietly in your home. Lynch's later films are more engaging, but this one is definitely important. If you're a Lynch fan, you've got to see it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Most science fiction movies fall into two rough categories: \\"Star Wars\\"-style action films, and more cerebral movies in the vein of \\"2001: a space odyssey.\\"  (Of course, the classification is simplified; a movie like \\"Minority Report\\" can bridge the gap between the two sub-genres).  \\"Solaris\\" belongs firmly in the \\"2001\\" school of sci-fi, which may explain why I liked it - and why it failed at the box office. <br /> <br />Cerebral science fiction movies demand patience and active involvement and almost always disappoint the masses.  (Recent examples include \\"Gattaca\\" and \\"AI: Artificial Intelligence,\\" films I admired that achieved something less than blockbuster status).  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's \\"Solaris,\\" which extends a concept that might have driven the plot of a Star Trek episode to feature-film length. That \\"Solaris\\" feels longer than its 99-minute running time is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a philosophical movie that eschews action, effects and violence, and is content to linger on moments and details as it considers its trenchant themes. <br /> <br />I can't say too much without giving anything away.  The setup is that Dr. Kelvin (played by Soderbergh favorite George Clooney) is summoned to a space station where some sort of disaster has occurred.  (Imagine how \\"2001\\" might have played out if Heywood Floyd's Clavius Base cover story had been true, and you'll get the idea). Shortly after arriving on the Solaris base, Clooney meets the survivors, and soon understands why they don't want to leave. <br /> <br />Soderbergh's directs efficiently, and the performances by Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies, and Ulrich Tukur all resonate.  Soderbergh wisely uses special effects to serve the story, based on Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel of the same name.  (I haven't seen the 1972 Russian film also based on Lem's novel, but this version inspires me to seek it out). <br /> <br />\\"Solaris\\" asks us to consider many questions: Whatwould we do if given a chance to relive the past?  How important is memory to our concepts of our loved ones?  Would we choose a false happiness over the ups and downs of reality? \\"Solaris\\" uses a futuristic setting to explore these questions eloquently and profoundly, leaving the viewer to supply the answers.  Bring an open mind to \\"Solaris;\\" it's worth your time.
B0002VHBTK|5.0|Thinking outside the box is challenging. Creating life and movement outside the box in a way that someone else can easily interpret and appreciate is masterful. Visually, the film could not be better, capturing both action and intense emotional moments with unmatched creativity. Along with expert camera work, editing and superb acting, this film becomes a roller coaster ride for the senses. A work of art, it deserves more than 5 stars.
1400079179|1.0|All the elements of this book are false and should not be taken seriously. This is a book of fiction and it is also HIGHLY offensive to over 1.1 billion of the world's population. There are many more other books that are worth your time.
0671688782|5.0|Holding is difficult. It depends on the family strength and will-power to maintain a nurturing connection with the child. But I am truly convinced that, in the case of my children at least, both of my adopted children would have been in deep trouble. Their behavior was terrible in the extreme. James, age 9, would have become a sociopath and ended up in prison. Sonia, age 10, would have been engaged in antisocial behaviors - shoplifting, self-mutilation or teenage pregancy. I've seen it too often in other families. In our case we needed coaching on how to safely do holding within our family. But after we got it (a 2-day program) we were able to dramatically alter the behavior of both children. Before the 2-day intensive program, they would fight all day long, a major meltdown every 25 minutes. After the intensive I think they went 6 months without a fight. It was like someone cut fighting out of our home life. Is it hard? Yes. Is it countercultural? Yes. But for those families lucky enough to have supportive resources for the mom (who ends up doing the big share of nurturing) it works.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is a beautiful and classic love story by director Nick Cassavettes (son of legendary director John Cassavettes). This film has gorgeous cinematography, you'll know what I mean when you view this film. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are breathtakingly beautiful together. McAdams is some actress, she has a big career ahead of her, she is so natural and real. Gosling is great as well, he carried the film extremely well. Well-acted, great supporting cast, and a timeless story of how strong love can be no matter what age you are. Defintely worth seeing, The Notebook is glorious.
B000E5KOJS|5.0|Of all the Mozart operas, I have a special affection for the ones he did in collaboration with Lorenzo da Ponte, a glorious set of non-identical triplets named Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi Fan Tutte. The latter opera is the least celebrated of the three, the black sheep of this sparkling brood if you will, but that is hardly an insult considering the strength of the competition. Cosi is a worthy scion of the Mozart-Da Ponte parentage, a masterpiece in fact, similar to the other operas in its subversive combo of ribald subject matter and music that is spritely and almost innocent. What it lacks is a strong main character(the secondary characters Don Alfonso and Despina are the most interesting of the bunch, that is until late in the second act when the soprano develops a soul) on the order of Figaro or Giovanni(or Leporello, Donna Anna or Susannah), but  since Cosi Fan Tutte is about the ephemeral nature of love, isn't it appropriate that the central lovers are more or less identity-less, even to the point of being interchangeable?    Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's film plays up this concept of interchangeability. The sisters are practically identical, they even don identical masks in one scene, and the physical attributes of their lovers are sometimes confused, for instance which one is dark and which one is fair. At one point, Dorabella realizes that the Turk romancing her is actually her fiancee's friend Guglielmo but she allows him to seduce her anyway. Not all of this jibes with Mozart's vision, of course, but this is a FILM of an opera, so it is perfectly appropriate for the director to give a freer interpretation, allowing some of his own ideas to filter in. After all, if Mozart and da Ponte had lived in a more permissive time, one gets the feeling that they would have gone for the gusto so to speak and allowed even more sexual farce into their work. At any rate, Ponnelle has created a beautiful film that for the most part adheres to the composer's intentions. Often, when I am watching an opera on DVD, I get distracted by the music and lose track of the story and the visuals. In this case, the visuals occasionally distracted me from the music, no small feat considering that the composer is Mozart and the opera is Cosi Fan Tutte.    As for the singers, has there ever been a more beautifully voiced Mozart soprano than Edita Gruberova in her prime? Here she is a wonderful Fiordiligi, in perfect voice, delivering her two major arias without a glitch or even the slightest indication of strain(well, she does have the advantage of a prerecorded soundtrack). Her physical performance is just as good, she captures the character's frivolousness and later her depth, how conflicted she feels over her growing attraction to Ferrando. She steals the film, although the rest of the cast is exemplary. Luis Lima has a lower register than a lot of Mozart tenors, but that isn't a handicap, his performance of the act one aria, one of the most beautiful ever written for the tenor voice(or any voice for that matter), does supreme justice to the piece. Feruccio Furlanetto, usually cast in non-romantic parts, is a sexy and strong-voiced Ferrando. Teresa Stratas is hilarious as the saucy and conniving sobriquet Despina. Delores Ziegler, our Dorabella, holds her own among the other more-celebrated female voices. Need I say more? Paolo Montarsolo makes a wickedly charming Don Alfonso. Finally, all the singers have the appropriate looks for their roles, which is especially important in an opera film.    I own a lot of opera DVDs. I have to say, this is one of the finest in my collection. Everything clicks. If one were to turn off the picture, they would still experience as beautiful a recording of this opera as is humanly possible(Nikolaus Harnoncourt rules!). The fact that the film matches the music note for note is gravy. Don't hesitate, buy!!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's incredible album, Hybrid Theory is a cool mix of hip-hop and rock tracks. Chester Bennigton has some powerful vocals, you can feel his tormented pain on every track. Standout tracks include:Points of Authority, In the End, A Place for my Head, With You, Crawling, and Papercut. Some people might think this is a depressing and angry album but it works and well this band ain't gonna churn out love ballads, it's not their taste. I can't believe how good Hybrid Theory is. You will end up listening to this album over and over again. Don't buy it if you are looking for a sunny and glossy album, Linkin Park are so much better than that, one of my favorite records to date, love it!
B000002HMH|2.0|When I think about the Load album, I cant help but notice the fact that the largest gap between albums in Metallica's career took place between The Black Album and this. Is it by chance then, that this hiatus coincided with the quality of Metallica's music plummeting. Probably not, but that's another issue for another time.  <br /> <br />What matters is that with this, arguably the single biggest disappointment in the history of music (well, Bathory's \\"Octagon\\" album was pretty abysmal, but at least they bounced back), Metallica have entirely abandonned the youthful fury, attitude and complexity that made their early work so great. Instead, they opted for a mellow, simplistic approach to metal, similar to Sentenced's later albums like \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Crimson,\\" except lacking those albums' emotional impact and poetry. In fact, one of the worst aspects of \\"Load\\" is that the music exudes an air of transparent pretentiousness, as though Metallica are purposefully trying to appeal to a larger audience. James Hetfield's voice no longer expresses real anger like we heard on \\"Leper Messiah,\\" but instead an inaccurate, false pretence of it on tracks like \\"King Nothing.\\" The guitars no longer exude powerful emotion, like on the instrumental \\"To Live Is To Die,\\" but a weak representation of it on tracks like \\"Hero Of The Day.\\" Put in simpler terms: it actually SOUNDS sold out. <br /> <br />This just might have been forgivable if Metallica had at least tried to keep their old style, but unfortunately this is seemingly too much to hope for. The mad riffs, raging guitar solos, artistic songwriting and six-minute song structures which populated their old work is gone without a trace. In their place are instantly forgettable melodies, hooks and diluted, half-hearted (almost - dare I say it? - nu-metal) riffage. The whole thing is fixed at mid tempo, giving us exactly zero percent energy. The songs are also noticeably shorter, although the band has compromised here by increasing the number: indeed, this album is actually one of the longest I've heard, clocking in at 72 minutes. At the end of the day though, it feels more like they're prolonging the agony than anything - probably a good metaphor for their career at this point. And what the hell is up with James Hetfield's voice!? Rather than the gruff, badass vocals he used to offer, now he sounds like he's trying - and failing - to be Elvis! They did at least salvage one star because they still have a grasp on basic melody and musicality, but nowhere near enough to make a good album. <br /> <br />Face it people: the old Metallica is gone forever, they've sold out. It's a tragedy, but an undeniable tragedy. Ten years on from this abomination and they're still milking it. Their career wants to die, let's put it out of its misery. It's only got worse since this album, and all that's holding them up now is the knowledge that they were good once. Admit it: if \\"Load\\" was Metallica's debut album, no-one would have given them a second glance. I know I wouldn't have. <br /> <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's second album, Meteora is just as good as their rock/rap creation, Hybrid Theory. Meteora has solid, catchy, and listenable tracks. Some of my favorites include: Nobody's Listening, Faint, Numb, Hit the Floor, and Somewhere I Belong. It's kinda cool that this hard-rocking band don't serve out songs with cussing or obscene overtones. Linkin Park is a classy and respected band. Highly recommend this great and satisfying disc. Linkin Park rules!
0780626966|4.0|When you think of horror movies you have to be nuts to not think of Freddy Krueger. One of the ultimate heavy weights of the red screen has been brought to DVD in this box set for the fans and at an incredibly low price for 7 movies and an extra disc filled with bonus material.  <br /> <br />I've noticed Freddy has become more of an icon or symbol over the years rather then actually be in great movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting down the films, but a lot like Jason Voorhees it's more the icon that is liked rather then the movies.  <br /> <br />And no doubt about it Freddy is the Hulk Hogan of horror icons. He's one of my favourites and of the larger majority of horror movie fans. Even kids who haven't seen a Nightmare on Elm St movie seem to know who Freddy is. He's usually always referred to by name of Freddy Kruger unlike others who non-fans would describe like \\"that guy in the hockey mask\\" or \\"that mime guy\\", \\"the guy in a mask with a chainsaw\\". No, Freddy's never usually referred to as just \\"that dream guy with the knives on his glove\\" every one knows the name Freddy Krueger.  <br /> <br />All 6 NOES movies and the 7th (New Nightmare) plus the bonus disc come presented in a nice box with pop out cardboard over the two fronts that show Freddy smiling, and the new Freddy on the other side. The spines of the cardboard DVD's make up a picture of Freddy's back (pun intended I guess) and also included is a booklet about the 7 movies and 2 pairs of 3D glasses for the final sequence of Freddy's Dead.  <br /> <br />All the DVD's are presented in its original audio track and also another option for new 5.1 surround sound! Also the usual stuff of subtitles and all that. They all each contain ROM stuff for computers. They consist of the script to screen, a trivia game and some web links. Every disc contains a useless jump-to-a-nightmare in the bonus features section that just take to each death scene. Quite useless to me, may be good for some die-hard of die-hard fans or the obsessed fan of death scenes.  <br /> <br />(1) Nightmare On Elm St. <br />* * * *  <br />High-school student Nancy Thompson is having nightmares about a man with a burnt face, wears a hat, has a red and green striped sweater and wields a custom glove with knives attached. Nancy figures there just dreams until she discovers that a lot of other kids from her high school are not just having similar dreams, but experiencing the same dream. One by one the kids are dieing off around her and no adults want to believe her story. She doesn't want to sleep, but you can't stay awake forever, and Freddy's waiting for you in the dream world to not only haunt your nightmares, but create them for you.  <br /> <br />The first film is usually the one people say is the best. I'm not to sure which is my favourite, but without any doubt this is the most serious one. After the first couple the series became funnier and Freddy is a joking, laughing homicidal maniac. Where as in the first one he's a more serious and straightforward killer in the nightmare world.  <br /> <br />BONUS FEATURES <br />Audio Commentary from Robert Englund (Freddy), Heather Langenkamp(Nancy), John Saxon (L.T Thompson/Dad) & Wes Craven (Director) the commentary isn't too bad for fans interested in it. The most interesting thing was finding out that how Wes came up with the idea for the movie was actual clippings from newspapers that stated that kids in Thailand where actually not wanting to sleep from fear of being killed and there parents would drug them to sleep and they would end up dead! Also, Sean S Cunningham (Friday The 13th) filmed some of the shots for this movie for Wes! <br /> <br />Cast and crew biography's & Jump to a death scene (these appear on every disc) <br /> <br />(2) Freddy's Revenge. <br />* <br />It beats the s#!+ of me and leaves me saying, \\"f###d if I know what the second had to do with the 1st\\"? Its kind of amazing how the Freddy movies continued on after this one. It just had nothing to do with the first, didn't play on any of the same rules as part 1, and was just plain s#!+-house to me.  <br /> <br />I guess with the success of the first film they decided to just grab the first script someone could write and used it knowing no matter how bad it was it would make money. I personally list this movie as one of the worst of all time I hate it so much. <br /> <br />No Bonus features (only what I said is on every disc) <br /> <br />(3) Dream Warriors. <br />* * *  <br />Nancy from part 1 returns as a phycologist in a nuthouse to help Kirsten Parker (Patricia Arquette) who is having the same kind of dreams she did years ago. Along with a group of other kids experiencing problems, but all get pulled in to Kristen's nightmare. More is indulged into who Freddy is as he tackles a bunch of kids who try to fight back against the dream demon.  <br /> <br />This movie is so much better then the previous sequel. A few familiar faces like Laurence Fishburne (E.R, Matrix) & Patricia Arquette (Medium) make up some of the cast of this decent horror flick. <br /> <br />The interesting thing is this movie goes on an issue with a new experimental drug to help eliminate nightmares. Sound a bit like the plot of Freddy VS Jason! <br /> <br />No bonuses <br /> <br />(4) The Dream Master. <br />* * * <br />Kriston Parker returns and a bunch of new kids are sucked in for Freddy's prey. Same old plot of kids having nightmares, no one believes them, but don't let that throw you off thinking it's the same movie again: Same elements, but another enjoyable horror flick. As the kids die off, there powers go into Alice who is the one seriously effected by it all this time around.   <br /> <br />Interesting thing about this movie is the guy's dogs name is Jason. I'm sure you can guess what the tie-in is about. <br /> <br />No bonuses <br /> <br />(5) The Dream Child <br />* * * <br />Alice returns and the same things happen, as Freddy wants her to suck more people intoher dream. Only this time they have figured that they cant keep Freddy down till the find out some vital history about Freddy. He is the bastard son of 1001 maniacs who was conceived in the unfortunate accident of a sister/nun who accidentally was locked in a mental asylum of psychos. Alice's unborn son is helping her out in the dream world, and he wont be safe from Freddy either unless mom kicks his ass back to hell first.  <br /> <br />No bonuses <br /> <br />(6) Freddy's Dead \\"The Final Nightmare\\". <br />* * * <br />A lot like Jason Goes To Hell, it's discovered that the only way to truly get rid of Freddy is by having his own flesh and blood pull him out of the dream world and into the real world and kill him. Everything is also told about who Fredrick Krueger was when he was alive and why he does what he does now. Will Freddy finally be put to rest forever? Well, obviously not if he continues on in Freddy Vs Jason, but he went down for the count for 10 years.  <br /> <br />No bonuses (There is an option to jump to the 3D sequence like the jump to a death bits, but a chapter selection made into a stand alone option isn't a \\"bonus\\" feature to me.  <br /> <br />(6) New Nightmare <br />* * * * <br />I really liked this idea for stepping out of the movies and into the real world. Wes Craven explains to (who played Nancy) that Freddy is a demon that was caught in the movies, but once the movies stopped, he wanted out into the real world. Now ()'s son() is being stalked by the real Freddy in his dreams and she's in fear of his life. The movie is a great way to celebrate the almost 10th anniversary of ANOES by having this kind of reunion movie of the original stars plays out something similar to the first movie.  <br /> <br />It's different, it's refreshing and it's interesting.  <br /> <br />Bonus features. <br />- Commentary by Wes and the other junk found on every other disc.  <br /> <br />(7) Nightmare Series (Bonus Disc)  <br /> <br />- Primetime: An interview with Wes about how the Nightmare series began. Going into more detail about what he mentions in the commentary of the first film. A drunken guy from his childhood is whom Freddy is designed from and other various things that helped create the ideas and stories for Freddy. Then Robert Sho of New Line talking about why the helped to do the movie. Sean Cunningham talks about horror films distribution and directing and how ANOES came about. Then how the cast and crew came about and they thought of making the movies, what concepts and formulas where used, ideas, what happened, chemistry ect... <br /> <br />- Labyrinth: Follow a lot of arrows around rooms and select various things in different rooms to view small clips of behind the scene stuff, promotions, misc clips, Freddy saying this n that, interviews, MTV Freddy, Trailers, Pics and a bunch of random things. Also pick up some objects to do various crap. <br /> <br />- Index: everything you find above in the Labyrinth thing is found here as a simple list of movie by movie. I wish I'd known this before I played the Labyrinth because the above one became tiring after a while.
0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is a dark, depressing, haunting film that stays in your thoughts until it hurts to think. Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are extraordinary in Leaving Las Vegas. Cage received an Oscar and Shue got a much-derserved nomination for best actress. I have always admired and liked Shue, she is a real and talented actress, she is good in every role even if it is a crummy movie. Cage's performance just blew me away, I knew he could act in Peggy Sue got Married but this is best and most appreciated role. They have amazing chemistry, they are electrfying together. Director Mike Figgis did a wonderful job, the opening credits and the musical score are fantastic. Leaving Las Vegas can be hard to watch but this is real and important film. One of my favorite dramas of all-time. You have to see this one.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I consider my self a collector of rock music. I have been collecting rock albums for about 30 years now. I own over 500 vinyl records and over 2000 CDs. Through my many years of collecting music there have been certain albums that stick out as the best rock albums I have ever heard. Albums such as The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, Abbey Road by The Beatles, Nevermind by Nirvana, and London Calling by the Clash. With the purchase of Stadium Arcadium, I can say with one hundred percent certainty that this album will find its way up there with those essential rock records. I haven't heard a rock album this spectacular, this mind-blowing, and this perfect since the early 90's...certainly not since Cobain's death. The other Red Hot Chili Peppers albums were very good, especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Mother's Milk, but in no way were they this complete and expansive. This is the best double album ever made by far. Take it from somebody who owns hundreds of double albums including The Wall and All Things Must Pass. Every song on this album is truly breathtaking. Stadium Arcadium is one of those albums that will still be considered amazing thirty years from now.  <br /> <br />It's embarassing that rock lovers have had to wait this long for a truly definitive rock album. The rock genre has been on the backburner with the emergence of rap, teenie pop, and skater punk. It has been on a backwards spiral since the 70's when it was probably at its peak. At the start of the 90's it seemed as if rock was going to make a revival but the death of Cobain ended any chance of that happening. Since his death there has been literally nothing worth remembering. Rock bands with nothing substantial to hold on to are seemingly being churned out, mass produced, and selling millions of records without really offering anything. Bands such as Green Day, 3 Doors Down, and Coldplay arent true rock bands at all. A rock band is more than millions of fans and electric guitars. It's passion, energy, and spirit poured into music. Red Hot Chili Peppers, while they may have lost a little edge after Blood Sugar Sex Magik, have definately found they're way back to the top and proven themselves as the definative rock band today. Stadium Arcadium finds them at the top of their game. I highly reccomend this album for anyone who has been waiting for a great rock release and have not been satisfied. I guarantee you that this album will deliver the same feeling you get when you listen to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road. So please...put down that Green Day CD. Take Nickelback out of the stereo. Put this in and hear a true rock album from a true rock band. This is the best rock release in maybe the last 20-30 years. And it's not going anywhere.

Firefly is a sci fi that puts people, ...and very human people at that, at the centre of the story's universe. There are no rubber masked aliens or Star Trek style miracle technologies. There is no utopian Federation of Planets. There is a brutal and incompetent governing Alliance, indifferent to the problems of the settlers on the Outer Planets. This is frontier life in the raw.    I'm not sure if director Josh Wheedon meant it this way, but the central theme seems to be that times change, people don't. In the end it's your family and friends that keep you going. It'll be that way in the future too.     In the follow up movie (\\"Serenity\\"), near the closing scene, Firefly's captain Mal Reynolds says it's love that keeps the battered ship flying. It was the love of Firefly's fans, and the cast, for the series that enabled Wheedon to get the Serenity movie to take off, despite the network's premature cancellation of the series. But I think Josh was hinting at a deeper meaning.    Capt. Malcolm Reynolds:  \\"....You know what the first rule of flyin' is? Well I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.\\"  River Tam: \\"I do. But I like to hear you say it.\\"  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: \\"Love. You can know all the math in the 'Verse, but take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells ya she's hurtin' 'fore she keens. Makes her home.\\"  River Tam: \\"Storm's getting worse.\\"  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: \\"We'll pass through it soon enough.\\"
B000002MTR|2.0|I like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but this is by far one of the worst albums I own, of any band.  The only songs that keep me from rating this a 1 are \\"Aeroplane\\" and \\"Walkabout,\\" which are pretty good.  \\"Pea\\" is the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life.  I can't even listen to the last half of the album.  All in all I think I've only listened to it all the way through twice.  If you want some good RHCP, don't buy this CD.
B000000QG8|5.0|I saw Rory three times in Boston. He was great every time. He was the opening act for Dave Mason around 1978. Dave Mason made a big mistake. Rory just blew the crowd away. 30 minutes into Mason's act the crowd was still screaming for Rory to come back out. I think Mason must have been humiliated. He simply could not follow Gallagher's set. Jimi Hendrix would have had trouble following Gallagher. He was truly one of the great live acts of rock history. The man could play. In two other Boston appearances at the Paridise he ripped the place apart. He simply loved playing and he was just so very, very talented. It is shocking to me that a man of his ability and stage presence was never more popular. I took my college buddies to see Gallagher. They all said it was the best show they had ever seen and they had never even heard one of his albums. This guy didn't need any complicted production or double trackig he could play it straight up. This is a very good album, but it is almost impoosible to understand how good this guy was unless you saw him play live. He had that rare ability to just take the crowd where he wanted them to go. If you   want to hear a master, pick up this CD. If you can't hear the genius, then you just don't really understand ...
B0000024SD|5.0|I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth? Every reviewer forgets to mention \\"Outlaw Blues\\".

B000FL7CAK|5.0|NEWS UPDATE -- May 16, 2006:  Mike Ausiello of TV Guide has just posted that Rob Thomas e-mailed him that VERONICA MARS has been renewed for a third season and a full 22-episode order, that can be cut back to 13 if the ratings are low.  So get this DVD box set if you are a fan!  Lend it to friends!  Recruit new viewers!  Keep this great show alive!<br /><br />In its first season, VERONICA MARS established itself as one of the best new shows on TV and while it didn't attract many viewers, it nonetheless managed to gain a surprising amount of critical acclaim. First, Salon.com, in its annual salute on the best show neglected by the Emmys, awarded the Buffy (named for the most unjustly Emmy-neglected show of all time) to VERONICA MARS. Then, BUFFY's creator, Joss Whedon, wrote a review in Entertainment Weekly of the DVD release of VM. His memorable three-word summation: \\"Best. Show. Ever.\\" Finally, at the end of 2005 a host of TV critics gave their lists of the Top Five or Top Ten or just Top shows on TV. Right there among shows like LOST and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT was that Veronica show. And it deserved all the praise. As great as it had been in its first season, its second represented a great leap forward in the complexity of its narrative and the development of its characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what VERONICA MARS did not get was viewers. Despite the fact that pretty much the same people who would love VERONICA were those who love the mega-hit LOST, the geniuses at UPN decided to put this lovely show, which was still attempting to build an audience, against one of the highest rated shows on TV, targeted at much of the same group of people. There have been some astonishingly dumb decisions in the history of TV programming, but this definitely ranks up there. The results were predetermined: very few people watched VERONICA MARS. My two favorite shows on TV are VERONICA MARS and LOST. Weekly I was left with a dilemma. But let me confess this: after the halfway point in the season and before they moved VERONICA to Tuesdays, I found myself watching VERONICA MARS instead of LOST.<br /><br />Season Two largely centered around the mystery of what caused a bus crash in the very first episode, a bus crash that killed several of Veronica's classmates and a bus that Veronica would have been on except by sheer accident. Though there are a host of story arcs throughout the season, this is the central one around which the season as a whole is built. What delighted me was the wonderful complexity that evolved during the course of the year. One plausible culprit after another was introduced, one new clue after another, so that one week it seemed definite that one person was responsible for the crash, but another the following week. All the way up to the end I was concerned that perhaps things were getting too complex, but in the end things were resolved in wonderful fashion.<br /><br />In particular I want to praise two episodes. The finale, \\"Not Pictured,\\" was one of the finest season finales I have ever seen. There was a new shocker of some sort every five minutes to go with some of the most gut wrenching moments I have ever witnessed on TV. There were many moments that were almost too horrible to watch, so intense they were. The episode no only resolved the major plot arcs of Season Two, but also some unresolved ones from Season One. All in all, it was a thing of glory. I was also amazed by the episode \\"Donut Run,\\" in which Veronica matches wits with not only Sheriff Lamb (who is supposed to be an opening credits character in Season Three) but with two FBI agents, one of whom was portrayed by none other than Xena herself, Lucy Lawless. I indicated that I was going to keep this relatively spoiler free so I won't go into details, but I found this one of the most moving, exciting, delightful, and heart breaking episodes I've seen on TV. And it ends with a nod to its competitor in the same time slot, LOST, by ending with a close up of a note from a fortune cookie, which has just below the fortune Hurley's numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. On a similar note, two of my favorite shows had nods towards one another this season. On one of the final episodes of the comic masterpiece ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, George Michael asks Maebe if she would like to go watch [BLEEP] on TV. A subtitle explains that FOX had censored the name of a show on another network about a teen female detective. A few weeks later, on the episode \\"The Grapes of Graff,\\" Michael Cera, who played George Michael, appeared as a college tour guide, while Alia Shawkat, who played Maebe, portrayed a girl who was raped and had her head shaved, and who Veronica helps find her rapist.<br /><br />VERONICA MARS is the latest in a string of shows to appear in the past ten years to present female heroes. This is no longer as novel as it once was, which is a testimony to how effective these shows have been. Although the early part of the nineties saw Dana Scully on THE X-FILES and Xena on the show of the same name, it wasn't until BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that girl heroes really began to be accepted in a big way. Compare this to the entire prior history of TV. Prior to Dana Scully, once you tick off Emma Peel (who still stands up as one of the great female heroes of all time) and Wonder Woman and the Six Million Dollar Woman (who do not), you have pretty much exhausted the list. But after BUFFY you get Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max Guevera on DARK ANGEL, Sydney Bristow on ALIAS, and River Tam on FIREFLY and SERENITY (we actually see in the latter what she would have become on the former). These women all do the things that male heroes can do, and it is irrelevant that it is unrealistic to have women doing super empowered things. We overlook that what male heroes are just as unrealistic. It is simply a convention that we buy Superman and Batman and the Green Hornet and Caine, and merely a bias that women doing similar things were unacceptable. I cracked up reading about a female anti-feminist philosophy professor who expressed outrage that feminists might want Wendy and not Peter Pan fighting Captain Hook, as if a boy who could fly and fight a pirate were somehow more lifelike. After Buffy, Wendy was free to take on Hook.<br /><br />Then came Veronica. Unlike Buffy, she is not super powered. Unlike Sydney and Aeryn, she wasn't trained from earliest childhood to be a super warrior. Unlike River and Max, she isn't genetically altered. She is just a girl. What is her super power? Her wits. She does what she does simply by being smarter better than anyone else. These female heroes (I am intentionally avoiding using \\"heroine,\\" which I think usually is employed to indicate less of a hero than a male version) have helped alter popular imagery about what women can and cannot do. Before Buffy and Max and Veronica, maybe popular culture could promulgate myths about a woman's proper place being in the home taking care of her kids, but not now. Or, stealing the title from one of Season Two's best episodes, now \\"Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner.\\" Veronica is the ultimate 3rd Wave Feminist.<br /><br />What can you say about Kristen Bell? I honestly feel she deserves an Emmy nomination for Best Actress. She is an immensely gifted individual, and she doesn't even get to employ her singing and dancing skills (her background is in musical theater) on the show. She is a very tiny girl (I've read 5'1 in more than one place), but she is able to project so marvelously that it is almost impossible to believe that she is that small. She projects, \\"Tough chick.\\" She makes you believe that she can take on an entire motorcycle gang and somehow come out on top. Or the combined forces of a sheriff's department and the FBI. Yes, she is as cute as a button, but it is her toughness and resilience that you love about her character. No matter how many terrible things happen to Veronica, she is like a cork that just pops back to the surface. She is backed bya great supporting cast. You have to love Jason Dohring as Logan Echols, one of the more complex, hard to predict characters on TV. He is also great at delivering the one-liners the writers give him. For instance, in one episode this season Veronica, wearing her restaurant uniform, rushes to get on an elevator, only to find Logan on it (this is at one of the periods where she and Logan are fairly hostile to one another).<br /><br />Logan: Hi ho.<br />Veronica (mildly shocked): What?<br />Logan: Hi ho, its off to work we go.<br /><br />The show contains reams of great dialogue like that. Another supporting character I want to mention is Enrico Colantoni, who excels as Veronica's father Keith. The two exhibit a rare father-daughter chemistry and comprise one of the great such relationships on TV. One character as hard to read as Logan is Weevil, played by Francisco Capra. Though he plays the ultimate outsider, Capra is the ultimate Hollywood insider, the grandson of studio exec Frank Capra Jr. and the great grandson of Hollywood legend Frank Capra.<br /><br />The BUFFY connections multiplied this season. Charisma Carpenter joined the show as a frequent guest star, playing Kendall Casablancas, a gold digger who seems a lower-class Cordelia Chase. It is certain that she will be back for Season Three (that is only a mild spoiler). Alyson Hannigan returned as Logan's sister Trina. There was even a moment when Kendall and Trina had an encounter. Hosts of fans were flashing on Willow and Cordy in the Sunnydale library. Finally, Joss Whedon himself did a cameo as an obnoxiously self-important rental car manager. Whedon wasn't the only celebrity to make a cameo. Early in the season director Kevin Smith played a fast food clerk, while the lead singers for both the Dandy Warhols (who perform \\"We Used to Be Friends\\") and Spoon sang on karaoke night in the restaurant where Veronica works (with Britt Daniel of Spoon appropriately singing along to Elvis Costello's \\"Veronica\\").<br /><br />On May 18th the CW-the result of a merge of UPN and the WB-will announce their new schedule. Though VM's ratings were terrible, the critical raves and the quality of the show seem certain to make this magnificent show one of the flagship shows on the new network.

B000AADYUI|5.0|Blows Against the Empire is the greatest album of all time. That's no exageration, no hyperbole, nothing. If you dig the idea of leaving the States and going off somewhere, anywhere, you'll love the album. If Sci-Fi is your bag, you'll love the album. Every song is well thought out and very good. Very good. I reccomend listening to the first ten tracks only the first time you listen to this album, because the last five are extra tracks, so you need to get a feel for the original message before enjoying the bonus stuff. Enjoy the CD's great liner notes, cover art, and message.  <br /> <br />Peace
B000EHRVP6|3.0|\\"Hostel\\" is quite a step up from \\"Cabin Fever\\" for writer/director Eli Roth.  He seems to take his characters and their development quite a bit more serious than in his previous effort.  I actually felt some attachment to Jay Hernandez' character once he realizes what's happening in this tale.  With that said, however, I wouldn't rank \\"Hostel\\" among the top thrillers or horror flicks in the genre.<br /><br />First off, just having a lot of gore and blood pumped on to the screen doesn't make a film scary.  Many of today's horror fanatics seem to believe that, but those are the same people who cut their teeth on \\"horror\\" like the \\"Scream\\" series and the later, lesser \\"Friday The 13th\\" and \\"Halloween\\" sequels.  Introduce these same people to films such as the original and remake of \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" and they'll get a little better dose of terror.  These films actually had terror and suspense in them coupled with the gore.  In my opinion, gore is nothing more than icing on the cake.  I've seen plenty of gory films that weren't even as scary as \\"Jurassic Park.\\"<br /><br />Another thing that drops \\"Hostel\\" down a notch is that it lacks a true hero or heroine in the story.  Sure, Hernandez does attempt to save a fellow torture victim, but before all of this his a typical, American butthole.  You know these types of people, they believe that the world is their oyster and mommy and daddy will always be there to bail them out.  Though Hernandez' character does sort of capture me in the end, he just isn't a likeable enough character who I'd want to cheer on.  In fact, his friend played by Derek Richardson is a more likeable guy.<br /><br />Some of the finer points of this flick include the fact that there is no one bad guy.  The baddies are folks wealthy enough to pay to torture and kill someone for their own pleasure.  None of these characters are of the enjoyable type.  One of the sickest sequences in the film isn't someone being dismembered, but it's the interaction between Hernandez and a soon-to-be torturer describing how great the rush is of offing somebody.  The guy has no remorse or concern in his eye, just the urge to feed his addiction.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how Roth constantly tipped off the viewer of the impending doom for the primary characters.  Slight looks to each other, creepy train passengers, and even the gloominess of Slovakia all pose as wonderful harbingers of what is to come.<br /><br />In the end, we have a solid attempt by Roth to seek out the bowels of mankind.  He almost attains it, but focuses too much on gore and leaves the solid and potentially great plotline to drown in a pool of its own blood.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of the gore genre and Roth's first flick, \\"Cabin Fever.\\"raction between Hernandez and a soon-to-be torturer describing how great the rush is of offing somebody.

0790729970|3.0|So the other night I said to my sister, hey, remember 'The Mask'? <br />So, well, she like flipped out. So we rented it right away. We went to the video store and there were all these people there, and we had to pay late fees. <br />So then we watched it and we hadn't seen it in years. And we were kinda upset because when we were little our mom made this edited version where she taped over all the nasty parts... like... a crest commercial would suddenly come on. It's because our brother might become a womanizer if he saw a girl flipping her hair around. like the part where the guy tries to lick the girl, and the part where the dog pees on the guy and you see his weener. Nolla kept saying \\"I never saw this part, I never saw this part\\"  I think the worst part was that we had no idea that cameron diaz was even IN it until we watched it the other night. Anyway, it was kinda good. I liked that it made sense. Actually... i don't know why we even watched it at all when we were kids. It was mostly mouthwash and juice commercials anyway. Maybe we were all just stupid.
B000000H64|5.0|When I first listened this CD (back in 1996), I really felt captivated by it. I mean, this is a conceptual album, where you can imagine yourself standing inside a huge, cold and dark factory, with gears and strings moving continuously... well, its hard to describe the feeling, but all I can say, is that this CD established the base of industrial metal. Although the high riffing speeds, some samples and background synthesizers, this album is minimalist in the sense that there is no guitar solos, polirythmic patterns or complex harmonies... is the sound of four human machines creating a cold and dark ambient. Redefining again the '90s metal sound. Sadly to say, Fear Factory wasn't able to repeat this atmosphere in their further works.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Daft Punk brought on a more Dance/Rock approach with their album \\"Human After All\\" and did it well. The only thing that is stopping me from giving this album a solid 5 stars is the fact that the CD is too reptitive. <br /> <br />If you are new to Daft Punk I would recommend buying \\"Discovery\\" or the four tracks I listed at the end of this review. <br /> <br />All songs on this album are very enjoyable and listenable for fans of Dance. \\"Technologic\\"'s lyrics basically follow the bass of the song and are very nice! \\"Make Love\\" is one of the two kind of slower songs on the album along with \\"Emotion.\\" \\"Emotion\\" is the best on the album if you ask me. <br /> <br />Stand-out tracks: <br />Robot Rock <br />Make Love <br />Technologic <br />Emotion
B000EULJLU|2.0|If you are a hardcore Tool fan the way I was and really dug Aenima and Undertow then this probably isn't the album for you.  I was disappointed with Lateralaus and even more disappointed with 10,000 Days.  The album is just soft.  I think Tool is on the Metallica path and will soon be recording Brittney Spears covers.  I know it's sad but it's true.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Did anyone really think they were totally going morph into <br />what they used to be........good.  If you are a fan of artists that <br />has soul such as: Bob Marley, John Coltrane, James Brown, Miles Davis, Fela Kuti, Parliament/Funkadelic, Frank Zappa, Marvin Gaye, The Beatles, Sly and the Family Stone, Santana(old), The Meters..etc then you will laugh at this album.  It really is hard to think that these are the same four human beings that made blood sugar sex magik. Although I don't think anything they could have made could top bssm this one doesnt even come close, even the cover art is lame and unoriginal. Instead of coming up with 28 tired tracks they should have made about 5 excellent ones. I would be alot more excited to see that.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This movie is SO GOOD! <br />I really like frodo and his inner struggle! It gives my life meaning! <br /> <br />five large heavy stars!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I think that this album was sick. I was worried that the songs on this new album wouldn't be like the old rhcp's hardcore funk in your face rock, but i was wrong. These songs are still hard rocking but they have slower spots in them like the verses but they kick it up in the chorus. Songs like tell me baby (fast verses slow/fast chorus), storm in a teacup (hardrocking like the song otherside), dani california, readymade (very audioslaveish), charlie, and hump de bump(very funky) are really hardrockin and good to listen to. Other recomened songs warlocks, shes only 18, torture me, especially in michigan, com'n girl, made you fell better, 21st century, and so much i (really good to head bang to). Alot of fleas bass lines are totally sick, and Johns guitar solos are intoxicating, and chad's drums are a really good complement to it all. Anothy's singing is much better than their earlier albums too. There are also many slower and quieter songs like stadium arcadium, wet sand, hard to concentrate, we believe, hey, desecration smile, strip my mind, she looks to me, and slow cheetah. I compare those to by the way's tear, i could die for you, and dont forget me (all of which are very good). All the songs on stadium arcadium are very rocking though some of them have been slowed down. But thats alright with me because the lyrics are still good and its fun to sing them when nobody is looking. The longest song, turn it again, (6:06) is a great song and dont be afraid of the length the music and lyrics are so rocking that you wont even think of the length of the song. What i also liked was that the lyrics still rhyme, its knida like listening to a hard rocking rap song, which is a kinda a rhcp trademark. This makes the songs very fun, and enjoyable to listen to anytime of the day.  I think the only thing i wish there was more of (besides more songs) is that i kinda wish anthony keidis swore a little bit more (he only swears in one song, tell me baby). To me those kind of lyrics remind me of there older songs. In the song tell me baby he swears in the second verse ,which is very fast, and that part of the song really reminds me of an earlier rhcp song like me and my friends. Never the less i highly recomend it, the chilis are back funkier and better than ever. If you're a true peppers fan youll look past the new changes ( which are still very excellent) and pick this album up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never knew this show even existed when it came out. I just recently found out about it when I watched Serenity. A friend let me borrow his FireFly DVD's to watch. My wife and I ended up watching the entire season in a weekend. We just couldnt stop watching them. We even went through a second time and half of a third through the next few weeks. Friend wanted them back, now I am purchasing my own along with Serenity. <br /> <br />I do like sci-fi stuff and this is like none other I can think of. The show has a very good sense of humor. I think all the actors did a great job with their characters, they each have their own pesona and they all fit together wonderfully. <br /> <br />I can see why this show would have been canceled not starting from the begenning. It can be kind of confusing and you dont get a real chance to meet the characters. Start with the very first one and I bet you will keep watching like we did.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|The central issue of this film is whether or not the \\"eye for an eye\\" approach to terrorism simply adds fuel to the fire, which, when you think about it, this theology of retribution is what has poisoned the world since Cain whacked Abel. With the clarity of hindsight, Spielberg's nerve-wracking account of the revenge visited upon the Arab murderers of Munich makes the case quite boldly that, as Eric Bana's character points out, when you kill off these villains, more and worse replace them. It's a bit like cancer, isn't it? You think you have it irradicated, then a relapse, only it's worse. Perhaps this was the defining flash point, in much the same way that Derry & Bloody Sunday ignited the Northern Ireland bloodbath. If so, certainly the world was never the same after Munich. <br />The world's never the same after any human tragedy of such unrelenting violence, be it Bosnia, WW2, Viet Nam, 9-11. There's no shortage of trigger points that would seem to argue for us to consider another way of dealing with such deep and festering ills, but don't. Well, all but for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which it mat come to before the Middle East becomes enlightened, as it were. <br />As for the film, it's a very gripping and powerful story. The actors are remarkable in their roles - from Eric Bana, to the little girl who plays the daughter of one of the Muslim lynchpins of Munich, each and every character is spot on. Bana delivers a soulful portrayal of a man who arrives at a moral crossroads, or perhaps, more accurately, realizes he has crossed an immoral threshold, especially when one of his colleagues, the bombmaker, pleads for justice as an obligation that must be revered and honoured. There are many disturbing moments throughout the film, and the toll they take on Bana become so heavy you'll find yourself not bearing up very well under their weight. For me, it was the murder of the Dutch spy on her boat. The obscenity of the revenge will knock the wind out of you. I'm still quite upset by it. <br />Daniel Craig is frighteningly menacing as a Jewish assasin who has no moral qualms about the job he must do. He is, in many ways, the ideological antipode to Bana: one becomes less convinced and one becomes more convinced of the ethics of their assignment as the killings go on and the counterattack from the Muslims seeks to trump them. Duplicity abounds among the hidden players, most notably the Americans. At some point, even though this is just a movie, you wonder when the US citizenry will wake up to the way their governments repeatedly play both sides of the street. Give the Israeilis their due: they mean what they say. For the matter, so do the Muslim extremists, but Bush will figure that out when Iran strikes back. Back here in the early 70's, when terrorism honestly shocked you as abhorrent, the opportunity to consider how to redress the roots of this issue pass. Bana and an Arab extremist share a safe-house in one of the most ironic sequences of the story. The Arab resolve to never give in resonates with Bana's character. For Craig's character, that is simply a call to go to the mattresses and deliver the final blow, for Bana, it underscores the vicious circle they have all played themselves into. <br />Craig is superb. This bodes well for the next James Bond film, if the franchise owners can manage to hire a writer who can deliver a story instead of an infomercial. He went from this film to LAYER CAKE, one of the best Britfilms ever. Hopefully, he will insist on the edgy danger he seems to generate. <br />I did not get the edition with all the special stuff on it, but I'm told it's as well. The special edition apparently tends to cheapen the experience of the ethical questions this film raises. Better it should be so hard to find. <br />In the end, I can't help but hear \\"Blood On The Rooftops,\\" the Steve Hackett song from Genesis' WIND AND WUTHERING CD of the mid-70's: <br />            \\"Seems Helen of Troy <br />             has founda new face, today.\\"
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After suffering through years of mediocre to good rock albums, RHCP return with a full blown masterpiece. The songs are layered, the musicianship is exceptional, and nearly every track is a gem. This is their best album since \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\". Between Flea's inspired bass riffing, John Frisciante's spirit lifting guitar solos, Chad Smith's great percussion work, and Anthony Kiedis's shifting and impressive vocal work, Stadium Arcadium makes it evident that this is a veteran band at the peak of their talents. Yes, it's more laid back then previous albums but get past that and you'll realize it's still on of the best albums to come out in years.
B000CNDIZE|3.0|Like Emiliana Torrini's album, The Fisherman's Wife, Sia makes is another subtle entry into the atmospheric category with Colour the Small One. Released more than a year after it's U.K. debut,Sia's songs have been featured on Six Feet Under and Grey's Anatomy. For some, her murmured songs may not have been even a blip on their radar, but for others her emotional moaning could be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />The song begins with \\"Rewrite\\" with a promising Psapp-like backdrop. The lyrics, however, are cliche and you can find yourself finishing them without even listening to the song. While she attempts to match her varying emotions with the tempo of the song, it never gains the momentum it should and is rather mediocre.<br /><br />If you can keep your eyes open throughout the first song, you are in for some real treats. \\"Sunday\\" and \\"Breathe Me\\" are the two album standouts. The former is soft and melodic as she seductively soothes you to rest. The second is melancholy and haunting. Both are powerful.<br /><br />The momentum comes to a screeching halt with \\"Bully.\\" Despite the sweet melody, it offers zero variablity to the point where you think you are listening to the same line over and over again.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Potato\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" are likeable tracks. I, however, challenge you to remember them after the album is finished. \\"Natale's Song,\\" like the lyrics, bring \\"peace to me\\" and is another soothing naptime reccomendation.<br /><br />Finding influence in the chilled-out electronica music Sia produced with Zero 7, \\"Moon\\" is another winning track, but I'd pass on \\"The Church of Whats Happening Now\\" where we finally get to see Sia belt it out. To the listener's dismay, however, the song is just as boring as some of her more breathy tracks.<br /><br />The album finishes off relatively strong with \\"Numb\\" and \\"Where I Belong.\\" After being introduced to a subdued artist, the latter track feels out of place on the album, however, with its complex and loud background instrumental. It works, though, and is a nice strong finish.<br /><br />While none of the other tracks on the album feature the same force as \\"Sunday\\" and \\"Breathe Me,\\" the album showcases a potential powerhouse. Or potential breathysubtlepowerhouse, should I say? Given another album, she may be able to take on the likes of Torrini or Dido. For now, with the exception of a few tracks, she just blends in with the rest.<br /><br />Grade : C+ (78)<br /><br />Download : Sia - Sunday, Sia - Breathe Me, Sia - Where I Belong<br /><br />Skip It : Sia - Bully, Sia - The Church of What's Happening Now, Sia - Rewritelex and loud background instrumental.

B00004YZFR|5.0|GIMME SHELTER is one of those rare movies that captures the attention of so many people, yet for so many different reasons. Whether you tend to focus on the music, the violence, the '60s peace/love/dope mystique, or the sheer fascination of seeing all three converge in one place at the same time, this movie is, as so many others have called it, a 'must see.'     There have been so many great observations made here that I won't insult your intelligence with any feeble attempts at waxing philosophical or trying to seem more intellectual than I am, BUT.... there have been quite a few things said that provoke so many different thoughts in me that I felt compelled to chip in my two cents (for which some will no doubt say I am still overcharging!)    Being a rabid Stones fan, I will try to be as honest and objective as I can and not allow my pro-Stones bias to show through. To that end, I have to agree with those who thought the Stones didn't bring their 'A' game to the Altamont show. This is not even considering the fact that their performance was constantly interrupted, if not outright aborted. They just sounded out of sync to me, and were out of tune and disorganized much of the time. In their defense (here comes my Stones bias again...), they very well may have been witness to some of the chaos and anarchy that had gone down prior to their appearance, and were understandably tentative about even taking the stage, much less being inclined to give 100% of their focus on the music. I can't say I blame them for that, although I do disagree with the posters who have said the Stones have never sounded better, or even that they sounded great. To my ear, the only thing 'great' was that it was the Stones! Any other legendary band that sounded that off, however, I would be sitting here panning right now! I'm also a bit surprised that Mick and the gang (especially Mick, though) allowed this film to be released, as it does show him to be woefully impotent when trying to settle the crowd down. He had completely lost whatever small amount of control he had on them. It almost looked like a Saturday Night Live parody of the Stones, and was actually quite humorous, the way Mick would attempt to use his god-like influence on the crowd and expect them to comply just because he asked them to, and then when that didn't work, would mince and prance around the stage in an obviously forced manner in order to make it appear as though all was well, and that none of this was really happening. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I actually saw some humor in that. It was also painful for me to watch.    Another aspect of the movie that shocked me is one that I can only describe as disturbing, and one that still haunts me everytime I think of it. That being the image of an obese, drugged out hippie lumbering through the crowd stark naked with half the crowd accepting it outright (hey, he's 'doing his own thing, man!') and the other half pretending to not notice the 800 lb gorilla in the living room (if you'll pardon THAT analogy, lol!) But that shock to my sensibilities paled considerably when compared with the guy standing on the edge of the stage and obviously on one hellaciously 'bad trip' as he snarls and growls at the band. The camera focused on this weirdo for almost two full minutes and it was IMPOSSIBLE to take my eyes off this human train wreck. I could feel the pit of my stomach start turning the longer I watched him. If these visuals are an advertisement for the merits of bad acid, I'll stick with Budweiser, thank you very much!    Then, there is the ongoing debate on this forum (well, it's become a forum, anyway. I think we're supposed to be reviewing the movie. Okay, I give it 5 stars. It's classic!) Anyway, this debate revolves around whether or not Meredith Hunter is a victim of murder (the hippy version) or justifiable homicide (the Hell's Angels version). Me? After viewing the incident a few times on this DVD, I'm still not sure! Too manythings going on to be sure. One thing is certain, the previous reviewer who said Hunter had no gun is full of crap. A stop frame clearly shows he is brandishing a heater, then we see a biker attack him with a knife and chaos reigns. What the hell Hunter was going to do with the gun, I can only speculate, but my gut instinct tells me he didn't bring it as a conversation piece. He was clearly aiming it toward the stage. I tend to agree with those who call it justifiable homicide, but then I have no knowledge of what provoked him, although I doubt that anything short of self-defense would justify his packing heat, and I seriously doubt that was the case.    Thankfully, I am almost done with my ramblings. This final thought comes from the 'WTF were they thinking?' dept. Mick, say it ain't so! The HELLS freaking ANGELS as SECURITY!?!? Isn't that a bit like hiring Michael Jackson as a babysitter? Come on!! I guess the fact that Jerry Garcia was a good friend of the Hells Angels in general and Sonny Barger in particular was good enough for Mick and his mates. What a brain fart that turned out to be! The funniest thing of all though is that when the aforementioned Garcia saw the type of 'security' that Barger and his mates were dishing out, errr... providing, he pieced it all together, said 'peace out' to the peaceniks and got the hell out of there fast. I find that funny, too.     Yep, 5 stars. I thought this was a poignant, thought-provoking and darned entertaining film. Peace out.
B000EULJLU|5.0|All the naysayers on this review page are high on crack.  Anyone who expects a band to be the absolute same with no evolution in style and expression of art should return this cd and wait for the next Aerosmith album. <br /> <br />10,000 Days is a sonically brilliant album with subtle nuance and passion.  While older tool albums have tended to be dark, oppressive, and violent, 10,000 Days is a starkly real album, devoid of the pretense and heavy use of metaphor that dominates the majority of the older albums.  Maybe they just got tired of waiting for those folks in the allegorical cave to realize the shapes on the cave walls were actually just shadows dancing across the light from the outside world?  Who knows.  The music is similar to Lateralus and the shares the grandeur of Salival, so yes, the songs are long.  Ah, remember the days when our attention spans were actually longer than a few minutes?  Gee, those were great times.  With this album, we get what we paid to get, so expect heavy drum and bass in alternate timing, heavy effects-driven guitar, and the ever ethereal voice of good ol' Reverend Maynard.  Also, the CD case is a really neat-o eye-twisty game, so have fun and remember to relax your eyes. <br /> <br />If you understand the importance of art as a cathartic method of invoking an emotive response, then ignore the naysayers who want only to be deafened by the latest piece of 3-and-a-half minute, heavy-rotationed, wannabe rock music that pervades our collective listening ears.  There once was a time when long orchestration and complexity in music was considered a \\"good thing\\".  And that's what you get with 10,000 dDays: a good thing.

This book is a core integration of a topic with too many diverse starting points (mine was digital filters derived from Prony's method, not in the book by name). Dr. Bose was my first EE Professor. Alan Oppenheim was my second EE instructor. Alan (just finished MSEE at the time) had not published a book yet, but his focus was always on your questions. His product was your understanding. If this book is for your shelf, it will not harm it. If this topic is for your mind, this book was meticulously written for you.  Lance Webb, PhDEE
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time. The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.  <br /> <br />I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience. That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions. For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!! There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American \\"unwashed\\". We must not forget the \\"casting couch\\" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.  <br /> <br />As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations. The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendours  <br />existing north of our common border.  <br /> <br />The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding. Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family will tug at your heart and your mind. Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time. HE should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Actor but then Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of TrumanCapote was very tough competition indeed. It is too bad there was not a tie vote because they both demonstrated their consummate mastery of the art of acting.  <br /> <br />The female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential.  <br /> <br />Every aficianado of fine cinema should run out to get this DVD and you don't have to be gay to appreciate its qualities. It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages.  <br /> <br />Very, very highly recommended for ALL sexual persuasions.  <br /> <br />TIMOTHY WINGATE Ottawa CANADA
0062502182|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring books I read.  Good story, applies to life.  The only part I don't care for is that talking with wind and sun thing.  It's a little bit too dramatic, but it is fine because the author is trying to get a way to talk deeper about some topics. <br /> <br />I would suggested this book.  At least it reminds you about your young dreams.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I read a recent review from a thoughtful reviewer who made the point that if you are only interested in the old DT stuff, this might not be the album for you.  I agree.  I've been a fan of DT for 20 years, and they have not disappointed me.  This is just one more album where they continue to evolve without losing that underlying element of musicianship (if there is such a word) that is common throughout all of their albums.  I'm not sure how this one slipped past me when it came out, but now that I have it, I'm not disappointed.  I just caught their 20th Anniversary tour in March 2006.  Their live show is every bit as powerful and fun as the live albums have led us to expect from them. <br /> <br />In short, yes, Dream Theater's sound is evolving, but this album demands your attention every bit as much as the early stuff.  Maybe the people who didn't like it were making the mistake of trying to listen to it as background music.  DT has never been background music, and this album proves that again. <br /> <br />If you like DT, buy this album.  It's nothing short of great.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|now, let me point out that this is the first non-rock album that i have ever bought. the reason? all of the pop/hip-hop stuff is the same, you hear one song you hear them all. then i heard the single 'crazy' and i had to hear more. i bought this album on day one, and it hasn't come out of my cd player yet. the tracks are all original and very, uh... unique. there are usually one or two songs that i skip on my cds, but in a nice turn of events, i dont have to fast forward thorugh anything! one word of advice, however, is to skip over the song 'transformer' if you have children with you, as it does have a couple of swear word, including the f-bomb. all-in-all, this is a must have
B000E97HIA|5.0|I've been consistently listening to Prince since I was 14 and I'm 35 now. His talent and well rounded genius has been well established so I won't go into that. He's simply a gift.  <br /> <br />3121? A masterpiece ! ! I suggest you pay close attention to: <br /> <br />Lolita - A song in favor of monogamy and commitment in this day and age. If you feel like your tempting yourself . . . listen to the song.  <br /> <br />Black Sweat - Super, Super HOTT !! - There's so much there. The first note of music heats you up. Then you hear his voice; rough, smooth, fast, slow... Then the message. The confidence in his voice - S-E-X-Y.  <br /> <br />The Word - A spiritual message. Calm down. Get yourself together before you listen to it. Praise and worship at its best ! ! Allow it to move you towards your personal spiritual quest. Don't take it literally. I say again, don't over analyze. Don't analyze. There are some things in there best left to themselves.  Flow with it. The music is slamming, the over all message, moving. Did I mention he's a genius?  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I am not ashamed to admit that I saw this at the movies 41 times. Each time I saw it, it seemed like the audience viewing it with me was totally different demographically from the times before.  This is my new all-time favorite film.  I respect the opinions of the people who say they hated it and that it was 2-1/4 hours of their lives wasted.  I respect that opinion; I just don't understand it.  The acting is great, the scenery is great and it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  I guess it's also a matter of personal opinion whose performance was better, Heath's or Jake's.  From a technical standpoint, Heath Ledger nailed the role of his career.  Ennis Del Mar was a more nuanced character and had several more shades of grey than that of Jack Twist.  However, Jake Gyllenhaal's talent can't be denied and I think in some ways I was able to embrace his character much more easily than Heath's.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Munich was by far the best film of 2005 and should have won best picture at the Oscars. Munich is about how terrorism effects society and the lengths a nation will go to protect its citizens and destroy the terrorists. Yet, the terrorists are not made to seem \\"evil.\\" The terrosrists are viewed as heroes in their homelands and the director takes the effort to depict both sides of the conflict. The themes are dark, the violence is beyond graphic, and there are no happy endings. I must say that Munich was a hard film to watch but living in a post 9/11/01 era, it is an important film to watch.
B000003S5H|5.0|A classic is something most people remember and continue to enjoy. In the music world, it also relates to a CD or album that is near perfect in tracks that are likeable. <br />Along with other personal favorites, Parallel Lines by Blondie and the B-52's first album, I consider Moon Safari to be a classic album of the slightly retro 70's electronic genre (if there is such a classification). <br />It is now 7 years since this CD was introduced and hearing a track like \\"Sexy Boy\\" at a NY lounge or \\"All I want\\" from the sound system at Outback Steakhouse is refreshing. This is perfect music for romantic encounters or laying in the tub with candles around. <br />If you heard a track or two from this CD...and liked it... do not hesitate...get it! <br />Now I want to find my CD and put it on!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It is unfortunate that people's innate prejudice towards homosexuality leads them to go into this movie with a closed mind. Too many of the reviewers seemed to have already made their mind up before even seeing this film. I went into this movie without expecting much either way. Needless to say, I was very impressed. The principle thing that stands out in my mind is Ang Lee's ability to convey so eloquently the conflicting love that these two men feel towards one another. Nothing ever feels forced, or in your face... more than anything you feel the resistance of the characters at every turn. This is what true love should really feel like, and it shows. Love can have no bounds, and seem impossible to restrain. This movie is a perfect example of this. I would gather that the same situation between people in a heterosexual light would gather rampant praise from all the homophobic people in this society. It is sad to say that they couldn't open their minds enough to appreciate the beauty of the film. Look, I can understand someone being put off by males kissing or what have you... but to those people I suggest maybe reading the short story that the movie was based off of first. The message is what is important, no matter how you obtain it.  <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />Excellent acting  <br />Beautiful cinematography  <br />Excellent neutrality that leaves it up to the viewer to decide (although if you aren't swayed at least a little bit, the only explanation is a complete rejection of the story on your part)  <br />Great critique of the unnecessary sense of masculinity that affects both straight and gay males alike  <br /> <br />Cons:  <br />The initial sexual encounter between Jack and Ennis may be too quick for people who are not prepared  <br /> <br />I think this is one of those movies that you really just have to see for yourself, rent it if you must. But if you really want a piece of art that will force other people in your own life to question their own stereotypesor even hatred towards other people, just buy it.
B00005REQR|5.0|Gong's first release for Virgin Records was released in 1973 and marks Pt. I of Daevid Allen's masterwork, the Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy.  The other albums in the trilogy include Pt. II Angels Egg (1973), and my personal favorite, Pt. III You (1974).  Sadly, Daevid Allen left Gong after the You album, taking his hilarious and seemingly magical world of protagonist Zero the Hero, Pot head pixies, octave doctors, crystal machines, and the like with him.<br /><br />The six tracks on this great album range in length from 1'51\\" to 11'52\\" and feature an excellent blend of synth heavy space rock, space whispers, really silly (and fun) absurdist humor, prog rock rave-ups, jazz rock, and all around excellent individual and ensemble playing.  Speaking of which, although this lineup is not the classic Gong lineup featured on Angels Egg and You, all of the band members are excellent and a few of the elements that made those later albums incredible are in place.  Specifically, newly acquired guitarist extraordinaire Steve Hillage and synthesizer player Tim Blake had signed on.  In fact, Tim Blake's spacey VCS3 and mini moog synthesizer work really makes this album work for me and he is highlighted on the short synth piece The Octave Doctors and the Crystal Machine.  In addition to bandleader Daevid Allen (guitars, vocals) and space whisperer/Welsh poet Gilli Smyth, former Magma bassist Fancis Moze, Didier Maherlbe (saxophone, flute), and excellent drummer Laurie Allen played on this album.<br /><br />OK, now for the bad stuff.  Although the music on this album is incredible, the 2005 remastering effort by Charly is simply atrocious and it appears that Flying Teapot may have in fact been remastered in a back alley.  The cover art is \\"pixelly\\" and grainy and it appears that the cover art may have been simply scanned from \\"Joe's copy\\" and then edited by someone who did not have a clue as to what they were doing.  Even the inner photos appear to have been scanned and are also grainy and \\"pixelly\\".  In fact, one of the images appears to have been borrowed from the remastered version of Angel's Egg issued by EMI.  The sound quality is also terrible, and has all of the texture and dynamic range you might expect from a beat up cassette tape (made in 1973) being played on a cheap, portable tape recorder at a distance of 300 meters.  Specifically, the overall sound is low and muffled, and there are points where there is severe distortion.<br /><br />I will not however, let the clowns over at Charly ruin this fantastic album for me and I will still give this album a five star rating in spite of it all.  For those of you that are not as forgiving and cannot overlook these problems, I would strongly urge you to look around and track down another version.<br /><br />All in all, this album is highly recommended along with Camembert Electrique (1971), Angel's Egg (1973), and You (1974).

B000F1IQN2|5.0|It's thought provoking, it's balanced and director Stephen Spielberg doesn't waste anytime getting to the heart of the issues or the action. Munich works on a number of levels as an audacious political statement, a tense thriller, and an inspiringly brutal look at two peoples forever caught up in a cycle of violence, constantly drowning in a sea of their own blood.     It's a bleak vision and Spielberg carries it off beautifully, providing us with a clipped and tight back-story, where the Palestinian terrorists invade the Olympic village in Munich, killing two members of the Israeli team and taking another nine as hostages.     The Israeli response is swift and fast with Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) authorizing a top-secret assassination campaign which will carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack. It is left to the hunky Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) to emotionally and strategically shoulder most of the burden.     The team is a seemingly innocuous and innocent mix. Daniel Craig's Steve is the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, often clashing with Ciaran Hinds' Carl, the cleanup man. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler).     As Avner cooks dinner, they all get to know one another, hashing out the fine details and the boarder implications for themselves and for the Jewish state. And so the methodological killing begins, yet as Munich progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas.     This is a world where the rule of the law is superfluous and where allegiances are none, the only constants are mistrust, paranoia, and the need to find more names, which inevitably comes at a price. No one is ever who they are, a drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB or the seductress at the hotel bar might be a hit woman.     Spielberg wisely avoids any soapbox speeches, but he does allow his characters to present both sides of the argument: At a safe house in Athens, Avner is confronted with a young Arab who tells him if the desperate need for a Palestinian homeland, a place they can call their own. And back in Israel, Avner's mother tells him that Israel is their land, finally they have a home and they will fight to keep it.     In Munich the themes are universal - the moral imperatives of violence, and in what circumstances can one justify such senseless murder. As Avner and his colleagues continue their operation, they become psychologically immune to it all.     Yes - the operation may be successfully carried out, but how long will it be before righteous anger - the anger of the Israelis - can be continued before stumbling into bloody-mindedness? The irony is that in demonizing these Palestinian terrorists, they are themselves acquiring similar gruesome aspects.     It's all about the cycle of violence, a common problem that has plagued the Middle East for generations and will probably continue to do so.  Munich deftly shows that everyone has their reasons for hating the other side - whether it is religious intolerance, or the fight over land rights - everyone ultimately thinks they're right, but such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people whatever side of the fence you are on.

B0002858YS|5.0|A friend lent me this CD and I had no idea what to expect... Oh my! The outcome was beyond any of my expectations!!! Really cool and powerful music with strong roots on brit punk and electronica from the 80?s such as The Cure, Depeche Mode, and New Order; but also with a very up-to-date rock and roll sound upbeat... No matter what kind of music you?re into, I think that you can?t go wrong with this album.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is great.  It is next to impossible to purchase a rock album anymore where there are any good songs on the album other than the ones they release on the radio.  For 28 tracks, this CD is the best rock CD I've heard in a while, and the mixture of music that is found in this CD is unreal.  I've heard they intend to release 7 of the 28 tracks including Dani California, Tell me Baby, Storm in a Teacup, Snow Hey Oh, and Stadium Arcadium.  I think they could release more if they really wanted too.   <br /> <br />My evaluation of each song (I'm more of an uptempo guy so expect the uptempo songs to get better grades) <br /> <br />*****Disc 1***** <br />DANI CALIFORNIA A+ Definitely one of the best rock songs in 2006. <br />SNOW (HEY OH) B+/A- <br />CHARLIE A <br />STADIUM ARCADIUM B/B+ <br />HUMP DE BUMP A- Very unique song.  I think this song gets tiresome more than the others though. <br />SHE'S ONLY 18 B <br />SLOW CHEETAH B-/B Probably the worst song on disc 1 yet it would be what I'd expect to be 2nd or 3rd best song on any other album. <br />TORTURE ME B <br />STRIP MY MIND B <br />ESPECIALLY IN MICHIGAN B <br />WARLOCKS B/B+ <br />C'MON GIRL B <br />WET SAND B+  <br />HEY A- If your a fan of Mellow Chili Peppers then you should absolutely love this track.  If Anthony was a little better vocalist I think this would be a surefire classic. <br /> <br />*****Disc 2***** <br />DESCREATION SMILE A- <br />TELL ME BABY A+ Dont turn the song before 20 seconds.  It alot groovier than what you'd expect ;)Great song along with Dani California. Should be second release.   <br />HARD TO CONCENTRATE C Pretty bland.  But it took 17 tracks to get to an \\"Average\\" song that would normally be 3rd or 4th best on most other albums. <br />21ST CENTURY B- <br />SHE LOOKS TO ME B- <br />READYMADE A If you like Johnny you should love this. <br />IF B Basically a lullaby.  A good one though (Chad must have thought so because he is nowhere to be found on this track. Zzzzzz). <br />MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER B <br />ANIMAL BAR C Chorus isn't bad, but the verses are unfulfilling. <br />SO MUCH I B- <br />STORM IN A TEACUP A Turn it UP! <br />WE BELIEVE B/B+ <br />TURN IT AGAIN B-/B <br />DEATH OF A MARTIAN B-/B
B0006FO8RA|5.0|i personally loved Britney's greatest hits, they are obviously going to be all her songs so i'm not sure why so many of you wrote scathing reveiws...not only about this album but for all her previous albums. if you didnt like her then your not going to like her now so don't bother getting the album. a lot of artists add a song or two that hasn't yet been released so give the poor girl a break. it's a fun album and i think that was the angle she was going for so if your not up for it go and get the pearl jam album and stop wasting your time writing a reveiw on someone you hate. <br /> <br />Good on you Britney...Keep it coming
B000EMGAOY|5.0|every song is amazing, i can't even name a favorite <br />because they are all my favorite <br />everything about it is good
B000E1OI7G|5.0|This is a great film, all comparisons to other projects aside.  Luis Guzman is a god!!!  Drugs are bad, mmkay?  Don't do drugs, cause they're bad.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I just don't get all the 5 star reviews for this album.   <br /> <br />I am 28 years old.  I have been listening to Tool from the beginning.  I know Tool.  My favorite bands are Tool, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Rush, Modest Mouse, Portishead, Smashing Pumpkins, The Strokes... Anything with some heart and soul behind it. <br /> <br />I have listened to this album about 20 times now straight through.  In the car, at work, at home nice and lubed up.  I just feel disappointed.  Not enraged, mad, pissed, angry...  just disappointed.  My band seems to have died.   <br /> <br />All the previous Tool albums have one thing in common behind them.  You can put them on and be entertained.  Either from nice, clean, hard hitting base lines.  Or original riffs.  Or awsome vocalization.  Something, anything that can make you sit back and enjoy the music and zone out and experience all that is Tool. <br /> <br />10,000 days is just short.  Short on heart.  Short on that nice, deep, clean, bassy trademark tool sound.  Short on exploration of riffs and ideas. Short on replay value.  I hate hearing people say how its art.  Its trying to be something different that what is out there.  Its music.  It should be ment to listent to and enjoy.  This album just doesn't have that.  No matter how \\"artistic\\" it is. <br /> <br />1.) Vicarious - Trying to be classic tool, but just didn't quite make it.  Just seemed like a half hearted attempt a possibly really good song. <br />2.) Jambi - The only real clean, original (with a little homage to a guitar legend in there), hard hitting sound on the album.  Nice transitions from vocals, to bass lines to guitar riffs and overall a good journey.  Tool. <br />3.) Wings for Marie (Part 1) - There is an awsome guitar / bass rift in here just screaming to be the basis of a symphony.  Like the beginning to all great Tool songs.  They just don't explore it deep enough.  It sounds like a decent intro into what should be a great exploration and resolution of ajourney. <br />4.) 10,000 Days - It should be the albumn.  They intended it to be the album.  It had a good intro it should have continued and flushed out all nuices of the idea / riff presented in Wings for Marie.  It just stopped and decided to whine and moan.  So very disappointing.  Definately the turning point of the album.  I was intended to be, but it turned the other way. <br />5.) The Pot - Sounds like a really cheesy song.  It is.  You must have been high... <br />6.) Lipon Conjouring - Just some Indians chanting.  Its not Tool.  Just some sound bite included in the album. <br />7.) Lost Keys - This is a first for Tool.  A random sound bite to introduce... another introduction.  Sounds kind of eery.  I kind of like it, but it flows into a bad song. <br />8.) Rosetta Stoned -  You must have been... high...  iii....  Its a mish mash of previous Tool riffs and a song i know i have heard before.  I just can't place it.   <br />9.) Intension - A nice, relaxing song.  But it always sounds like it should go somewhere.  There is no resolution to it.  It just leaves you longing for something more... <br />10.) Right In Two - Once again, a mish mash of previousl Tool riffs.  Overal, not a bad song.  Enjoyable to listen to.  Probably my second favorite on the album. <br />11.) Viginti Tres - Complete crap.  The album goes out with a horrendous whimper.  This, more than anything, leaves you scratching your head for wtf went wrong. <br /> <br />Overall, I don't know what happened.  Maybe with all the side projects, they just spent all they had.  A Perfect Circle's first two albums were very good.  The third just went off on tangent that was no longer entertaining to listen too.   <br /> <br />I just feel for 5 years of waiting, this is just a half assed complilation of random crap they had lying around and threw it into an album.  It just doesn't have any flow to it.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|From this album, we can correctly assume that RHCP is veering towards a different direction. But at times during this album, they try infusing their old funk style into their music, obviously trying to appease old RHCP fans.  Being a hardcore RHCP fan, I cannot give this album less than 4 stars. But, I think there's room for improvement, and that the consistency is just not there.  Some songs seem a little dull, and not as creative, while others are stellar.  If they just released one album with all the top end songs from these two albums, I think I would have been more satisfied. This album is alright.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|The music of the film the Da vinci Code is a blend of bells, sounds, pipes, horns and a lushness unheard since Howard Shore did Lord of the Rings soundtrack. Just like the movie and the book, It is a musical puzzle to relish and enjoy<br /><br />Composer Hans Zimmer has no main theme in Da Vinci, which works for his experiencing and devolping this soundtrack recording into something special. Which  each selection is different, you have varies style of renaisaince style music mixed witth Zimmer's  lucullan  score.<br /><br />Sometimes mixing a Baroque style with a dark theme music as in L'esprit Des Gabriel (cut two on the CD) is an amazing contrast. There is also the celtic influects throughtout the music, but especially  in Rose of Arimathea (cut 11). Also well the Italian richness like the renaissance like in the selection Ad Arcana (cut 5)<br /><br />on the whole, this CD is an amazing musical piece to savor after the movie is over. I think i will read the book again with this playing in the background<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B000EMGAOY|5.0|To quote Flea in a recent interview in promoting Stadium Arcadium, \\"If you don't like this [record], you don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Period.\\"  <br /> <br />This album is perfect, there is a perfect blend of rock, rap, excellent harmonies, groving bass, solid drums, pop, experimental, psychedelia, acoustic, and as Anthony said, \\"some painfully retarded funk.\\" <br /> <br />Stand out Pepper: John.  His solos and chord progressions have improved so much.  His powers have doubled since the bittersweet \\"By the Way\\", and he shows it all over this record.  There were some songs like \\"Readymade\\" and \\"Turn it Again\\" that I couldn't handle, he was too fast, haha.  I could have used more drum solos from Chad like in \\"Hump de Bump\\" and solos from Flea, but they were going for the whole late 60's early 70's jam vibe.  John Frusciante is the best guitar player that continues to make music and is under the age of 40. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks: #1)Dani California-#28)Death of a Martian. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, buy it. <br />
0307276902|4.0|I don't think it matters. I read this to see what all the fuss was about, and what I found was a scary, deeply disturbing picture of drug addiction at its worst. By the time Frey reached his early 20's, he had destroyed his body and was well on his way to destroying his mind. His addiction was profound--alcohol, crack, meth, you name it--he had to have it to live. By some stroke of luck he entered Hazeldon, the most successful drug treatment facility in the world--so they say--with a shockingly low cure rate of 17% after one year.   <br /> <br />Frey rejects the 12 steps, which require surrending yourself to a higher being of some sort and acknowledging your powerlessness in the face of your illness. Rather, Frey takes total responsibility for his addiction, believes it was his own choice to take drugs, and consciously chooses to stop. Frey was lucky--he had loving parents, a forgiving brother and supportive friends, who genuinely welcomed him back into their lives as a sober person. Thirteen years later, he is still on the road to recovery. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any kid old enough to handle it. Perhaps the danger is that a reader says \\"it couldn't be THAT bad.\\" And now we know perhaps it wasn't. But for me it rang true--not so much in the details of jail time and the horrible dental procedures Frey maybe didn't undergo after all, but in the dark rage, depression and anguish Frey experiences as he withdraws from the drugs. That seemed all too true.
1400079179|2.0|I understand the temptation to spout off \\"It's just fiction\\", but there are reasons for disputing the historical context of the book. Foremost is that he claims it's true (the context is true). He doesn't have to do this. He could have said \\"this is a work of fiction, so get over it.\\" He didn't. And not just in the book. Over an over again in his interviews, his website, in articles, etc. he touts its accuracy. Another reason is that in this context, the book is a sort of historical fiction - with the claims of historical accuracy of the events the author is putting the book in a (allegedly) truthful historical context. A well written book of this type weaves itself into the historical context and cleverly inserts a fictional story into the interweaving of factual historical events. In Sharpe's Waterloo, for example, the French lose the battle and the Prussians arrive at the battle late. In this placing of a fictional story within a factual context, the reader gets a history lesson for free. Not so with TDC, the research is sloppy at best. He either does believe his claims of \\"factualness\\", in which case he is a really sloppy and inadequate historian, or he doesn't believe his claims, in which case he is trying to boost book sales (by misrepresenting). In short, he is sloppy or is a deceptive promoter.<br /><br />Much has been said about these inaccuracies and I will leave it at that. The real task would be to find a historical fact amongst the unsupported historical claims. You end up with some bland facts like \\"Isaac Newton existed\\", and \\"there was a Merovingian Dynasty\\". I think that the Author never read a website he didn't believe.<br /><br />I decided to read this book, thinking that the history be darned, that with all this hype, what I can expect is at least a good work of fiction. But it was not cleverly researched and there were some real problems with the characters. They seemed to be quite cliche and thin, all of them seemed to be \\"the best\\" and zealots in one fashion or another. They also are not that bright, as one might expect from a Harvard professor, a cryptologist, and a dedicated historian. **Mild Spoilers** The french policewoman, who earlier in a main element of the plot went through a lot of effort and endangered her career and personal freedom by pointing out that the main character was wearing a tracking device, doesn't think to consider that the armored car they stole from the most secure bank on the planet might also have some radio tracking device. And the same character, sitting in said banks vault, with a Symbologist (from the Symbology dept. of Harvard? Whaaa?) sit around going, \\"we need a string of numbers to get access to my grandpas account so that we can vindicate his death, I wish he had left us those numbers.\\" You mean the numbers he scrawled by his oddly positioned CORPSE that he drew with his LAST DIEING EFFORT, the numbers that you have been talking about endlessly for the last several chapters. Perhaps they are relevent. Nah. Or how about the \\"So dark the con of man\\". These clever symbologists and code breakers go (and I paraphrase again) \\"Yeah, Man was conned and it is sooo dark that he is conned\\", not \\"I wonder if this is another in an endless chain of anagrams written by a man who loves anagrams.\\" OR, how about the cryptex, version 2, that has a strange code written on it. \\"Is it hebrew? Farsi? Aramaic?\\" go the worlds foremost grail historian and the Harvard professor. It certainly wouldn't be a code used by Da Vinci, would it? Nah, just because the last 5+ codes we have deciphered in the last 24hrs have all been of a style by Da Vinci, and we have been talking about his paintings and how he was the most important leader of the group whose secrets we are trying to uncover. And it is in a box designed by Da Vinci, and they know this because they are foremost experts in Da Vinci's life and writings. Nah. Nope, can't figure this out. Wait, its actually backwards ENGLISH. Yep, I can see how that looks like Farsi or Hebrew. Sheesh. Those backwards \\"o\\"s really are tough to figure out. Hercule Poirot these folks are not -- closer to the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, I think.<br /><br />And here's another thing that I noticed. Spheres, bent lines, triangles, diamonds, pentagrams, penticles, pyramids, stars of David, and other symbols are all representative of the sacred feminine. I think Dan Brown needs to get laid -- if he sees the sacred feminine in one, two, three, four, and five sided objects, he has \\"it\\" on the brain, and could use a release. Well, at the minimum, the characters in the book could. At least it sounds like Sophie will provide that in the end.ee how that looks like Farsi or Hebrew. Sheesh.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Having grown up with Sabbath, Grand Funk and Zeppelin music back in the seventies I lost interest in the eighties when rock music seemed to lack any excitement. But after listening to Wolfmother I have to say that this is the best music I have heard since those days. Truly exciting, familiar and original at the same time. Great stuff !
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After 7 years since a good album, By The Way to me was a complete flop, the Chili's have finaly released material good enough to be praised 15 years tot his date. <br />I just hate seeing the 1 star reviews from poeple who haven't given this album there full attention, or who haven't been bothered enough to listen to disk 2 (Mars). <br />And I am also fed up of R&B!, Hopefully this album will knock it off the charts, for good. <br /> <br />Though there is some bad news, this album has been out for nearly a week, by this time the Chili's would of had more songs on the radio and on music channels, so far Dani California is the only famous song on the album, lets hope that changes as it is NOT the best song on the album. <br />This album is not like BSSM, it is more like By The Way, with the rare track which may of come of Freaky Styley, for example, Hump De Bump, Storm In A Teacup, Warlocks etc. <br />Then there is the boring songs, <br />Hard To Concentrate, Make You Feel Better, She Looks To Me, If. <br />But every album has boring songs, so we can deal with that. <br />Anyway 4 songs out of 28 is very good. <br /> <br />PLEASE LETS KNOCK R&B OUT OF THE CHARTS AND BRING BACK ROCK!
B00009W0U4|5.0|First off I think this is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and recommend it to anyone who likes good cinema. There is alot that can be said about Irreversible, but I think even more could be said about the director. Noe's films are very realistic and powerful, he has a talent to challenge the viewier and really send the images from on screen into their head. He showed that very well with the extremely brutal revenge scene in the gay S&M club. Watching Irreversible is a real expierence and in my opinion thats mostly what its ment to be. The camera techniques, cinemagraphy, and music were perfect for this film and really captures the feel to it. Anyway this is one of the most powerful films ive ever seen, and think it can definitely be called art in a movie form.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is a really fantastic album which is one of the albums from this great British rock band.This contains some of the finest rock songs in pigs and dogs.I have had this since the past 5 years and still enjoy it today as I did when I got then.Get this with their other albums.FIVE STARS.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Compared to Rob Zombie's other work, this CD is dark and hard. I opened this CD expecting to find inside of the plastic container a collection of metal/pop/60's club music. Instead, I realized that over the years, Rob's work has grown with him. This new CD is an older, mature version of his music. While it does contain a song or two that bears resemblance to his previous work (\\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" has a great dance beat injected with a macabre overall influence), most of the album is barely recognizable as Rob Zombie at all. Yes, he does have the same dark growl of a voice, but the music on this album is just DIFFERENT, and I don't know how else to say it. The good thing is that even though I am a fan of his previous work and his band White Zombie, I LOVE this album as well. Rob has gotten past the need to write about horror and dead girls (at least for the moment) and instead writes about his own life. That is what makes this album so REAL. This isn't the same bloody/glam-rock that we love Rob for, but that isn't a bad thing. This is one of the best albums I have ever listened to, and Rob Zombie is only getting better!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Although it's clear that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is terrific filmmaking, I was not really interested in seeing it until I heard Annie Prouix interviewed about the project. (It was her short story that the film is based on.) Prouix described how she had wrestled with finishing the tale for years, and had a much harder time with it than she had had with her longer works. (BTW, her book THE SHIPPING NEWS is a brilliant novel and a pretty good movie.)  <br /> <br />Anyway, Prouix did eventually finish the story, but had absolutely nothing to do with the filming of this movie. And here is the telling moment: Authors are almost always dissatisfied in some ways with the films of their work, particularly when they are not associated with the movie project as creative consultant or some such.  <br /> <br />Not Annie. She was absolutely floored that the movie had stayed so true to her story's original tone and purpose, and even substantially expanded upon it. (The fact the adapted screenplay won an Oscar for Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana is a testament to its excellence.) What a story, and what a movie.  <br /> <br />INTERESTING SIDELIGHTS: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a western set mostly in Wyoming and Texas. But it was written by a woman born in Connecticut, filmed in Alberta, and directed by a man from Taiwan. Go figure.
B000B19BCG|4.0|Supergrass has had an up-and-down career, starting with the blazing debut album \\"I Should Coco\\" in 1995, an album they are  still trying to live up to, 10 years later. 2002's \\"Life on Other Planets\\", their most recent album before this one, divided the Supergrass fans, some thought is was outstanding, others (like me) were quite disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Road to Rouen\\" (9 tracks, 35 min.), issued in Fall, 2005, is a great return to form. The band is highly focused, and sounds re-energized after a 3 year lay-off. While only lasting a little over half an hour, the album brings a LOT, starting with the opener \\"Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)\\" (making you wonder where the first 3 parts are). The other epic song on here is \\"Roxy\\", a 6+ min. minutely built song, just beautiful. Interestingly, it is followed by a short and funny instrumental, \\"Coffee in the Pot\\", showing that the band hasn't lost its sense of humor. The upbeat title track is a tribute to the fact Supergrass recorded this album in France. The closer \\"Fin\\" (\\"end\\" in French) is a sweet 'ballad' in the way only Supergrass can bring it.<br /><br />While a major act in their native England, major success has always eluded Supergrass in the US, and this album has not changed that. Nevermind, \\"Road to Rouen\\" is a top-notch album, and highly recommended.
1400079179|3.0|I find most of the \\"bestselling\\" novels to be shallow--they're a million miles wide and 1 inch deep. Brown's Da Vinci Code, however, is a million miles deep. There are a million details to substantiate the plot, but its resolution is unexpectedly shallow.<br /><br />Brown develops an intricate web of deceit for 400 pages, and then unravels it ALL in just a few pages. The effort to develop this intricate plot was all for naught because, in the end, it doesn't matter--the lone culprit quickly and unexpectedly becomes completely obvious. Everything else was explained away and most everyone previously intonated in the deceit comes out looking innocent and sometimes even victimized. The explanation for the lone culprit's actions are unconvincing and rather shallow and convenient.<br /><br />Also, the answers to the codes and riddles our two heroes must understand to continue their increasingly meaningless and oftentimes banal search come to them all too conveniently. Countless times, one or the other will proclaim, \\"I got it!\\" and they'll be off solving another code or riddle. I wish I had such skill when I misplace my car keys!<br /><br />With all that said, it certainly is an interesting read. I think, however, that you'll be less entertained by the book's plot twists than by its stories concerning the Priori of Sion, DaVinci's works, codes in artwork, the meaning of the holy grail, the history of the church, et cetera.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Normally when Hollywood makes a film about a gay character from the last century the straight characters are portrayed as narrow-minded or backwards at best or bigots at the worst.  A film about a gay man it never made fun or satire the \\"straight\\" world of the 1950's.  I kept waiting for that to happen but it did not.<br /><br />The makers of this film are fair not only to the main character well played by Hoffmann showing his strengths and flaws as a human being but also to the many straight characters.  The strength of the film is despite Capote's flamboyant and effeminate characteristics he as shown at times as lying to friends and colleagues, bribing government officials and finally to the men on death row he befriended all for the sake of his book \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  The film in short is about a self-obsessed writer who is eventually is changed for the better and worse by his greatest work.<br /><br />The movie is a rare example of Hollywood getting it right i.e. a well-made, honest film, with a plot and a point.  It is not a film for you if you prefer fewer dialogs and more action.  Nor is it a film one can see over and over.
0385513755|5.0|What Dan Brown has done in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is take the book \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" (by  Michael Baigent) and put it into a fictional plot. This book is not for Christian fundamentalists because they will find it very blasphemous. It is a nice little mystery/thriller plot with religious implications that are starting to get people to think about things they have always taken for granted about Christianity.<br /><br /> The action kicks off in modern-day Paris with the murder of the Louvre's chief curator, whose body is found laid out in symbolic repose at the foot of the Mona Lisa. Seizing control of the case are Sophie Neveu, a lovely French police cryptologist, and Harvard symbol expert Robert Langdon, reprising his role from Brown's last book. The two find several puzzling codes at the murder scene, all of which form a treasure map to the fabled Holy Grail.<br /><br /> As their search moves from France to England, Neveu and Langdon are confounded by two mysterious groups-the legendary Priory of Sion, a nearly 1,000-year-old secret society whose members have included Botticelli and Isaac Newton, and the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei. Both have their own reasons for wanting to ensure that the Grail isn't found.<br /><br /> The most fascinating aspect of this novel is the overwhelming public interest and controversy surrounding many of the assertions Brown makes in this book. It may be safe to assume that most people have little or no previous exposure to these topics and it certainly has generated extreme controversy in Christian circles. There are no less than 20 books in print that attempt to support or refute the information found in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". I have never seen such polarization over a work of fiction before. The illustrated edition of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is just the kind of book that not only makes reading experiences more enjoyable and interesting, but it also continues to stir things up by providing visual references for the works of art, architecture, and religious symbology discussed in the text.<br /><br /> Dan Brown has done amazing jobs to his book \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The story is powerful and magnificent. Mixing with a lot of traceable truth and facts, he made his novel sound extremely convincing and inevitably deluded you from what's real and what's fictional.the works of art, architecture, and religious symbology discussed in the text. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown has done amazing jobs to his book \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".

B00006GA48|5.0|I grew up listening to this masterpiece and it will always resonate with the utmost integrity, passion, truth and not to mention a deep rumbling bass you'll ever hear from a Fender Jazz bass that vibrates your bowels.  Here you have three musicians that matured and grew tight as a three piece unit and produced this highly acclaimed 3rd LP \\"Closer To Home\\" in 1970.  The lyrical content is at it's core, masculine and displays truth, hope and love to our fellow man and woman.  Every song on Closer To Home is excellent and essentially it's the most perfect album they recorded (Survival being 2nd and Phoenix 3rd in my opinion).  Don and Mel's solid driving rhythm section with Mark Farner's articulate and dynamic vocals delivering mature lyrics, his trademark guitar sound and blusey riffs is most evident here and what put Closer To Home on the map with a lightning bolt.  Don Brewer is an amazing drummer with near flawless execution.  Had his drums been better sonically produced in the studio like say, John Bonham or Carmine Appice for example, he would have been more readily recognizable in that same league of great rock drummers when in fact he surely IS.  Mel, well Mel is \\"The Man\\"!  It also sickens me that those good for nothin' critics of the day panned Grand Funk as a no talent in the beginning.  These are the same idiots that panned Led Zeppelin's debut album when that came out in early 69', so go figure.  The only panning going on here my friends is the guitar from the right and left channels.  This music was and is made for the people and Grand Funk Railroad always had the highest regard for their fans.  This album bestows knowledge and wisdom delivered in a special sauce of addictive, hook laden riffs and melodies.  It is hard to pick a favorite off this album, but I'd have to say \\"Nothing Is The Same\\" puts me to tears it's so f**king heavy!  \\"Mean Mistreater\\" is beautiful and sad at the same time: I've tried hard to live w/o you in so many ways, I can't help myself I'm thinking you, for the rest of my days.  \\"I Don't Have To Sing The Blues\\" is a wonderful, assuring tune with addictive melodies:  Please don't tell me that's the way that is goes cause I tried hard and I know, I ain't been playin' in your backyard cause I got my baby and she loves me so....  The 2002 remasters edition restores this particular album to how it should have sounded.  The past Capitol/Cema CD releases in the 80's and 90's were thin and dry as a bone sounding and needed tweeking (yes, the original album itself sounded better).  We've waited a long time for Closer to Home to be reissued in it's full domestic glory (not including those imports with misinterpreted lyrics) with improved sonic quality.

B000021Y7X|5.0|After getting this DVD, I watched at least part of it almost every day for the next two months.  No lie.    While it is true that the cinementography is outstanding, what also keeps me coming back are the outstanding performances.  I almost wish that each band member had a camera dedicated to them, cause they're all spectacular.  Even the director, Jonathan Demme, laments the difficulty of balancing the members' screen time in the commentary.  They all look like they are having a blast, and at times it seems more like a big party on a stage than a concert.  Here's a capsule review of each:    David Byrne: The eccentric leader.  He appears slightly spaced out and in his own little world at times, but then he'll flash a glance at one of his mates and you'll realize that he knows exactly what he's doing.  There's a wonderful part during the bonus song \\"Big Business\\" where he walks over to each band member and stands transfixed while they play a \\"mini solo\\" for him -- he even bobs his head along with Bernie Worrell's keyboard riffs.  In addition, his clinical descriptions of how he conceived the show in the commentary are fascinating.    Tina Weymouth:  The sly bass player.  Tina doesn't have a whole lot of screen time to herself except when she sings \\"Genius of Love.\\"  However, if you look for her in the background, you'll see some good stuff.  The \\"blimp suit\\" that she wears in the first half of the show rocks!  Tina's also quite an entertaining talker and contributes some funny moments to the commentary track.  She gleefully recounts a prank the crew pulled on David, and also has a great quote about making music: \\"Whether your arms are sore or your fingers are bleeding, it doesn't matter.  The end result is all that counts.\\"    Chris Frantz:  The good-natured \\"teddy bear\\" behind the drum kit.  You can see him lip-synching along with many of the songs, and he'll belt out the occasional \\"alllright\\" into his mike.  It's funny to watch his hair become increasingly drenched in sweat as the show goes on, while the perpetual grin on his face remains.  Favorite commentary quote: \\"We thought we knew how to rock, and then these people [referring to the guest musicians] came along and...well, just look at them.\\"    Jerry Harrison:  The most stoic member of the band, Jerry contributes some nice rhythm guitar licks and is very articulate during the commentary.  He briefly comes out of his shell during a \\"mini-solo\\" in the song Big Business, and it is quite amusing.    Bernie Worrell: Ex-Parliament keyboard wizard who doesn't get quite enough airtime to fully appreciate, but he's outstanding nonetheless.  He's an adept visual performer, and I enjoyed his call-and-response section with David in the song \\"Making Flippy Floppy.\\"    Steve Scales: The happy-go-lucky percussion player who's always trying to fire up the crowd.  He has a great moment on \\"Take Me to the River\\" where he grabs the mic and starts trying to get everyone going.      Alex Weir: The EXTREMELY enthusiastic guitarist who's constantly bouncing around the stage.  He almost collides with David during \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" while David's doing his \\"man possessed\\" dance.      Lynn Mabry/Edna Holt: The two sultry backup singers.  They play off each other well, and have a great moment in \\"Slippery People\\" whey they mirror David's guitar strumming.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I have never seen the first movie and I do not really like vampire movies so I was surprised that I liked this film. The film explains what happend in the first movie in the first 5 min so i kinda understood what I missed, but at times I was lost and had to ask my friend some questions. The movie is enjoyable for thriller or action fans. The movie has lots of gore and is really dark. The story is action packed and dosent stop. The acting is pretty good for an action/thriller movie. Overall I enjoyed this film with all the gore action and scary parts.
6305364648|4.0|this movie use to be one of my favorites, but now after watching it again its been downgraded on my list. Reason being, I noticed that in every action scene, whether it be fighting a guy or running through the woods, Arnold uses a stunt man for every one of those scenes. And the stunt dude did not resemble Arnold very much at all. I hate it when they do that in movies. I understand some of the scenes having to use a stunt man for safety reasons, but Arnold can't even run through the woods. Anway, after saying that, its still a pretty good flick. A lot of humor and some pretty good action. If you enjoy Arnold, you will definitly want to add this to your collection....
B00028HBKM|1.0|Not to mention his father is a rabid antisemite...those two facts alone should negate this entire film. No I havent seen it, I dnt need to see this garbage to know it's fiction
B00005JOTV|4.0|Contrary to what many people think, I find Lindsay Lohan to be an above-average talent in the entertainment industry, and more intelligent than people give her credit for. Admittedly though, I prefer her acting to her singing. I've enjoyed her work in films such as \\"Freaky Friday,\\" \\"Mean Girls\\" and \\"Herbie: Fully Loaded,\\" all aimed at a younger demographic. With \\"Just My Luck,\\" Lohan graduates into the young adult romantic comedy genre, complete with a business suit and all (which, I'll add, she looks MIGHTY GOOD in).  <br /> <br />So does she pull it off? I would say without hesitation that she most certainly does. While this type of role isn't necessarily difficult to play, Lohan adds all the required charm and likeability to her character. There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie, thanks to a great supporting cast. And Chris Pine is also good as the lucky guy who wins Lohan's heart. <br /> <br />Romantic comedies are like action movies...we all know how they're going to end. But what matters is what happens in between point A and point B. And \\"Just My Luck\\" has all the right ingredients for a successful film, with a positive message thrown in for good measure. Recommended.
B00005JOVN|5.0|This movie has billions of effects and messages. It was very well made out, the ship design was amazing, the death of the people, the wave, the elevator shaft incident, the flash fires, the propeller effects, inside the vent, the destroying of things, the extreme life and death situations, the knoweledge for surviving and how to use it, the quick thinking, reactions and decisions, etc... <br /> <br />Many people did not get the main message of this movie, which was \\"Your name has alot to do with your life.\\"(try changing it and see) <br /> <br />Posiedon had built his gem palace on the \\"OCEAN FLOOR\\", not on top of the ocean. <br /> <br />This movie also shows a wide range of creativity. Look at this ship! Look at the unique way it went down! There had to be a very intelligent person to come up with a movie like this. I give appraisals to them. Although there is not much background, the actions and events always spoke louder than the words.
B00005K3NR|5.0|As one reviewer said, the 70s were the second Golden Age of film. Slow-moving at times, you were supposed to absorb the atmosphere and develop real empathy for the characters. Rambo and its successors ruined all that; nowadays, even intelligent films (such as 12 Monkeys) have a fight scene or a car-chase scene every few minutes, which adds nothing to development of characters. <br /> <br />Carrie is a film in that 70s tradition; the middle 1hr, in particular, is slow-moving, but vital. You feel real empathy for Carrie--what a pitiful, tortured soul she was. <br /> <br />Near the end of the movie, the horrible bullying she suffered comes to a head. The bullying really is painful to watch, but, boy, does it make you feel good when they get their comeuppance! You wanna say, Go, Carrie Go! Get 'em, girl! <br /> <br />None of the reviewers mentioned the cinematography of the prom sequence. I think this scene is a masterpiece, especially as Carrie gets angry; split-scene, revolving scene, nightmarish, ghostly memories haunt her--then she goes into a real rampage. It's a masterpiece. <br /> <br />This is a rare movie that gets better with each viewing. The first time I saw the movie, I was a little disapponted; I'm not sure why. The second time I realized it was a near-masterpiece. One of the other reviewers has had the same experience, apparently. <br /> <br />See the movie, it's great!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all. Even with a movie that I absolutely loved such as Broke Back Mountain, I really did not feel the motivation to write a review until after I see how many propaganda driven, lack of depth, shallow idiots wrote reviews for this movie, just so they can accomplish what politicians and church activist want ever since this movie received the recognitions and nominations they deserve.  <br /> <br />Broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that \\"Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult.\\" The story starts off with two cowboys, both in desperate situations financially; both came from a less than perfect background. Then, they work in jobs without any support from their employers, and the only people that can comfort them are themselves. Anyone in this situation would fall in love, but their love extends way beyond that. Through the time they spend on Broke Back Mountain, characteristics that these two are destined lovers began to play out. For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs. They both share the same values, same thoughts, and if this were a girl-boy movie, as all the third rated movies Hollywood have made perhaps too much of due to a lack of extraordinary writer and director as talented as Annie Proulx and Ang Lee, then it would be easy to see that these two are suppose to be lovers. But why should the situation be any different when it comes to Two Men? It isn't any different, and finally, on a cold night on Broke Back Mountain, the two started the love that was already meant to happen.  <br /> <br />Deep inside Jack and Ennis, and perhaps every viewer of Broke Back Mountain, there is a realization that Jack and Ennis are meant to be together, instead of going seperately to wives because of the propaganda they are surrounded with. Yet, that is exactly what broke Jack and Ennis apart: Propaganda. These men would have been extraordinary together, but the propaganda that men should be with women force them into separate lives, and when Jack wants to escape this Propaganda, he is killed. Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.  <br /> <br />Now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie? Or are you judging this movie by the surface which, due to the same propaganda that kept Jack and Ennis apart, is a love that is not suppose to happen. All of you who think very lowly of this movie did it because you claim that these men are not in love. Yet you would say that the other Hollywood flicks, which is filled with people who just have sex on each other when they meet, and dump each others the next day, is true love. Some of you even claimed that this book portrayed that gay life is miserable, and this movie is about two miserable men seeking each other for sexual release. You are right, these men are miserable, but how can they not be when people like you are pressuring propaganda on them? Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment. The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, gay or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love. Let me ask you a question, if what they show is not love, then what is?  <br /> <br />If the displays of love and affection between these men do not come logical to you, it is because Ang Lee had to delete scenes from the original script so that narrow minded people like you won't be offended by it. If love between two men is the reason you don't like this movie, then perhaps it is time that you expand your horizon and be more accepting towards all forms of love, instead of expecting director Ang Lee to place a limit on love for you. If the misery you see is what displeases you, then let it be a lesson to you to create a more pleasant and accepting world for everyone so that these tragedies, which is still occurring in modern society, will never happen again. Finally, if you rated an movie that provokes new thoughts and emotions within the viewers, depths of understanding towards human nature, and a cry for a different way to live as 3 stars and below, then know that this is how you rate your integrity, as there is simply no reason to compromise true beauty towards your personal bias.  <br /> <br />Now let's look at this movie once again. Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful? Yes! Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world? Yes! Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills? Yes! Does this movie that satisfied all criteria that define an once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard? Most definitely!  <br /> <br />In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain. Apparently he and the entire Oscar board decided that they can critic a movie without even laying an eye on it! But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar. The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain. This movie deserves 5 stars if not more, and that's what needs to appear on the Amazon rating page. We cannot allow narrow minded individuals who can only see a surface that is covered by propaganda, and cannot delve into the deeper meaning of this movie pull down the rating that this movie actually deserves. Let us all give this movie a 5 stars on Amazon, and 10 stars in our books so that theprejudice of these idiots can be negated, and so that this movie can get the rating it truly deserves!

038572179X|5.0|Atonement is my first Ian McEwan book, and I'm ready for more.  The four sections of the novel are completely different yet each completely mesmerizing.  The first part of the book describes the Tallis family home in perfect detail-the lake, the trees, the tiled floors.  Section one also reveals the inner motivations of the very three-dimensional Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, Lola, Emily and others.  Part two, where Robbie marches to the sea, reminds me of Meg Rosoff's recent novel How I Live Now.  Both these books create an alive, vivid setting, describing the countryside in great detail, then fill that beautiful setting with scenes of war.  My personal preference is part three, which describes Briony's experiences as a nurse during WWII.  It is interesting to imagine a war taking place in your home country, and this book piqued my interest in WWII.  I usually hear about the war from the American point-of-view, and I'd like to read more about the European experience.  Briony's interaction with certain soldiers brought tears to my eyes.  I truly enjoyed, too, the rejection letter a publisher sent to Briony.  McEwan perfectly captures (what I imagine and he obviously knows for sure) the tone of a publisher:  \\"However, we wondered whether it owed a little too much to the techniques of Mrs. Woolf\\" (294).  The final section of the novel is the shortest and takes place in 1999.  In it, Briony brings it all together.   <br /> <br />Atonement will continue to stay in my mind long after finishing it.  The beautiful, detailed writing and vivid setting, as well as the intriguing and fully-realized characters make this book unforgettable.  Thanks to this reading experience, I've added McEwan's Saturday to my summer reading list.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|It sounds like a psychotic reaction to a Catholic mass. Something horrified goes running from the church. Bells, chants, booming crescendos, and a glockenspiel tied to a lead weight, go hand in hand with swirling and standard back vocals, (oooh, aaah, oooh), which are about as progressive as The Partridge Family, complimented and compensated by a weird, whimpering lead vocal that sounds like an alien-being with lockjaw attempting to mimic the human voice. Washed over by a wave of alarming, climactic vocal structure, and tinkered by a constant, brainwashing keyboard that sounds like a passive-aggresive hearing test from a very bad nightmare. Accesible? Not if your of this world. I know one thing. I drove down a lonely highway from central New York State to Pennsylvania on a cold stormy winter night, and popped this new CD in the player, and I swear, SOMETHING was trying to take control of the steering wheel.

One of my \\"Top Ten Books Everyone Should Read\\" books.<br /><br />I felt like I was whispered a secret of success that would change my life forever (for the better)!

B0007XT7V8|3.0|<br />...and I do like it - to a certain point. I'm not head-over-heels in love with it, but I don't think it's complete garbage, either.  And I'm not going to bash them and call them Nickelback rip off artists, although at times I swear they sound just like them. I will say TOADs lyrics are definitely stronger than Nickelback's (but that might not being saying too much - and yes, I do like (not love) Nickelback).  <br /> <br />That said, I do enjoy listening to Hating Hollywood, Santa Monica, Say Goodbye, and Since You Been Gone.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|There is some strong material here.  Standouts are \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"Marker in the Sand\\" and \\"Gone\\" (an acoustic version of which was released as a B-Side on PJ's X-Mas single) but nearly every track has something to offer.   <br /> <br />I'm particularly impressed that there is finally a song penned by Mike McCready, \\"Inside Job,\\" (a sort of power ballad that begins and ends in hauntingly beautiful fashion) on the album.  Recent albums have had quite a few contributions from Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, with McCready having the odd music-writing contribution.  As evidenced by his side project, the Rockfords, he was quite capable of putting words to a song.  He even wrote a song that was performed at the Bridge School Benefit, \\"Last Soldier,\\" that never seemed to have studio treatment.  Finally, here's an album where Gossard and Ament are silent (at least as far as lyrics) and finally gives McCready his chance to speak (Vedder gets the lion's share of the songwriting duties, however, and has a contribution to every song, including \\"Inside Job\\"). <br /> <br />One thing I'm not too sure of (and this is the main reason I rated this 4 stars) is Vedder's voice here.  It sounds kind of strained and rather tired, at least in places, particulary when he goes after the high notes.  It doesn't come off as easy as it did as recently as Binaural on such tracks as \\"Evacuation\\" and \\"Binaural\\" (I wonder if his smoking habit has finally caught up to him; also he is on the wrong side of 40).  It doesn't sound terrible but something sounds wrong; it's just not forceful.  But I can't bring myself to detract too much because of this dubious flaw. <br /> <br />I don't feel this is really that much of a return to Pearl Jam's beginnings.  It strikes me as more of a new facet uncovered in the Pearl Jam legacy.  It does have a lot of kick, but it doesn't strongly evoke Ten or Vs.  It is its own entity. <br /> <br />On a trivial note, I'm not a big fan of self-titled albums.  I'm not sure a lot of people are, for that matter. The Beatles' self-titled album of 1968 was dubbed the White Album by the world.  Similarly, Metallica's 1991 \\"Metallica\\" became known as the Black Album soon after its release.  Thus, I propose that this release by Pearl Jam should hence be referred to as...the Avocado Album.
B000002IQW|5.0|Guns n' Roses and Skid Row were by far and away my two favorite bands during the late 80s/early 90s. In truth, Skid was a distant second, but second nontheless. They toured together in the summer of 1992 and I got the chance to see them when they came to my hometown.  Wow! What a show.  I had their first one and was expecting more \\"18 and life\\", and \\"I remember you\\" type stuff. \\"In a Darkened Room\\", \\"Quicksand Jesus\\", and \\"Wasted Time\\" are in that same mold. But, the rest of this disc is heavy metal at its absolute finest.      \\"Monkey Business\\", \\"Slave to the Grind\\", \\"Living on a Chain Gang\\", and \\"Mudkicker\\" are some of the heaviest and best songs ever recorded.  Heavy doesn't always make it good. Hard rocking doesn't always make it heavy. But it all comes together - completely together - on Slave to the Grind.  What these guys did on this disc is absolutely amazing. This is no doubt a timeless classic.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|In a time of mediocre music, Pearl Jam releases another gem. It's always refreshing to hear a band that can actually play more than just power chords. Is it just me or does the music these days seem really watered down? There doesn't seem to be much talent out there. Thank goodness for Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam is a lot like the Foo Fighters in that they play hard and fast, but still now how to incorporate great melodic hooks. Simply put, they understand how to move people with great music and thought provoking lyrics. The problem with most bands these days is that they don't even understand the fundamentals of what makes a great song. Pearl Jam understands this and they have produced a near perfect album. Rock on!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|...than just a 'gay cowboy movie.'  But also just that.  Two rough and tumble, unschooled, primitive men of the American West come to learn painfully and ultimately, tragically, that  Marlboro men do indeed sometimes fall for each other... <br /> <br />After some 756 reviews, one is hard pressed to say something refreshing about this film.  Yet, the sheer fact that discussion about BBM is so alive and thought-provoking attests to the greatness of this film as a piece of art.  Ang Lee has succeeded in creating something so visceral, so moving, so elusive and infinite in its meanings that twenty years from now, we'll still being try to decipher it. <br /> <br />While some of the reviewers have referred to Jack and Ennis as 'unsympathetic' characters, I would rather use the word, 'human.' Yes, human.  A story about two deeply flawed and deeply scarred human beings who struggle to find a way to that which redeems us all: love.  Ennis and Jack's struggle is a universal one, that of loving somebody in the fullest and most elemental sense of the word.  That is why this film is for us all, regardless of sexual persuasion.  BBM is an epic tale about the costs of loving somebody whom your world, your family and even yourself deems to be unacceptable or just plain 'wrong.' <br /> <br />From the minute we see them, Ennis and Jack are more than just gruff ranch hands thrown together by the whims of fate.  As he  gets out of his beat-up pick-up and very deliberately saunters(dare I say, sexily) towards an Ennis caught in the burn of his gaze, Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is out for something.  And that something just happens to be Ennis Del Mar.  As he spies Ennis through his side mirror whilst shaving, Jack is a man under a spell.  Unconciously or consciously, acting on his desire for Ennis is just a matter of time.  As both men move up the mountain, the ball between them starts to roll, picking up momentum with each gorgeous shot of the Canadian Rockies.  Ledger's Ennis wears the face of man fighting back every feeling he might have, and feelings for Jack especially.  But feelings and desire have 'no reins on them' as Ennis accurately points out.  Both characters slowly succomb to these feelings as their time on Brokeback passes.  Ang is the master of the tiny things that speak volumes. Whether its his intense concentration NOT to look at the naked Ennis or his child-like concern over Ennis' wounds, Jack indulges in his initial fascination and lets himself be ready for the moment.  And that moment soon comes with one of the most raw and REAL portrayals of homoerotic passion you'll see this side of pornography.  While born of the moment, Jack and Ennis' explosion is the culmination of their evolving and very unacknowledged desire for one another.  How this scene could have surprised and/or shocked anybody is beyond me.  All the signs were there, you just had to be looking. <br /> <br />Like the black and white of a checkerboard, Ledger and Gyllenhaal complement each other like few other on-screen lovers have. Gyllenhaal's performance is nothing if not amazing.  How a straight actor could manage to capture Jack's open yearning for another man so perfectly, so precisely, is simply miraculous.  Jake's Twist is almost innocent in his near-joyful acceptance of the possibility that Brokeback offers.  He is the ennabler of the relationship, always looking for the road down the mountain where their fire can be continued. Yet, even Twist is confused by what this could all mean.  'Me neither,' he replies to Ennis' adamant declaration of not being 'queer.'  Part of the film's excruciating beauty is that both characters never really come to terms with who they are.  Men who love each other. <br /> <br />No ride off here into the sunset. Ennis and Jack are the products of their time.  1963 America, where every man had to be JFK and every lady, Jackie.  And if you weren't, you'd best keep it to yourself, far in the closet, far from Mr. Kinsey.  More than that, BBM's world is rural, frontier, hardscrabble 1963 America where the mere idea of two men loving each other represents an assault on that most precious icon of Americana, the cowboy.  The laconic champion of simple goodness who stands for justice and defends the weak against the guys in black hats.  Falling in love with another cowboy ain't in the scipt and that's what makes Jack and Ennis' love so heroic, so fragile, so ultimately doomed. <br /> <br />So you've had sex a couple of times with a buddy out in the boondocks and now it's time to come back into the rigid, heterosexual world of 1960's America. What's a queer cowhand to do?  Get married, sire a couple of kids and try to put it all behind you.  Jack and Ennis follow suit, but nature can't be held back.  Their first meeting after their marriages has to be one of the most passionate and tortured film 'kisses,' if that's the word one can use here, you'll ever see. Ledger and Gyllenhaal will leave you in a whirlwind.  As will Michelle William with her performance as Alma, Ennis' wife.  Alma's look of shock and disbelief as she stares through the glass window at her husband entwined in the arms and lips of another man is just one of the many grand cinematic moments in this film.  Alma's face is one of profound confusion. What just happened and what does it all mean?  Michelle Williams is indeed one of the highlights of BBM.  She doesn't need to say anything, her taut and pained expressions tell it all. A woman struggling to pick up the pieces of her shredded dream with dignity and self-respect.   Moreover, Ann Hathaway does a stellar job as Laureen Newsome, Jack's attractive Texas wife, a woman captivated by Twist's bull-riding prowess and boyish smile only to gradually learn what Alma knows early on.   <br /> <br />As the years drag by, both men settle for the costs and freedoms of the double life.  Fishing trips to Brokeback a couple times a year and then back to the lie with their women and families.  A lothas been mentionned already about the extreme damage both men cause their families.  And the claim is valid enough, if not too realistic.  Proulx and Lee wanted to show characters of THEIR time, crippled and blinded by THEIR circumstances, by THEIR environments and not least, by themselves.  After having witnessed the horrid aftermath of a hate crime as a young child, is it any wonder that Ennis has become a walking time bomb, striking out at anybody rather than admit he might not be all that different from the old rancher his father murdered.  Think about it people, most of us in Ennis' situation would have also strived for the so-called 'normal' life. <br /> <br />Like Twain's Mississippi, Lee and Proulx's Brokeback is a mythical place.  Lee's masterful use of the West's untouched natural grandeur is without parallel.  Is not the mountain the third character in this relationship?  A place where the two lovers, like Adam and Eve, can act out their feelings in complete harmony with their surroundings.  A place unfettered by social constraint, tradition, expectation.  A place which allows Jack and Ennis to do that which should come most easily, to love.  Brokeback is a profoundly 'American' place, far from the maddening crowd, a place where self-limitation and painful compromise are unknown.  A place where it's all up to you to create your own heaven and/or hell.  Yet, such freedom comes at a heavy price. As Jack rightly says, 'Brokeback is all we got!'  What was once their playground of freedom, soon becomes their prison, their hideaway from the lies of their everyday lives.  Jack had the answer once.  He was willing to give this 'thing' a chance.  A ranch together, a life together...but Ennis's fear is just too much to overcome.  'Two men living together...if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.'  And with such stoicism, Ennis nails the lid to both their coffins.  Denied the only one he ever really wanted, Jack looks elsewhere for his Ennis substitutes, which eventually lead to his ignominious murder.  Yet, could he have done otherwise?  Could he have been strong enough to forget Ennis Del Mar and cut off their relationship completely?  Are any of us strong enough to deny ourselves true love when it comes our way?  Is Ennis to blame for driving Jack to his death, for fostering his own emotional death due to his inability to conquer fear?  Who can judge? Certainly not us.  Such is the complexity of Ang Lee's art that it defies our natural desire to point the finger at the characters. <br /> <br />Brokeback finishes on the same note it began, one of omnipresent sorrow and unbearable longing, longing destined to be unfulfilled. Shattered by Jack's murder and more importantly, by his own culpability in it, Ennis Del Mar has become a violent and empty shell of a man when his loving daughter, Alma Jr.(played brilliantly by newcomer Kate Mara), invites him to her wedding.  When asked whether her boyfriend truly loves her, she replies, 'Yes, Daddy, he does.' Ennis winces in pain, in regret at not having done like his daughter, at not having accepted love when it came his way.   <br /> <br />With Ennis's faintly voiced, 'I swear...,' a great American film closes.  And so much more than that.  A biting and gritty lesson on how lives should and should not be lived.  The reasons for watching BBM, repeatedly I might add, are many. More than anything, BBM should be seen and seen again as an example, par excellence, as to what a genius with a camera is capable of creating.  Ang Lee's visual poetry, similar to that of another maverick director, Terence Malick, is breathtaking.  Whether it be a single tear down a cheek, a look up at the camera in fear and confusion, icy red lips before the phone or the ultimate cowboy posing before the rocket's red glare, Lee manages to create scenes that will remain in you long after the lights are up.  Like a Hucklberry Finn of its day, Brokeback Mountain is more than just an indignant cry against injustices that remain with us still.  It's all that and so much more...   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

This is a band whose albums must be heard on a sound system, not just an ipod or mp3 player. <br /> <br />If you've never seen them live, it is a must.  Out of all of the shows I've seen over the last 30 years, this band is in the top 2 or 3.  A concert experience like no other.
B00009W0WM|5.0|A film taking place during WWII when refugees are trying to escape from the Nazis.  Casablanca was a port city in French Morrocco where the refugees awaited a flight to the New World. <br /> <br />Anyway, before my husband tells you the whole plot and ruins the adventure, I'll just say buy it!  You'll love it!
B000051VWW|3.0|\\"Lover's Rock\\" by Sade is not a bad album. The lyrics are good, Sade's voice has not changed at all, and the production is alright at best. The album as a whole is good. It's on the mediocre side, but it is enjoyable. \\"By Your Side\\" is this album's only release, and it is a nice song. \\"Flow\\" is another highlight. The lyrics on this song are very memorable. The album's title track is nice as well. My beef with this album is that this group made no attempt to switch things up. The sound is the same throughout then entire album. When I listen to an album, I like to experience different feelings, different moods. Thus album's lyrics have variant subjects, which I appreciate, but the tempos of the songs were basically the same, and that made this album slightly difficult to listen to.<br /><br />I would'nt necessarily recommend this album to people. I'd recommend it to Sade lovers, or big neo-soul fans. 3 Stars<br /><br />1. By Your Side<br /><br />2. Flow<br /><br />3. Somebody Already Broke My Heart<br /><br />4. King of Sorrow<br /><br />5. Immigrant
B000AIZ8WM|4.0|CD rocks pretty much the whole way through. If you like melodic songs with screaming than this delivers. They remind me a little bit of 36 crazyfists, great band, not heavy heavy, but definately heavy enough. Buy it, it's worth it.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Ok. Honestly, when I first heard that the Peppers would be releasing a double album, the first thought that came to mind was: Why? By default, double albums (w/ the exception of a select few) are almost always floppers, with quality tracks far and few between. So I took a chance on this one after reading some different reviews. My assessment...  <br />  This one is tough to judge. The compilation is not the best in my opinion- especially on disc 2 because there are so many slow songs in a row that lack much tempo and typical Peppers energy, and you get the urge to just flip through them real fast. I definitely prefer Disc 1 over Disc 2 right now- Dani is a great single and some of my favorite songs right now are Snow; Slow Cheetah, Stadium Arcadium- these are the more typical Chili Pepper songs. What I dont really understand is- why have they gotten so SOFT? Its completely out of character to me and that is why I really feel they would have done themselves much more justice by selecting the best songs of the 2 CDs and put out 1 instead.  <br />  The pics of them, while kind of odd, are not necessary. I mean, what's with the football helmets? I dont get it. There's a pic of flea w/ a sailors outfit- hmmm, yea, ok.  <br />  Putting aside the qualms, I'd have to say, just about any album produced by the Peppers is gauranteed to be worth the cover price just because you cant get this kind of music from any other band . They are simply a quality musical force that continue to exhibit great musical producing skills and have great presence both on and off the stage. Still, this release makes me question whether the band should change the name from Red Hot Chili Peppers to just Red Chili Peppers, or even just Peppers. Yep- its time to hang em up guys. Thanks for the memories.
B000056N8X|4.0|The original Highlander was a cult classic. It was a fine movie that didn't need to have any sequels based on it. It did and the sequels did not make sense because it was based on a movie that already killed any possible chance for a sequel. <br />Now the TV series came and it was great. Not faithful to the movies but it didn't need to be. It even had episodes with Connor in it. Now Endgame I found very faithful to the television series. It had the watchers. It had the oldest immortal Methos and it had Connor. All of which was in the series. The title is misleading because there are clearly still immortals around. The action sequences were great and the story line was decent. It wasn't the best in the series but it definitely wasn't the worst. TV allows a person to have more character development. Movies don't have that freedom. I know the movie doesn't deserve 5 stars but it was definitely one of the best translations from television show to movie I have seen and it had great swordplay. It lacked the emotional intensity but very few movies can do in 2 hrs what a show can do in 9 one hour episodes. <br />Final thoughts compare to tv series don't compare to previous movies.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Well...I was very excited when I bought this CD. <br />I thought : what does Hans Zimmer wrote this time. <br />Well now I've listen the soundtack a couple of time and I'll tell you what I think of it. <br />First of all for those who love Hans Zimmer they will agree that in almost every Hans Zimmer soundtrack there is a real good Main Theme with great orchestrations. I was a bit surprised when i saw that there were no \\"Main Theme\\" in this soundtrack, and when I listen the soundtrack I couldn't find one. Each music is quite different,each are quite melancolic but they have all something in commun, they are breathtaking. Da Vinci code is not one of this soundtrack made from one Main theme and where all the other tracks are copied from the main theme. <br />Hans Zimmer did an excellent job over this soundtrack and I can't wait to see that movie now.  <br />Well I'll wait until May 17th to find out. <br />
B00005JKOI|5.0|This is a great movie staring some of the Brat Pack of the 80's.  Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy each do a great job here, as do a very young Jon Cryer and James Spader. <br />It's your typical 'wrong side of the tracks' movie that turns out right, but it's all the in between parts I love.  It has an awesome soundtrack too.  If You Leave is one of the best songs from the 80's.  It was fun looking back at the fashion for that time too. <br />Molly Ringwald gets asked out by the guy she has a crush on, and the 'trouble' is that he has money and she doesn't.  She doesn't feel worthy enough (there's that awful scene after their first date where she doesn't want him to see where she lives), and his best friend, Steff (Spader) doesn't want to associate with Blane if he's going to date Andie.  Andie's best friend Duckie (Cryer) loves her and only wants her to be happy.   <br />It is a feel good movie and well worth watching.  You will have a laugh (Otis Redding 'impersonation') and a little bit of a cry (but a good cry) at the end.  This is still one of my older favourites.
B000AL730O|5.0|'Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard' showcases Paul at the best work of his maturity so far.  It is a spare, but substantial album.  If he draws from his past, he mainly gathers his work from 'The White Album'.   He starts with a vintage rocker, \\"Fine Line,\\" which is rooted in \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road,\\" but new enough to be necessary.  Later he outdoes this effort with \\"Promise to You Girl,\\" one of the C.D.'s most engaging songs.  Most of the sound relies on a fine interplay of piano and acoustic guitar. \\"Follow Me\\" is a beautiful accoustic ballad, and \\"A Certain Softness\\" is an acoustic masterpiece, a serenade so intimate that it makes one feels like adding something to his tip jar.  \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" shows Paul unbearing his soul more specifically than usual.  Using keyboards and blues riffs, he creates a darker mood, while singing lyrics about being betrayed by the tabloids and their informants who were supposedly his friends.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" reminds us of who was responsible for \\"Blackbird,\\" but it isn't just a rehash, either.  He also scores well with the catchy and poignant \\"Friends to Go\\".  Paul closes the album with \\"Anyway,\\" which showcases his musical virtuosity.  If starts off ethereal, segues into blues, then ends with heavy rock.  We are reminded of his contributions to 'Abbey Road' here.    This C.D. shows Paul as still an expert.  There is little to criticize.  All of the songs are good to great without any filler.  The production is just about perfect.  We can hear Paul as if he were in our livingrooms.  The sounds are so clear and smooth without sounding mushy.  This C.D. sounds like the production Paul would have liked for 'Let It Be', and it illustrates that 'Let It Be Naked' was no solution.  It is a treat to have so many fine new songs coming from a master of pop/rock music.  He does best when he has something close to his heart to say and when he says it well.  Like when he's in his own backyard.
B000EMGJM2|4.0|This is a good follow up to his first cd.  I liked that a lot and knew this should be good as well and I was right.  I think that this is better still. <br />He is a talented musician and he's a great vocalist.  I'd put him in the same vein as Maxwell (that's who he reminds me of) who I also like.  I love the funky, Being A Girl, Ride Ride Ride (very upbeat and that's probably the best song) and the remake No Sense Of Crime.   <br />This is a great R&B cd and I'm listening to it on a nearly full time basis.  I was glad to see he got some tv publicity on Letterman the other night.  I never saw him perform live, but he did well and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.  He's very talented.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Mirrormask is artistic and dreamlike, both in terms of visuals and plot. Gaiman's writing is sharp and witty and sometimes poetic. Other reviews say the plot is hard to follow or incomprehensible. It's really not. An attentive 12-year-old can easily follow the story. However, you will not be spoon-fed every little detail! It's not an episode of 'Friends'. It's a fun, off-beat, Tim Burton-esque fairytale more in the style of 'Big Fish' than Narnia. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for families, artists, poets, dreamers, and those not afraid to stray off the beaten path.
0671027573|4.0|this book kept me up late because I couldn't put it down. good love story.  interesting sex scenes. Definitely has a place in my \\"keep\\" section.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I'm not going to call this the greatest record of all time. It's all subjective, and of course there are millions of records out there. All I know is this music hits me like almost nothing else. As many others have said, this is a far cry from the Beach Boys surfin' and hot rods image(though I personally love that as well).This record is Brian Wilson putting the deuce coupe in the garage and the surfboard in the attic, growing up, and writing and singing from his soul. This is arguably his masterpiece, and the record that the Beatles and almost everyone else has been profoundly influenced by.The first time I heard this record I ended up on the floor in a fetal position.  The only songs that don't really work for me here are Here Today and I Know There's an Answer/Hang On to Your Ego(they're the same song, different lyrics). Everything else is simply gorgeous. God Only Knows, Don't Talk, and Caroline, No are simply angelic pieces of music, though nearly everything else is stunning as well. This is just simply an album of moving, beautiful pieces of music, best album of all time or not. Unfortunately Brian and the Boys would never live up to this again(though they came close with what was finished from the infamous Smile sessions). If you can listen to this and not be moved, then your soul is dead.
B000BVD460|5.0|Eminem is the second greatest rapper ever. Only lagging behind the great Tupac Shakur. And this greatest hits compilation showcases exactly why. It has everything from the dirtest \\"Fack\\" to the sensitive, somber \\"Mockingbird\\". It not only shows Marshall Mathers evolution as a rapper and a musical artist, but his evolution as a man ever since his Grammy-winning debut \\"The Slim Shady LP\\". As someone who has been an avid Eminem follower ever since 1999, I can tell you that no one can touch his lyrical ability. I repeat: No one can touch Eminem's lyrical ability. His rhymes are some of the best you will ever hear from any artist. This cd mixes in the old with the new. I have all four of his albums and chose to buy this cd solely for the awesome \\"When I'm Gone\\". This song shows what all the great things Eminem has done and how badly it has affected the ones that he holds closest to his heart. This is possibly his most thought provoking song ever. After listening to this monumental cd, I'm left with only one question: Why does he have to leave us so early?
B00000JMOF|5.0|Frankenstein is an excellent example of how film in the early 1930s was still used as a visual art form, as in the silent films of the previous decades.  It falls right on the cusp of the transition between silent and 'talkies', proudly boasting its predecessor in a visual vehemence soon to be lost in following decades, when storytelling began to overthrow the simplicity of watching moving pictures. <br /> Colin Clive lays down a terrific performance as Henry Frankenstein, the mad, foolish but passionate scientist who longs to create pure life but succeeds only in creating a monster.  He is matched in performance by the now legendary but then unknown Boris Karloff who took the role of a monster, traditionally what nightmares are made of, and played it with such compassion that the audience fell for him, a sympathy equaled two years later by the 'monster' Kong, both brought by man into a world they did not understand, and killed by man for their ignorance of that world. <br /> A haunting, slightly disturbing film with some quaint, well timed frights.  It has a distinct style suggestive of early German silent films, such as Nosferatu and the Cabinet of DR Galigari, because of its harsh compositions created with striking sets, intense lighting, strong makeup and greater dramatic acting, altogether making this a first-class piece of art.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I get sick of people labeling this as a drug movie or a movie that says that drugs are bad.  Requiem for a Dream is far from that.  If you stopped short at thinking of this movie just as a message against drugs, you failed to let your mind travel into the depth of this movie.    The movie is more so a presentation of 4 people's lives rather than a movie that's trying to make a message.  Requiem speaks on dreams and the obstacles that one has to go through to achieve them.  The drugs serve as the obstacles.  They're the easy way out-- think, Mrs. Goldfarb wanted badly to be in that red dress but instead of taking the tough route, she relented to taking the easy path to her dreams like so many of us do.  The same goes for Harry and his friends dreams of living in the easy lane.    On top of the things I listed in the above paragraph, Requiem is a very touching movie because it reminds us of how hard it is to let go of something you really love, something you really yearn for.  Even though the 4 carachters lives were going down hill, they still stuck to their belief in their dream and went through insane measures to get to it--driving from New York to Florida.  Requiem is the sad tale of 4 people losing everything in the process of reaching for that dream of theirs.  It's not just a anti drug movie or a drug movie, as so many people like to label it as, it's a movie about life, hopes, and the sadness that comes with failure.
B00003CXAW|5.0|King Kong is a well directed, acted and of course created masterpiece of 1930s cinema.  Full of action, adventure, romance and really big animals!  The viewer can't possibly ask for anything more except that it be longer and maybe to sight a few oversized bugs in the famous lost 'spider pit' sequence (both of which the legendary Peter Jackson does so successfully in his 2005 remake). <br /> The giant ape, crafted by Willis H. O'Brian is the first non-person to be seen and admired by the public as a complete character in his own right.  When he is killed the audience cried for him and he touched people's souls even though he was twelve inches high and made out of foam and rabbit hair.  But the true star of the picture has to be Fay Wray, it is her acting and reacting that convinces the viewer that the jumpy, twitchy and often times quite laughable Kong is real.  Indeed without that veracious innocence she put into her character of Ann Darrow, King Kong may not have been the long standing success is has become. <br />Special note: the RKO 7 part documentary is simply fantastic.  I never took notice, but it must have been at least twice as long I think than Peter Jackson's Kong.  It leaves nothing out, even giving a full stop-motion recreation of the 'lost spider pit sequence' made by Jackson and his team at Weta Workshop.  Its about time DVD makers realised us special features junkies need documentaries that take a whole afternoon to watch!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I disagree with some of the viewers who claim this is better than the series; I think it does an extremely good job tying the series together in a way that the network did not allow. I think the impact of Serenity, while it can be watched on its own, is diminished without the backstories from the Firefly series. <br /> <br />It seems clear that Mr. Wheddon and his cast are all comfortable with the roles of the characters which makes the story so credible. At heart it is a western with frontier justice and 'regular' people forming a small community/family in order to survive adversity. <br /> <br />I haven't gone much in the story because it is already well reviewed previously; it deals basically with a small band of space frontiersmen trying to elude pursuit by the military because they are harboring/protecting a young fugitive, who was the subject of military experiments. The greater arc soon unfolds, encompassesing the origins of the cannibalistic reavers... a more dangerous form of a highwayman. <br /> <br />To get the most out of this movie -- which is still recommended regardless given the good writing, great casting, and strong acting -- I would strongly urge you to see the series first because the motives driving the various characters are clearer and the story because so much more compelling when you are already invested in the characters.  <br /> <br />Stay Shiny.
0694003611|4.0|Okay, I'll admit it -- this is not my favorite kids' book in the world. In fact, I probably wouldn't pick it up if my kids didn't ask for it again. And again. And again. <br /> <br />The illustrations are a bit wobbly, and the poetry is less than inspired (\\"Goodnight house. Goodnight mouse. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight kittens.\\")). But my children -- all three -- have adored this book and begged for it over and over again.  <br /> <br />Let's face it -- We're not reading for ourselves; we're reading for them. So give in and get this book. You might regret it (after the 100th reading), but your kids won't.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I felt compelled to leave a comment here because I've never seen a  movie that has moved me so deeply like Brokeback Mountain did.    The movie wasn't as half as good as it is without the perfect  performances of the entire cast. You could actually turn off the sound  and just look at the facial expressions and gestures and you would  still understand the story. Heath Ledger as a lonesome cowboy is  simply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few words  and gestures is absolutely heartbreaking. It is amazing, how a twenty  something year old man understands such a complex character and he  shows it in every single gesture.     Ang Lee's images are extremely powerful. You can almost smell the  grass and feel the wind. He knows exactly what he does, no second is wasted.   I love his understated and subtle style of directing.   There is a lot of silence, but the atmosphere is always intense and emotionally charged.    The movie is more than the sum of its parts, though. I can't find a  logical explanation for the fascination that this story has for so many  people around the world. \\"The secret of Brokeback Mountain\\" (That's the  title for this movie here in Europe) will always be kept together with  Jack's ashes up there in the Mountains. The only things left for Ennis'  are the bittersweet memories and his longing that echoes now eternally  through the mountain of Brokeback Mountain- and through your soul, long  after the last credits have rolled down. -This is a terrific movie!
B000001GQP|2.0|I have six different recordings of this masterpiece, and this particular recording is probably my least favourite of them all.  It's jarring to hear sprightly passages played too slowly, making them seem to plod along -- and it's even worse to hear sensuous and languid portions like \\"Cour D'Amours\\" and \\"Uf Dem Anger\\" played too quickly, as if they were all in a hurry to get home.  It ruins the effect completely.    And Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau?  I actually winced, hearing him in his solo passages, where he's supposed to sound impassioned and suffering, to hear him warbling away like he thought he was singing lieder.  Sorry, no.  If you want to hear how it all SHOULD sound, buy the CD with Charles Dutoit conducting the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal, which is the finest version I've ever heard -- the best use of tempo, the best diction, and the best soloists by far.    And PLEASE, let's get something straight: \\"Carmina\\" does NOT rhyme with \\"Christina\\", it rhymes with \\"stamina\\". \\"Carmen\\" is a second-declension neuter noun in Latin, as is \\"stamen\\", and in the nominative plural, the stress falls on the first syllable. It's CAR-min-a, not car-MEE-na. It makes my hair stand on end to hear someone pronounce it like they think the \\"-ina\\" is an Italian diminutive ending, like in \\"manina\\". It is NOT.     [ADDED LATER:  How pathetic that so many people have thought my review was \\"not helpful\\".  Did they expect lies and smiley faces?  They probably went right ahead and wasted their money anyway.  I tried to warn them.  Chances are, though, they have no idea what the lyrics mean, so it won't matter to them that Dietrich F.-D. sings them like he doesn't know what they mean either.    I even hope they will also ignore my correction of the frequent mispronunciation of the title, because it can be quite hilarious to hear pseudo-sophisticates mangling pronunciations and thus announcing to the world that they really don't have a clue.]
1416524800|1.0|This book deals with the US government, primarily NASA making a startling discovery on Ellesemere Island in the high Arctic.  The US military and NASA set up a base on the island including a habisphere and a landing strip.  Submarines patrol the coast, ships fly back and forth to the base.  At one point a international press conference is held from the island with the US flag as a backdrop.  There is just one tiny problem:<br /><br />In reality Ellesmere Island is a part of Nunavut which is a territory of Canada.  The island is home to civilians and contains a Candian military base.  The idea that the US government could enter another country and set up a military base without permission and then broadcast that to the world is wholly offensive.  Not once in the book is it mentioned that the island is part of Canada, or perhaps that the Canadian government has given permission to the operation. This is even more troubling when you consider the fact that Canada is a great supporter of NASA (it developed the CANADARM of the space shuttle) and one of the partners of the International Space Station.  With global warming and the impending opening up of the Northwest passage this seems like a direct challenge to Canada's sovereignty.<br /><br />What was Dan Brown thinking?
051755075X|5.0|Buy this book. It is simple and smart. I constantly reference it for marketing advice. This book was much better than any textbook I read in college. It combines pages of classic Ogilvy & Mather print ads with crisp, honest commentary and advice.
B000002WCJ|5.0|While they are heavily influenced by Iron Maiden, to the point where they do plagiarise them in certain types things such as long endings and some very similar vocals (though dickinson is a better vocalist than Kiske), this band is one of the best rock bands of the 80s. the music is very well done. this album deserves a 5.
B000EULJLU|3.0|You'd think that after a 5 year lay off, they would come out with something better than this. Still a great band, but while listening to it, I heard bits and pieces of other bands that I love..namely, Pink Floyd, Rage against the Machine, Metallica, a little Zeppelin. Man, have I just heard too much music in my life or is Tool really becoming a conventional band?
B000EULJLU|5.0|Anyone who has followed Tool's epic career knows that this is not a band who strive to fit into the mainstream. Tool's sound is at once instantly recognizable and ever-evolving. This leads many fans to express disappointment when a new Tool album is released and it doesn't sound exactly like the last. As Maynard himself expressed in an interview, repeating oneself musically in an effort to replicate something you did several years ago is redundant. Bands and musicians cannot grow that way. The members of Tool are not in the same spiritual/psychological place as they were when they made Lateralus...Maynard, for instance, went through the death of his mother. We cannot expect such life events to not affect an artist and thus affect their art. 10,000 Days is the product of a group of true artists who continue to develop themselves musically, spiritually, and mentally. Tool never makes the same album twice, and the fans shouldn't expect them to. In fact, we should thank them for not insulting our intelligence by rehashing old material over and over. This band absolutely puts 100% of themselves into their music and expects their fans to understand that they see music as ART, not as a get-rich-quick scheme. And that's why I appreciate them so much. It's more than we can say about bands such as Godsmack or Disturbed, etc. <br />  <br />10,000 Days is a beautiful album because of the personal pain and disillusionment that is displayed raw and unvarnished...Maynard is working through his feelings about his mother right in front of us in \\"Wings for Marie\\" Pts 1 & 2. He expresses his anguish over mankind's continued exploitation and abuse of our environment and each other in \\"Right in Two\\". For those seeking the drug references, Tool's experience with entheogens is addressed in songs like \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"The Pot\\". This band doesn't mess around with trite lyrics and 'catchy' hooks, trying to replicate that \\"Tool\\" sound...in fact, the moments when Tool is stretching out into new territory are the very moments when they most purely express everything Tool is all about.
0393327655|5.0|I loved this book.  It's viewpoint will be despised by many, but in the end, it convinced me.  I have always been a conservative athiest.  I didn't believe in God or religion, but I dismissed it as something to be tolerated.  This book changed my mind. <br /> <br />I'm not saying I'm going to fight religion in the streets or even make a big deal about my views.  But I will not sit by and allow people to claim religion is necessary or, at the very least, harmless.  Mr. Harris's writing is direct, thoughtful, and inarguably logical.  This will, of course, be the stumbling block for many religious folks who must believe in something despite logic.  But that doesn't matter.  Because this book isn't for them.  This book is for the rest of us.  The mildly religious and the mildly not religious. <br /> <br />At the very least, it will make you think.  And no matter what, that is a good thing.
B000000OF6|5.0|How anyone could possibly say Green Day is better than Queen(Or even worth listening to)is beyond Me. Like 'em or hate 'em Queen is a group of talented musicians making good music. Like 'em(Which i don't) Or hate 'em(Which i do)Green Day seems to be built on endlessly repetetive power chords and origionality free guitar solos that any 9 year old with a couple of weeks of experience could master. Get a Life man. While i agree with you're recommendation of Dire Straits,(One of the greatest bands ever, and a group of amazing musicians)Green day Is Simply not the best... There's not even anything there that merits you're listening time.
B0001GF2DS|4.0|This has to be one of the classic \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" and I chuckled to see that it's supposedly Quentin Tarantino's favorite film. <br /> <br />It's really too bad, though, that M-G-M felt compelled to ruin an otherwise really nice package by placing one of those cursed anti-theft devices under the transparent disc tray, where it wrecks the cosmetics of the box and cannot be removed.  One star off for that insult to us collectors.

Stadium Arcadium is very different but great musicianship all around .Buy it.
B00079FUI6|3.0|I tried to avoid Desperate Housewives for a long time. The more the Oprah crowd talked about it around the water cooler, the more I wanted to avoid it. Then I heard one of my heroes was going to be on the show. Yes Shaft himself was going to show up on Wisteria Lane, and since Shaft is one bad... (maybe I should shut my mouth), I had to check it out. What I found was a disturbingly entertaining show. First you have Lois Lane turned single bubbling single mom. The producer of Sports Night turned overwhelmed mom. The creepy chick who used to live at Melrose Place is now a Stepford wife. And of course, what show today isn't complete without a token hot chick. I wonder if the executives at ABC during pilot season go, \\"yeah that a interesting show, but do you think you can add a token hot chick?\\" Now if the other channels would only do this. <br /> <br />So it turns out that dead chick's husband has hired Shaft to find out who was blackmailing his wife. (Ironically the last lime I saw the dead wife was on Everwood where she played... the dead wife. Typecasting anyone?) This got me a little interested, not quite as interesting as the token hot chick, but anyways. But that is just one of many mysteries on Wisteria Lane. Unlike Lost, some of the mysteries were solved by the finally. Some with better results than others. It was interesting how they intertwined the two biggest questions together with why did the one chick commit suicide and who exactly is the plumber dude. <br /> <br />Then there were the mysteries that went unanswered, first and for most, what was the gay homosexual, also imported from Melrose Place, big secret that he talked about with his dad. The easiest answer of that he had another family was shot as he quit his job where he does a lot of traveling. My only other guess is that he swings both ways or they will drop that plot line all together. My other big problem was the introduction of the black family. Why did they show up only to accomplish nothing to the storyline? Either hold them off until next year or tease us with something that will have us guessing all summer. Watching them just move in was boring. <br /> <br />The biggest glaring problem I had with the show was with Paul Young. At first he concocts a great plan to hide the dead chick that his wife killed under the pool. But once his wife kills herself, he decides to move the body from a place where no one will find her and instead throws the bode and the and the wood box that it is in into a lake. Has he never seen \\"Will it Float?\\" on Letterman? Both wood and bodies float. <br /> <br />Looking forward to next season, I think it's pretty safe to say it will turn out that Dana is the plumber's kid (or at least the plumber will think so). The black family will have some deep dark secret. Susan will fumble around a lot. The Melrose Place dude will have the same problem his wife did as Mr. Mom. Edie will hit on the black dude. And hopefully if the token hot chick starts showing her pregnancy, they bring in another token hot chick to replace her.
B000929AJQ|4.0|as i say, a little too \\"pop\\", especially in some of the vocal areas,but still a really good cd.  i LOVE many of the strange sounds and textures (which is suppose is a NIN landmark) at times i would even almost be tempted to use words like \\"genius\\" or at least \\"master.\\"  i am still waiting for the day Trent Reznor will abandon being any kind of pop or rockstar and just really go for it musically.  i would love him to do things more akin ot filmscore, like he has sort of dabbled with at times.  not that there is anything wrong with his voice or him singing, its just...to me he is too focused on songs and what not and it feels to me like it holds him back from some of the very modern and wonderful ideas he has about music.  many little moments here and there throughout this album are amoung the best music i have ever heard, but overall it just leans a little bit too \\"songy\\" for me.  i would love him to do something similar to King Crimsons \\"the power to believe\\" where there are a few songs but mostly instrumentals written as music and not just remixes of songs without lyrics.  i think NIN really has something...but again, forget about focusing on songs and just really go for it will you? we all know you could do it if you wanted to,and probably better than almost anyone else.  still even the \\"poppiest\\" \\"rhymiest\\" song on this album is far better than 99% of the music i hear on the radio.
B00005B36H|3.0|There is a reason most Tool fans cite this as their least favorite album...Its a very good album, but compared to other Tool it just isnt as good... Aenima, Undertow, and even 10,000 days are far better. If youre just getting into Tool, dont start here. Start with Aenima...
B000EULJLU|5.0|a lot of mixed reviews on this one.  personallly i think with each album Tool get closer to Tool.  in my opinion each album gets better and in my opinion this album is the best so far.  the \\"heavier\\" songs are not as hard hitting as past heavy songs....but thats not what im interested in about Tool.  like some other reviewers i think wings for marie and 10,000 days are the best tracks.  also i am something of a musician and play the sitar, and i do not think i hear any actual sitar on this cd, unlike the top review suggests... sort of an eastern feel though.  i could be wrong but i think all of that sound is just guitar with various effects.  not saying it couldnt contain the sitar, but i dont particularly hear it so far.   i also think the last three tracks or so are really great.  but there is only one part of the album i really dont care for, the very \\"wahwah solo \\" sound in the second track.  still i think just about every track on here is great, and i always find it odd that people call some of the shorter tracks \\"filler\\" material.  isnt it all music? thats what i thought...but everyone has their own opinion of what that is.  of course Tool brings all aspects of art with them, the album art is nothing less than great, in fact its Tools music videos that first attracted me to them, as opposed to the actual songs.  also i love that they have lyrics that mean something but arent overt.  almost poetic, and ambiguous enough to be enjoyed from many perspectives.  overall i think this is a great album, and i think that it abandoned some things that Tool didnt need.  of course all the way back to Opiate tool has put out great material, most of which still holds up today, but i think the last three albums are definitly better than the earlier ones.  of course by the time its over i really felt, more than with any other album,that there just wasnt enough... i could have done with 8 or 9 more tracks but Tool seems to be against double disk releases.  if you havent heard this yet, and you like Tool, then i dont see how you could be dissapointed, but aparently some have been...
6302298695|5.0|Good movie from the 1990s years,Tre has to live with his dad after getting into a fight with Bobby the boy he walked to school with, I like the part when Tre,ricky,doughboy and little Chris(or Chris)were young.The part when Doughboy said she loved that fool more than she loved me. I think it was pretty obvious.I think he said fool but if he did that ment ricky.But you know what ever!I know part of this review sounds stupid.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I absolutely love this cd, not just for the music, but for the hilarious comments in between.  I love how Johnny Cash has a little annecdote for each song; it makes it more like you were actually at the concert.
0330487388|3.0|richly developed characters, but not the author's best.  The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best.  Jackdaws is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best...  worth a read in my opinion.
0375703764|5.0|I love this book.  It's just a whole lot of fun to read, and it really is scary (I found myself checking my house to make sure we hadn't grown any extra rooms).<br /><br />Johnny Truant is a memorable character, and his straight-face hallucinations (paraphrasing: \\"I ran at my boss and killed him and cut up his body.  'So, Johnny, how are you?' he said as I turned.\\" Where of course he hasn't really killed him) are really skillful and inspiring.  The sex scenes are sometimes graphic but well done.  Although Johnny's run-on rants can be a little hard to keep track of, they are rewarding and a rich read.<br /><br />The main story, the one Zampano ostensibly wrote, is amazing as well, with a genius plot and characters you care about.  It's really well done, and the footnotes add a lot to it.<br /><br />And about the footnotes and appendices... they're really cool, and add a really adventuresome element to the book.<br /><br />What's more, whenever the word \\"house\\" is printed it's in the color blue (at least in my copy; apparently in some it's the word \\"minotaur\\" that's printed in red).  How could anyone resist a book like that??  It's as good as the hype claims.  Read... and risk being sucked into a crazycool world for as long as a few weeks.  (It's definitely not a quick read, although easy to put down and pick up again without losing the flow of narrative.)<br /><br />Overall, a great book that I recommend.
0451208706|2.0|Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best.  The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best.  The Man from St. Petersburg is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion.
B00005JOVN|3.0|Normally in a disaster movie theres a half-hour to an hour where we meet the characters and get to know all about them.  It is necessary for the disaster scenario to have its full effect on the audiences.  But the clever writer for Poseidon had the great idea to meet the characters for about 5 or 10 minutes than have the big wave come.  Bad idea.  I did not even care about any of the characters.  By the end of the movie you don't really care anymore.  The special effects are stunning, but I expected a lot more from Wolfgang Peterson(Air Force One, Troy).  Don't pay to see this, rent it when it comes out.  If you want a good summer movie go see Mission Impossible 3.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers long anticipated STADIUM ARCADIUM brings some zest back into rock music for 2006.  The set is a mix between funk, metal, funk-metal, rap-rock and everything that the Peppers have come to be know for. Kiedis's vocals are exceptional here while Flea's bass playing is as strong and distinctive as ever.  First single \\"Dani California\\" was the first indication that the Peppers were coming back full force for this double album.<br /><br />For the most part, the selections tend to be above average with a few filler tracks, not unusual in today's age.  The tracks that are standouts though truly grip and grab your attention such as \\"Dani California\\", \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", the exceptional \\"Charlie\\", \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", the infectious \\"Hump De Bump\\", and \\"Strip My Mind\\" among other selections on the first disc Jupiter.  On the second disc Mars, there are hits such as \\"Desecration Smile\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", \\"21st Century\\", \\"Readymade\\", \\"If\\" and \\"Storm In A Teacup\\" among others.<br /><br />With strong production, this album is another Rick Rubin masterwork.  It seems as all that Rubin touches turns into gold and this work by one of the greatest bands of out time is no different. I think that a #1 debut wouldn't be a surprise for this exceptional album.  4 stars.
B000000H3Z|5.0|Ill get to the point here, this CD rocks! As a long time Metallica and Anthrax fan and of most heavy metal, i have to say the album; Sepultura: Beneath The Remains, is one of the heaviest releases of the 80's. Sounding a lot like slayer, but slowed down (not too much)and 100X HEAVIER THAN AN ATOM BOMB! This album also makes me think of Master of Puppets(Metallica).     The song ''Inner Self'' is worth the price alone (love the double bass). Thrash/Heavy Metal fans definitely need to pick this up and discover this UNDERRATED band and MASTERPIECE of an album. One last thing, the instrumental versions of Inner Self and Mass Hypnosis are a nice inclusion.    I have a collection of over 130 metal CD's.. Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica, Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse, S.O.D, Motorhead, Forced Entry, Criminal, Tankard, Metal Church, Pantera, Diamond Head, Sodom, Death, Dark Angel, Dragonforce.. (just to name a few) and this is still my favorite CD out of them all..it's that damn good!    Best Tracks(they're all good, but these are my faves): Inner Self, Mass Hypnosis, Sarcastic Existence, Slaves Of Pain, Hungry, Primitive Future.    Also check out these other Sepultura releases:  Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastation (1985/'86)  Schizophrenia (1987)  Arise (1991)  Chaos A.D. (1993)
B000AARKOO|5.0|Overall, I have a huge interest in \\"historical\\" movies.  Although I am aware that the writers took some liberty with the historical figures in this movie, I don't think they did so in a way that diminised the historical value of the movie. <br /> <br />The cast is an all-star group - Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons all turn in outstanding performances.  I would recommend this movie based on the cast alone, but there is also much merit in the film-making that makes \\"Kingdom\\" worth owning. <br /> <br />Overall, I give it 5-stars.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I spent part of the afternoon out at the theatre, watching Mission: Impossible III...but I'm not here to write about that, or about getting a new battery in my watch, or about picking up the chicken and green onions and mushrooms that are now baking away in the oven.<br /><br />Instead, I'm going to write about Before Sunset, a film that was released a couple of years ago, as a sequel of sorts to the previous Before Sunrise. The original film was released in 1995, and told the tale of an American college boy (Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke) and a French college girl (Celine, played by Julie Delpy), who meet on a train in Europe and spend a romantic night together in Vienna.<br /><br />So, Before Sunset does not pick up exactly where we left off last time. Instead, nine years have passed, and Celine has tracked down Jesse in Paris, where he's appearing at Shakespeare and Company for a book-signing. Jesse has been touring Europe, promoting his new book, which is, in fact, based somewhat on that previous romantic night together. Finished with the book-signing, Jesse and Celine go to a cafe, walk the streets and gardens of Paris, and take a short cruise up the Seine. All the while, they are talking about how they lost contact with each other, lost loves, how their lives have changed in the nine years, and those things in life, big and snall, that matter to them. Hawke and Delpy pull their roles off perfectly: a little more jaded, but still thoughtful and conversation-oriented.<br /><br />The film is shot as if it were really in real-time...no real scene breaks punctuate the story, just changes in scenery. So, instead, we can take pleasure of observing the 80-minute conversation between two people who should clearly be together, and only the vagarities of circumstance have kept them apart. This is very different than most films you see. Back in the mid-90s, when I first watched Before Sunrise, that film had some meaning for me, as it represented the kind of romance and relationship I was seeking. Now, with this film, I see things nicely book-ended, and I see a mirror of the type of relationship I actually have...one in which thoughtful conversation is important.<br /><br />And, it was nice to see Paris again.<br /><br />So, check it out if you have a chance!nd relationship I was seeking. Now, with this film, I see things nicely book-ended, and I see a mirror of the type of relationship I actually have...one in which thoughtful conversation is important. <br /> <br />And, it was nice to see Paris again. <br /> <br /> <br />So, check it out if you have a chance!
B00005QG9J|4.0|I like Incubus. <br />I wont sit here and front as if I know alot about them but I did like one of their previous hits.  <br />I got this cd as a gift because I remember loving \\"Talk Show On Mute\\".  <br />They never played it enough for me so I  got the cd and actually loved alot of it. <br />Now I find myself likeing 60 percent of the album and thats enough for me. <br />Now there are some songs that were just a  little too loud for me but im sure others loved it.  <br />my favs are 1,3,4, 5, 6, 10, 11 (some what) 13- a nice tempo after the previously noisey tracks. <br />Seems that I lied. I like about 75% of the album.
B00009RXLG|1.0|The Editorial review for this dvd is biased, except that there are 56 minutes of images. It's a poor compilation of the worse played-for-comic-relief wrestling you get on telly, for free, with two notable exceptions.<br /><br />There is a 8 min midget wrestling match featuring a young, well-built Karate Kidd, wrestling naked feet at 93lbs, against a real veteran Little Tokyo, 88lbs; even if their routine is predictable, there is a true show of athleticism none of the other men in this compilation can claim. Without nothing to place the match in time, you should know this is a match from the classic American International Wrestling (AIW), of Kentucky, that stopped promotions long ago; this match will be of 1999 or earlier - considering Little Tokyo's age.<br /><br />Sherry Martel, looking older than her 27 years then, but still sexy and tight packed, defends her recently won World Women's Championship at the American Wrestling Association (AWA). The contestant is the eager blonde Candi Devine, younger and supple. These two women show they have the balls to actually give and take some blows and apply telling holds - as professionally as their male counterparts rarely do. The match took place October 17, 1985, in Manitoba, Winnipeg, and lasts about 9 min.<br /><br />So, 17 out 56 minutes (30%) of the tape is bearable in terms of content. Considering the poor quality of editing, the nulity of the so-called introduction, the non existence of notes on the matches or the wrestlers, the inclusion of a 'music video' that is nothing but a collage of The Missing Link's photos on a noisy background, and that another reviewer was right about the picture and sound problems of the whole thing - you must be brave to buy this tape.<br /><br />I don't know about the midgets match, but the classic title defence by Ms Martel is available in various bootleg wrestling compilations.<br /><br />A note to the FBI: I read the copyright protection warning on the dvd, but I recommend you start taking action, and applying that US$250,000 fine to producers of filthy 'documentaries' like this.you start taking action, and applying that US$250,000 fine to producers of filthy 'documentaries' like this.
B000005AYM|5.0|Its so hard to write a review almost 10 years after the fact. And 10 years later there has been nothing like this cd. Erykah hasn't even topped her self.  <br />Sometimes you can only do it once and i guess that's what all it took cause this album is still undisputed. <br />No need to list favorties...we all them from the radio and videos but for your whole album to be mind-blowing is CRAZY. <br />Anyone who doesn't have this album by now, smack your self and go get it.
B000EQH2QK|1.0|Six years of buying music though Amazon i've never commented or reviewed an album once, untill now. <br /> <br />Terrible music, poor singer, even the recording sounded like it was done in someones basement studio. <br /> <br />Virtualy every song you could take tracks from popular singers of the 70's-90's  cut and paste then play and you have Shakira songs.  One line sounds like Cher followed by an Annie Lennox or Chrissie Hynde sort of vocal.  Bounce like that around every other line of each and every song and there you got the album. <br />Even the songs are retro 90s on the corner street band tunes.  Nothing memorable as music goes. <br /> <br />It's clearly understandable that Shakira the 2000's version of the 80's MTV star.  Popular not because of her music or talent ( or lack there of) but for showing plenty of skin and shaking it in videos. <br /> <br />This is worse than those American Idol try outs ( at least you can laugh at those.  with this CD, only people laphing is the ones that got your money) <br /> <br />There is FAR better music out there with people that do have talent,  don't toss your money away on this one.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Once again Terry Gilliam delivers well above the heads and beyond the intellect of most viewers. <br /> <br />Maybe if he suffered a lobotomy he'd be accessible to the masses and have a commercial hit.
B000002TP7|5.0|Arguably their greatest album ever.It's has so many different musical styles it's unbelieveble.Many consider Check Your Head a better effort but this is as good as they ever got.This album gets my personal vote for best album of 1994.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The last thing I expected to find on a Monday night was a small, indie movie theatre sold out of tickets to see what has been termed the \\"gay cowboy movie\\". Yet, when I went to see Brokeback Mountain last night, I found myself one of the last moviegoers to find a seat in a theatre overflowing with people from all walks of life.     Upon first hearing of this movie, I considered it laughable to have an entire film set around two cowboys falling in love, for it seemed, at best, to be a chick-flick with a political agenda. However, my predication's were quickly discarded. This film is much undeserving of it's \\"gay cowboy\\" stereotype, as it cannot convey the emotional aspect which will inevitably overcome the most callous of moviegoers. For what this movie provides is a heart wrenching tale of two thoroughly complex men, struggling with societal pressures and their desire to be themselves.     The story told in this film is of two men, who meet while working one summer herding sheep on top of, what else, but Brokeback Moutnain. Ennis Del Marr (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves with idle time and only each other to fill it. They spend days riding around on horses and nights sitting around a campfire, talking and drinking whisky. Ennis rarely speaks, and when he does, his words are simple. Jack, on the other hand, is more outgoing in nature. At this time, his spirit seems playful, yet experienced, making for a sharp contrast with that of Ennis. In a surprising turn, for both the viewers and the characters themselves, Jack and Ennis find themselves filled with a primal urges which fuels their first sexual encounter which is void of seduction. They next morning,they both assert that they are not \\"queer\\", yet continue with the relationship, never speaking of their bond, perhaps because they knew no words to define it. When it comes time for them to part, you can see anguish on both character's faces, believing that they will never see the other again. Both characters marry andestablish families before they meet again. When they find each other four years after their work on Brokeback Mountain, they are instantly drawn together again and establish a relationship where they meet a few times a year, for fishing trips where no fish is ever caught. Their story spans 20 years, culminating in a hauntingly tragic ending.     Credit must given to the actors in this film, who truly gave the meaning to each and every character. Much attention should be paid to Heath Ledger, an actor with potential who could never seem to break away from the teen demographic for which his prior films have been marketed. His portrayal of Ennis Del Marr is heartbreaking. With few words, he was able to reveal a array of emotions. With just one look, he could communicate more then words could ever describe. His performance is the reason I cannot get this film out of my mind, a full day since I was present in the theatre. Ledger has found the small intricacies which make this character come to life. The low, rasping voice which seems to come from it's disuse, as well as the slight hunch which hides Ledger's height and conveys his characters venerability. A simple shot of Ledger's soulful eyes can tell the viewers all they need to know about his emotional duress, and will surely leave every onlooker teary-eyed. The way in which he clings to a shirt of Jack's, still upon it's hanger was able to say all that Ennis could not express with words, and was one of the most poignant scenes in the film. In supporting roles, Michelle Williams (as Alma), Anne Hathaway (as Lureen), and Jake Gyllenhaal all do incredible jobs as well, each bringing an intense believability to the roles in which they portrayed. The melancholy nature with which this film concludes, does so, in part because of the exquisite changes each actor brings to their character.     It has been a day since I experianced this movie, yet I can still feel it's ramifications churning in the pit of my stomach. The heartache felt by Ennis Del Marr has yet to leave my being, as my mind reels. This film brings to life a story which will not quickly leave me, one which was so realistic in manner I feel almost as if I had experianced it all myself. Do not be quick to write this movie off as just one of \\"gay cowboys,\\" or a movie with a political agenda. This is a movie with heart, compassion and lose. This is a movie not to be forgotten
0823023494|5.0|I've been a professional Illustrator for 4 years now, and before then an avid student of art. But during all that time, I've bought piles and piles of \\"How To Draw\\" books, namely by Christopher Hart. I was in the book store one day and saw this one and almost just bi-passed it as just another amaturise attempt at trying to make a \\"How to Draw Cartoon\\" book, the cover being the main turn-off. <br /> <br />In my 8+ years of buying these types of books, this is the first time I was simply astonished by what they were presenting; MOVEMENT! <br /> <br />It is rare that anyone write's these books with any mention on how an artist can try to achieve a sense of force and movement, and that is why I so highly recommend this book. The incoporation of how to apply the knowledge to comic book work was also great, not to mention the fact that Tom Bancroft also had the \\"Assignements\\" in the book which gives you a real look into what can go into creating charachters. <br /> <br />From novice to seasoned professional, this truley is a great book!
B000BKVQTS|2.0|The Brothers Grimm stars none other than our favorite hot gay cowboy, Heath Ledger (whose work in \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\" is legendary) and the once-disillusioned mathematical genius who came back from \\"seeing about a girl,\\" Matt Damon. <br /> <br />I had extremely high hopes for this movie. Being that this film is about the illustrious Jacob and Willhelm Grimm, I expected it to be rich with history; to celebrate the culture of fairy tales by profoundly and cleverly portraying the elements of myth in the brothers' lives. <br /> <br />Boy was I wrong. To begin with, the story itself was excruciatingly weak.  The brothers are portrayed as country-roving frauds who scam poor villages out of money by elaborately staging false \\"ghost exterminations.\\" All of a sudden they get in over their heads when they're forced to look into a  truly magically cursed forest that is at the bottom of a handful of childrens' disappearances. <br /> <br />The movie was mostly a mess of disparate scenes that made no sense. There was no history, no character development. It was a shallow movie that did absolutely no justice to the ages of fairy tales that enriched the imaginations of countless generations.  <br /> <br />The one thing that saved this movie was the cinematography. Absolutely stunning and sumptuous. Basically, this movie is eye candy and nothing more. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album has completely blown my socks off. I realize that this album may not be as hard rocking as their earlier work, but the songs are incredible. They fuse a completely new genre of music: taking some wah-wah licks from Hendrix, complimenting it with the patented Flea bass, and then kicking in a catchy chorus that would give Lennon and McCartney the chills. There are still the edgy sexual references in their songs, like \\"SHe's Only 18\\" and \\"Tell Me Baby.\\" Every song shares a common thread, but is also produced in a way to give it its own life. The musicanship is also top notch, with completely appropriate and almost hummable guitar solos. As a die hard fan of the music of the 1960s, I would say from first glance, this is the greatest rock album to be released in the last ten years. If you love rock music, you'll love this album
B00003CXA2|5.0|History is one thing when it's told in a book, it's something amazing when it's told by \\"Forrest Gump\\" The incredible story of the good hearted low IQ man from Alabama and his the highlights of his life that made him famous. He's a war hero who recieves the medal of honor, a football star, a shrimp boat captain, a ping pong player and a national celebrity, he's met 3 presidents- Johnson,Kennedy and Nixon, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Dick Cavett. The Story also follows his personal life with his mother, his friends Dan Taylor and Bubba Blue and the love of his life since childhood, Jenny. One of the most extrodonary, inspiring movies of all time, terrific entertainment, a top notch classic, brilliant, Hanks is the greatest actor of this age. Winner of 6 Academy including Best Picture, Best Actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis- the man behind the Back to the Future Trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is one of my favorite films of all time.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Metal needs a pioneering band to constantly push it into new territory.  Opeth is just the band to answer the call.  I will not mire you in a history of the band,  but I will tell you about this album in a clear, concise manner.  This album is the culmination of roughly eleven years of Opeth working very hard to make the best product possible.  From death screams to crisp 'golden voiced' harmonies, this album is solid enough to hold Atlas and the world on its back.  Buy this album, and see just where it is that metal is going in the 21st century.  Unbelievable.  A five star performance.

B000F0UV0E|4.0|I am with the reviewer.  While not bad and a couple of songs I really like (\\"I Dug up a Diamond,\\" \\"This is Us\\"), I keep waiting for Knopfler to cut loose (we know he can!).  The two are absolutely excellent together, just wish they would push outside of the box a little more (in Spyboy fashion).  Yes, too tame.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|This is a great movie, showing the humanity of the crew of the Enterprise, and allowing for something competely unexcepted to happen, the Enterprise to commit mutinity!! It shows that the people are really human, and can resist the urge of being immortial to saving a race of people.  The Son'a are the 'evil' race in this movie, who need the need for revenge, and munipulate the heads of the Federation to support them because they are doing something that is not revenge, but will help people.  <br />      <br />This is a movie which is acted extremely well, and shows that even in the 24th century, there are still people who will take advantage of other people to get reveng for something that happened hundreds of years ago.
0679759328|4.0|A beautifully written, realistic book, eschewing any triteness or literary cliches.  Atmospheric to the max, with the description of the Swiss countryside almost a character.  Intricate, thoughtful, never a wrong note.  To me, a page-turner.  Didn't want it to end.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|\\"We'll do it like the Italian Job\\"   <br /> <br />This is a excellent movie, with all of the action and suspense one expects from a Bond movie, or from Ocean 11. There is not much foul language, which is another plus, but the beginning is fairly sad. This is better then Oceans 12, and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.  The plot does not seem planned, but is more like that 'we'll take them as they come and deal with it.\\" <br /> <br />Another interesting fact.  <br /> <br />For the metro scenes, they had to completely replace the engines with elecric engines so they could drive them into the subway.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Alright, well I'm really sick of reading these ill informed Tool \\"fanatics\\" who didn't get the album they wanted and give this album a mediocre review. I mean, seriously, Tool is not a radio friendly band. They do not make number 1 hits. I have never liked any Tool album the first time I heard it. You have to absorb the album slowly. Many of these reviewers are not giving this album a chance, and that's just sad. On to the review...    Vicarious: Starts off with a familiar sounding guitar and bass interplay leading into a badass riff by Adam. I love the break in the middle, with those stacato riffs, \\"part vampire, part voyuer...\\", yeah! When Maynard does the \\"la la la la la la la-lie\\" part over that, that's bliss. Song ends with Maynard going an octave higher, sweet.    Jambi: This one rips you a new one with the machine gun riff that nu metal fans will probably recognize. Bass on here is punchy, with the drums doing its own thing in the background. Maynard delivers the vocal goods once again with \\"Shine on forever, Shine on benevolent son/sun.\\" Sounds like the song is about his son, but, what do I know.     Wings for Marie: This song starts off with a gong. Maynards vocals slowly drift in, \\"you believed, you believed in me.\\" It gets heavy for maybe 10 seconds, then goes bare with the lyrics talking about his mother's paralysis. This is pretty much the intro into the next song, as this track and the next are one song.    10,000 Days: A heartfelt song about his mother. This song is the softest on the CD, so, umm... don't listen to this on the bus, you'll miss all the subtlety as the song climaxes with \\"set as I am in my ways and my arrogance, burden of proof tossed upon the believers, you were my witness, my eyes, my evidence, JUDITH MARIE UNCONDITIONAL ONE!!1!!1!!111\\" Excellent.    The Pot: Alot of people judge this song when they first heard the opening vocals, which, are just a little higher than what Maynard usually does, so don't get your panties tied in a knot.However, this song packs alot of attitude, with some superb riffing, and anger that harkons back to the Aenima days. Lyrics are vague to say the least, but this one might get stuck in your head \\"weeping shades of indigo, shed without a reason.\\" One of the more radio friendly songs. I expect this to be the next single.    Lipan Conjuring: I...uhh... actually got this song stuck in my head a week ago. Yeah, kinda sad, considering it's not really a song, just Native American chanting over a tambourine.    Lost Keys: If you like your music to go somewhere, i.e. climax, you'll not like this \\"song\\" at first. This is another interlude, but a nice intro to the next track. The held note in the beginning may irritate at first, but that's what it's meant to do. Sounds like someone woke up in the hospital with a ringing headache...    Rosetta Stoned: This song blew me away the first time, and it still does. I didn't think Tool would ever be this \\"hard\\" again, but sometimes I hear this and I think to myself, it's too hard. There's about 666 riffs in this song, some of them derived from previous songs, many new, and all kickass. There's alot going on, and it doesn't stick to one groove very long. There's alot of pop culture reference in the lyrics, the music itself sounds familiar at times, the story is tongue in cheek and quite amusing. Eargasms are bound to occur with Maynard's amazing vocals like, \\"you believe me don't you, please believe what I just said,\\" and \\"overwhelmed as one would be, place in my position...\\" This might be the best song Tool has ever written. 'Nuff said.    Intension: Man this song is like, way chill. Reminds me alot of Disposition, except this one has lotsa whispering action. The riff in the middle is killer, and the synthesized drum beats are very cool. \\"Move by will alone.\\" Now, how deep is that, think about it.    Right In Two: This song is the second most accessible song on the album, behind Vicarious. Pretty predictable song structure, with verse,chorus, verse, chorus, build up, and climax with some monster riffage. I don't care what anyone says, this song is about the fight over the holy land.    Viginti Tres: Tool knew they were missing their soundscape quota, I knew it, and you knew it. So, here's some random wind and spaceship sounds for you. Hawt! Actually, I'm sure there is more to this song then that, but what it is, I don't know.    To sum up, 10,000 Days is very good. I rank it higher than Lateralus because I can identify more with the lyrics because they aren't as abstract, but lower than Aenima because, well, that is the best album ever. If you like Tool, you definately want this album. Just listen to it everyday for a month and I don't think you'll be very disappointed. If you are a Tool newbie, don't get this! Get Aenima first, then Lateralus, then this. Those are the 3 best albums, and they should be absorbed in that order.
1592401791|2.0|The book is full of interesting information and the author has a nice writing style. However, Geoff has a very clear pro Paul McCartney bias, and admits that he believes it was Paul who arranged for him to have his job. He also admits that Paul was best man at his wedding and that Linda was the wedding photographer. Emerick also writes that his wedding reception was vegetarian to please Paul and Linda over the objections of his own family.  I think these facts as well as others make clear that Emerick is clearly \\"Paul's boy.\\"         I could tolerate this clear bias except for one thing: the author relentlessly bashes George and Ringo, repeatedly depicting them as having little talent and little to offer even in personality.  It happens I am a Beatles fan, own every record, and have seen each of the Beatles perform live after the group disbanded, so I know that much of what he says cannot be true. For example, he repeatedly describes George as a brooding, fumbling, inept guitar player, and demeans some of his musical compositions in an unkind way.  I have seen George perform live in two concerts, and contrary to Emerick, George is a very skilled guitarist.           Emerick clearly is not and was not a \\"Beatles\\" fan although he is a worshipful McCartney fan.  I think many Beatles fans would be offended by some of Emerick's remarks in this book.

0805047905|5.0|I have never written a review , but I HAVE to comment on this one!!!  We bought this book for our daughter when she was one month old along with 6 or so other board books.  At that time she loved them all, but now that she is 6 months old she will only read this one.  She crys if we try to read a different book to her!  I think it is because of the way the words sound like a song and there is a very clear que for her to change the page without me telling her it's time for her to do it.  The pictures are also great because they are bright and there is only one animal to focus on at a time.  I am sure she will love this book for a long time...  now it's time to try \\"Panda Bear, Panda Bear\\" and \\"polar Bear, Polar Bear\\"  good luck!
B000002MY3|5.0|Gosh Alanis Morissette. She's done so much in her life and this is just the beginning. Many will proclaim this as her best work. I agree with that crowd, but let this not distract you from her other music. \\"Under Rug Swept\\" and \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" are great albums, too. And you have a few JLP tracks on the MTV Unplugged and of course there's the Acoustic 10 Year Anniversary version.<br /><br />SONGS:<br /><br />01. All I Really Want [B+] - It took me a bit to get into the song, but the chorus really snagged me close. The background music was unique, but uninviting. I'd have to say the chorus holds it at a B+ and the lyrics are an amazing plus too.<br /><br />02. You Oughta Know [A-] - The first single from the album has a chorus that I sing aloud when I'm alone in my room or working out alone. The chorus defines the truth of the song and anyone can say that this song defines \\"REAL.\\" The music is great, too.<br /><br />03. Perfect [A+] - One of the best songs on the album. Bar none. I just see children like the ones Alanis talks about in this song daily and I know that it's happening which yet again, defines \\"REAL.\\" She knows what she's talking about and the guitar is wonderful.<br /><br />04. Hand In My Pocket [A+] - The second single off the album is incredible! I once sang this karaoke and scored 88% on the machine. =P Anyways, the guitars are unique and masterful and Alanis describes herself which defines \\"REAL.\\" Which now that I've repeated that enough already, I'd have to define the album as \\"REAL.\\" Yay.<br /><br />05. Right Through You [A+] - I just guessed this is a song about the cutthroatness of the music industry. Alanis sheds light on everything behind the glamour and glory. Yet again, the guitar is masterful and... real.<br /><br />06. Forgiven [A-] - I rather call it, \\"We All Had a Reason\\" just because that was repeated over and over again. But to Alanis' avail, she sings with such passion and the guitars are incredible. The lyrics are lovely as well. The only annoying part is that \\"We all had a reason\\" part because it just gets so repetitive and annoying.<br /><br />07. You Learn [A+] - Should there have been a fifth single to the album, I genuinely believe that it would be this as opposed to \\"Perfect\\" or \\"Not the Doctor\\" because it really belongs in the Alanis Jagged Little Pill Singles category. The song is AWESOME. Alanis recommends senseless, yet deep things for her audience to do and then gives the advice, \\"You live, you learn.\\" What lyrics could get more praise? You gotta love the guitar too and the singing on \\"You... LEARN!\\"<br /><br />08. Head Over Feet [B+] - The chorus holds up this song. I think I might have overplayed it [it being the third single from the album]. Yeah sure, Alanis pulls it off with singing and the guitars are great, but it just is a little much. My opinion.<br /><br />09. Mary Jane [A+] - I love this song. I actually first heard it when Nikki McKibbin sang it on Season One on the search for a superstar that is \\"American Idol.\\" Nikki pulled it off and I finally found the right singer of the original Mary Jane and Alanis is her and she pulls this off with such passion and gusto, you are drawn into Mary Jane's world. You can see the hidden meaning of a child on marijuana, hopefully [being that \\"Mary Jane\\" is another name for marijuana]. Alanis tackles the issues and she tackles them well.<br /><br />10. Ironic [A+] - Duh. How could this song not get an A+? Alanis' fourth and last single from the album goes crazy and the lyrics are just so zen it's incredible. The singing is right on and cannot be duplicated. Congratulations, Alanis, this is your star.<br /><br />11. Not the Doctor [A+] - I love this song. I didn't get it at first, but the singing and guitars are enough to enchant you into loving this piece. Later, I figured the lyrics out [thanks to the booklet... it did take forever, though] and this song just pure straight rocks!<br /><br />12. Wake Up [A] - No plus,no minus. Wake Up is a great song. It's not incredible like some of the others, but the lyrics are solely strong enough to keep it out of the minus category. This song's truth really hits you right in the face [of course along with her voice and the background music]. The last track is a good one.<br /><br />BONUS! - You Oughta Know [Alternate Take] [B+] - Yeah. Okay. Why? It's different, but a waste of a bonus track.<br /><br />So overall, this album is incredible and definitely belonging in the top 5 albums of the 90s.2. Wake Up [A] - No plus, no minus. Wake Up is a great song. It's not incredible like some of the others, but the lyrics are solely strong enough to keep it out of the minus category. This song's truth really hits you right in the face [of course along with her voice and the background music]. The last track is a good one. <br /> <br />BONUS! - You Oughta Know [Alternate Take] [B+] - Yeah. Okay. Why? It's different, but a waste of a bonus track. <br /> <br />So overall, this album is incredible and definitely belonging in the top 5 albums of the 90s.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|This reissue is a single cd and includes 9 bonus tracks which will be of interest to fans of the band. The most interesting is the full version of \\"So Deep Within You\\" which sports a cool bass guitar lead-in. Other than the intro there is little difference in this from the released track. Also of interest is the BBC radio version of \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\". <br />Soundwise this release beats the previous 2 cd issues, however the best sounding Moody Blues CD still remains \\"This is the Moody Blues\\" which featured complete re-mixes of key Moody Blues songs by their producer, Tony Clarke. It would have been interesting if a few complete remixes would have been added as bonus tracks. On \\"This Is\\" a lot of buried instrumentation and vocals were revealed- this could have been used to great advantage on this album- for instance the jazzy guitar riff in \\"So Deep Within You.\\" <br />One noticeable oddity is that all cd versions of \\"To Share Our Love\\" obscure the prominent sloshing tambourine that is featured in the intro of the song on vinyl-especially evident in the Nautilus LP version of the LP. This may be nit-picking, but that tambourine really adds a lot to that intro. <br />However these releases should not be missed. This reissue series is equivalent to the Sony Byrds reissues in that they all feature nice booklets and never seen before photos. Unlike the Byrds however the Moodies did not leave a lot of undiscovered tracks in the can-the alternate versions in this reissue series, with few exceptions-do not vary from the commercial release.
0780628551|1.0|The Astronaut's Wife, starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment. My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD's. Since our spare time is so limited, if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes, we stop and put something else on. <br /> <br />I'm sorry to say that The Astronaut's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule. In fact, I found myself watching the timer, wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time. <br /> <br />The first thing is, the movie is slow. Very, very, very slow. There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful, Charlize looking pensive, Charlize looking worried, Charlize looking scared, Charlize looking sad- well, you get the idea. Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel-- noises are slightly muted and have an \\"out-of-body\\" sound to them. <br /> <br />Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie. The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own. In this instance, however, I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part, and we wouldn't have noticed the difference. <br /> <br />If you must watch it, put it on fast forward and read the subtitles. That way you'll get it over with faster. <br />
B00006LI4S|5.0|Ya, that's right I cried. I'm a man. The goosebumps and well just a little tear but hey this thing is moving. This performance from Gilmour is just beautiful and precise. It's an up close, mellow, and intimate setting. Did I mention it's moving. OK OK. After purchasing his newest album On An Island, I had to get this. A new respect has been developed and a new obsession has been formed for this guy. If you've read my other reviews, this is usually the case with me. Well if you love something you naturally research it to death and really dive into it. So I bought the last two Floyd albums courtesy of Gilmour as well. I'm just as blown away.<br /><br />This DVD takes from Wish You Were Here, Division Bell, Momentary Lapse, The Wall, and even Island. Also thrown in is a Richard Wright performance and a couple of cover songs. I just can't get over the writing talent of Gilmour. He really made me take a closer look at his works with Floyd and as a solo artist. Some criticize his lyricism on the new album (On An Island) but I love it. Especially The Division Bell lyrics. It's strange and metaphorically out there. The spacey and whymsical guitar talent is beyond todays standards. On stage Gilmour displays contentment and a lot of class. It's seems he's reached a new platform of maturity, happiness, and freshness to music.
B000F3AB0Q|4.0|Let me get this out of the way right away I have been a fan of the man since the 70's (yes that makes me old)and I run to the store the moment I hear of a new disc coming out. That said this disc is just way to short on new songs and in length. I could have done without the new versions of \\"Midnight Blues\\" and \\"All your Love\\" There was nothing wrong with the originals. As for the rest of the disc I rated it only four stars because he is leaning to much on remaking other people tunes and not enough of his own originals. I know I should be grateful that they still let him make music but coming from a guy who has released so much great music in the last 25 - 30 years this would of been a whole lot better if he had \\"Moore\\" originals. Don't get me wrong this is still a killer CD just give me more \\"Moore\\" next time, and how about touring the US of A we haven't seen you over hear since '91. The best songs on the disc are Flesh and Blood, Cut It Out, & No Reason to Cry. Thanks for the music now get back in the studio and release some more tunes. Even the non-originals are good but just way to many <br />
B000002HH2|5.0|<br />This is Bjork at her best. Here she demonstrates an amazing diversity of images and styles, yet this album has a great integrity. Everything is on par - music, lyrics, recording and design. Simply wow! Zing!! Boom!!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|He writes, <br /> <br />\\"Anyways, the only records deserving of 5 stars in the hard rock/metal genre must provide oustanding musical selections front to back, some examples being: Metallica/Master of Puppets, Guns n' Rose/Appetite for Destruction, Rage Against the Machine/Self-titled, Nirvana/Nevermind for the last 25 years\\" <br /> <br />The problem with your logic, kiddo, is that this album is way better than any of those albums <br /> <br />I agree, anyone who gives this album 4 stars or less wouldn't know good music if it crawled up their...
B00002E23E|5.0|Really this is a awesome video, I saw it originally on VHS, which I had bought used at Blockbuster.  Now to clear up a few matters. About the audio quality, and Zep sounding better in the studio, yes the studio songs are better sounding, most, if not all studio peices are better than their live counterparts.  Second, I don't see all the fuss about the fantasy sequences being that bad, really they are not that bad.  I acually like them... <br /> <br />This is a great DVD for any real Zep fan, if you truely love Led Zeppelin, this is for you!  Buy this DVD, turn up the volume, turn out the lights, find a comfortable seat and enjoy!
0064400018|5.0|The Wilders are a small, happy family, living in the deep woods of Wisconsin. They hunt for their food, and live off the land, the way that many had to in the mid 1800's. The main character and author, Laura \\"Half Pint\\" Wilder, is an adventerous little girl who loves living in the woods with her two sisters, Mary and Carrie, more than anything.<br /><br />The story takes you over a year in the Wilder family's life. They have many adventures, including a panther attack, a visit for Christmas from family members, a bear break-in, and many others to keep the reader entertained.<br /><br />A very good book, and an excellent start to the series.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|I watched each version of Live At Pompeii at least twice, and I must say that the original version is much better that the director's cut.  The main problem I have with the directors cut is that it doesn't transition smooth enough between songs, it would start the song with the band playing in the ampitheater, and give you a jolting flash of some scene that more or less throws the mood of the whole song out the window.  I found it rough to watch, I wanted to see Pink Floyd live.  The directors cut is a bunch of random clips stuck together with little bits of Floyd actually playing. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the original version, focuses longer on Floyd actually playing, you see the effort that every echoing note requires.  THIS is the reason to buy this DVD!  This is Pink Floyd playing music in an ancient theater, a theater that Romans would have watched gladitorial combat in, this is the real deal. <br /> <br />Any true Pink Floyd fan would love this DVD, if not for the directors cut, than the original version.
B000CBSHK2|1.0|Droning vocals. Was hoping for so much more. Where is the passion? This CD is a total bore. Don't even feel I can pass it along.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is amazing, I can't wait to find out which songs are going to be famous, I reckon, Hump De Bump, Turn It Again, Death Of A Martian, Desecration Smile, Slow Cheetah, Snow (Hey Oh), Make You Feel Better have a good chance. <br />By The Way, was good too, so here are my favourite albums so far. <br />1. Stadium Arcadium (all the songs are great) <br />2. Californaction <br />3. Blood Sugar Sex Magik (best front cover though) <br />4. By The Way <br />5. One Hot Minute <br />6. Mothers Milk.

NOW my 3 year old twins LOVE watching many parts of this EXCELLENT video too. This OUTSTANDING VIDEO needs to be released on REGION 1 DVD here in the USA.<br /><br />MoonWalker is a ONE OF A KIND! It has outstanding music and entertainment for ALL AGES!<br /><br />I don't want to buy this again on VHS video.. anyway, they will all be in USED condition.<br /><br />Somebody, ANYBODY! Please get this on Region 1 DVD released here in the USA! My Twins and I would be very greatful!
B000EMGAGW|4.0|I expected their greatest album ever, and instead got a somewhat decent album. These guys really need to kick it up a notch.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|For me, the appeal of \\"Ten\\" was missing. Though I grew more appreciative of their next effort, I continued to resist them due to my rejection of their debut album. Presumably I considered \\"Ten\\" to be too commercial. My loyalties at the time laid with the edgier \\"underground\\" sounds of Nirvana and Alice in Chains-despite both gaining mass audiences. The pop rock feel of \\"Ten\\" lingered in my mind. As time passed, many great Pearl Jam songs were certainly noticed. Not until \\"Do the Evolution\\" appeared did I begin to pay more attention. Incidentally, the raw feel of this song is very much evident in their new album. The band have evolved and matured enough to be able to express through their music a wide range of influences while synthesizing them into their own unique sound. What has emerged is a rock album for the ages; an album which should help to establish them as one of the great rock bands in history.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is about a love affair between two ranch hands in 1963 Wyoming. They take jobs watching over sheep up on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the two. There's not a lot of dialogue in the beginning between them, but there is a chemistry that is obvious to all. After a night of drinking, Ennis decides he can't make it back to check the sheep so he decides to sleep it off there outside of Jack's tent. Ennis begins to audibly shiver as the cold of the night sets in. Jack hearing this invites him in to his tent. Later on as Jack awakes after pulling Ennis' hand around himself, they both are a bit uncomfortable at first but Jack then takes the initiative and they end up having sex. After that neither one wants to speak too much about it but they have this understanding. After the job is cut short due to the weather, at least that's what they are told, they split ways and end up leading their separate lives, both eventually getting married and having children. They then continue their affair on a more frequent baisis over the years. Each telling their wives they are going away with a fishing buddy. That's the basic story. I won't tell anymore. I really recommend you see this film. Chances are if you've taken the time to read this you will enjoy the film.  <br /> <br />All the acting was amazing, but Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were both outstanding. I think it's time for some Oscars for this one. The directing by Ang Lee was stellar as usual. It is just a beautiful film.  <br /> <br />I knew this was going to be a tragic love story from what I'd heard and even the previews gave it away. So I decided to brace myself and try to enjoy it. Well it left me in tears which a lot of movies do, but even more it has stayed with me. I saw it about 6 hours ago and I'm still feeling down. This is not a knock against the movie, in fact it explains how deeply moving the movie is. It's going to make me enjoy my life and thethings I have a little more than I did yesterday. I would imagine everyone will take a little something different from this movie but I think it will affect a lot of people, hopefully in a positive way.  <br /> <br />Before I saw the movie I was talking to a friend who said they were saying on the radio that it's not a gay movie, but a \\"country\\" movie. I'll admit the word gay was never uttered during the movie. I think I understand what they are trying to say, but in my mind it was gay. Don't get me wrong, not like \\"Torch Song Trilogy\\" (great movie), but let's face it, it's about two men in love in an age and a place where that was not an option.
B000EULJLU|2.0|From a musical standpoint, I guess you could say this is a highly technical album.  However, I tend to think most musicians lean away from unusual time signatures and their constant changes because it sounds like crap.    As always, Carey is spectacular on percussion (the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars).  The rest of the bands work seems forced and unmotivated (yes, I know Maynard's mom died and all, my condolences, this cd is still terrible), as if their label simply pushed them to release another cash cow.  I bought this cd expecting Tool - how disappointed I was.  I've listened to it in it's entirity without interruption.  I still don't like it.  And I'm certainly not going to force myself to listen to this over and over again to appreciate it, my time is too important.  I'll just write this off as a loss of $[...] and listen to Lateralus or earlier works when I'm feeling like Tool.
0451527046|5.0|There is certain kind of books that cause (involuntarily, of course) certain ammount of pain. These books are often found on those hated list (hated by any kid out there) of \\"have to read\\" in any school in the world. One of those books definitely is Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. When you look at the book and its contents wihout joy and with sensations of punishment if you fail to accomplish the task that has been given to you, no book can prove any kind of enjoyment, or artistic eye-opening, whatever you like the best.<br /><br />But, every now and then, when you are older, and you try to remember those dear times that are long gone, and you try to evoke them by any means avaliable, sickness that is peculliar to humankind, sickness that we often call nostalgia, you stumble upon some hidden jewel, and suddenly, that that has been covered in dust for many years, starst to shine with a brilliant light and you cannot avert your eyes.<br /><br />There is great ammount of all kind of adventure books out there today, many of those will never be read, reasons being what they are, and there are books, like this one that will often remain in our memory as brilliant example of something that existed in some other time.<br /><br />Story of Jim Hawkins, pirate Long John Silver and their treasure hunt, story that would be called shallow and naive in these days, is wonderfull adventure novel, with charaters so charming in their naivette, with their archaic english, with sea-faring that evokes waves of never-felt nostalgia, with corsairs, pirates, ruthless crimes, chivalry, cunning and many of those long forgotten atributes of world and novels that are being rewritten (or deconstructed) nowadays.<br /><br />In search for your own treasure, whether the one of your spirit, culture, or what-you-like, you should stare back for a moment and remind yourself of the times when you were kid, and when the world was much simpler than it is today.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Okay this albums is old, by now air promoted, toured, and even put out new little singles out. <br /> <br />Anyways: I am a hug electronic music fan and I have all of their cd's. This is by far their most polished, moody and yes a bit cheesy take on electro/french/post modern pop. I use the word post-modern losely because its take on love is very modern and the way it expresses those feelings of love is very much not as redundant as many other artist have already done. Sure they are ballads of love but with a new technofied take on it, with a very unique take on it. I mean the mike mills songs although a bit(tiny bit) cheesy it is very ambitious in its rendition of French Baroque music and how it has tried to modernized it. The arrangements on that song alone, musically are almost genius in its ambitiousness, its vision, creativity and style. From a dance music listeners perspective, that had never been done before and it is almost groundbreaking work.  <br />I would fully recommend this album to anyone given the fact that it is SUCH and easy listening album. If anything -- \\"Too easy\\" perhaps, I mean some of you are saying that it is cheesy but that is because it is a \\"chill out\\" album which is supposed to be not as challenging as something like Radiohead might do for example.  <br />In my opinion this is the perfect album to get into AIR and it exposes their some of their best work, even better than Safari moon which is more lofty/bacground party music. In short if anyone cannot get into this sound then I am pretty sure all the other cds might not be as good to you since this is probably the most polished and most straight forward message that they have in music which is basically about all about love. The other albums they have done, their themes seem to differ and their moods are not as similar, here in this album the whole mood and theme of the album is about love and is very well delivered.  <br /> <br />One more thing, all of you do yourselves a favour and gosee these guys live with your girlfriends. I am a guy and I saw these guys live and they are incredible all of the music being done live with instruments instead of pushing buttons was incredible, it brings a whole new dimension to their music. They are perfect musicians for film scores and for romantic settings, if you are that type of person. That is all I have to say. <br />enjoy. <br />
B00005JOFQ|3.0|There isn't really much to criticize in this movie. The acting is superb, the scenery is stunning, and the emotion is so raw, it really tugs the heart strings. But I have to admit that there was too much hype and pretentious praise to Brokeback Mountain. I wasn't blown away by it. I didn't necessarily think that it was \\"the greatest love story of all time,\\" or that the movie was \\"the best film ever made,\\" but for what it is, it's definitely a triumph that breaks boundaries, hopefully allowing the film industry to broaden their horizons and touch upon deeper and untouched territory that we shouldn't necessarily hide or be afraid of. Even though at times this movie felt a bit too long and was kind of boring at some parts, it's something to check out at least once.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Some Rent-o-philes can't get over the liberties taken by the film version of the beloved Broadway show, but judging a film by the same standards as a theatrical production is simply unfair.  This film does its very best to capture the heart and spirit of the show without trying to outdo the stage show with film-only effects, sets, and superstar casting.  True, some of the original cast members had to be replaced for the film (the most notable substitution being Rosario Dawson as Mimi), but the stage show is still present by all accounts.  Roger, Mark, Maureen, Collins, and Angel are back for the film version and manage to maintain their strong performances after god knows how many times around.  The filmmakers made strategic decisions of which songs to leave out, with some not being missed (Contact - a strange, staccato chanting of sexual innuendo and warnings) and others questionably absent (Goodbye Love, one of the most poignant songs of the entire show).  Overall, the film does the show as much justice as it can and respects the origins of these songs as it portrays them for a larger audience.  The second disc of special features is mostly just a two-hour tribute to the writer of the show which, frankly, could have been done in about thirty minutes.  The commentary track is decent, but doesn't shed as much light on production decisions or other differences between the film and the stage show as I would have liked.
B000EGCITG|4.0|This is the first Pink album I've ever bought; now I will go and check out her earlier stuff.  Terrific songs throughout - my favorites are \\"Stupid Girls,\\" \\"Dear Mr. President\\" (w/Indigo Girls), and \\"\\"Cuz I Can.\\"  I also love the song she does with her dad at the end.  Very touching.  All in all, a great album.  You go, Girl!
B00005JKOI|2.0|Pretty in Pink is your basic ugly duckling story without much else.... other than a screaming view of early 80's fashion.  James Spader's performance as the detestable ringleader of the \\"cool kids\\" gives a sneak peak of his future repeat performances as detestable characters (see: Boston Legal, Secretary, etc.).  Andrew Shue is as irritating as ever with his wide-eyed \\"innocence\\" and pursed lips which are, apparently, meant to indicate internal self-flagellation during his less-than-sensitive moments.  Annie Potts and John Cryer give the only two performances without reproach (and Duckie's famous dance to \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" is not to be missed)but are, sadly, relegated to second-tier characters.  This film isn't even up to par with the other Brat Pack films as far as storyline and character development (which isn't saying much!), but, in the end, at least you'll get a chuckle out of Andie's pink polka-dot atrocity.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I have every PJ studio album, and I must say, this is their finest work since 1998's \\"Yield.\\"  Plenty of kick-butt songs should bring back those who abandoned the group (wrongly, IMO) back in the 90's.  Pearl Jam still rocks with the best of them, and remains one of the best bands in the U.S.!
B000957O82|3.0|Charming as ever, Will Smith carries this film through many pitfalls to come out shining like a new penny (as usual).  Supporting performances are more than disappointing, but Will Smith's squeaky-clean portrayal of a dating expert working to help men get to know women who would never give them a second glance intrigues and holds the viewer's interest through the entire film.  The plot is one we've seen innumerable times before - man thinks he doesn't need woman, woman thinks the same, man and woman meet and begin to change their minds, woman finds out detail about man she doesn't like, man and woman break up, man and woman reunite after woman decides detail wasn't so bad after all.  Still, Hitch ends leaving the viewer feeling amused and not too much stupider (see?) for having watched the movie.
0670032506|4.0|I was disappointed with this book because it isn't significantly different from the author's book, Getting Things Done.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Despite any reviews from those that are \\"too hard rock\\" for he rest of us, 10,000 days is another great Tool album, plain and simple. Well, not so plain and simple. <br /> <br />I, too, was a bit skeptical the first listen or two, as the album felt a bit slower and quieter than their previous volumes of work. But as I listened I began to appreciate the album all the more. The flow of the 10,000 days is similar to that of a series of waves on a stormy day. Hits you hard at first then backs off a bit and lets you think everything is all right before it slams back down. <br /> <br />Vicarious is the first wave, straight through cookie cutter Tool. Hard riffs, hard singing, catchy tune. Jambi backs off a little, though still has a rough edge about it. Wings pt 1 backs the storm down to a dull roar which works its way into the melodic pulse of the title track, 10,000 days (wings part 2). Almost tribal in nature the song works itself slowly into a frenzy at parts only to calm itself back down again, then ending up as wings part 1 ended up for the most part. Bridging the gap between the title track and the next actual full-on song are two tracks that are more \\"mood\\" tracks than anything else. A group of native sounding men chanting out a song, followed by a classical \\"noise\\" track which works its way into the next full song \\"Rosetta Stoned\\". This track wierded me out at first, but it has quickly become my 2nd favorite track on the album, beneath the title track. Following this track is a slower track which repeats the same words a few times and some nice bongos to go along with it etc. Topping off the album (aside from the final track which is just creepy sounding static noise), is a very clever song called \\"Right in Two\\", which ends the storm of 10,000 days on a light note, fading off with the tide. <br /> <br />Overall, this album was great. I'd recommend it to anyone who has listened to anything by Tool ever. It is not a down point in their work but, rather, a forward point.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|\\"Munich\\" manages the difficult feat of presenting Steven Spielberg at his best, and at his worst, demonstrating his considerable gifts in the way of pacing, creating suspense, and generating a response from his audience while at the same time greatly underestimating the intelligence of his audience. For every moment that inspires awe, there is another that inspires a collective cringe, as the audience realizes it is being trusted with nothing, and has been lead around by its nose by a director that is so determined to make sure we get his message that he is willing to abandon all subtlety in order to do so.    Consider: The central character in Spielberg's \\"Munich\\" is an Israeli wet-work specialist named Avner. Avner is hired, along with several other men, to enact bloody retribution against those responsible for plotting the execution of Israeli athletes at the Olympics in the early seventies. His wife is expecting a child. In one scene, we see him coordinating the murder of a Palestinian sympathizer who has a young daughter. We know he has a young daughter because she is paraded around for several minutes, exchanges significant looks with the Israeli assassins, acts cute as a button, and is serenaded by vibrant, melodramatic music. This would be bad enough in itself-- surely, the Palestinian who is to be assassinated, an articulate, even-tempered man who seems as far from a terrorist as can possibly be imagined, is sympathetic enough on his own. But no. Spielberg not only drags in the child, and uses her as a device to create suspense when it seems like she might be in the line of fire. Not only do we get a scene where Avner is waiting in the hospital for his wife to deliver her baby, as a counterpoint to the violence he has just perpetrated.    No, Spielberg is still not convinced that we get it. So, we get a scene in which the most reluctant member of the assassination squad (a man whom the Mossad, an organization that relies on men whom it knows to be dedicatedto the preservation of Israel, never would have hired for the work in question to begin with) congratulates Avner on the birth of his child. This is followed by a close up of Avner's ashen face. Avner turns to walk out the door... and is stopped by his interrogator, who congratules Avner again-- for the successful assassination of the Palestinian man with the child, who, it seems, has officially died of his wounds. Another shot of Avner's conflicted visage. End of scene.    It's a testament to Spielberg's considerable talent that his film is able to survive such embarassing lapses in judgment, which occur often, but are counterbalanced by the sheer momentum of the film he has created. For the most part, \\"Munich\\" is a lean, brutal, fast-paced work of art. The film is impeccably organized and structured. We begin with a galvanizing recreation of the Palestinian attack on the Munich games. Then, we are briefly introduced to Avner, and his wife. Then, Avner is given his mission, and the rest of the film, more or less, follows a rigid structure that would become repetitive, were it not so well-handled by Spielberg.    That pattern is as follows: First, we are introduced to Avner's contact, the man who finds the targets for the Israeli assassins. Then, we are introduced to the targets, in brief vignettes that create sympathy for them. Then, we see the Israelis at work, plotting the assassination. Then, the assassination commences, briefly and brutally. Then, the team members face the aftermath of what they have done, debate the merit of what they have achieved, wonder about whether they can trust their contacts, and view news reports about the reprisals their own mission has spurred. Intercut throughout are flashbacks of the events at Munich, as more and more of the actual violence is revealed to us.     This happens over and over again. Did I believe what I saw? Was I convinced that it happened this way? Not really. As I mentioned earlier, Mossad, the Israeli spy network, has always been an organization that takes the loyalty of its members very, very seriously. It surely would never have hired men like Karl, the reluctant, very liberal member of the team, who incessantly questions whether it is RIGHT to kill any man at all (remember, this is supposed to be an assassin!) for such a mission. Similarly, Avner, the protagonist of the film, the leader of the Israeli team, is seen to undergo a crisis of conscience as a result of his labors. I was unsurprised to learn that the real Avner has never expressed such doubts-- the book on which \\"Munich\\" is based, and Avner's own comments (he's still alive) bear this out.     Further, Spielberg is so determined not to offend any Palestinian sympathizers that we never encounter any radical Islamists-- you know, the kind that blow up buses in Jerusalem, not because they wish to liberate Palestine, but because they believe that Jews are infidels who pray to the wrong god-- indeed, we never encounter any Palestinians at all who seem more extreme than, say, Mahmoud Abbas. Avner has an extended political debate with a young Palestinian who sounds like an International Relations major from Cal-Berkeley.     But I digress. The ideas behind the film take a backseat, for the most part, to the dynamic action on the screen at almost all times. Rarely has film violence been wielded so effectively. There is blood and gore, but it is brief and far from exploitive. The aftermath of a surprisingly large explosion, which leaves a body hanging from a ceiling lamp, and a confused young couple wandering around, naked, bleeding from their eyes, and seemingly waiting to be told what to do next, is incredibly well staged. But the film's best set piece is a massive Israeli operation in Beirut, in which something like eighty Palestinians are killed by machine gun fire, doors are kicked down, and it seems like forty people are on screen at any given time-- but we never once lose track of what's going on. Lest we forget,Spielberg reminds us that he knows how to direct action masterfully.    The spiraling sense of doom that accompanies the latter half of the film, in which it becomes evident that no one can be trusted, the team starts to fall apart, and the effectiveness of the mission becomes increasingly called into question, is something to be experienced as well. There is a subplot that is jump started by Avner's encounter with a lonely woman at a bar that has the logic of a nightmare-- not the \\"War of the Worlds\\" kind, but the kind Scorcese created in \\"After Hours.\\" Spielberg has never strayed this far from the mainstream, and it's something to witness.     In the end, I believe \\"Munich\\" is worth seeing. It's not the message movie that many have made it into. It's a gripping work that exploits all of the resources of the cinema-- sometimes to its detriment, where emotional manipulation is concerned-- and even the more conservative members of the audience should appreciate it without feeling like Spielberg is spoon-feeding them liberal propoganda. I don't see \\"Munich\\" as a pro-Palestinian polemic-- I see it as an suspense film that wants to enthrall its audience above all things but doesn't want to be accused of neglecting political correctness. Accordingly, it makes concessions, to Palestinians, to the liberal supporter of their cause, and, yes, to the audience's intelligence.     There is much to admire here, but I can't help but wonder what might have been, if Spielberg let the Mossad be as uncomprising and rigid as they have proved themselves, over the years, to be, and done the same with a number of the Palestinians. The reason that peace between Israel and Palestine has proved untenable is because neither side has proven willing to compromise. On the basis of Munich, you'd draw the conclusion that a long-winded discussion would settle everything, as all parties seem mutually conflicted. History has proven that this is simply not the case.     Rated R: Though there is somesexuality and language, the film's violence is what stands out above all else. \\"Munich\\" contains a great deal of violence and an extraordinarily high body count, but Spielberg deserves a medal for the taste in which he handles it. It's gruesome and messy without drawing attention to itself, as I felt \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" did, and is thus more palatable than, say, the violence in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" or \\"Casino.\\" I don't think the average audience member will have a problem with what they see.
B000EJ9MTW|1.0|This particular band lacks originality and depth in their music.

0060555661|4.0|This book does deserve the 4 stars ans it is the bible for value investors, however I believe most investors will get more out of reading a book about Warren Buffets investing stlye, like \\"The Warren Buffett Way\\" or \\"Buffetology\\", they condense down the information found in this book and add what Buffett learned from Philip Fisher and others.<br /><br /> The key learning I took away from this book were:<br /><br />1).The stock market could be compared to having a partner in a business named \\"Mr. Market\\", and every day based on the earnings of your business Mr. Market would come and make you an offer to buy out your share in the business. His offers could be any where from 10 to 40 times the yearly earnings of the business. He would base most of his offers based on what he logically thought were the future potential for growth in earnings, but on occasions he offers would reflect greed or fear.It was your job to determine when and if to accept any of his offers. This is the best analogy I have ever heard of the stock market.<br /><br />2).A lot of this book is very out of date having several editions, but the last one is from 1974, I was shocked at how the boom and bust of the early 70's resembled the late 90's crash. If I had read this book before 2000 I believe the over valuations in internet stocks would have been VERY obvious.<br /><br />3).The big learning is make your money when you BUY the stock,buy when the price is unfairly depressed, buy great companies that the stock market has missed that have a huge potential for growth through being well ran.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Having read the short story by Annie Prouix (which I thought was very good, but not particularly outstanding) and read so much about the movie before I got a chance to see it, I was actually prepared for a letdown if \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (2005) did not live up to my own expectations or the mega-hype in the media. I'm happy to say that the hype is well justified, as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is indeed a magnificient, flawlessly acted and directed, landmark film and the ultimate \\"love story\\" for our age.  <br /> <br />Two down-on-their-luck young cowboys, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), accept a summer job from a burly rancher (Randy Quaid) to tend a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. The closeness of working together leads to a physical and romantic relationship, one which Jack doesn't want to lose after the job is ended. But this being Wyoming in the 1960's, the genuine affection they felt for each other was repressed in some \\"good ol' boy\\" horsing around, and they went their separate ways, with Jack going back to his family in Texas. Several years later, and both married with children, they meet again and rekindle their relationship, getting together at Brokeback Mountain for regular \\"fishing trips\\" which Ennis' wife eventually gets wise about. When Ennis' marriage ends, Jack shows up, willing to end his own marriage if Ennis would agree they should be together. It has been almost 20 years since they first got together, but Ennis still assumes a \\"macho cowboy\\" facade and insists they cannot be together, despite an emotionally-wretching scene when they agree not to see each other for a while. Keep the tissues handy for this one.  <br /> <br />Nominated for 7 Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee, who absolutely redeemed himself for subjecting us to \\"The Hulk\\"), Best Actor (Heath Ledger, who showed an acting range of raw emotion not evident in any of his earlier work), Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams,who played Ledger's wife, and is today his real life live-in girlfriend and mother of the baby they recently had together), Best Screenplay and Best Original Song (\\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\"). \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" also won 8 other awards at various film festivals and critic competitions, and is sure to be a contender at Oscar time as well ... and it is all well deserved.  <br /> <br />Don't think of it as a \\"gay movie\\" or modern western. Think of it as a parable of our times, and how our society can often keep true love from prevailing. It's a message that anyone can relate to, and everyone can't help but feel. To paraphrase a review by Entertainment Weekly, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" redefines our concept of a love story, and has the power to deeply affect the minds and hearts of anyone who sees it. DON'T miss this one.
0671449028|5.0|Our family loves this book. It is well written and the illustrations are simple but offer a variety of opportunites for discussion with my two year old daughter (colors, animals, sizes, etc). In addition, we have incorporated the book into our bedtime routine and the effect of the repetition is usually successful in achieving the ultimate goal: SLEEP!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a really fun album, very good for the summer.  <br /> <br />To paraphrase Flea, if you don't like this album, you don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
B00005JOVN|2.0|This so called remake completely missed the boat. Solid performances by Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are wasted with a poor supporting cast and little to no suspense. The special effects are good, but the script is so weak that it can't save this movie. You are much better served watching the original!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko stretches ones level of imagination beyond the norm.  Jake Gyllenhaal as the Jesus-like figure of Donnie pushes the limit with an unusual, yet brilliant, performance.  This movie can be described as a thriller with some obscure comedy and also much darkness and despair thrown in.  If you are looking for a great film you can watch multiple times, then look no further than this star studded gem.
1932907009|5.0|If you're new to the madness of screenwriting (like me) and are looking for direction from someone other than a so-called guru, most of whom have never written and/or sold a script, then read this book.  It's informative and fun.  I had read McKee's \\"Story,\\" which was valuable, but made me want to buy a bottle of Jack Daniels and a Colt .45.  I really was looking for something by someone who was writing and selling and whose prose didn't encourage thoughts of suicide.   Lo and behold here it is.  Read it.  You won't regret it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  The combination of comedy along with historical aspects in relation to Homers 'Odyssey' is a good fit for The Coen brothers.  I strongly recommend this movie. <br />P.S. the soundtrack has some catchy tunes as well!
B000002GZ1|5.0|This is the one album, (I got it in the 60's), that you never skip a track. Every song is great. Turn it as loud as you can handle it and really listen to the beat. There's nothing like it! Bloomfield is the best at making the guitar resonate and bite. Every note is purposeful and exactly played. The album is the template for all other blues since then. I'm always listening for the next Butterfield band. Haven't found it yet, still looking!!<br /><br />Ted Shred

The answer my friend is 'Blowin in the Wind .The answer is Blowin in the wind.\\"<br /><br />Dylan's special richness in intonation and innuendo, in those wild changes of feeling given by a sudden harmonica riff, or a sneering scowl in tone are part of the greatness of his music. It just has so much in it, and is talking and singing to us in more than one way.<br /><br />This record has the war protest songs, and the romantic songs.And it has above all the voice and music of a great American original.
0393317552|5.0|This is an excellent must-read, and ought to be a reading book assigned for classes in High School and/or college. It is more than just another anthropology book as it gives the real reasons why societies and civilizations came to be the way they are, by giving personal accounts of environmental and trade conditions that existed in majors societies throughout history. This book is not racist in anyway, on the contrary, it gives the history to how differences in class and standard of living between cultures came to be.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Immensely enjoyable, flawlessly arranged, composed and performed by Prince this is a GREAT album!!! Musicology was hailed as a return to form, but this one definitely exceeds that! Much more focused, consistent and tight this one thrills and delights on every turn. Not even one average track here. As licensed joyologist Helen Madden would put it: ''I love it! I love it! I LOVE IT !!! ''
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|At first, you might be thinking, \\"Why do we need yet another remake of Pride & Prejudice?\\"  It's a valid question.  I mean, it hasn't been that long since the BBC remade the famous story; however, this version of the Jane Austen classic is, in my opinion, the best one yet.  From the casting, to the adaptation, to the beautiful cinematography this is a far superior film.  If you loved Austen's novel, then you will love this film.  It stays true to the book better than any version I've seen and the casting is nearly perfect.  I'm not a huge fan of Kiera Knightley, but she was wonderful as Elizabeth Bennett.  Equally as good is Rosamund Pike as the lovelorn older Bennett sister, Jane.  Whenever she is on screen she far outshines any of the other actors around her.  Of course, there's Mr. Darcy as played by Matthew Macfadyen.  Throughout the film he has to play the sourpuss and condescending Darcy who is unwilling and unable to show true emotion; however, if you really watch Macfadyen's performance you can see so much just by looking at his eyes, which convey so much that is left unsaid.  When Darcy finally does let his guard down it's almost alarming.  The entire cast of this film, which is mostly British, but with some Americans thrown in for good measure, is just wonderful.  Director Joe Wright assembled the perfect group of people to play these roles.
0684833395|5.0|This book is genious. It's so hilarious. It manages to make as serious a topic as war funny. But at the same time, Heller makes it clear just how terrible a thing war is. This book isn't for everyone, it's a love-it-or-hate-it book. The sense of humor is hard for some to understand. If you read the first one or two chapters and don't find yourself laughing, just stop reading right there. But if you're like me, you'd have fallen in love with it by then.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Somebody here recently penned a review claiming rather curiously that this breathtaking and profoundly heart-wrenching motion picture offered him nothing new. Having taken in the film for myself, I can testify to you here and now that this is quite simply not the case.  <br /> <br />Ang Lee has crafted the one film that audiences will be talking about for many long years to come. The buzz it generates, contrary to what some may otherwise believe, will not cater to the media's recent and over-exaggerated abuse of the words \\"bravery\\" or \\"courage.\\" Especially not as such terms relate to Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger and their joint decision to star in this production. More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the discussion \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is. Director Lee is the one who should be labelled brave. He, working directly from the Annie Proulx short story, has given us a revolutionary firsthand view of a deeply-rooted romance that was, for the time period it was set in, considered strictly taboo. The year 1963, one must remember, was far and away removed from the much more tolerable climate of today's modern society. This is why we can so strongly identify with the harsh inner conflict facing Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. We feel their angst, the sheer emotional passion they have for one another and, ultimately, the genuine frustration of realizing they can never fully or openly embrace their mutual attraction.  <br /> <br />My spouse and I were in a theater, way out in the suburbs, on opening day to experience this film amongst a packed house with varying cross-sections of other people young and old alike. Not a single one of them, I should mention, got up and left throughout the entire showing. There are simply no sufficient words for me to adequately describe just how powerful and totally touching this movie's driving message proved. I cannot, in my entire life, recall a time I ever saw so many members of the crowd as positively touched as they were by \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due. It may not change the minds of those who unfortunately shun homosexuality in general. But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore. Love, no matter how you may look at it, is what it is.  <br /> <br />I am recommending this movie to everybody I know. It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture. Ang Lee, Ms. Proulx, take a bow and thank you both very much.

B000E0W24S|5.0|Shaw once said loftily that Tchaikovsky has a thoroughly Byronic ability to be intensely tragic about nothing much. Without going quite so far, I'd certainly agree that a certain sepulchral tone and a propensity to whip up frantic emotion come to him easily. I don't think I ever heard the start of the 5th symphony expressed with quite such cavernous gloom as it is on this set nor the frenzy more frenzied, and that is exactly how I like it all done.<br /><br />This set dates from 1960, the height of the cold war, and at that time Mravinsky had been very little heard in what we used to call `the west'. It was a period when western critics were inclined to favour a smoothed-over play-safe school of interpretation of the musical classics. This had something to be said for it as a reaction against the libertarian excesses of some previous schools, but it descended into a facile mediocrity based to all intents and purposes on checklists and box-ticking, reaching its nadir in the 70's and 80's when the main aesthetic preoccupation in many commentaries was the issue of how many repeats had been observed. Myself, I am thoroughly in favour of professionalism from professional musicians, but on the other hand I don't find checklists a very illuminating guide through the gardens of the muses. It also seemed to me that our ideas of how to play Tchaikovsky were probably too influenced by our ideas of the Viennese classics, and the advent of Mravinsky in London came none to soon.<br /><br />It was enlightening to me to compare Mravinsky's account of the 4th symphony with a fine modern version from Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic. On the checklist approach Abbado does very well indeed. I don't impugn the professionalism of the Leningrad orchestra in any way when I suggest that they are not quite the equal technically of the Vienna players, something I noticed particularly in the pizzicato effects in the third movement. However when it came to the question which interpretation had the greater individuality and sense for the composer's idiom, the answer was not long in coming. Put simply, Mravinsky's performance is an event, and Abbado's, by comparison, is not. This is not a matter of taking undue liberties with the tempo. The 4th symphony does not call for that, and Mravinsky deploys only a very normal ebb and flow. The tone-quality has more to do with it, and I find myself bewitched by the penetrating sound of the Leningrad woodwind and brass, but most of all it's a matter of the expression. A great interpretation of Tchaikovsky must put across a sense of neurosis without losing control. Quite apart from the tragedy, gloom and semi-hysteria there must be a tense and nervy feel to the gaiety, and the lyric sections should seem like balm on wounds, and these are the senses I get uniquely from Mravinsky.<br /><br />When it comes to the 5th, the liner-note has some fairly superficial and noncommittal remarks about freedom of tempo and `authenticity'. The issue here seems to me to be that Tchaikovsky is trying to achieve something more distinct than before from the Viennese style. The tightly integrated structure of a first movement at which Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms were so adept was not his natural style, and he lacked their mastery in varying the lengths of musical phrases. His first movement is more a succession of short episodes, and without labouring the question of authenticity I'd say that the sense of the music demands a certain amount of flexilibity, although this composer does not micro-specify the details in the way Mahler does. As a comparison from a different standpoint I played my version from Celibadache. By contrast Mravinsky sounds the soul of `correctness', notably in the first movement where Celibadache starts the allegro at a funereal pace, getting much faster a little later. I don't recommend it as any model, but it has the feel of real Tchaikovsky to me, and I prefer it to any 10 spick-and-span western versions.So does Mravinsky, and I appreciate the comment in the liner that he shows some of the virtues of Toscanini and of Furtwaengler combined.<br /><br />With the 6th Tchaikovsky has finally got his formula right. Instead of a seamless Viennese first movement he writes great separate blocks of music, and Mravinsky plays the effect up with long pauses between them. In the finale he abandons `cyclic form', which doesn't amount to a form but is just a matter of bringing back themes from earlier movements in the finale. Brahms's 3rd shows how the thing can be done, but late romantic symphonists in general are not such musical aristocrats as Brahms. The device is something I learned to dread. Dvorak uses it, but not in his best works, it lets down even so great a composition as Franck's symphony, and in Tchaikovsky's 5th the matter is carried to such excess that it takes Mravinsky or Celibadache to make it tolerable to me. The 6th leaves all that behind, and I never heard a performance to equal this. I recall some comment many years ago to the effect that this 1960 stereo version is not the equal of his 1956 epoch-maker in mono, but I own both and I find little to choose.<br /><br />This set, for me, is what Tchaikovsky is all about. The orchestral discipline is total, the sound is thrilling (compare Mravinsky at the start of any of these symphonies with anyone you like), this that and the next detail is better than in any other version, but it's the overall sense of communication of the personality of Russia's greatest composer that grips me. The question that the liner poses in its last paragraph is a false antithesis. The 6th shows Tchaikovsky at the height of his powers and is also a suicide note. Blackmail can never have had so eloquent an outcome.eciate the comment in the liner that he shows some of the virtues of Toscanini and of Furtwaengler combined.

B000EMGAOY|1.0|the Red Hot Chili Peppers had a moment in the early 90's where they connected with a Hybrid of Pop,Elements of Funk&Hip-Hop flavoring that made them cool for a minute.but they ain't been able to go beyond cliches since about 92/93&have been playing it safe&just repeating the same grooves,&the Production been the same over the past decade. nothing really stands out here. if this were a 8 song single album i might say average&even then that might be too much.
0767817486|3.0|I just got done watching this movie. Well, on the one hand, I have to admit that it was very well done. The acting was believable and convincing, the settings LOOKED like Turkey (I know, I've been there) and the soundtrack was pretty good.  <br /> <br />But on the other hand, it bothered me that this movie's trying to make me feel sympathy for someone who did a crime. In my opinion, he broke the law, therefore he got what he deserved. SOL pal!  <br /> <br />It also appeared to me that this movie is trying to show \\"US=good\\" and \\"Turkey=bad\\". How irresponsible can people get? If you've paid any attention to current events, guess what? Turkey is now showing a movie called \\"Valley of the Wolves\\", in which Americans are demonized in the Iraq war. Supposedly it's a big hit over there in Turkey. Hmmm, I wonder why.  <br /> <br />I vacationed in Turkey in 2005, and personally, I had a GREAT time. Turks are indeed hospitable (thanks for all the \\"tourist tea\\"!). Not surprisingly, I did not see ONE American tour group. I was with a German one. Even the Japanese vacation in Turkey! But apparently not too many Americans. Hmmm, again, I wonder why. <br /> <br />A bit of advice if you're planning on going overseas and want to avoid that one-in-a-million chance of getting into the sort of prison this movie depicts: <br />1) TRY to learn the language <br />2) Blend in (don't wear your \\"Proud to be American\\" shirt over there <br />3) Respect/follow their customs <br />4) Don't do anything stupid (like smuggle Hashish).  <br /> <br />If you want to watch a movie about a terrible prison with a lot more merit to it (and also based on a true story, to boot), then I HIGHLY recommend \\"Papillon\\" and also the book by the same title by Henri Charriere.
1591396190|1.0|The book is very naive, in assuming that the blue ocean market is a stable one like the \\"red ocean\\" market. The reason for the existance of cut-throat competition in \\"red ocean\\" markets is  also the reason why \\"blue ocean\\" markets will become \\"red ocean\\" makets.-eventually. <br /> <br />I had this in mind before reading the book, and the book did not deal with this problem with the strategy. I believe this is THE reason why \\"red ocean\\" market is the dominent form of market not the \\"blue ocean\\" market.
B00005JOVN|1.0|This movie kind of proves that you can't improve on the classics.  I feel so bad, as to how bad, that i don't want to say any more bad things about this film.  It's just poor.  Get the original and rent it.  Check out the actors of yesterday against these want-to-be's.
B0006399FS|5.0|First of all, I rarely give anything 5 stars, but I assure you this album is that good.  I have been a long time U2 fan and i got this the day it came out about a year and a half ago.  I still listen to it all the time.  It seems to get better and better as time goes on.  If you are a casual U2 fan or if you \\"used to\\" like U2, do yourself a favor and get this album.  It is my favorite of all their albums, which is difficult to say because previously I had been an \\"Achtung Baby\\" phanatic.  If you are not familiar with this album this may sell you on it: \\"Vertigo\\" is my least favorite track on the album. (although I still love it)
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Just when you think she couldn't get any better, she did.  This amazing album is one of Celine Dion's greatest works.  I mean it.  There is nothing even close to this, it doesn't compare to all of her other albums.  I used to think that D'EUX (a.k.a. \\"The French Album\\" in the States)  was her absolute best, but this truly wins. <br /> <br />Never before have you heard the rocker chic in Celine, but with it's premier single \\"Tout l'or des hommes\\" you see just that.  She also does a country-rock song with some of her best vocals in her career called \\"Ne Bouge Pas!\\" <br /> <br />She reprised \\"Et, je t'aime encore\\" on this album, but this time in French which follows the english lyrics almost to the perfect 't.'  The video is probably her least interesting of her career, but this song is meaningful. <br /> <br />One of the largest highlights of this superb album is the 3rd single \\"Contre Nature.\\"  It is Celine at her best, the Celine we all know and love.  This ballad is the ballad among ballads. <br /> <br />This album is excellent!  Buy it!  Do you have to speak French to enjoy it?  Non, non...ce n'est pas necessaire...mais c'est tres bien si vous parlez francais! <br /> <br />Merci, Celine!  Je t'aime et je t'aimerai pour le rest de ma vie!
B000E97Y6K|4.0|I recenty read one reviewer observe a \\"massive violation of the suspension of disbelief\\" concerning the fact that the three main characters survive such numerous and perilous pitfalls throughout the film.  To anyone else who has noticed this about the movie, I have this small reminder to issue:    Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" contains a giant, 2-story gorilla, large man-eating worms, AND DINOSAURS!!.  Normally, after seeing such things in a film, ones 'suspension of disbelief' should have been asked to leave the theater.    The 'realistic question' you should all be asking yourselves is this:  Why didn't Ann wet herself after standing on the very TIPPY FRIGGING TOP of the Empire State Building?!  I mean, C'mon!  She had to have looked down at least once!!
B000EWBKM6|1.0|This is INSANE.  Where the Hell are seasons 5-8?  How can they release the series finale FIRST?  I'm annoyed (as is everyone).  And yeah, I was angry over \\"Friends\\" for the same thing.  It's been forever since season four was released, and I say that we all BOYCOTT the series finale DVD until at least seasons 5 and 6 are out!  I feel like I \\"just watched that episode\\" every time I pull out seasons 1-4 because the discs only go \\"so far!\\"
0143036556|1.0|I found this book to be full of scattered opinions and incorrect assumptions. I bought the hardback and will throw it away rather than give to another.  Parts of the book are interesting, and as I read it I took the authors work at face value.  However whenever he ventured into my area of expertise, agribusiness, I found that the author had only an armchair understanding and opinion of agricultural markets and practices - this led me to doubt the complete work.   <br /> <br />I greatly anticipated reading this book - sadly I can not recommend it at all.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This is without a doubt the most overrated album that I can think of at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, Tool has produced some real musical gems.  The problem is that this was 10+ years ago. <br /> <br />This album seems like it was intended to drag its listener through a 70+ minute diatribe of woe, all the while wreaking of mediocrity.  Perhaps this is the deep, subtle meaning that Tool worshippers seem to be going on about *shrug*.  Or perhaps it's simply that the band has \\"evolved\\" musically from their harder roots into a more emotionally charged artistic phenom (Metallica comes to mind).  If this is the case, the album still sucks. <br /> <br />I don't see why I need to keep listening over and over, or light candles and meditate as some reviewers suggest, in order to appreciate this work.  I suppose if I start stabbing myself in the eye with a spoon repetitivly, I might begin to notice some subtle feelings or disguised truth of the action that I previously failed to comprehend. <br /> <br />If you were a fan of Tool since the beginning of their career, don't waste your money.  If you just started listening to them on their last album, enjoy posting about how hard your life is on myspace.com, and are looking for some emo a little bit harder than Simple Plan, go ahead and give this album a shot.
B0000070QS|5.0|A lot of people at the time of the release of this album, did'nt think that Morten could write or produce propper compositions like his collegues in a-ha. However he proved the critics wrong.  <br /> <br />The album is a fantastic piece of art and very much typical of Morten. Very mature, very thoughtful and very melancholic. <br /> <br /> <br />Of all the soloprojects from the members of a-ha, Morten's Wild Seed album has been the biggest sucess. <br /> <br />AND in response to Mr. Brian E. Erland \\"Rainbow Sphinx\\"  <br /> <br />Morten Harket can still hit the high notes as he did during the 80's with a-ha. He still does it when he tours with his collegues in a-ha. Both in old and new songs. <br /> <br />The song \\" Summmer Moved On \\" from the a-ha album \\" Minor Earth Major Sky \\" ( 2001 ), includes a note that Morten holds for 20, 2 seconds ( without any studio enhansments ). This is a world record. <br /> <br />
B000AGTPUU|5.0|People look at me funny when I say that I had never heard of The Polar Express until this film was released.  Somehow, I was never introduced to the book as a child.  Hopefully, with this wonderful film now available along with the original book, no other child will grow to adulthood without taking a ride on The Polar Express.  It's a wonderful story about the spirit of Christmas and the importance of giving.  The incredible animation of the film may always be the first thing people speak of, but in the end it really does come down to the story.  It is not what you see, it's what you feel - these are the memories that will linger.<br /><br />The digital animation that brings this story to visual life is nothing short of astounding. This revolutionary \\"performance capture\\" technology makes these characters the most life-like animated characters I've ever seen.  I think they look more human than actual humans, truth be told - except for Santa.  It's a weird thing about this Santa Claus; he immediately reminded me of none other than Harry Potter's Professor Snape (even though Santa's voice was actually that of Tom Hanks).  I've heard that some kids found the whole visual look of the characters rather creepy, but I think the uncanny technology really makes the film come alive.  By incorporating the motions of live actors into the digital creative process, filmmakers were able to imbue their creations with the nuances of human expression, and one can hardly underestimate just how much that adds to the viewer's experience of the animated story.  It's really quite incredible.  Traditional animation would hardly have done this story justice, and it would have been incredibly challenging to film such a magical journey in the traditional manner.  This film has some of the most unique and exciting camera angles and perspectives I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's hard to see how anyone, child or adult, could not enjoy this movie.  It's an incredible journey, filled with both excitement and comedy, to the North Pole, for Pete's sake.  There are also moments of great warmth and emotion - most of them supplied by the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye).  Tom Hanks may steal the show in his performance of five different roles, including the Hero Boy at the center of things, but the Hero Girl - who befriends a forlorn little boy (Peter Scolari) who shies away from everyone else - is the heart and soul of this film.<br /><br />I chuckled when I read the editorial review because I also thought of Nuremberg when I saw the masses of elves rallying around Santa before his Christmas Eve departure.  Clearly, though, there is nothing but joy and kindness in this mass assembly of people - er, elves.  I loved this movie.  Unless you're a grinch or a Scrooge, just watching it will take you back to your own days of childhood and the magic that Christmas once brought.

B000ENWKN8|4.0|What a good CD!!  This latest from Rob Zombie has been a long time coming. Although, I am not mad at him, because his movies are amazing. It just seems like we waited forever to get a new CD release out of him. But, it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />On Educated Horses Rob Zombie changes some things yet keeps some things the same and the finished product is outstanding. A lot less screaming (which in my opinion is for the better), he seems to have taken on more of the industrial sound over the metal. Don't get me wrong, the metal is still present, but the industrial is the more prodominant sound heard here. I like it a lot. I would have to say that I like this CD (as a whole) the best.<br /><br />There are so many good songs on here. There is not one that I skip over. But, my favorite one is: \\"American Witch\\".<br /><br />Great job and worth the purchase!!
B000683VI4|4.0|As much as I enjoyed this movie for its terrific acting, beautiful cinematography, mature and sensitive writing and directing, the depiction of Alzheimer's as a now-you-see-it-now-you don't amnesia left me wondering whether anyone involved in this movie had any familiary with Alzheimer's at all. <br /> <br />When Alzheimer's patients' memory has deteriorated to the point where they do not recognize their husband or children, they do not exude the perfectly groomed, impeccably dressed magazine-cover glamour that Gena Rowlands depicted.  Granted, Allie was not in a public ward but in what seemed to be a very expensive assisted living facility.  Nevertheless, Alzheimers is not a disease where you \\"die pretty.\\" <br /> <br />Having had a stepmother die from this disease, I would have preferred a movie that did not gloss over the true viciousness of Alzheimer's. It not only robs memory, it robs every vestige of dignity.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I love the idea of an older, eccentric woman being pursued by two hot guys, one young, the other older. But I cannot picture that woman being Diane Keaton!! Sure, she looks great for her age, but she is possibly the most annoying actress I have ever seen! She constantly shrieks, throws her hands up in the air, rolls her eyes, overreacts to everything, and talks about me me me me me. Why is she appealing to these guys? How did her daughter turn out so nice? <br />I especially hated the scene where Harry (Jack) is evidently having a heart attack. He turns pale and sweaty, holds his hand to his chest, and seems disoriented. Ironically, she rattles on, completely unaware of his discomfort, griping about his insensitivity, then gets in a cab and zooms away, still oblivious. This is the same woman who saved his life with CPR in an earlier scene. Go figure. <br />Jack Nicholson, of course, is loveable in anything. He's got mojo at any age. Keanu Reeves is appealing although somewhat dull as the young doctor pursuing what's-her-name. But the movie would have been much better, implausible but sweet, with a much different actress in the main role. <br />
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Sometimes I find it intimidating writing a review for a blockbuster or super popular movie because I hate to sound like a Hallmark Card and because some people like to hate them only to go against the norm. I was simply so impressed with King Kong that I felt the need to throw my two cents in. <br /> <br />I must say that I was prepared for this insanely long movie and I didn't find it dragging at all! I took a quick break in the middle to run to bathroom and grab another beer with boyfriend but the 3 hours flew by! I was sucked into the story and since there was always something insane going on I had no time to be bored, scout's honor! <br /> <br />My favorite part was the sweet love story between Ann Darrow ( Watts) and the colossal Ape. I felt the connection this gigantic beast had with her  even though she was human and he was this big strong animal as  they became instant friends who shared naps and laughs. It was very touching watching their friendship develop as a rescue team from the ship had to battle giant bugs, beetles, spiders, dinosaurs and savages to bring her back to safety. <br />I admit, I cried a bit a few times, but I'm a huge sucker for animals and this movie had some sweet tender moments. I was absolutely enchanted by Kong, and his devotion to Ann, as he fought off a few huge T-Rexes and saved her. His had this strong bond with this woman who had no one to love her and she made him laugh by dancing for him and for bringing this sweet look into his eyes. He was more than a killer, he was this sudden soft creature that found her beautiful. I swear I saw his brain working behind all the looks he gave her, and the move did a stupendous job of making him real. I didn't once this that this movie looked like a computer movie because everything looked touchingly real. <br /> <br />This movie is a real feast on the eyes as the tight escapes, especially when the crew men had to run from the brachiosauruses and velociraptors on the mountain slopes, I couldn't even believe what I was seeing! I kept saying to my boyfriend \\"Can you believe this?? Its insane, this movie is crazy!\\" I felt like my wildest jungle fantasy movie scenes were right in front of my face as the movie progressed. <br /> <br />Truly a spectacular, yet bit sad but powerful story. King Kong won me over, as this sweet loving giant, who kept reminding us that love and compassion come in all forms.
0553801503|4.0|For those who have been patiently following this story, Book 4 is largely transitional.  However, the threads are starting to come together at last, and it is possible to glimpse the resolution. <br /> <br />Fundamentally, A Song of Ice and Fire has always been about an act of betrayal -- a conspiracy among nobles leading to the overthrow of Aerys Targaryen, ancestral and legitimate King of Westeros, a land somewhat resembling Medieval Europe if Christianity had never taken root.  The overthrow took place before Book 1, but it has left behind consequences that bedevil all the principal characters in different ways -- above all, through a nasty civil war that still rages among the successor kingdoms.  The Westeros characters, who dominate Book 4, are for the most part interesting and even attractive in their own right, but as they fight amongst themselves, they are also, some of them, dimly aware of much larger forces that will eventually alter their world forever: above all, the vague anarchic forces that gather beyond the immense wall marking the northern border of Westeros, and Queen Daenerys (Dany), surviving daughter of the overthrown King, who is massing an army in an Eastern city that is something out of an Orientalist fantasy. <br /> <br />In Book 4, the Starks are marginal except for the two surviving daughters, who range across the desolate, war-torn landscape of Westeros.  The Lannisters, their mortal enemies, seem virtually triumphant, but are troubled by internal conflicts.  By contrast with earlier books, this one has few of the great set scenes, and the action moves rather slowly as the inevitable doom of the Lannisters becomes clearer. <br /> <br />The great asset of Martin's books, which distinguishes them from all other fantasy I have seen, is that he really knows how to write.  His literary style is extraordinarily rich and multilayered; even profanity seems in place, and many of the descriptions are beyond vivid in their language.  The charactersare sharply drawn, with personalities all their own; even Cersei, the wicked Lannister Queen Regent, has sympathetic moments.  The world Martin portrays is richly invented, replete with its own competing religions and a set of backstories that are sometimes millennia old; every city, every street, and every palace is sharply detailed.  And Martin never shies away from the pitiless realism that characterizes his novels: his unflinching gaze at how these fantastical wars affect characters of both sexes and all classes, as well as the willingness to include even ostensibly sordid details of his characters' daily lives. <br /> <br />This is strong stuff, enough to keep one going even after three thousand pages.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|I would probably give it 4 1/2 stars.I must admit it takes awhile to get to the gore.There is a lot of sex in the first half of the flick but there are plot points that keep you interested beyond the sex.I think they wanted to let things develop a bit.The second half is incredible and while I have seen even more gory movies than this one,it had a twisted real to life feel to it.It was dark throughout and it entertained me right much.Pick up a copy and keep an open mind.

0790729369|2.0|Geez, maybe I have a heart of stone. I wasn't a bit moved by the overrated Streep and handsome Clint. It's a story about two hearts linked as one - a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good - a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy, bored adults. Yawwwwn. Streep can do any accent on the planet, and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau. That doesn't make her an actress - just a clever chameleon. I'd rather watch Julia Roberts play herself over and over and over than see Streep play \\"pretend\\" roles. There, I've said it. Now goodnight. <br />

Plus, it is a very fun read!
B00080VSNK|4.0|This is a delightful romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is a charming, self-effacing leading man. Salma Hayek is a most fetching and winsome leading lady. Strong performances by the supporting cast help make this a most enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) lives in New York and has a high powered job as a field agent for a builder that specializes in the construction of night clubs. He is sent to Las Vegas to supervise new construction. While there, he meets a fiery, latin beaty, Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), with whom he has a very memorable one night stand. This is totally out of character for both of them. In fact, she is so embarrassed by what happened, that she sneaks out of his house first thing in the morning. Before he even knows it, she is gone, never to be heard from again, until she shows up on his door step three months later to announce that she is pregnant with his baby.<br /><br />Alex tells her that he supports her right to choose. Isabel chooses to have the baby. She asks nothing from him other than he meet her family, so that it is not such a shock when she announces that she is pregnant. He agrees to do so. He meets her traditional, Mexican-American family and is taken by their warmth, a quality that is sorely lacking in his family.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have listened to the album straight through about three times now and even  on the first listen I loved it.  However, the more I here it the more I appreciate some of the songs I initially thought of as weaker moments.  In response to the people saying their losing their attitude I have to say they aren't.  They write music that reflects their life and they are older and have families and this is simply what they enjoy and feel like writing.  I enjoy this album more than Blood Sugar simply because it has a nice refined sound to it that comes from a band that has matured since 15 years ago when Blood Sugar was released.  Being a guitarist I also enjoy hearing more of John on this album.  His guitar playing is strong and melodic  and he has some great solos.  Dani California's solo is great especially the \\"quote\\" of Purple Haze thrown in.  Some other good solos are in Readymade and She's Only 18.    1. Dani California- Great song with a catchy chorus and as I stated before a cool guitar solo at the end.  Love the video spanning the history of rock music. 5/5  2. Snow (Hey Oh)- Another fantastic song.  Seems to go on a little bit in length, however still wonderful. 4/5  3. Charlie- More traditional funk/rock style of earlier Chili Peppers.  Cool song however it isn't a favorite. 4/5  4. Stadium Arcadium- Beautiful ballad.  One of my favorites off the album.  Nice melodic solo from John as well as nice backing vocals in the chorus.  Awesome. 5/5  5. Hump de Bump- Incredible song.  Has an awesome funk feel and again a more traditional RHCP song. 5/5  6. She's Only 18- This is definite favorite.  Has a dirty feel from the bass intro and the wha wha guitar on the verse is a great addition.  Great solo. 5/5  7. Slow Cheetah- Good ballad.  Have the patience and listen to it all the way through before forming an opinion of it. 4/5  8. Torture Me- Cool bass intro and is a great rock song of the album.  Slows down halfway through then speeds backup with a John Frusciante solo. 5/5  9. Strip My Mind- Nice chorus and one of my favorite ballads.  5/5  10. Especially in Michigan- This is an alright song, but the guitar part is a bit strange.  Still not a bad song. 4/5  11. Warlocks- Funky song.  However not a personal favorite. 4/5  12. C'mon Girl- I like the chorus to this one especially, however the rest is good to.  I enjoy the change from the softer verses to the heavier chorus. 5/5  13. Wet Sand- Another good ballad.  I really enjoy the more melodic guitar solos John does such as the one John does at the end of this.  Nice song. 4/5  14. Hey- Probably my least favorite.  Just gets slightly repetitive, still worth a few listens though.  Don't skip over it. 3/5  15. Desecration Smile- Great ballad.  Has some great harmony guitar overdubs. 4/5  16. Tell Me Baby- Starts out like another ballad.  Then the drums and bass enter with a pounding funk background.  This has always been my favorite off the album.  It has the old attitude of RHCP with a more melodic chorus while also blending in some nice guitar solos. Good rapping and singing on Anthony's part.  10/5  17. Hard to Concentrate- Nice ballad. A little repetitive however altogether still is a great listen and has nice vocals by Anthony.  18. 21st Century- Not too much to say about this one.  Nice song, however it doesn't stand out. 4/5  19. She Looks to Me- I enjoy this song, but it doesn't seem to stick with me.  I can never really remember it or how it goes.  Still fairly good song. 4/5  20. Readymade- Awesome. Has a great heavy rock feel. Reminds me of Buick Makane by T-Rex.  Great solo. Driving bass and drums.  Cool chorus. 5/5  21. If- Nice song if you listen to it.  It reminds me of Porcelain off Californication.  Nice vocals that carry the song. 4/5  22. Make You Feel Better- A sort of fast song however with more of a ballad sound.  Nice song. 4/5  23. Animal Bar- Seems like this could have been taken off. Just doesn't seem that great. 3/5  24. So Much I- This is a cool song. Good fast fast tempo song after Animal Bar. 4/5  25. Storm in a Teacup- Incredible.  Wonderful rapping and a really memorable chorus. Cool funk riff at the beggining. 5/5  26. We Believe- Cool song.  I'm not sure why I like this one.  Great vocal effect at the end. The vocals sound like they are underwater.  It sounds like the end vocals on the song Crimson and Clover. 5/5  27. Turn it Again- Cool funky guitar riff and an altogether great song with a cool guitar solo and chorus. 5/5  28. Death of a Martian- Absolutley the greatest album closer ever.  Awesome chorus. Just an all around wonderful song. Beautiful lead and backing vocals.  The spoken part at the end is awesome. Great way to finish of what I can already say will be the best album of 2006. 5/5
B000EMGAOY|5.0|When I found out RHCP were coming out with a 28 song double album, I thought, ok, some stand out songs for sure but probably half of the songs are fillers.  I bought the album at release and I have not stopped listening to it since and has become easily my favourite album from the chili peppers and the best album i've purchased in like 10 years.  I can't remember the last album I bought that I was so impressed with.  I have listened to it through and through and it only gets better.  I can honestly say I love all 28 songs (some more than others) but it is that good of an album. <br />Standout songs for me are Dani California, Snow, slow cheetah, wet sand, torture me, especially in michigan and the whole 2nd disc.  I love this album.. <br />Another thing I love is the sound/mixing of Stadium arcadium.  I hate hearing people saying that the future of audio is in DVD Audio or SACD.  These are statements from lazy bands and/or record companies looking to squeeze more money from fans.  Listening to SA, I assure you that it's better than the dvd audio discs that I have purchased thus far (I got the equipment to listen to dvd-a but have not been impressed thus far).   RHCP choose to release a great sounding album and work very hard to get a clean, crisp, non muffled sound.  While listening to this album, you can hear the many tracks they use to record and you can hear them crystal clear.  I hate bands using the excuse that their cd release was crap because they used different tracks to record and when converting to cd, the sound becomes compressed and muffled.  This is their excuse to release the album in all its glory in SACD or DVD-A format.  Other bands and record companies should take notice with what can still be done on a regular CD format.  Bravo to RHCP... BTW, if RHCP do release in SACD or DVD-A, I still applaud them for not ripping off their fans with a half decent cd effort.
B00008EY9G|4.0|It would never win an Oscar. Who cares?? A fun, spooky movie, kind of campy and fun. A great rainy-night movie, especially since it takes place on a rainy night. This movie was made to entertain, and entertain it does. Loved the twisty little ending. <br />If you like Dennis Lehane novels, you might like this! Kind of a \\"Shutter Island\\" feeling to it. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the peppers back in the days, but i started digging them since give it away, then i really start liking them since the cd Californication and especially the dvd live at Slane Castle (must have concert) but like others said before me, this albums is the shiznit! It doesn't even takes more then one play to like it but it only gets better & better. All tracks are great, ofcourse i like some more than others, i personally like Desecration Smile & Stadium Arcadium the most. Great to play along with your accoustic guitar too! Just like Toxicity by SOAD this albums is superb from beginning to end!
0553573403|5.0|At one point in reading this series I slowly closed the book, put it aside, and sat in stunned silence for ten minutes.  I just couldn't believe it.  How could Martin do this to the characters I've come to know so well?  I really didn't think I could go on reading, but of course I did.<br /><br />I could almost hear Martin chuckling at my reaction.  You can tell that he enjoys taking every preconcieved notion and expectation of where you think the story is going and giving you a sharp slap in the face to dispell your naivety.  He builds the story along lines that you think you've seen before,  building suspense and your hopes, then smashes them to bits.  (To those who've read it, don't you feel like Sansa sometimes?)<br /><br />If you'd like something different, if you want to be shocked and heartbroken, and have a great time too, read this series by George Martin.
0140284087|4.0|I had never got around to reading any P.G. Wodehouse until I read this volume, and now I regret the delay.<br /><br />My first exposure to Wodehouse, at least the first I can remember, was the great Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie (better known from \\"Black Adder\\" and \\"House\\") TV series \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\". That series, plus a few artsy articles on Wodehouse (for example this one by Christopher Hitchens [...] ), turned my Wodehouse radar on.<br /><br />Even though the world of butlers and aristocratic drones in the 1920s may as well be life of the Siberian Steppes to us web connected suburbanites, the human comedy never really changes. It was the Jeeves and Wooster stories, not \\"Seinfeld\\", that was the original \\"show about nothing.\\"<br /><br />Every story starts from a minor mishap that turns into major mayhem, requiring the sagacious Jeeves to slide in and rescue his well meaning but social accident prone patron from the self induced quagmire.<br /><br />This is humour that is sympathetic to all the parties involved. As such it is a pleasant change from the rude brood of \\"cruder than thou\\" comedies that has dominated mainstream TV / movie comedy from both England and America for most of the last dozen years. My guess is that generation of young media consumers has grown up that know no humour other than the stick it someone else variety. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, it's just the monotony of it all that I am tired of.<br /><br />Bring back Wodehouse!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.  <br /> <br />Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proven in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply a \\"gay cowboy\\" romance.  <br /> <br />Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.  <br /> <br />Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.  <br /> <br />The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, \\"Dawson's Creek\\", Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's \\"The Station Agent\\" by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's \\"The Princess Diaries\\" in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.  <br /> <br />However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirrings affect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the \\"Scooby Doo\\" movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\". I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Well, its good. Ive always thought Pearl Jam albums were all pretty equally great. I like the grunge era for them, but I loved them more after they got more experimental. So, this is the only album that falls away from great. Im more of a No Code, Vitology, Riot Act, Binarul and Yield kinda guy. Ten and Vs are still great, but they got better with age. And yet this album was laking something for me personally. World Wide Suicide is quite the single though. I need a good mix of songs here and there, not just all flat out rock songs. Good, but not great.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Kristin Chenoweth & Idina Menzel deliver out-of-this-world performances as well as the rest of the OBC. Both of these wonderful women will take you on a wonderful journey as you listen to this CD. For those of you who do not know, Wicked has won numerous Tonys! (Best Costume Design - Susan Hilferty, Best Scenic Design - Eugene Lee, and Best Performance by a Leading actress in a muscal - Idina Menzel) and all these awards were very much deserved. It also recieved some more nominations including Best Leading Actress in a Musical - Kristin Chenoweth. Although I have not seen the OBC I have seen the show numerous times and this is honestly one of the best shows on Broadway! The songs are beautiful and the story is very moving. If you are able to see this show on Broadway, Tour, in Chigaco, or London -- GO NOW!! You will not regret it! Stephen Shwartz has done a great job writing this amazing musical and deserves a lot of praise, as do Marc Platt and Joe Mantello! If you are cannot decide whether to buy this CD or not ... DO IT !!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|An album that wins with each listen. As the title says: their best since Vitalogy. No experiments, they've gone to the point in this record.
0345452577|4.0|This was a fun ride and took a while to figure the real culprit, which you didn't know to the end unless you're really into murder mysteries!  Kept expecting to find one of the \\"friends\\" to be the culprit, but I was wrong...you'll enjoy the book, it's a delight in speculation.
076790382X|5.0|As a fan of collections of brief articles, and a bigger fan of Bill Bryson's work, this collection was a joy to read. My only mistake was reading it in a public setting, where laughing out loud was met with strange gazes and glares from others. <br /> <br />The basic gist is this: after living in England for many years, Bill Bryson and his family move to America and to small-town New Hampshire. He continued to write a column for a newspaper in England, however, the subject of which was the peculiarities of life in America. It is these articles that are collected here. Whether you'll love each individual article depends on your mood at the moment and whether you're interested in the topic; for example, I skipped through exactly one story (detailing his struggles with computer tech support). <br /> <br />To American readers, the book allows us to laugh at ourselves and the nitty gritty details of our society that we shake our heads at constantly. Since the book's components were written for a non-American audience, I would speculate that others would be equally amused. In any event, Bill Bryson's unique style and constant bewilderment at the way other people's minds work will keep any reader entertained.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I'm sure most everyone has heard of this hot new band coming out of Australia, that one that is going to revive classic rock from the depths of it's grave and save music from all of this nonsense we hear today!    Wolfmother, the band of all bands, like Zeppelin, and Sabbath...    Sadly, this isn't really the truth.  Sure, these fellows sound pretty good. Next to the \\"emo\\" and pop-punk that controls popular music today, these guys are freakin' gods!    Wolfmother rocks, no question about that.  Here's the thing. These guys are no Zeppelin.  All the comparisons to the hard rock of the early 70s are very over-exaggerated. They cook hard and belt out their lyrics forcefully, but to say the guitar work is comparable to that of Jimmy Page?  To think that the front-man delievers the lyrics like Plant?  Not even close.    Now lets try to escape for a bit all the wild comparisons, and lets just look at Wolfmother for their music.  The first song, \\"Dimension\\" is a driving track that certainly rocks.  Same with \\"Colossal.\\"  But these songs, and others on the album, are haunted by notably simplistic lyrics.  \\"Where Eagles Have Been,\\" easily the most poetic song on the ablum (it at least has a metaphor that drives the lyrics) also suffers from simple song writing.      But obviously this album's appeal lies in the heavy guitar work.  The hard-rocking music over shadows the almost lame lyrics to create an ablum that hits the soul hard, almost in the way that those geniuses of long ago did.  Songs like \\"Mind's Eye\\" and \\"Witchcraft\\" are very impresive, and do bring back memories of the golden time in hard rock.  The flute solo on \\"Witchcraft\\" will definitly remind anyone of Jethro Tull.    This album is so different from everything else today, and it really is a breath of fresh air.  It's hard to take the comparisons to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath to heart, and they really are over simplified comparisons.  Wolfmother's debut is really a solid record, and I'm excited to see whatcomes next from these guys.      I think this could be the greatest band of the last 20 years, but with the state that popular music is in today, it will be interesting to see how the public takes these guys.
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|Ok, so don't bash this review.  I've never seen the movie, and based on its depressing themes, doubt that I ever will.  And I'm not a big fan of this CD either.<br /><br />I bought this CD ONLY because I heard this thrilling soundtrack for a Ronaldinho soccer video that I had downloaded off the Internet, which some people thought was the Overture from Requiem for a Dream.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as the Amazon website for this movie soundtrack CD does not have song samples from the CD, I had to actually BUY the CD to see if it contained that soundtrack.  The closest track to the song that I was looking for was \\"Lux Aeternum\\".  The rest of this CD, those tracks that did not repeat the main theme from the movie, I found pretty disappointing.<br /><br />So I did a vigorous search through the Internet, and finally discovered that the track that I had heard was an orchestral remix of \\"Lux Aeternum\\", done especially for the first movie trailer for \\"The Two Towers\\".  A Google search turned up a post on [...] by someone with the screenname of Fatboy Roberts who described how two MP3 versions of this orchestral re-mix came into being.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, this gorgeous bit of music does not exist in a commercially released form.  It is certainly not one of the tracks on the \\"Requiem for a Dream: Remixed\\" CD.  And so although I would actually like to BUY this music, I was able to find it only on Internet file sharing networks.<br /><br />Use various combination of keywords such as \\"Lux Aeternum, \\"Requiem Overture\\", \\"Two Towers\\", \\"orchestral remix\\", \\"Fatboy Roberts\\" when searching for this piece.<br /><br />Addendum:  As per the comment by Derek LeLash, a CD with the orchestral remix of Lux Aeternum, the one used in the \\"Two Towers\\" trailer is now available  -  \\"Requiem For A Tower\\" by Corner Stone Cues
0895260131|1.0|As the US continues it's slaughter of Muslims, it is necessary to whip up enough of the population into a frenzy of hate and confusion to get them to pull the triggers, load the bombs, break into the houses, and detain the target population.  Nazi intellectuals used the same techniques that Spencer employs in his book.  Spencer regularly appears on right-wing talk radio shows to pound his grotesque messages home to an intellectually vulnerable, or eager to be deceived, audience.  If not for hate-mongers like Spencer, people in the military would be less apt to carry out the occupation and \\"reconstruction\\" that Wall Street and Big Business favor.  Tales of Arab \\"evildoers\\" are better at motivating some to fight than the reality of corporate profits. <br />This book is obscene, and it's pathetic that US citizens, some calling themselves \\"Christian\\" no less, buy into it.   <br />For those who want to provide some fairness and balance to the discussion of Islam, Arabs and US bigotry and aggression, \\"Peace, Propaganda & the Promised Land\\" is an excellent DVD.  Also see \\"Behind the War on Terror\\" by Nafeez Mossaddeq Ahmed.  Ahmed documents, in page after page, the suffering that the US is inflicting upon Arab people - overthrows, invasions, theft of resources, destruction of local economies, support of dictators, lethal sanctions, bombing of water and sanitation systems and so forth.  Spencer's job as Pentagon propagandist is to deflect our attention from these hard truths.  It's shameful, and makes me embarrassed to be a citizen of this rogue empire. <br /> <br />\\"O Mankind!

0375759174|4.0|I was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years. I assumed that if she couldn't get it published that it probably wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book. It is meant to be a satirical work mocking the Gothic romance popular during Jane Austin's lifetime. In such romances, there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such, and in this book the main character, Catherine, keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up, but they never really had. Towards the end, instead of some fantastic mythical monster, a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain Catherine experiences: pride in rank.  The father of Henry Tilney, whom Catherine has fallen in love with, refuses to allow them to be married because Catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does.  Austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both Henry's father and through her friend Isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself, leading Catherine to much pain. <br /> <br />This is nowhere near as good as some of Miss Austin's other works, but it is good nontheless, and a fun read. It's much better if you understand what Gothic romance novels were like, since this is a satire on those novels. <br /> <br />Overall grade: B+

B000EMGAOY|5.0|These guys always bring in a good album, ok By The Way was rather bad, but the rest is good, even One Hot Minute. <br />The album has a couple boring songs, yet again so does, Californacation, and Blood Sugar Sex Magik (I'm sorry but it does). <br /> <br />The best songs include, Dani California, Snow (Hey Oh), Charlie, Desecration Smile, Hey, Make You Feel Better, Slow Cheetah, Storm In A Teacup, Wet Sand, Death of A Martian, She's Only 18, Readymade, Animal Bar, We Believe and my favourites on the album Hump De Bump and Turn It Again! <br /> <br />This is nothig like other RHCP albums, but thats why I like it so much, and thoughs negatives are onlt poeple haven't listened probably, I can understand 3 star reviews at the least, but 1 is going way to far. <br /> <br />This album is very solid, personally I do think if they had made it only 1 disk with the bes tosngs on it, it could off been better than Blood Sugar Sex Magik. <br /> <br />Get it you will not be disapointed. <br /> <br />Peace Out.
B000024D4R|5.0|The band's most collaborative album, Animals finds Pink Floyd reaching their musical apex.  It's bookended by two simple pleas to an unknown listner, in which Waters stresses how important the simple act of just caring about each other can be. <br /> <br />The heart of the album slides from the long, meandering, and torpor-inducing Dogs.  It can be a hard listen, and it's a total downer, but it's just a set-up.  Coming off its tail, the opening of Pigs is legitimately frightening, which doesn't happen often in rock music.  This is a bitter, spiteful piece aimed at actual, living powers-that-be in 1977 England.  It takes dead aim, serving the \\"pigs\\" up to be ripe for revolution. <br /> <br />That's where Sheep comes in.  It's the masterwork of the album and possibly the band's whole catalogue.  A meandering keyboard gives way to a driving bass line over which Waters sings lyrics screaming at the masses to fight off their laziness, to rise up.  Another lull, then a victorious major chord progression to close that will have you nodding your head Wayne and Garth style. <br /> <br />All the while, the band is putting together music that takes full advantage of Richard Wright's skill, which is a real rarity.  And David Gilmour's guitar is allowed to announce itself outside of solos (a la Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here), which lets him demonstrate just how good he really was.  The album is angry, it's intellectual, it's gripping, and it's terrific musically.  Great as Floyd was, this was the only time they ever got all four of those pieces into one album.
0684803356|5.0|A number of previous reviewers have noted that this book is about the difference one man makes in the world.  Unfortunately, I think a number of reviewers have missed what Hemingways is saying about the issue.  He is not saying that one man makes all the difference in the world, or that one man is meaningless compared to the whole.  What he is saying is that the world continues without him regardless of whether he changes the world or not.  The title of this book, and its theme, comes from John Donne's 17th Meditation, which says that     \\"...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...\\"    Hemmingway masterfully tells the story of a man, Robert Jordan, who becomes involved with some Spanish gypsies on his mission to blow up a bridge to help his side win a war.  He begins thinking that it does not matter whether he lives or not, as long as he accomplishes his goal.  However, he falls in love with Maria, and suddenly wants to live.  He takes great pains to make sure that he will be able to do his job and blow up the bridge.  He finally does it.  Then he dies in the escape.  And the world continues on without him.  Hemingway is trying to say what Donne was saying:  life is not tied in the individual, though the individual may be important.  The individual is a part of the collective whole.  The issue is not whether the individual is valuable or not, but rather the issue is the individual's relation to the complex web of human existence.  Perhaps the best illustration of this idea is in Hemingway's beginning and conclusion of the book.  It begins with Robert Jordan lying in some pine needles planning his life.  It ends with himlying in pine needles dead.  The whole middle of the book simply details his part in the complex web of human existence.    Hemingway also explores the concept of war through Robert Jordan, who is fighting a war he does not need to be in.  Robert begins to question why he is fighting and why the war is happening.  Some have complained that Hemingway glorifies war.  I do not disagree.  I disagree when they say that it is wrong to glorify war.  It is not at all wrong to glorify the Allies side of World War II, is it?  It is wrong to glorify war for war's sake, but I'm not sure that Hemingway does that.  He glorifies the willingness to lay one's life down for what one loves, not simply dying and killing meaninglessly (which makes his own suicide later in life rather ironic).    Whether you agree with Hemingway's thesis or not, it is very well written and very interesting to read.  The characters are very real, and it is neat to see what Spanish gypsies were like in the early part of the 20th century.    Overall grade:  A
B00005JOVN|4.0|Actually, I got stuck seeing this last night because the backwater movie theater I went to wasn't showing \\"An American Haunting.\\" I enjoyed the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" and thought this one acquitted itself nicely. It's not so much a fully-realized film as it is a cinematic roller coaster. If that's all you're expecting, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The acting doesn't stink. The visual and sound effects are top-notch. It's paced like a mofo, the fastest 90 minutes I've sat through in a long time. \\"Poseidon\\" is not deep (heh, no pun intended) or original, but it's not a complete waste of $7, either.
B000002HRE|4.0|I initially hated Load and ReLoad, but I figured them out a couple years after they were released when I was working on an all-day school project and my friend had five Metallica discs, including these two, playing all day long. A lot of people were bummed because this wasn't thrash, but that's the point. Master of Puppets was pure distilled anger, but ReLoad and Load were the products of an older Metallica having to deal with the consequences of their youth. Not all the songs are classics, but when James sings \\"renew our faith which way we can/to fall in love with life again\\" I realized this is coming from a band seeking forgiveness and a new direction. If you only dig hyper-aggressive thrash, this probably won't work, but if you're into multiple styles of hard rock ReLoad is worth a spin.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is an odd album to hear.  For those of us who were first introduced to Pink Floyd through Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, Meddle isn't quite what we're used to.  There's no non-musical, semi-philosophical rambling.  The lyrics are extraordinarily poetic, entirely ignoring the messages that would trademark their subsequent work.  For those who knew the band before, when Syd Barrett was the driving force, this album probably sounded subdued when it first came out.  Where was the whimsy?  Where was the lyrical absurdism? <br /> <br />That said, this is my favorite Floyd album.  It's not their best or their most emotionally gripping, but it's their most interesting.  Here is a band in transition, and you can tell they're finding themselves.  They're trying something new, and for the most part, it works.  Seamus is a waste of time, though harmless.  But the rest of the album is a treat.  Waters is writing lyrics that every lyricist for decades to come should envy. <br /> <br />The first song is a heavy, angry beating of the ear drums, seemingly designed to beat and frighten listeners.  Then, out of nowhere, it gives way to three beautiful, soft, understated songs that engage in wordplay and occasional music sampling.  It creates a peaceful effect that we weren't expecting. <br /> <br />Following Seamus, the band launches into the most experimental song recorded in the last forty years.  Echoes is a sprawling piece that would take paragraphs to decribe.  It's not a perfect song, but it's intentionally beyond description, yielding both the best and worst of Roger Waters' habits.  He creates these incredible concepts, but he can't stop until he's proven how much smarter he is than everyone else. <br /> <br />All in all, the band took a real risk, and they succeeded brilliantly.  Willingness to experiment has been in short supply for the last ten years; this is a perfect example of why modestly successful bands SHOULD break their formulae.  Pink Floyd, nice Britishband, turned into Pink Floyd, world conquerors, and this is the album that started it.
0740748475|5.0|Despite owning all the larger Calvin & Hobbes compilations (The Days Are Just Packed, It's a Magical World, etc) when I saw The Complete Collection I knew I just had to have it.    Three large wonderfully bound books full of every Calvin & Hobbes strip PLUS the dates of when each and every one of the individual strips were created, this is something any fan will enjoy.  If you're like me you will get a kick out of seeing what strip was written on your birthday.  Andrews McMeel Publishing haven't spared any detail with this set and Bill Watterson has a great foreword in the beginning of the first volume.  They haven't spared much expense either with every page being quality grade paper making every turn a pleasure.  The books are hard bound and appear strongly constructed so they should stand the test of time although I will still handle my set with the greatest of care.    My tiny criticism (but I still award five stars!) is that putting all the works of Bill into three separate volumes makes for some very heavy books.  This can be countered by the fact that if you read in bed at night, like I do, then you will soon have a stomach of rippling steel from supporting the weight!  As a note it may also be a set you don't want to have kicking around the coffee table as it really just begs to be cared for and cherished for a very long time.  Mind you, I wouldn't spend this kind of money not to look after it!    If you are a big fan of Bill Watterson's Calvin & Hobbes then you must, must have The Complete Collection.
B00006G9QN|5.0|Colonel Philip J. Corso's amazing story is shocking if true. As Chief of the Army's Foreign Technology Division in 1961, he stewarded the Roswell Crash artifacts in a reverse-engineering project. According to him he handed out to most of our top Defense contractors alien technology that exploded  on the market what we now take today for granted. Colonel, I salute you, you were a great American for your service for our country in WW2 and beyond.
B000ERU5EK|5.0|As a person who listens to electronic music mostly for the vocals, this album was a hard sell. Regardless, I have found that Tri-State is the best trance album I have heard in a very long time. This is the kind of mind-soothing music that you can't help but become addicted to. <br /> <br />Above & Beyond, whatever names they have adopted over the years, have always been true to the meaning of trance music. This is as true as ever in Tri-State, which has rekindled in me the mesmerizing feeling from which the genre derives its name. A truly exceptional work.
630512762X|5.0|First off, I have seen alot of movies, good and bad.  Of all the action movies I have seen, this has to be one of the best, up there with the Matrix and Die Hard.  What this movie has that they don't have is interesting characters, and two of the best actors in the business giving great and believable preformances.  Nicholas Cage and John Travolta look like they were meant to be together on-screen, and it is really interesting to see both play the bad guy and the good guy.  Every character in here was believable and intrigueing.  But the main attraction here is the action scenes.  This movie has it all, a prison break, a boat chase, a shoot-out in a church, and shoot-outs basically everywhere in the movie.  This will always be one of my favorite movies, and as far as action movies go its one of the best.  My one qualm with the movie is the hoaky ending.  For example; rebellious teen girl suddenly changes for the better, somehow Archer's face managed to stay intact, despite what Troy did to it, and the way that Archer takes the orphaned boy in.  I just feel that after all that things just couldn't go back to normal.  Besides that, its great.<br /><br />Overall 90/100<br /><br />DEFINITELY recommended
B000EULJLU|5.0|If you're reading this it means that these Amazon police have forgiven me, bless their hearts.  If this is destined for obliteration... well...  You see, I was banned for writing some nasty things to a fellow over Lateralus, I apologize now, really.  They didn't even tell me that I was banned, (which is kind of lame, but...) so if they have the mercy in them to give me a second chance, I offer my gratitude! <br />!0,000 days is an entirely unpredictable step forward in the growth of Tool.  Some other people warned me (who bought it before I possibly could where I live) that it's gonna REALLY confuse you on first listen.  Guess my response.  I could only say \\"It sounds sort of like old man music.\\"  Repeated listens magically revealed, in fact, nothing unordinary and a very obvious Tool record.  How they've done this is beyond me, it's that kind of thing about the art of these 4 that makes me trust them so deeply.  I kept listening to this unfathomable and disappointing hunk of an album because I had the trust within me to try harder, and I was actually - right in this regard. <br />!0,000 days is, if you don't mind me saying, one of the finest albums you are likely to hear within a considerable span of years.  If you DO NOT agree, I can only supplicate you to give in and appreciate exactly what this piece of art is.  For my personal interest the thing that most detracts from its overall greatness (or whatever you like) is that the guitar and vocals seem to be more pop oriented, which is mysterious.  While I was on the phone, Vicarious was playing and my freind (who's a sort of tough-guy metalhead to a ridiculous point) said \\"That sounds like Avenged Sevenfold\\" with derision, upon which there was brief panic on my part.  BUT upon a small degree of personal evaluation afterward I realized that this is... nonsense for you, because where this gruesome emo etc. is honestly clueless, Tool is very much determined, fully aware of their actions, and nearly uninfluenced by thetastes or demands of a pop audience.  Which equates to the fact that even though it bears an accidental resemblance to truly useless music in a remote way to someone eager to denounce any sort of weakness because of fear, over the phone, who has no point of reference concerning tool - Why should I even give a f**k, or think any less of it?  Disregarding all exterior likenesses, I let this music move me.  Please do the same, it'll be worth it, trust me. <br />I get carried away.  Ah, forgive me!  All the tracks are exceptional by comparison to nearly anything else, to begin my actual review: <br />Vicarious is a wise choice for opener, it's fast paced, focused, and while your attention span is still relatively fresh, it instructs you about something which is very important for you to consider.  The sort of driving, propulsive quality to the majority of the song is totally brilliant, and only seems to affect me better each time (Which is, by the way, something which an emo band would sacrifice a few organs to be able to write). <br />Jambi (IS this a character on PeeWees Treehouse or something? I'm so confused...)  seemed like awful filler @ first, but it surely grows on me, and plus Maynards pig voice solo is too good.  My grasp on what this song means is slightly deficient, but I can accept that because the music sounds so good. <br />The title tracks are absolutely the greatest things on here, a totally unconvential Tool epic.  Man, and this is already so close to my heart.  I can't exactly summon the proper praise, everything about these songs just mounts and flows perfectly, and it's so sincere that being casual in a listening (to me @ least) is a cause for guilt.  The breakdown after the \\"pillar of faith \\" bit is just incredible, breathtaking... <br />The Pot...  Hmmmm, seems to be a very good way to resume the album, and on first listening it was the only thing I could identify as Tool.  Justins bass in this owns.  I didn't recognize maynard either, I thoughtit must be some guest vocalist - for the intro, I mean.  Aye. <br />Lipan Conjuring is perhaps my favorite interlude (excluding Harry Manback, which is genius) that Tool has done, and convinces me that all bands should include some sort of world music gem in their album.  And make no mistake, I actually really like it musically. <br />Lost Keys, even with its cheesy skit (what's with the total babe nurse?... And the australian doctor?... ?!) is a very effective mood piece which I never skip leading up to Rosetta Stoned. <br />Rosetta Stoned not only has some of the most solid and intense music on the disc, its subject matter is very compelling.  To you people who don't like Maynards sort of babbling/rapping, well...  I think it's downright hilarious, and it never gets old.  Especially his line about highschool.  Geez, that one's too good.  But then the part where he sings and there's multiple voices is probably one of the most unique and beautiful things I've heard on a record for some time.  The climax of the song is almost momentous.  Or rather is momentous, I guess....  In fact I accidentally heard it just suddenly by rewinding, and it was jarring and frightening with nothing to lead up to it. <br />Intension is a subtle but very masterful composition, with those mystical and difficult lyrics that I was expecting to encounter more of.  The drum machine is sort of confusing, but I've come to accept it.  The comparison to Disposition is easy, although I still like Disposition better, and for different reasons. <br />Right in Two is my least favoite song of the whole album, and made it seem much more flawed than it is by being the finale.  I don't like political activism, and while this song isn't 'exactly' political, it might as well be.  The only politically chrged music I ever really enjoyed for being just that was Radioheads Hail to the Theif, which was probably because the execution of that was original and very deft & subtle.  This takes a common approach.  Iagree, the music is nicely progressive, but it seems less like Tool than... er... not Tool?  I believe that my opinion of this will change in time, and after all, the perspective and values of an artist will almost invariably move toward a more general picture of humanity as he or she ages.  I'm still a youngster, and soooo.... <br />Viginti Tres is even freakier than Faaip De Oiad, and I love this song.  The voice at the end:  Genius.  And then the pixelation sounds, the alarming swooping sounds, satic and so on.  It's great craftsmanship.  For people who call this unengaging or unnecessary, you baffle me.  You must be desensitized. <br />SO - Anyone with the patience to go through that without having their thoughts drift @ least once is deserving of admiration.  To finish I say this:  It is uncertain at such an early time whether or not this album will endure (and endear) so magnificently as Lateralus (or I suppose AEnima...), it's something I simply can't tell you.  Lateralus is still the greatest album I've ever heard, but the more I listen to !0,000 Days, I can honestly say that it's getting closer to that mark.
B00000JCOV|3.0|First off, I am a fan of any kind of rock or heavy metal, death metal, pretty much any band that kicks ass.  Korn, Mudvayne, Tool, Rob Zombie, Cradle Of Filth, Marilyn Manson, even A Perfect Circle.  But for the longest time I never had a Slipknot Cd (mostly because none of my friends had one handy for me to rip) so I waited, expanding my collection of other music.  Finally I bought this cd from Amazon, and I have to say I am sorely dissapointed.  My friend had earlier given me a mix cd of a bunch of bands, but it also had Sic, Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, and Liberate on it.  I thought all of those songs (except maybe Liberate) were great, so I couldn't wait for it to come in the mail.  When it did I popped it into my cd player and stared in horror at what I was listening to.  Every song except the ones I mentioned (except Diluted) were complete garbage, filled with repetitive screaming and dumb vocals, and not very noteworthy preformances with the exception of their drummer.  I was so surprised, because from what I had heard earlier they were great, but appearances can be deceiving.  Also, Wait and Bleed is a great song, but it is more of a guilty pleasure for me.  Why?  Because it has a great chorus that is played 3 times in 1 minute, and 7 times throughout the song, which is 2:27.  Think about that, guys. People rave about the song, but singing a catchy chorus 7 times throughout a 2 and a half minute song is criminal.  Surfacing is probably the best song on the album.  It has a catchy chorus, but there is a lot more to it, and although it is only 3:38, it seems very long compared to the rest of the album.  Also, while I listened to this album a few times, it really has no staying power.  I will listen to a song for about a minute or so, until it gets to a good part, then skip to the next song.  I hardly ever do that, even with slow songs, its just Cory's senseless screaming can get annoying after awhile.  I have no problem with screaming, but it has no point.  Whenever Jonathan Davis from Korn screams, its to prove a point, and you know why, but when Cory screams it has no meaning or substance, and gets to a point where you just want to skip past it. Maybe it is his voice, it has a certain whiny-ness to it, because Mudvayne screams alot, but I don't mind because it sounds more like a roar than a scream, and makes you think a man is actually singing it. I am not sure if I will get Iowa, it is said to be worse than this, but at least if I do, my expectations won't be as high.  Now to the song ratings:<br /><br />1 742617000027: 1/10  Not a noteworthy song, original songtitle though.<br /><br />2 (Sic)  8/10  Good song, not great.  Doesn't really have much of a chorus, but for some reason makes me want to kick some a$$.<br /><br />3 Eyeless: 7/10  An outright crazy song.  For some reason I don't feel the need to skip past it, even though it really doesn't have any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />4 Wait and Bleed: 8/10  I have already discussed this song, and have debated whether to give it a bad or good rating.  This is really LAZY songwriting, whatever anyone else may say.  Slipknot found a catchy tune and exploited it for all its worth.  Even if it is lazy, it is still an addictive song until you get sick of it, which you will with Cory repeating the chorus 7 times!<br /><br />5 Surfacing: 9/10  Like I said, this is the best song on the album, the whole band really came together on this one.  It actually feels like there are 9 members in the band instead of 4 or 5.  While I love the chorus F it all! F this world F! everything that you stand for! I still feel like I am listening to kid music, because the writing seems so immature. I still like it regardless.  After this song they all pretty much go downhill, though.<br /><br />6 Spit it Out: 6/10  I can't belive they made this a single.  I don't like it at all, it is weird, rappy, and just pointless.  Of course, that is only my opinion.<br /><br />7 Tattered and Torn: 5/10  The way this song starts out makes it impossible to get into.  The whole song will irritate your ears and make you reaching for the skip button.<br /><br />8 Me Inside: 6/10  I am being generous with a 6 rating, because it has some more screaming by Cory, this time: INSIDE! INSIDE! INSIDE!  It has a bit of a catchy verse, which is basically spoken by Cory.<br /><br />9 Liberate: 6/10  Some more pointless screaming, but not that bad a song.<br /><br />10 Prosthetics: 7/10 I guess this song is supposed to be creepy, but it doesn't work for me.  Being a die-hard Korn fan, and hearing all the explicit stuff about child abuse and incest, this just seems juvenile.  At least they tried.<br /><br />11 No Life: 6/10  Man, the screaming is really starting to get on my nerves.  This time its: THIS IS NO KIND OF LIFE!  Give me a break.<br /><br />12 Diluted: 8/10  Clever song, marred by more senseless screaming, but the verses rock.  Clever, and you actually know what Cory is talking about.  There are parts on this song that really rule, but still, I find myself skipping after I have heard them.<br /><br />13 Only One: 7/10  Not that bad a song, just sort of forgettable.<br /><br />14: Scissors: 7/10  This is a blatant rip-off of Korn.  From 1994-1999 Korn were known for putting long, emotional closers on their albums, then in 1999 Slipknot thought they could cash in on that, and succeeded in making a half-assed replica, complete with the hidden track.  Give me a break.<br /><br />Overall, I am probably a little biased against the album because I pretty much heard every good song on here repeadedly before getting the album, where I found out that I hadn't heard all the rest of the songs for a reason.  At least now I know why:)<br /><br />Overall 75/100, which is about a 3 star rating, and I am being generous.<br /><br />Recommended for people who want a break from all the really good Hard Rock/Heavy Metal to listen to some mediocre copycats.Torn: 5/10  The way this song starts out makes it impossible to get into.

0679422714|4.0|I went out to read this book because of all the negative reviews here and on forums on the net. Many of them don't really explain why this book gives them a negative reaction. That means there must be something about this book that affects people. This made me want to check it out for myself. <br />In my teenage years, I read a lot of books written by Mao and I bought magazines like \\"Chinese Literature\\" regular basis. This was from the final days of the Cultural Revolution. My introduction to Mao came from school. My middle school history teacher was a leftist, and we had an exchange student from China. This was immediately after Nixon went to China. I read propaganda books like \\"On the Long March with Chairman Mao\\". In my later teenage years, I grew to admire much of what Mao Zedong wrote. He was a great thinker, philosopher and a charismatic man. He had an aura that made people listen to him. I still think his essays such as \\"On Contradiction\\" show a brilliant mind. <br /> <br />I later moved to Tokyo, where many Maoists were hanging around leftist bookshops. They would ask me to join their struggle against imperialism and smash the Japanese government, imperialism, and capitalism. There was one guy who organized a space to see North Korean political movies. Once he invited me to see the film and talk politics afterwards. Another guy he invited wanted to be a real activist. He would start to drool when the film started to show scenes of young people \\"struggling\\", smashing up buildings, knocking down policemen, throwing stones and bottles. \\"We must rise up. We must smash things! We must destroy!\\" I would ask him if he ever read Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. He said he was trying hard to, but not yet. It turned out most of these people couldn't really read these essays. They wanted to destroy, smash things, shout out slogans, and beat up people. Political propaganda films would make them excited. Saliva would run down their mouths. Their eyes would gleam with excitement, when they were shown films of students beating up the authority in the name of \\"struggle\\".  <br />  <br />I met with a young Japanese, who was trying to take people to North Korea. He said his uncle had been in World War 2 in China, and was probably responsible for killing many people. He wanted to make amends. He believed that smashing up the Japanese government, distributing guns, and going out on killing spree, murdering millions of Japanese capitalists was the way to make friends with China and Korea. A few years later, it was on the news that the people he met in North Korea were responsible for kidnapping over 10 Japanese people and forcibly taking them to work in North Korea. I asked him if he ever read books. He also said he was trying to, but didn't have the time to finish anything yet.   <br /> <br />There are many people like this. People who don't know how to read books or essays. People who simply pick up some slogans to shout as a kind of excuse for their violence. They want to go beat up people. But they don't want to become criminals. Politics gives them a good excuse. They can pretend that they are doing something for the world.  <br />Most people are not like this. They would cry out in horror when they read something like the \\"rape of Nanjing\\". To most people, it is something that is difficult to believe. Especially for women. Yet, there are people who are sadists. Extremists seem to attract other extremists, whether left, right, nationalists, patriots or whatever. In Yukio Mishima's book, \\"Runaway Horse\\", about a rightist terrorist from before World War 2, the main character says: \\" If one seeks a kindred purity of resolve, one should seek it in a diametrically opposed ideology\\". So extreme Chinese leftists attracts sons of Japanese rightists and the very same people who went out to kill in World War 2, who think they are joining them in their struggle. If people went out and compared Japanese rightist propaganda with Chinese leftist propaganda, they would see a similarity. They both talk about liberating Asia, and creating a government that benefits the peasants.  <br />It's quite ironic. But it shows that the ideology itself doesn't matter. <br />It's not because Mao or Stalin was a communist or because Hitler was a Nazi. The people there wanted a charismatic leader that would give them order, and tell them what to do. If something goes wrong, they always give the old excuse of  \\"I was only following orders like a good soldier\\". What Nonsense! They can't admit that they wanted to go out on a murder spree themselves. They wanted to beat up people. If such people didn't exist, there wouldn't be teenage street gangs. What happened in Bosnia wouldn't have happened. People like Mao are held responsible because he didn't stop them, but allowed the violence. Mao never went out to torture people himself. He spent his time reading books like the medieval tale of military adventures \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" or the novel \\"A Dream of Red Mansions\\". He couldn't stop from playing chess with living beings. Today, kids play war games with computers. But it was the people who made him their leader because he gave them the direction they wanted. WHEN ARE PEOPLE GOING TO WAKE UP AND STOP BLAMING JUST THE LEADER OR SOME IDEOLOGY AND START REALIZING THAT THEY MADE IT HAPPEN THEMSELVES BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE VIOLENCE WITHIN THEIR HEARTS. The Chinese government today does not want to let the population realize that more people were killed during the years of Mao than in World War 2 in China. It hurts their national pride. So they look for excuses and others to blame. Only when people can say that violence existed within themselves just as much as in everyone else, will the world start to change a bit. A book like Joseph Campbell's \\"Power of Mythology\\" is a good book to start understanding about human beings.  <br />Last year, there was a large anti-Japanese demonstration in China where people went around smashing sushirestaurants and Japanese goods. Nationalism and Patriotism can be just as effective as socialism or extremist religion for people to let out a steam of violence. <br /> <br /> <br />There is a song about this on Ayuo's CD \\"Earth Guitar\\" called \\"The Holy Man and the Sinner Within\\", available at amazon in the popular music category. <br /> <br />In the book, \\"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\\", Zhisui Li, Mao's personal docter writes the following: <br />\\"Participate in these festive celebrations and you will receive an education in patriotism\\", Mao had told me. He was right. As he reviewed the crowds, thrilling to the martial music and the sea of color and displays of China's might, I was indeed overcome with patriotism.\\" <br />I'm sure Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese militarists made the population feel the same way. There are many people who still remember being overcome by emotion, rather than to think rationally of the millions who died. I once met a Russian, whose grandfather was imprisoned by Stalin's policies, but still admired Stalin as a great patriot.  <br /> <br />The one problem with this book is that the writing is somewhat cold. The characters don't come to life like they do in \\"Wild Swan\\". Zhisui Li's book shows why Mao was attractive as well as the destruction that he caused. But this was because he was close to Mao in person.  <br />This is an important book. More details could have been filled in, but I'm sure other books can follow. I would have preferred to see more of what the author was feeling and doing at the time.  <br />20 years ago, I met someone in China, who told me she used to be a Red Guard. She told me that she saw so many unbelievable things happen, that she wanted to escape from China and write a book about it one day.
6304806426|5.0|I really enjoyed this film for the cinamatography, acting, and symbolism.  Two parallel stories are drawn.  The first is a worldly pair of adulterers.  The other, an innocent pair of shy and hopefull lovers. ( apoilers)  <br />  The adulterous pair die and suffer horribly ( including many punishments that seem right out of Dante.  In the beginning of their relationship Almasy and Kate are trapped in a sand storm, just like the first circle of the inferno where the lustfull are comdenmend. Later he is tortured with fire after having stated there is no god, sounds like a direct ticket to the seventh circle where the blasphemers are.  She, on the other hand, a young adulterous wife who is the aggressor in the afair, dies in a cave, freezing and alone, much like the suffering of  thos trapped in the nineth circle, the place of the trecherous.  As she has betrayed her husband the punishment seems to fit. <br />  Each bad person gets their just deserts.   <br />  The innocent lovers, Kip and Hanan, move around each other shy but open, hopeful, but willing to let themselves be guided by the will of god: as they part at the end, wondering if fate will bring them together again.  Through the whole, Hannah is tested by the deaths of those around here, but never curses god or gives up hope.  Kipp, lives his life by the grace of god.  Going out in to the feild everyday, even when he finds a bomb that literally has his name on it, to protect his fellow man.  <br />  I'm a bit puzzled by some of the reiviews on there that seem to think this film glorifies adultery.  Perhaps they have a different view of what makes for an happy ending than a rational person would. <br /> <br />
B00009L1UP|3.0|First things first, if Amazon allowed it, I would give this CD 3.5 stars, that said, on with the review.      Empire came fresh off the heals of what is now considered an all time metal classic, Mindcrime, an album that had the band in top gear, and pushed them into platinum territory. After such a success, the band went into somwhat different territory. While the Prog-Metal elements were there, they also had more of a pop sensibility, also, the band in a way stepped back to progressive, slower tempo sound as people heard on Rage For Order.      The CD kicks off with a mid-fast tempo Prog metal track, \\"Best I can\\", in a similar vien musically to what took place on Mindcrime, but one would notice right off the bat that the production is more mid range/pop-rock in nature, also lyrically, it is a little heavy handed, and these two elements(production and lyrical content) tend to weigh the rest of the CD down in parts.      The next song also continues in the prog-metal vien, though slower tempo than Best I can, but it show  the strength of the CD as well, and that is the atmospheric nature of the music, putting bass in the forefront. The next song is the farmilar, radio hit, Jet City woman, a solid track, but it more towrds pop-metal territory, but still holds up well to this day.      After a strong start, the CD has its first dud, Della Brown, a 7 minuite long song that is weighed down by what at the time was topical lyrics(homelessness) and music that meanders and doesnt have a point. After this song is another framiliar hit, Another Rainy Night, and like Jet City Woman, while it is more in pop-metal territory, it holds up well to this day, and also again features more bass driven music.     The second half of the CD kicks off with the title track, Empire, that is musically similar to Mindcrime, and is firmly in the Prog-Metal vien, but again, a too pop oriented production robs the song of some power. After this, is another solid Prog-Metal rocker, \\"Resistance\\", probably the most Mindcrime like song on the album, though generically preachy lyrics weight it down a little. After this is their biggest hit of their carrerr, the very Pink Floydish \\"Silent Lucidity\\" ballad. While many say it is their best track, I view it as one of the weaker numbers. Then comes \\"Hand on Heart\\", another bass driven Prog-Metal track, similar to the vein of \\"Another Rainy Day\\", after this comes a track that comes a little too close to \\"hair\\" metal, at least with its main riff. Lastly is the power ballad of the CD, \\"Anybody Listening\\", in a way, similar to \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" on Mindcrime, but somwhat decompressed, and also drags onn a little too long.      All and all a solid but somwhat flat effort by Queensrhyce. The elements that made Mindcrime great are mostly here also, but in a more simplified and less consistent form, and fans of the full throttle Prog Metal in Mindcrime would have to wait another 18 years before its sequel came out. That said, if one is a Queensryhce fan, its worth picking up.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Feh.  The best release since 10?  Pooh.  They shoulda quit after 10...  EV is out of tune on the entire cd, and the tunes themselves are pure drek.  Boring.  Nothing new.  Poorly mixed.  Very compressed.  Lots of riff rip offs.  Disappointing.  I bought it because all the hype said it was fantastic, great, a wonderful listen.  I am a PJ fan - of the good stuff.  This doesn't cut it.  Now I want my money back.  Anybody want to buy a used Pearl Jam cd?
B000EULJLU|2.0|Yeah, it really doesn't compare to their other albums. The song structures seem haphazard--they're trying too hard to combine all of their styles together. Also, I thought the electronics were really subpar, as the \\"tabla\\" was clearly just made of poorly processsed samples. I expected more, especially after Lateralus. Probably their worst album.
B000FIMG68|4.0|It was bound to happen -- after a breathtaking first season, expectations were high for the continuation of \\"Lost,\\" a creepy, semi-mystical series with a checkered cast and an exotic island setting.<br /><br />\\"Lost's\\" second season builds on the story of the first season, picking up where it left off. Though it has some flaws -- a bit of bad casting and some lag in the \\"island\\" stories -- it's still intriguing and eerie, and solves old mysteries as it introduces new ones, with shocking twists on characters you thought you knew.<br /><br />As the season opens, Locke, Kate and Jack finally enter the mysterious hatch. But they didn't count on finding a concrete bunker, a button that might postpone doomsday -- and a frantic man who is very familiar to Jack. Meanwhile, Michael, Sawyer and Jin manage to make it back to the island -- and are promptly captured by a band of strangers.<br /><br />These people turn out to be castaways from the fallen plane's tail section, led by the suspicious Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodrieguez). They make the trek to the opposite side of the island, but as they arrive, Ana makes a fatal mistake -- she shoots Shannon. Nice way to start integrating the groups.<br /><br />As the season goes on, new personal crises arise when Locke loses faith in the island, Michael goes off to find Walt, Hurley falls in love with one of the tailies, Claire explores what happened to her during her \\"missing month,\\" and Sawyer scores an unexpected coup which gets him all the guns in the camp.<br /><br />As the season goes on, things start to heat up. The mysterious French woman gives an \\"Other\\" she trapped over to Sayid, but is he really an enemy, or just an innocent castaway? And as Locke and Eko discover the true purpose of the hatches, one of the lost returns to the camp -- and treachery is guiding the castaways into a trap...<br /><br />\\"Lost\\"'s second seasons started out strong and thrilling, then hit a dead spot for a few episodes, before picking back up again. While the middling episodes are solid enough, the best parts are at the start and finish, where the writers throw several shocking twists into the storyline.<br /><br />The mystery of the island itself is not solved -- the presence of the mysterious Dharma Corporation is revealed. But the corporation doesn't explain how the island has healing powers. Some answers are revealed, and some mysteries simply get more complex. On the character backstory front, the castaways' problems still haunt them, from imaginary friends to torture to drugs.<br /><br />The returning cast continues the compelling job they did in the first season, especially Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Daniel Dae Kim, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia, who all get their pasts raked up again; the actors do a magnificent job with guilt, sorrow, longing, and love. In fact, all of them do a good job, including ex-star Maggie Grace, who manages to make us actually LIKE Shannon in her final episode.<br /><br />As for the \\"tailies,\\" there are good and bad choices. Michelle Rodrieguez was an appalling choice, since her butch ex-cop is the same character she's been doing for years. But on the flip side is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who quickly won fans' hearts as the spiritual Mr. Eko, a mysterious and dangerous priest/drugrunner. Think a Christian counterpart to Locke's animist believer.<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" stumbled a bit in the middle of the second season, but regained its footing for shocking, explosive episodes leading up to the finale.

0399241523|3.0|I'm sorry to say this, but thus far, this is the worst book (with the exception of Storm Breaker) in the series. It is very predictable, and is also slow at times. Alex is still a good character, but everything else is nothing special. If you have read any of the other books in this series, you will know exactly what will happen.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is Tool's most rhythmically complex work.  And THAT, I believe, is why you see so many \\"I'm not feeling it\\" reviews here.  It really takes awhile to internalize the asymmetrical rhythms of these songs.  An album like Aenima is much more accessible in the near term because, while it also features many unconventional rhythmic sections, many of them resolve back to hard, crunching straight-up rhythms that are very simple to headbang to. <br /> <br />Alas, not so with 10,000 days.  Your ears are challenged to take in extended movements of rhythmic unconventionality, movements that often DO NOT resolve back to simple, headbangable rhythmic normalcy.  If you are caught in the mental trap of expectation, i.e. you are waiting for that familiar headbanging moment to come around, you will probably feel left hanging... <br /> <br />Essentially Tool's new music is asking the listener to make the unfamiliar familiar.  The music challenges the listener to internalize rhythmic groupings of eleven, ten, nine, seven, five...and to bask in them, to take those old worn-out expectations of how rock music should resolve, and discard them.  This disruption is a very good, positive thing, and the musical result is freakin' brilliant...but it is inevitable that some listeners and \\"fans\\" will initially feel alienated. <br /> <br />The best advice I can give is simply to put the cd in your car cd player and leave it on a permanent loop for a couple of weeks, with the volume as loud as you can stand it.  Once you start internalizing individual rhythmic sections of the songs, things really start to fall into place, and you will feel the heart, emotion, and power of this music.  But you can't expect to really \\"feel\\" the music until you internally come to grips with the shifting, contrasting pulses that act as the frameworks of these compositions.  It sounds academic but it's really not.  Relaxation.  Immersion. <br /> <br />In terms of raw musical accomplishment, 10,000 days has Toolbreathing the rarefied air of such other rhythmic evolutionaries as King Crimson and Frank Zappa.  Sometimes growth can be painful, and some of Tool's \\"fans\\" may just have to be dragged along, kicking and screaming...
B000ENV2R8|4.0|Although I like very much 'Violator', I didn't think all of the tracks are great, specially 'World In My Eyes' and 'Sweetest Perfection'. <br />But, in the other hand there are 'Personal Jesus', 'Enjoy The Silence' and 'Clean' wich are some of the most brilliant tracks DM produced. <br />The sound on this CD is stunning. I get chicken skin while listen to the tracks on SACD. This edition is definitely worth the price and time spent listen to it. Plus, you get a DVD with some 'new' tracks: 'Dangerous', 'Memphisto', 'Sibeling', 'Kaleid', 'Happiest Girl (Jack Mix)', 'Sea Of Sin (Tonal Mix)' AND Depeche Mode 89-91 (If you wanna use guitars, use guitars) + 30 minute short film: New interviews with band members past and present. <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Get into this album NOW!  Can't recommend this album enough.  Especially pleasing if you already are into old David Bowie, Roxy Music... comparible to the British original glam sound of the early 70's. Energetic, Intricate and well composed but still very catchy.  Great artwork too.
B000002504|5.0|This 1973 release is often cited by many fans as their favorite GG album and after a few years of listening to the album, I generally agree.  Although admittedly, it really knocked me for a loop when I first listened to it - as I recall the overwhelming complexity of the album nearly tore my head off.  I guess it's worth noting that although I am a Biologist, I did study music formally once upon a time.  This background allowed me to dissect each composition into smaller pieces, which made digesting the music that much easier.  It took me a while, but I eventually \\"got it\\".<br /><br />This album saw the band moving light years beyond the comparatively more rocking first three albums (although it is really stretching things to use terms like rocking when discussing GG) and composing their pieces with the staggeringly intricate counterpoint and medieval English styles that made them a personal favorite.  The band lineup had also changed and featured drummer John Weather's first recorded performance with the group.  Joining him were Kerry Minnear (piano, Hammond organ, mellotron, mini-moog, the Regal, lead/backing vocals); Ray Shulman (bass, violin, guitar, percussion, and vocals), Gary Green (acoustic/electric guitars, percussion); Derek Shulman (lead vocals, alto saxophone); and Phil Shulman (saxophones, trumpet, mellophone, lead/backing vocals).<br /><br />Although the eight pieces range in length from only 3'10\\" to 5'54, which are generally short by prog standards, they seem enormous due to the use of instrumental preludes, interludes, and postludes.  The opening track Advent of Panurge is a great example of how these guys would layer parts that on their own are fairly straightforward, but when combined, the emergent property is that of mind-numbing complexity.  As the title implies, Raconteur Troubadour is a great example of their ability to weave medieval English styles into their works.  Other tracks that are somewhat varied include the maddening piece Knots, which showcases their ability to write multi-part vocal sections of considerable complexity; the delightful and nostalgic Think of Me with Kindness (a nice reprieve); a fantastic instrumental (The Boys in the Band); and a lighthearted piece dedicated to their roadies which features the nasal and somewhat abrasive tones of the Regal, which is a medieval keyboard instrument.  Of all the tracks, River is the most rocking and closes the album on a great note.<br /><br />All in all, while Octopus may not make for the most easy-going listening experience, it is certainly the most rewarding.  In fact, this is what got me hooked on Gentle Giant in the first place - I had to think about the music, which resulted in a more active listening experience for me.  Although Octopus is excellent, most newcomers are advised to start with albums like Acquiring the Taste (1971), Three Friends (1972), or The Power and the Glory (1974).  They were written by Gentle Giant during their artistic and creative peak, yet are not as intense as Octopus.  Other great albums include Gentle Giant (1970), In a Glass House (1973); Free Hand (1975); and In'terview (1976).s their ability to write multi-part vocal sections of considerable complexity; the delightful and nostalgic Think of Me with Kindness (a nice reprieve); a fantastic instrumental (The Boys in the Band); and a lighthearted piece dedicated to their roadies which features the nasal and somewhat abrasive tones of the Regal, which is a medieval keyboard instrument.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every episode of this series is brilliant.  I can't stand all the garbage on TV, and Firefly demonstrates what TV ought to be.  The characters are original and well developed, the writing is hillarious and insightful at the same time, and all the episodes fit together to tell a bigger story.  The story takes lots of unexpected turns, but if you go back and watch the earlier episodes again, you can see the clues that were cleverly embedded.  On top of all that, the show is just plain fun -- a sci-fi/western combination with lots of action, shot in a way that makes it feel like you're there.   <br /> <br />It's too bad fox didn't give this show a fair chance.  I didn't even know about this show until after it was cancelled, and it's the most innovative, exciting, and funny show I've ever seen.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Best album ever.   <br />It is rare to find an album in which every single track is excellent.  This is one of those albums (all 28 of the tracks!).  They've changed, but really, that shouldn't have come as any surprise.  People change, places change, bands change.  A few of the songs are funky reminders of the Chili Peppers' early days, some recall to Under the Bridge/Californication mellowness, but most are a brand-new sound, and it definitely works.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0316666343|5.0|Wow...this book is so wonderfully odd, you can't put it down.  Alice Sebold does an amazing job of making you totally uncomfortable...but you keep turning the pages!  I couldn't get away from this book...I even dreamed about it!  It is an amazing work of art!
B000EULJLU|5.0|It seems the negative comments are short and uninspired. There is no way you can dislike this musical experience if you just give it a proper listen. I too was a little confused at first. I had seen Tool live four times after Lateralus, they are the four best shows I have ever seen. I bought the 10,000 days cd on the way to the show at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas. A 3 hour drive. After the first listen I thought it was pretty good. After the second listen with it cranked as loud as I could I thought it was very good. Then we stood in line for good seats for 5 hours! Then there was the show! Awesome!! is all I can say. The live performance of the new songs set this cd in concrete for me. You can like Tool, but if you ever see them live you will worship Tool. I rate this cd a 10! listen too it as a whole, all the way through with no interuption, maybe on a drive and you will will love it!
B0002S943O|5.0|I saw Mode at the Coachella Music Festival and this concert was actually better than the incredible performance for Touring The Angel.  Devotional contains many of the same songs featured on their current tour (minus recent album content of course.)  I watched this 6 times over the course of a week and its never disappoints.  The band is absolutely on point in every way:  Gahan's voice is a silver bell in the night, Gore is his estranged blonde-mopped self booking around on stage and swapping out his synths for an electric guitar, the onstage video montages are earth shakingly intense and their track section is clean and potent; every song performed beautifully.  Fans of the Faith and Devotion album will be reminded how brilliant some of these songs are with Walking in My Shoes, Mercy in You, and Judas leaving you speechless with their power.  In my opinion Devotional outshines 101 for what I like to call the \\"Violator Era\\" fans of the band.  The majority of the songs are from Violator and Faith with no extraneous B-sides thrown in which keeps the performance SUPER core.  Other classic DM tracks include Behind the Wheel, Everything Counts, Fly on the Windscreen, etc.  .  .  Pure joy and pain in this release, Devotional will be the best 14 dollars you ever spent on a DVD.  <br /> <br />In a word, haunting.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I've listened to alot of music in my time, I listen to everything from Led Zeppelin to Korn to Nightwish and I can safely say that this is one of the best albums ever. I can name 2 or 3 that can even compete with it and none that clearly beat it. Unlike other Rammstein albums, this album has no weak track and it never EVER gets old.   <br /> <br />1. Mein Herz Brennt (10/10) A great starting song with an epic chorus filled with string effects.  Rammsteins first use of strings is amazing and gives the song a great dynamic. Rammstein lets the listener know immedeately that this album is amazing.     <br />2. Links 234 (9/10) A catchy song with cool guitar that has important lyrics. Alot of people accuse Rammstein of being Nazis (only because they are German and ignorant people cant comprehend that all Germans arent Nazis) This song is a cleverly concealed message to those people.    <br />3. Sonne (11/10) Best song on the album.  The chorus to this song is among the best choruses in music and the riff will be stuck in your head for days.  The female voice at the end is actually a keyboard but it sounds beautiful none the less. Incredible song. <br />4. Ich will  (11/10) Another amazing song. The chorus, like Sonne, is unreal and will be stuck in your head forever. It also has a great bridge section that really builds up to the epic final chorus. Probably the best concert song ever.    <br />5. Feuer frei!  (9/10) This song is seen in XXX and helped Rammstein gain popularity. Its a pretty simple song with crunching riffs and a catchy chorus.  Very heavy.  <br />6. Mutter  (11/10) This song is a power ballad, and probably the best I've ever heard. Till's emotion when singing this song is one of a kind. The bridge section is amazing and the guitar is great.  This is a classic.   <br />7. Spieluhr (9.5/10) A fun song with an awesome chorus featuring a robot voice.  The music box keyboarding sounds and awesome and adds a great dynamic. The most underrated song on the album.    <br />8. Zwitter (9/10) A funny song with an annoyingly catchy chorus.  A German person probably wouldn't sing this song aloud...Just a fun song overall.     <br />9. Rein raus  (9/10) A heavy song with pretty good instrumental work. Another song a German person wouldn't sing aloud.  The ending is great.   <br />10. Adios (9.5/10) Rammstein does punk. This is a fast song with catchy guitar and great drumming. Someone who reviewed it called it a slow song, obviously they didn't listen to it. Awesome chorus.      <br />11. Nebel (10/10) Very slow song that starts off kind of boring buts so strongly it gets a 10. The chorus of this song is amazing and the keyboard work is superlative. Good ending   <br />
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Now All I got to say is I never used to listen to Mobb Deep. I always used to hear their name but just just never bothered to listen to their music. After I got \\"The Massacre\\" I heard the song \\"Outta Control\\"(50 Cent Single) I pretty much like it. After I heard about \\"Outta Contol(Remix)\\" on the radio I was like Whoa After that I started to get to know Mobb Deep. So I thought that was their first song with 50 Cent so I expected more.     Later when Get Rich or Die Tryin'(Original Soundtrack) was out I had to check it out with all of the different artists from G-Unit. The song \\"Have A Party\\" which featured in \\"Blood Money\\" happened to be in the soundtrack first. I couldn't stop listening to \\"Have A Party\\" the verse was so good including Nate Dogg with the chorus. After that I knew Mobb Deep was now one of my favorite artists. So I got \\"Blood Money\\" and its the best. I know that their other albums were ok but I think signing to G-Unit actually helped them out. I do have one problem with this album, too much 50 Cent in the tracks. Its like almost half of the whole album I mean already heard enough in his own album and now he is like in 7 songs in this album. So I would rate this cd 3 stars and recommend you to get it to check out Mobb Deep's first G-Unit records album \\"Blood Money\\".     My Top Favorites  1. Outta Control(Remix)  2. Have A Party  3. Put Em in Their Places  4. Daydreamin'  5. Give It To Me
B000002VMD|5.0|Whatever you may think of her today, Whitney's vocal ability on this CD is amazing and would be difficult to imitate by female singers on the radio today.  For those who call it anything other than beautiful, where were you and your sordid opinions when the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" first hit the airwaves?  Originally recorded by Dolly Parton, Miss Houston's interpretation and impeccable performance of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" catapulted her into super stardom.  Videos also turned her into an international icon of celebrated proportions as The Body Guard Soundtrack continued to climb the charts, set new records and earn numerous awards.  In my opinion, Miss Houston need not prove herself any longer.  For even without uttering another note, Whitney will go down in history as one of the greatest voices of all time.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I have always been a huge Pearl Jam ever since 6th grade, and I was really looking forward to this album, but I was a little disapointed.  The songs are pretty good but make no mistake-this is no masterpiece by any means.  There are several great songs on here-Life Wasted, World Wide Suicide (the music is good, the lyrics are too propaganda-ish), Gone, Come Back, Inside Job and Severed Hand.  But there are some bad songs on here too-Comatose (this is now my least favorite PJ song ever), Marker in the Sand and Unemployable arent that good either. <br /> <br />If you were expecting beautiful songs like Off He Goes or Thumbing My Way, you won't find them here.  If you want some noise, its here for you.  Don't get me wrong-any Pearl Jam album beats most other musicians, but this won't beat any other previous Pearl Jam album.
B000002VSN|5.0|I agree with another online reviewer who simply says \\"Let The Angel Sing\\" and I reiterate their opinion that \\"I Love The Lord\\", sung by Miss Houston will make the hair on your arms stand up!  Whitney is absolutely amazing and she should be.  On this particular performance, Whitney is not just a Diva, she is in her element!  Her origins go back to the choir of her youth, under the direction of none other than her own mother, Cissy Houston, the awesome soprano from the \\"Sweet Inspirations\\" and former back up singer for Arehta Franklin, the \\"Queen\\" of Soul.  Whitney's gospel performance is awesome and will be a classic for years to come.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|i was never really much into the rhcp, but his album is great, even for non-fans. a must buy
B000C65Z1G|3.0|Here's another highly praised film that left me, if not cold, at least not much more than tepid. Several flaws struck me. <br /> <br />First, I found the love story unconvincing, and once again, not about love at all. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz get together way too fast. Or it seems fast. The general chronologically fractured structure of this movie often leaves the viewer with no sense of how much time has elapsed. So it appears that one moment, Weisz is in Fiennes' classroom, flirting, asking to go along with him to Africa. And the next moment, there they are together, in the thick of Africa's medical dilemmas. <br /> <br />Or actually, the two are not really there together at all. Contrary to the great love story that many people claim to find in this film, I found only separate tables. Fiennes and Weisz seem to be pursuing different paths from the start. They don't confide in each other about certain dangers, presumably to \\"protect\\" each other. But their lack of communication more often seems to derive from actual hostility, which flares palpably on more than one occasion. So where is the great love story? <br /> <br />Then another flaw is that the movie once again conjures the corporate executive as nearly invincible boogieman. There is no nuance in the evil of these men. And once again, they are omniscient and omnipresent, capable of commanding the gruesome murder of anyone hundreds of miles away, who so much as whispers a thought that would reduce their profit margins. <br /> <br />Finally, gratuitous red herrings are cast into the mix. For example, there is the hospital scene where Weisz is shown holding a baby. That's misleading for no good reason. <br /> <br />This movie does give a strikingly different view of the African landscape though. It's not the usual landscape we see on nature specials, with a herd of giraffes loping in front of a beautiful sunset. And it's not the jungle that some Tarzan enthusiasts still equate with Africa. The area where this movie was shot is a vast, parched moonscape. Being projected onto this ground for just the hours of the movie gives the viewer a sense of searing dearth. Our teenagers, whose biggest problem is often choosing between a Gucci or a Pucci handbag, seem as if they are growing up not thousands, but millions of miles from the present African generation.   <br /> <br />So the film does wake the viewer up to some harsh realities. But on the whole, the constant gardener has too many weeds growing in his plot. <br />
B00006J9OT|5.0|This album really flows and swings. Very enjoyable. I am not thrilled about the last two songs. The Billy Joel song is OK. Not sure about the other one. Still, the live songs are just great. I heard this CD before any of her other CDs. I really like this one better than the studio CDs - not to say that the studio ones are in any way bad. This one is just really good.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This may be the best documentary about the legendary Bob Dylan narrated by him and those who knew him. From his fateful journey in search of Woody Guthrie to his rise to stardom to his fall from his fans' graces, this film is a non-stop joy ride into what the 1960's was for Bob Dylan. I have always felt that Martin Scorsese was brilliant with his use of music in his films, and this film is no different. Not only does it include many Dylan songs and performances, it is also packed with performances by many of Dylan's friends and influences including Joan Baez, Woodie Guthrie, Rhetta, Pete Seagar, Peter Paul and Mary, and any number of other figures. In short this film is fantastic from start to finish.
0316172324|2.0|Gladwell deftly squeezes about 100 pages of content into almost 300 pages of book. It goes from pretty good to tedious to boring.  He draws conclusions which are not based on any \\"facts\\" in the book, but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths.  I gave him 2 stars because the first part of the book was OK. <br />Don't waste your time and your money.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I can't believe I and all the other reviewers giving 4 and 5 stars could possibly be listening to the same album. This album is not that good. Its fortelling when a group puts the first single released as the number one track on their album, that you've been baited, hooked, and in for disappointment. Dani California is a great song, maybe three of four others out of 28 are worth your time to listen, but the rest are filler. Is it worth the full price of $22 to buy the album at a later date or buy it now at $12 I'm still unsure.  <br /> <br />Yes we all mature but if this album is a mature Red Hot Chili Peppers, let them retire and collect their social security checks. The beats sound all to familar and tiresome. I'm searching through my memories for where I've heard quite a few of the same melodies in previous albums. And believe me you will too. I wish I could say this was a good album, but in honesty I can't. This is not the greatest album ever as others have stated. Don't try to compare this as the greatest double album since The Beatles double album as other reviewers have, cause you haven't lived on this earth long enough. Another reviewer compared the guitar work to Jimi Hendrix, Jimi is no where in Stadium Arcadium, Mars or Jupiter.  <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this album to surpass the pop-y, uncreative music on the radio. Sadly this album only rises to mediocrity from an otherwise great band. I still enjoy the Chili Peppers and won't let this album change that. I'll simply file this album in my collection and move on.
0394800184|2.0|I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham!
B00004XOWM|1.0|if you like kindergarten intellect, and wanna-be tough guy antics then check out anything from these guys!! honestly how can this album be any worse than the first one? they actually had to work at sucking.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Most of the acting is great in this film except for the lead actor Orlando Bloom. In order for this movie to be considered good, he would have had to really sell this character to the viewers but he fell far short of that and he just ended up looking moody through out the film. I could not understand or sympathize with his character at all and I just felt if Russell Crow or an actor like him had played the lead it would have been a much better film. I usually like Orlando Bloom but this role was way wrong for him!!!
B00000JCB2|1.0|F**k these poser ass rejects. Fred Durst more than likely got his ass kicked in high school (now i know why you wanna hate me?!?!?). no talent ass clowns!! hacks!!! never was real metal. terrible trend, glad its over.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I just looked back on past Tool reviews I'd written, and it seems like I'm always defending them, or defending myself for loving them so much, but the more I've thought about it, the more it's become obvious that there's no need. Not at all. Not only does Tool not need me to defend them, they have tons of fans, sell millions of records, but they hardly qualify as a guilty pleasure at this point, other than for the fact that a bunch of d-cks with backwards baseball caps and jacked up trucks love them. But those same d-cks love Slayer too, but you don't see people embarrassed to love Slayer.  <br /> <br />And what's not to love here, lengthy epics, sludgy crunchy guitars, impossibly complex drumming, lurching and grooving, moody and so intense, creepy crawly vocals, this is some seriously dark and heavy sh-t. Maybe more so than a lot of 'heavy underground' bands. Plus Tool just seem super cool. They refuse to sell their tracks on iTunes, they spend years crafting epic sort-of-concept records, totally elaborate and complex, right down to the packaging. And holy sh-t, the packaging this time around is mind blowing. And mind you Tool have long championed the ultra deluxe packaging for their records, but this one is definitely the most outrageous. In fact it just might be the most amazing packaging I've ever see. When I cracked open the case I ooh'ed and aah'ed like a kid on Christmas. What it is, is a super thick black plastic folder type sleeve, with two lenses embedded in the flap. When you open the sleeve, and check out the full color booklet each photo is split in two, two images side by side, and then you realize that it's a stereoscope and as you look through the lenses at the photos, they become strange 3-D tableaus, band photos are rife with tiny little details, ghosts in the background, strange items on the desk in the foreground, fire and smoke, other images are strange surreal juxtapositions and creepy Eastern psychedelic images, even the song titles are in 3-D! <br /> <br />It's funny, but Tool are one of the few bands that almost everyone I know loves, customers, band members, folks who run labels, over the last week or two, lots of our 'underground music' pals have emailed or called to opine on the new Tool, as if that made perfect sense, and it kind of does. It's a little bit like somehow one of \\"our own\\" managed to crack the code and miraculously made it to the big time, and in their own way are subverting from within. When Opiate came out years back, I never would have thought that a band that dark and that weird would one day be mentioned in the same breath as Coldplay or U2. But it's gotta happen once in a while. And it's pretty great that if anything, Tool have not softened or mainstreamed at all, but maybe gotten more strange and more obstinate with age. Just like me.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  I never saw the play but the music in this film was wonderful and the romance intense. Gerard Butler is great as the phantom and so sexy!!! The singing is top notch and anyone who enjoys musicals will love this movie.
0143034901|4.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is not a book that bowled me over with insights into the human condition, as does a Marquez work (which some compare it to). Nor does it have the labyrinth-like complexity of an Eco work (another frequent comparison). What the book does have is a lot of love for romantic literature. A sweeping tale filled with truly likeable, and truly detestable characters, \\"Shadow\\" prides itself on a sense of atmosphere and discovery. It's a big, fun read that twists, turns, and comes together in an altogether satisfying, if not groundbreaking way after five-hundred or so pages. The book's main drawback, in my humble opinion, is its somewhat unnecessary length.  The last two-hundred or so pages fly by, but there is a decent amount of dead time in the opening three-hundred or so pages that I felt could have benefitted from some trimming. On the whole though, a very handsome, wholly enjoyable read.
B00005O3VC|5.0|What can I say about this movie other than it is the best of British comedy and everyone should see it!!!! I mean everyone!!! You will love it!!!
B000002L5P|5.0|I had a group of friends that were into the smiths in the mid 80's but I was never really a fan until someone got me to pay attention to thier lyrics. This is without a doubt my favorite albumn of thiers. It is not as slick as the later albumns but song for song this cd is GREAT. Alot of critics say this albumn does not live up to the Smiths' ability but the underproduction is one of the best things of the albumn. If you are looking for a hits albumn get one of the compilations but if you want to hear the beginnings of a sound still going strong today this is the one.
B0002S94BG|4.0|I loved this cd set not only does it have my favorite songs from Grace, such as Last Goodbye and Grace but it has the never before recorded song \\"Forget Her\\" , which is my new favorite. Something about the notes in that song just make your heart go out to the singer. It is a haunting song that you can't help but listen to.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|A friend lent me Anastacia's first CD years ago and I was amazed by her voice. On a recent trip to Europe, I found this album in one of the music stores and since then have become a true Anastacia fan. This is definitely her best album to date, and one of the greatest rock albums put out in a long time. There isn't one track that I skip on this cd! It is a wonder how an artist as talented as Anastacia is so overlooked in the U.S.
0399241515|5.0|All of the Alex Rider novels contain a certain level of mystery and how it has been unsolved until Alex comes along, yet this is definitely NOT a mystery book, it is action, like all the others.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Alex Rider novel, but it is still worthy of a 5 star rating. My personal favorite was Point Blank. It had all the action, but was condensed.<br /><br />What is so great about Scorpia is that Alex is tricked by the \\"bad guys\\" AND by the \\"good guys\\" leaving Alex stuck in the middle.<br /><br />The last chapter was a bit of a confusion for someone who didn't already know the ending ahead of time.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Just a fun evening. Not for the real little kids, but everyone else. The actors look like they are having fun. That's always good news for the audience.Even a touch of the stooges. So enjoy.
B00005JOVO|1.0|If you saw the sequel to the grand-daddy disaster classic of all time you know what I'm talking about. Enough said!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|First, let me start by acknowledging what so many others have pointed out:  THIS IS NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHER TOOL ALBUMS!  If you listen to, for instance, Opiate, and then 10,000 Days, yes you will notice a difference.  The band has, for lack of a better word, evolved.  People change, and so do bands for that matter.  It would be selfish to assume that Tool plans to exist for ages, pumping out the same stuff to sedate our minds as they did on their first albums.  Also, an album should not be judged in relation to its predecessors. <br /> <br />Now, back to the difference.  While different from the other albums, it is still reminiscent.  To me, Maynard's voice plucks at memories from the song \\"Sober\\" throughout 10,000 Days, while the riffs and melodies remind me strongly of Lateralus.  Another similarity: the lyrics aren't black and white.  On other Tool albums you cannot expect to know what the songs are about after the first listening, and maybe never will.  But that's one of the great things!  Every listener can form his or her own interpretation based on their perception.  The same with this album.  Don't take the words completely for their face value. <br /> <br />In short, no, this isn't the Tool of yesteryear, and I think the band should be respected for that fact.  They are not giving us what we want just to make us happy, they're going in the direction they want to and not giving a damn about everyone else.  If this band had a message, that would probably be it right there.  This albums deserves to be judged on its own without relation to previous Tool albums. <br /> <br />As far as songs go, most of the songs have a religious undertone.  I'm not sure how many references to the bible there are, maybe none at all, but if that bugs you, you may not like this album.  If you like knowing about the absurdity of the human race though, track 10 is a must. <br />&lt;end rant/review>
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love Tool, every song on every album. They re-create their style every time and I am really into that.  I was out of the country when the album first came out, and not able to listen to it.  My sister emailed me and told me is sucked and that there were only 3 actual songs on it and the rest was chanting and bongo drums and clicking.  I have been gripping for this album for 5 years so I was pretty p*ssed at her for laying that on me while i was out of town. I was worried until I was able to listen to it when I got back, but needlessly.  TOOL ROCKS AND SO DOES THIS ALBUM!  The only tracks that aren't songs are 6,7&11.  And one of those is this cool American Indian chanting that reminds me of the Doors.  Every Tool album has weird/cool speaking tracks that sort of set the tone/mood of the album.  Anyway if your a Tool fan you won't be disappointed.  Plus the album art is in 3-D and has googly glasses,  HOW MUCH COOLER CAN YOU GET??!?!!
B000AARKO4|4.0|I'm not to sure about how true this story really is but the action is intense and Orlando Bloom's Performance is just outstanding.

1400079179|5.0|I just finished this book and found it facinating. It's a fast paced inviting story. It's all about entertainment and should not be taken seriously. If you find yourself defending your faith by trying to boycott a fictitious book then maybe you need to ask yourself why.
0316172324|1.0|I heard that the main idea of this book is that first impressions are more valid than thoughtful reasoning, so instead of reading and thinking about the book I just flipped through the pages for a general impression. It is nonsense.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|I thought this book was great. It's very well written and gives you a lot of insight on life and everything involved in it. It's a great read that I could not put down. I reccomend giving it a chance, its a very good book!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Attention, people of the future! Do you want to sort through the ruins of early 21st-century music and see why the Red Hot Chili Peppers towered over so many contemporaries? If so, study this massive \\"Stadium.\\"<br /><br />Here are the band's pillars, exposed for all to see: Anthony Kiedis's voice, which has improbably evolved from primal rap-rock fratboy obnoxiousness to beautiful Beach-Boy harmoniousness; John Frusciante's stunning guitar virtuosity, which on the strength of this album alone should land him both in the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame and on every drug rehab center poster telling junkies what great things are possible when they kick smack; Flea's funky surf-bass, advancing and receding in perfect time to get every song where it needs to be, and Chad Smith's drumming, as steady and dependable and excellently simple as his name.<br /><br />Though resting on such solid foundations, this album breaks the rules--not of what's musically possible, mind you, but of what's possible for a band's career trajectory. Bands just aren't supposed to be making their best music 23 years after they started making music. Nor are they supposed to be able to get clean and sober while also getting better and better. And they're especially not supposed to be able to release a double CD without any filler. (Yes, I love \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\" as much as, if not more than, the next guy. But at 80 minutes and 67 minutes long, respectively, they're about the length of your average bloated single-disc rap CD these days.) But this--this is two full hours of music, folks! 28 tracks. And not a clunker in the lot. (For the record, \\"Animal Bar\\" comes closest.)<br /><br />This is the Chili Peppers' \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" though--a culmination of, not a departure from, everything that's come before. (Or, more accurately, a second culmination, after the first culmination that was \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\\") \\"Exile\\" synthesized the Stones' blues and country influences; this is the perfect blend of the Peppers' P-funk and laid-back beach-ready jams.<br /><br />Strangely (or perhaps not so strangely, given that this is the Red Hot Chili Peppers), they've named the two discs after planets. Stranger still, the names work. \\"Jupiter\\" is a large, stately, beautiful, ballad-heavy disc, while \\"Mars\\" is generally zippier, funkier, faster. (Personally, I'm more comfortable on heavy Jupiter than on funky Mars, but I actually find the funk here much more breathable than that of the \\"Subway to Venus\\"-era, thanks, perhaps, to Kiedis's generally airier vocals.)<br /><br />As far as individual tracks go, this album generally runs the gamut, ranging from the excellent to the merely very, very good. \\"Snow\\" and \\"C'mon Girl\\" feature some of Frusciante's very best guitar work ever. \\"Dani California\\" strip mines the lode they prospected to great effect on the title tracks for \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way\\"; surprisingly, there's still gold in them thar hills. \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" blows away all the haters who might think this band's gone soft in their middle age. So, too, does the pyrotechnic funky snarl of \\"Turn It Again.\\" The lyrics cover some familiar ground (sex obsession and sobriety) and some new territory, with some oddly affecting notes of humility and spirituality.<br /><br />It's scary to think about what might come next for the Chili Peppers: can they take it to the proverbial next level? More to the point, after such a humongous and comprehensive work, is there even a next level left to take it to? Will they rocket off to Saturn and Uranus, Neptune and Pluto? Or will coming years find them recording \\"It's Only P-Funk (But I Like It)\\" in Stones-esque self-parody? Only you can tell, future-people. (At least, those of you reading this in 2010 or so can tell, not those of you reading this next week.) At this point, I'm not about to bet against the Chili Peppers--they've proven me, and so many others, so wrong before. More to the point, I just don't care right now, because this gi-normous double album should keep me busy and happy for some time to come.st don't care right now, because this gi-normous double album should keep me busy and happy for some time to come.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|<br />I'm a sucker for romantic movies.  This is definietly a love story to die for.  I though Keira Knightley played the part well.  But there were moments where i would have been, \\"Freak you Mr. Darcy!\\"  She's a great actress, and i thought the moive went a little slow but i think it's meant to be like that really.  The environment was beautiful, the music is absoluely perfect,and.... eveything went well!  The ending was perfect, but i felt it was rushed.  The second time i watched it though, the overall moive went faster and the ending went slower.  Sigh... I want to be Mrs. Darcy...  \\"You bewitched me, mind, body and soul...\\"
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Justin (Ralph Fiennes) is a British diplomat to Kenya.  He has all the manners and foibles of an official man who knows protocol well.  He is challenged one day when he meets a beautiful and feisty activist named Tess (Rachel Weisz) when he is a substitute lecturer making the rounds.  She challenges him with such pointed and angry questions about British policy that the audience gets up in clusters to leave.  Keeping his composure and his diplomatic skills, he speaks calmly enough to disarm her.  From here they have a passionate affair, then quickly marry. Soon later she insists that he takes her on one of his African diplomatic voyages.  She is just as passionate oversees, and the viewer sees first hand the plight that war, poverty, and disease have taken on the Kenyan citizens.  She challenges the status quo of bureaucracy, greed, and indifference, and it is this match up that gets her deeply into trouble.  And it is trouble that Justin inherits as he tries to unravel the mystery of his wife's disappearance and slaying.  The clues he comes upon tell us even more about the troubles in Africa than they do about his wife.    This is a socially conscious movie that does weave intrigue and suspense well throughout.  The panoramic views of the colorful African landscape and people are inspiring enough, and the entertainment is crafted in a way that is engaging and edgy.  There is a tug-of-war between \\"show and tell,\\" however.  It is more effective when the movie shows us, rather than just continually tells us, about the social contagions and their antidotes.
0898159156|5.0|Well- what can I say? It was a fantastic read and very entertaining. The author clearly knows what he is talking about and gives detailed information on how to cultivate the plants, grow them and even talks about the different mechanisms by which they work. I would nonetheless also recommend reading Slack's book on carnivorous plants along with this one. <br /> <br />I suppose you may be wondering if there are any negatives with this product; the only one disappointing this was that it was clearly focused for the American grower. I live in the UK, so the way in which I grow my plants are very different due to the different climate etc. However, I would certainly recommend the book to any grower as it has good tips and ideas that are useful to all.  <br /> <br />Definitely thumbs up to this book.
1400032717|4.0|I'd heard great things about Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and it certainly didn't disappoint - until about 125 pages in. The first half of this book was so good I crowed about it half-way through to my wife, and then - it never fails! - the next time I picked up the book I started to be disappointed. Without giving too much away, let me just say that the protagonist makes a major decision in terms of both the immediate story and his life, and . . . well, the book suddenly became less interesting to me.<br /><br />Curious Incident starts out as a self-professed mystery novel. Our protagonist is Christopher, a teenage boy who is incapable of understanding things like basic emotions, metaphor, or, oftentimes, simple human motivations. His child-like, innocent, and fearful view of the world makes him an intriguing \\"detective,\\" since he must work hard to discover things that readers of the book will understand from the moment we hear them or see them. The real thrill for me was putting together the answers to the mystery - the violent murder of a neighbor's dog - from the bits and pieces of the world Christopher is able to translate. That and the boy's incredibly detached and yet insightful observations kept me inthralled.<br /><br />And then, about mid-way through, he solves the murder mystery. Wait, what!? I was upset when I got to this point in the story, because I anticipated it as the conclusion, not the catalyst for more action. So, Curious Incident is not really a mystery story, at least not in the traditional sense. Instead, it is the story of one boy learning more about his family and his world well beyond the mystery of the dead dog next door. But that knowledge doesn't seem to help him in the end; in fact, I think his decisions in the second half of the book only make things worse for himself. That's debatable, I suppose, but I never like it when protagonists make bad decisions for themselves. I know that into every life a little rain must fall, and that every main character worth reading about must face challenges that change him, but I dislike protagonists who make outright bad decisions, whether misinformed or not. I prefer challenges to be thrown their way, and then watch as they struggle to survive those challenges, rather than seeing characters create their own hardship. It's a fine line, but I'm pretty particular about it.<br /><br />So, overall, I give Curious Incident a less than cosmic rating, although for the first half of the book I got that tingly feeling that I was reading what would become one of my top five favorite novels. It's on the list of good books to recommend, but doesn't crack the top of the list.a little rain must fall, and that every main character worth reading about must face challenges that change him, but I dislike protagonists who make outright bad decisions, whether misinformed or not.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in my life, & in history should go down as the best album of the decade.  Pearl Jam are not only back, they're God.
0780619587|5.0|A beautifully rendered film about artistry, madness and love. This film has fabulous performances and a really beautiful plotline. \\"Shine\\" was the first film that introduced the great actor Geoffrey Rush to a wide audience. He brilliantly portrayed the genius pianist, David Helfgott after his mental breakdown. Noah Taylor, a talented young actor played Helfgott as a young man who was in love with his art but was tormented by doubts and abuse. The incredible work of Armin Mueller-Stahl as David's abusive but strangely loving father really stands out here. The whole plot and feel of the film reminded me of Pnk Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" as it illustrated how the sensitivity of a vulnerable person and the cruelties of the world can come together to create a madness born of necessity. The song \\"Mother\\",  from that album captures what I mean but in the case of \\"Shine\\" you would sing,  <br /> <br />\\"Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry  <br />Papa's gonna make all of your nightmares come true  <br />Papa's gonna put all of his fears into you  <br />Papa's gonna keep you right here under his wing  <br />He won't let you fly, but he might let you sing  <br />Papa's will keep Baby cozy and warm  <br />Oooo Babe  <br />Oooo Babe  <br />Ooo Babe, of course Papa's gonna help build the wall.\\"
1400079179|1.0|Every few years the publishing world goes crazy over the next big thing.  Basically the latest Stephen King novel, the new Oprah's Book Club selection, or magical books about a wizard named Harry grasp the world's attention for a few months.  While nothing changes in the real world, a handful of books allow the publishing world to breathe a collective sigh of relief.  People can and still do read books.<br /><br />Unlike movies, television, or music, literature needs to hold our attention for more than just a few moments.  Who's going to pay thirty bucks for the latest John Grisham novel when they can't get past the first couple of pages?  The question of whether a book grabs me and keeps me reading plagues my mind.  How many well written books have I put down to never pick back up again? That's why it was amazing that I finished THE DAVINCI CODE.  A book so lacking in anything remotely compelling that the only reason it exists is because it's such a fast read.<br /><br />Robert Langdon has been called to the Louvre to answer questions about the death of Jacques Sauniere. Sauniere is the curator of the Louvre and was supposed to have drinks with Langdon that evening.  His body was found naked  in a weird pose with ominous words surrounding him. His final written words \\"P.S. find Robert Langdon.\\" Soon Langdon discovers he is the prime suspect in Sauniere's murder.  But he has some friends to help him prove his innocence, like Sophie, Sauniere's estranged granddaughter, and his old friend Sir Leigh Teabing.  With their help,  Langdon sets out on an adventure to save his good name.  In the process he stumbles upon a mystery that could change the course of human history forever.<br /><br />I started reading this book because I had heard so many good things.  I had followed the controversy and it interested me.  But mostly it was because a close friend kept asking me what I thought of the darn thing.  So I grabbed the value priced paperback and began reading.  I set the book down about fifty times each time I begged myself not to finish it.  But alas I did and it was only after the finished the book that I realized this would make a far better movie.<br /><br />Dan Brown's book is so simple. The chapters are about a page and half long and the story so riddled with modern day movie cliches.  I found myself not invested in the story as much as tearing apart its faulty logic.  If you don't realize who the bad guy is about 15 minutes before you even meet him, you've obviously never been to the movies. It's not that Brown doesn't try to pull out all the stops.  I found the renegade Super-Catholic and the crazy albino monk to be the most compelling characters and vastly underutilized.<br /><br />Robert Langdon is supposed to be this great doctor of symbology.  But he makes mistakes at every turn. Brown actually writes an entire chapter about how he can't figure out some strange DaVinci language.  Alas, it was English written backwards with some swoopy curves.  Even I could see that with my own two eyes and I'm not a symbologist. Hmmm..... maybe I missed my calling.<br /><br />To cover up the weakness in plot Brown fills the story up with what has been pissing off Catholics and to some extent Protestants for a couple of hundred years.  You see, many hundreds of years ago a bunch of wacky nuts named the Gnostics decided they like this Jesus cat but didn't like the whole religion part. So they stripped the Bible of its religious content and filled in the hole with a story involving Jesus getting married and moving to Europe.  Then they convinced a bunch of guys that the Catholic church covered up the story thus deceiving millions of people around the world.  Trust me, it's all bunk.  Any freshman history major can tell you that the Gnostic gospels (the earliest written at least 150 years after the events of the Bible) cannot be considered eye-witness accounts even though the Gnostics claim they were.<br /><br />Brown does nothing to clarifythis. His theories and research do nothing but cast doubt.  His research runs the gamut from interesting to just plain silly.  I especially loved his nod to The Little Mermaid.  But at heart, his character's discussions are so convoluted I kept thinking back to my argumentation class in college where I learned of a little guy named Occam and his Razor.  In essence \\"the simplest answer is usually the best answer.\\"  But The Davinci Code only offers convoluted proof to what should be a lot simpler.<br /><br />What makes Dan Brown's research even more pointless is that he allows his book to end on this silly and yet astoundingly stupid statement about what \\"the Holy Grail\\" is or is not.

His research runs the gamut from interesting to just plain silly.  I especially loved his nod to The Little Mermaid.  But at heart, his character's discussions are so convoluted I kept thinking back to my argumentation class in college where I learned of a little guy named Occam and his Razor.  In essence \\"the simplest answer is usually the best answer.\\"  But The Davinci Code only offers convoluted proof to what should be a lot simpler. <br />  <br />What makes Dan Brown's research even more pointless is that he allows his book to end on this silly and yet astoundingly stupid statement about what \\"the Holy Grail\\" is or is not.

B000EGCIU0|5.0|This is by far one of the best CD's I've bought in a very long time! A must have immediately for all P!nk fans!
B000F0UV0E|3.0|Not up to the best of either Emmylou or Mark.  I love both of the musicians and song writers but this CD seemed just a marketing ploy.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|There is no structure in my life, no planning, I fell across this movie one night on cable quite by accident. I don't like a lot of things but I'm now hooked on Serenity AND the Firefly series. I bought this and then I bought the series and consider it money well spent. I don't by any means consider myself qualified to be a critic but watching this movie makes me happy and that's what movies are all about, yes?
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Well, I never liked this band, i bought one of their cd's blind because someone recommended them, i glad i bought it for a dollar because it was at Hastings about 15 minutes later waiting to be traded for a real metal cd. I listened to this album, and it was horrible as well. I think the warehouses made an error on the tags because it reads \\"Rock/Metal.\\" However, I kept my mouth shut about them. Then one of your fellow dream theatre fans named                                              Jeremy Brackeen \\"themetalbeast\\"    <br />had to go and slam Until the End by Kittie. How can you call these sad vocals that for some reason remind me of \\"death cab for cutie\\" metal vocals? This album is horrible. This band is horrible. No wonder they are so popular, the masses always seem to like crap. If you say this is metal, you must like A7X, Chaimera, Atreyu, Bloodsimple, and maybe the Backstreet Boys.  Listen to real metal that you can actually bang your head to, not elevator music.

0743442539|5.0|This was my first book to read in the top 10 bestsellers of the year I was born, 1964.  Wow, what a compelling read!  I didn't know what I was in store for.  At first, I thought it started slow, but it increased from there and built till the climactic ending!  If you haven't read this book, you should!  It is a fantastic spy story.  I saw the movie shortly after reading this with Robert Mitchum, who played a wonderful lead in the story.  This should be a must for everyone above the age of 15, even if it is just for education purposes but is is exciting as well!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I'm not really sure what else I can say about this movie. There are some intelligent reviews here that cover much of what I'd like to say. At some level, I guess, it's just a matter of adding my affirmation to what others have said. My most enthusiastic affirmation. This is a great film. It's not great just because the acting is good. Though it is. It's not great just because the cinematography is wonderful. Though it is. It's not great just because it puts a taboo subject on the big screen at a time when Americans need to face a whole variety of realities about themselves. Though you bet it does that too.  <br /> <br />It's great because the story just makes sense. Annie Proulx has looked into an unfortunate aspect of American culture - our reticence to acknowledge that love and affection doesn't fit into easy, cultural-correct cubicles - and she's told a story that in one way or another must have been lived and relived again and again by a great many people. All the characters in this movie get full and sympathetic treatment. Yes, that begins with Ennis and Jack, but it goes beyond them to include everyone unfortunate enough to be caught up in the repressive society this film details. They're all victims - wives and children included. And it just makes sense! You can totally understand why people would live the lives these characters do, unable to love themselves or those around them naturally, because of pressures from a close-minded, fearful society.  <br /> <br />I came home from this film wondering if other actors could've done a better job than Ledger and Gyllenhaal, only to find an old Mel Gibson movie on the box. I was painfully aware of how poor an actor someone like Gibson is in comparison to these two young, talented men. I was also painfully aware of how brave they are, and how someone like Gibson would never have done a film like this. It actually makes me - usually a cynic when it comes to Hollywood - enthusiastic about the future of mainstream American filmmaking. Every now and then we get something right. Brokeback Mountain is one of those times.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|I think this movie is very interesting in two ways. <br />Firstly, every one of us can be the victim of the \\"jigsaw\\". The characters in this movie were captured by the \\"jigsaw\\" because of the mistakes which they committed in the past.?Everybody makes mistakes and tend to dismiss the importance of one's precious life. <br />Secondly, everyone can be the \\"jigsaw\\". Violence depicted on this film makes us feel very badly, but sometimes you find yourself being in empathy with the violent character.  <br />This movie is very violent and aggressive, but it makes us think about the importance of life.
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|\\"Mogambo\\" (1953) is a good film with an excellent ending that makes you want to watch it again. Of course, the great cast and the place where the story was filmed help, and a lot.<br /><br />This movie was directed by John Ford, and filmed in Africa. The plot is simple, but quite effective. Victor Marswell (Clark Gable) is a safari guide whose like is disrupted when a beautiful woman, Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner), shows up at his camp, looking for a majarajah. Unfortunately for her, her \\"acquaintance\\" has left and she has to remain in the camp at least until the next boat arrives. Eloise starts to fall for Victor, and their attraction seems mutual, but not meant to be.<br /><br />However, things are further stirred up when a couple, Professor Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly) arrive to Victor?s complex for a safari. The problem is that now Eloise likes Victor, Victor is attracted to Linda, and Linda has feelings for Victor but is married to Donald, who is not aware of what is happening around him and is only interested in looking for gorillas.<br /><br />Of course, that situation is a good recipe for entertainment. Throw in a great scenery and some wild animals, and you have a very entertaining movie. All in all, I give this movie 3.5 stars, and I think it is worthwhile to recommend it  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Steven Spielberg's \\"Munich\\" certainly polarized filmgoers; many found Spielberg's film to be anti-Israeli and many others felt it was anti-Arabic. In truth Spielberg didn't take sides and neither did writers Tony Kushner (\\"Angels in America\\") and Eric Roth; Spielberg's film is a complex look at the cost of violence and murder. Avener (Eric Bana)and his team of former Mosad members (Daniel Craig the new James Bond, Hans Zischler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheu Kassovitz)discover that the cost of violence is the loss of your soul as they try and track down members of the terrorist group Black September that planned the kidnapping and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Over the course of a year Avner and his men hunt down these men while becoming the hunted as well. It's a riveting thriller with strong performances from the entire cast. Brilliantly directed by Spielberg \\"Munich\\" may run about 15 minutes too long but this powerful suspense film never wavers or loses its momentum as it thunders towards its conclusion. For those who claim that \\"Munich\\" ripped off its plot from the TV movie \\"Sword of Gideon\\" it should be noted that both are based on the same book and the scenes that have the most similarity are those that are drawn from the book.<br /><br />The transfer looks terrific with the subdued colors and fine detail captured in perfectly on disc. While occasional digital flaws come up (such as edge enhancement) they are minor and only crop up on occasion. I'm at a loss as to why Universal and Dreamworks have elected to release this in the same configuration as the \\"War of the Worlds\\" DVD late last year. More than likely it's due to reduce the cost of the discs since many retailers offer these big blockbusters as loss leaders to get people into stores and this would allow the studio to create economical versions that won't eat into their profit margins too much.<br /><br />The single disc edition has only a introduction by Steven Spielberg and some trailers as the only extras. The two disc edition although it lacks a commentary track from Spielberg (to date he hasn't done any)does feature a number of interesting featurettes. They don't make up for the lack of a comprehensive documentary on the real event (the best documentary on the Munich assassinations is \\"One Day in September\\")or a commentary track by Spielberg and/or the writers who worked on the film but are pretty good overall.<br /><br />\\"Memories of an Event\\" presents Spielberg and Kushner recalling their reactions when they heard about what occurred. \\"Portrait of an Era\\" provides insight and information about recreating the early 70's for the film. \\"The On-Set Experience\\" gives us onset footage of the shooting of the film. \\"The International Cast\\", \\"Editing, Sound and Music\\" gives us insight into both the casting for the film and why Spielberg went with the choices he did (for example Spielberg had been thinking about Bana after seeing \\"Hulk\\") and \\"Editing, Sound and Music\\" takes us into the post-production of the film. It was done on an extremely tight schedule because of the predetermined release date and post-production of \\"War of the Worlds\\". \\"The Mission, The Team\\" focuses on the genesis of the script, Spielberg's interest through production. We also get a collectable booklet with photos and rave review quotes from critics.<br /><br />While the 2 disc edition isn't essential it will be a nice catch for fans of the film and those into the film process.

B00005JOVN|5.0|People, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!!!!  I just got back from seeing Poseidon, and it was awesome.  You couldn't ask for more action in a film than this.  Every second is filled with action, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.   <br /> <br />As for people complaining about bad acting, bad plot, etc, I'm just wondering if they saw this same movie I did or just making crap up. The acting was top notch in here.  Overall, the entire cast gave excellent performances, but  with the 2 main standouts being Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas.  They were perfect for the roles they played in this type of movie.  Whoever did the casting, I give you credit.  You really know how to pick your people.  Oh, and Richard Dreyfuss is getting really old yes, but he shows he can still do some heavy action stuff. And as for the plot,  yes, there is one.  A big giant wave crashes into a big ship,  people are hurt and killed, and a few try to find a way to escape, and they do.  There you go.  And what did you want, another Titanic, which runs about 3 hours long.  Heck no, I would think not.  This movie runs a good short 98 minutes, so you can't really complain about that.  The movie does not drag on, and gets to the action right away. <br /> <br />So all in all, I highly recommend this action masterpiece to everyone who enjoys an awesome action movie filled with stunning visual effects and scenery.  You can really tell that the 140 million budget for this film was used all the way and was not a waste.  Great acting, great visual effects, great cast, great plot, overall GREAT!  Go see.  You will not be disappointed!! :)
006054094X|2.0|Hello,    Many things are not simply \\"anything is possible\\" but no \\"hitting the nail in the head\\" fact, although the author Gavin Menzies made a lot of money out of his book without any fact on the discovery of America by the Chinese around then already. Myself as a scientist would say enough is enough after years of professional education and training. There are many issues involve here and one would have to stay true to the science of things to realised all. For example, Asian in America could have happened before the gold rush in California, could have been centuries ago, but not necessary 1418 or within that 100 years +/- time frame. so DNA testing doesn't prove anything really except the fact that there are people with the Asian blood, the rest is just stories rand tales really. The recent discovered map is a \\"claimed\\" copy of the original 1418 map, where is the 1418 map? Someone's claim something doesn't mean that it is necessary true. I have seen fakes going way back to many centuries ago as there were already people who would buy something with a big fake artist name on it, Japanese included, such as Masamune made Japanese sword. I have seen an early map by about a dozen years and it looks way off from this 1418 version. THE KEY TO PROVE ANYTHING IS TO HAVE A REAL 1418 MAP, and without it everything is just pure fraction. Remember, anything after the Columbus discovery of America doesn't count, as that is the very date that the knowledge of Asia, Europe and America had been established, words and map could be passed on from that point on. Gavin Menzies needs to find evidence(s) that the very same fleet that he spoke of was doing what he said they were to prove his own point, and all the existing material doesn't suggest so even for another 100 plus years after 1418. Also, any evidence could have been planted at a later date, such as plant, animal, even artifact of the Ming Dynasty, he would need a real boat that there is in no other way could have got thereotherwise, with natural deposit on it from the nature aging of material nearby in the very same location. Chinese could have been all over the place even way before 1418, who knows? But those doesn't make it a America discovery, those could have been done pre-historically. It make more sense if he name his book as who landed on America first and yet went back home to report such finding, but as for discovery and documentation, once again, need evidence.    Also, there were a whole lot more going on at that period of time if Chinese history is being looked at by many more folds, not just the money, but also the politics at the time. The issue in here stays the same, did he or did he not accomplished so much as claimed and if so, where is the evidence? Also, I do not have any problem with the idea of the size of the treasure junk after seeing the Great Wall of China, or the Yamato from Japan during WWII, or the size of the pier, and I am so sick and tired of Chinese burning all the books every so many hundred years, but proves settle all things and where is it?    Here is a link to the 1402 so called world map from China:    [...]     Can you see the huge difference? Does it even occur to anybody that the so called claimed to be a copy of the 1418 map looks just like the centuries later European world map, with many updates on the description (I happen to read classical Chinese perfectly) with the name North America and South America (after Chinese translation) seems to be a little TOO ORIGINAL for any professional view point?    In order to go from the 1402 map to the \\"claimed\\" 1418 map, plus to receive acceptance of earth as being round, plus figuring out drawing the whole world map as 2 connected circles on a flat surface without stating that it is in fact a representation of 2 half hemispheres joined together, and yet it wasn't represented as a whole square shape map similar to the 1402 map without the circular cut out, it only suggest that the 1418 map is highlyunlikely for real, more of a hoax at the time, but not entirely impossible and yet there is not one solid proof.    I could only wish I watched the PBS show early enough to end this hypothesis (NOT a theory or a fact without any proof) so that no one would even have to waste any money to make some nut case rich.    Kind regards,    Tony Ng (San Francisco)
B000EULJLU|3.0|Much better than most music in Tool's genre, but for a band this talented, a very lackluster album.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Fresh from their 2001 masterpiece \\"Mutter\\", German industrial metal merchants Rammstein return with a bang with their phenomenally epic 2004 masterpiece entitled \\"Reise, Reise\\". Not a single word can truly describe how phenomenal this album is. From beginning to end, this album will no doubt take you on an epic breathtaking journey that you'll leave you breathless, and sometimes bring tears to your eyes. Every song on here is simply awesome. Till Lindemann's vocals are just absolutely awesome and very enchanting. Paul Landers and Richard Z. Kruspe-Bernstein's guitar riffs are tight, crisp, and very menacing. Doktor Christian Lorenz's keyboardwork is great, and Oliver Riedel's bass, and Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider's drumming are all good as well.<br /><br />Favorite songs include -<br /><br />1. Reise, Reise: The opening title track, and my all time favorite song on here. No words can describe how much I love this song. The chorus is very addicting. It just brings tears to my eyes whenever it sinks into my brain.<br /><br />2. Mein Teil: The first single off the album I believe, and a hard hitter as well. Till's vocals are very aweome on here. Great song.<br /><br />5. Los: This song has a bluesy like accoustic riff throughout. Pretty cool song.<br /><br />6. Amerika: Another one of my favorite songs, and a catchy headbanger. The chorus on this song is sung in English which I believe is a first for Rammstein. There's even a solo on this song which is pretty cool.<br /><br />7. Moskau: This song has another headbanging beat that is very catchy throughout, and the chorus will stay stuck in your head for days. I like the guest female vocals on here too.<br /><br />10. Ohne Dich: The chorus and the keyboard riff on this song brings tears to my eyes whenever I hear it. Another one of my favorites.<br /><br />The whole song list and ratings:<br /><br />1. Reise, Reise - 10/5<br /><br />2. Mein Teil - 5/5<br /><br />3. Dalai Lama - 5/5<br /><br />4. Keine Lust - 5/5<br /><br />5. Los - 5/5<br /><br />6. Amerika - 5/5<br /><br />7.

B000E1155E|5.0|This album makes me glad I ignore the hype because I would never have listened to this album if I had really given time to all the stuff people had to say about these boys from Britain. It is a good album and the Artic Monkeys should be one to watch in the future I wont compare them to anyone and I wont try to convince you but give them a listen and see what you think. Two Thumbs Up!
6305907145|2.0|As previous reviewers have mentioned, this is simply NOT Jane's Austen's book.  Some major plotpoints were taken, period costumes were added, and then the 20th century actresses with anorectic bodies, and smirky nasty attitudes were added, and we have a very nasty mess indeed.  Yes, I mean the same Frances O'Connor who was so blank as the dream/mother in A.I.  Clearly the Director's fault however, as he lets her raise eyebrows in sexual knowing and all but have a lesbian moment with almost twin co-star Embeth Davidz.  It is really apalling for any Austen fan.<br />  The entire focus on slavery is not mentioned at ALL in the book, and is misplaced in Austen.  There is only one mention of business in the islands, and that could have been many many  things.  It is indicative of the film author's and Director's desire to focus on the most venal and debased part of human nature.  That too, is not Austen.<br />  So... what rates 2 stars?  The production values are wonderful.  Costumes, sets, but especially the cinematography is a high mark.  The spinning, soaring visual breaks set the mental set of a young girl who is literally made dizzy by the world she is \\"out of place\\" in.  Unfortunately, it is not carried through in the choice of actress or direction.<br />  A brilliant, memorable and completely right casting choice is the double-casting of Lindsay Duncan as both sisters, Fanny's Aunt and mother, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Price.  This is modernized Austen, and therefore, not Austen at all.  It holds it own just barely... but if you are going to update the mental set of a piece, you really need to set it in modern day.  Boo Hiss.<br />  (If I may say, the herione of the slow but thorough BBC miniseries, Sylvestra Le Touzel, is badly treated by some.  She is halting and odd, somewhat irritating in her fish out of water -ness, but it is completely RIGHT for Fanny.  Fanny is one of Austen's least appealing heroines, but her purity of heart redeems her.)<br />  Update: 5/19/07 - I watched this again last night.  While I sill stand by what I said before, I should add that, taken completely on it's own, this film is entertaining and stands up well, and remains glorious to look at.  The performances are all very fine within the mental set mentioned above.  I'd also like to add that Victoria Hamilton gives a beautiful performance as troubled and bothersome Maria, and looks the most lovely she has ever looked. Overall a fine production, just... not Jane's book.  So...maybe it's a three,.. and if you liked the awful Kiera Knightly version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", this is much better.watched this again last night.

0385513755|5.0|I decided to read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown because I'm a follower of the Catholic religion.  Many Catholics were upset by the way Dan Brown portrayed the Catholic religion and did not agree with the information pertaining to the Holy Grail. This book was  historical fiction . So the story was made up but the facts were real.  In the book the, the Curator of the Louvre Museum and member of Priory of  Sion (a secret society who protects the Holy Grail) Jacques Sauniere is found murdered. Through clues left behind by Jacques, Robert Langdon ( a symbolist) and Sophie Neveu (the granddaughter of Jacques and a French cryptologist) try to solve the murder and through that save the mystery of the Holy Grail.  They travel throughout Europe while being chased by the police and the people who are a part of Opus Day trying  find out about the  Holy Grail. Some of the clues were found  in Leonardo Da Vinci's works, there go the title, The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br /> I liked this book for many reasons.  First of all, it had many religious controversial point of views.  Being born and raised Catholic I learned many new things about the different groups that are part of the Catholic Church. . The biggest one Opius Day, which is a controversial group within the Catholic Church. The book portrays this  group as a cult where men have the hierarchy over women,  and where self mutilation is used as a  discipline. Many Catholics disagree because Opius Day is not a cult and it is just a small part of the Catholic Church. The book basically makes the Catholics out as bad people. This is why most Catholics do not like The Da Vinci Code. I myself as a Catholic was not offended by this, but it made me second guess my religion. The book was also controversial with other Christians not jusmade me second guess my religion. Towards the end of the book I was against most of the beliefs that the Catholics believed in the book.  The book was also Controversial with other Christians.  Not just Catholics. For the simple fact that it implies that Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdeline and out of this relationship a child was conceived. In the bible Mary Magdeline was portrayed as a prostitute, and Christ was consider to be single and never to have had relations with a woman. It goes against the bible and the Christian faith in general. The book  also suggests that the Dead Sea Scrolls was a book of the Bible, that was never included in the Bible or got left out. This is controversial because it would change the Christian faith. I like the controversy of this book because it made me think outside the box. I was always taught not to question my faith and to believe what I was told. Then this book comes along and makes me think that there could be other possibilities out there.  When I got done reading it I didn't want to be Catholic anymore.<br /><br /> The second reason I like this book was because  I was presented with new knowledge.  In this book I learned about art, symbolism , and religion. The most important thing I learned was about the Holy Grail. From what I've been told in the past, and what has been portrayed in movies such as, Indian Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Arc, the Holy Grail is a the Chalis that was used by Christ in the last super. In the book, the Holy Grail is the Lineage of Christ. Which some believe are the ancestors of  Christ.  Some believe that to this day living in France are these ancestors of Christ.  I also learned about the symbolism in Leonardo Da Vinci's painting. For example in Leonardo's painting \\"The Last Supper\\" it is supposedly Mary Magdeline sited next to Christ and that the way their seated in the painting their bodies form a V which is the symbol for Femininity. Which goes against the Catholic belief that men and woman are equal in the Catholic Church. I learned more about the life of Da Vinci. Like how he was part of the Priory of Sion. I also learned that many famous artist and writers were also apart ofthe Priory, like Sir Isaac Newton, and Victor Hugo.<br /><br /> I did not like how the book did not follow a consecutive partner. Dan Brown did not men are higher then women when it comes to the Catholic Church. I learned more about the life of Da Vinci himself.  Like how he was part of the Priory of Sion, the secrect society who protects the Holy Grail. I also learned that other famous artist and writers were apart of the Priory, like Sir Isaac Newton, and Victor Hugo.<br /><br /> I did not like how the book did not follow a consecutive pattern. Dan Brown did not do a good job of intertwining the historical part and the story. The story paused a lot to go into the explanation of the historical facts, or to explain pictures or writings that clues came in. In some parts it was very hard to follow.  I also didn't like how if you weren't familiar with all the different painting that were discussed then it was hard to picture them and you could get lost easily. When Dan Brown explained the Paintings you would have to interrupt the book and try picture the painting in your head.  The book also started off very slow, which would cause some people to put it down and not finish it. Which would be a shame because later on the book becomes intriguing. It was also hard to separate fiction from fact.  I could not tell the difference between a point of view or an actual occurrence. While I was reading the book I thought that every aspect of it was true. This caused me to think that the strong Catholic views portrayed in the book were all true.

Dan Brown did not men are higher then women when it comes to the Catholic Church. I learned more about the life of Da Vinci himself.  Like how he was part of the Priory of Sion, the secrect society who protects the Holy Grail. I also learned that other famous artist and writers were apart of the Priory, like Sir Isaac Newton, and Victor Hugo. <br /> I did not like how the book did not follow a consecutive pattern. Dan Brown did not do a good job of intertwining the historical part and the story. The story paused a lot to go into the explanation of the historical facts, or to explain pictures or writings that clues came in. In some parts it was very hard to follow.  I also didn't like how if you weren't familiar with all the different painting that were discussed then it was hard to picture them and you could get lost easily. When Dan Brown explained the Paintings you would have to interrupt the book and try picture the painting in your head.  The book also started off very slow, which would cause some people to put it down and not finish it. Which would be a shame because later on the book becomes intriguing. It was also hard to separate fiction from fact.  I could not tell the difference between a point of view or an actual occurrence. While I was reading the book I thought that every aspect of it was true. This caused me to think that the strong Catholic views portrayed in the book were all true. When really some were true and some were fictional. <br /> All in all I loved this book and gained more than what I expected out of it.

B000ETQRCM|3.0|Pearl Jam is my favorite band, I have loved every album. However this album is a huge let down. With the addition of Matt Cameron from Soundgarden you could hear a blending of sounds on the last album, exemplified by the haunting \\"You Are.\\" I was hoping for this to continue. It did not. After the reviews I read prior to the release I expected another brilliant album from Pearl Jam however after listening to the album more than a few times (I really wanted to love this album), many of the songs sound as if Pearl Jam has become an adult contemporary band. Each album before has been a building block: the wonderful culturally symbolic lyrics of \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.,\\" the distorted \\"grunge\\" of \\"Vitaology,\\" the sonically rich experimentation of \\"No Code,\\" \\"Yield,\\" and \\"Binarual,\\" and the mystery of \\"Riot Act.\\" None of that growth can be seen here. It's as if they forgot everything they did in the last 15 years. I've read reviews that say this album goes back to what Pearl Jam was at \\"Ten,\\" what they don't say is that none of the songs have the tension and energy of any of the songs on that album. The complex interplay between Stone and Mike is also lacking, something that I've grown to love in the past. It's kind of like \\"Ten-lite.\\" <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong there are some gems on this album \\"Parachutes,\\" and \\"Gone,\\" however most people don't buy Pearl Jam albums for gems, the albums are gems. This album is more like a piece of coal. I don't regret buying the album but in a few weeks I think I'll only be hearing it as it randomly passes on my iPod's shuffle function.
6301966562|5.0|After all of the movies I have seen converted and released to DVD why this one has been overlooked is beyond me.  It is one of my all time favorites and every once in a while I do a search in hopes that someone has released it to DVD. There is just a timelessness to it that even though it was done in the eighties it still has a modern feel to it. I will not give up hope---
B00000JCB2|1.0|The late 1990s were one of the worst times ever for popular music and this CD is from the bottom of the barrel. Limp Bizkit had the crazy idea that all you need to do to sell records is record some awful \\"rapping\\" over loud guitars and add a lot of swearing to sound tough. Funny thing is - it worked, at least on the business side, and far too many people bought this stuff. This belongs in the used CD bin with releases from Korn, Powerman 5000, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback.
B00005JOUM|3.0|As always, Denzel Washington is fantastic, though maybe a little over-the-top. The rest of the main cast, particularly Owen, Plummer and Foster, all put in great performances.<br /><br />The story is about a bank robbery/hostage situation. It's got something of The Usual Suspects twist, but it's hardly that original or surprising.<br /><br />In some ways, it's almost as spoof of bank robbery/hostage movies. The greatest film in that category, Dog Day Afternoon is even referenced in this movie.<br /><br />Lest I be misunderstood, this is a very entertaining film.  As art, however, it lacks some depth.  It's probably worth the full price of admission, but it's not so stellar that you'd be missing out by waiting for it to hit the video stores.<br /><br />3.5 stars. The good acting and suspense save it from its lack of originality.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Fast and furious from beginning to end. Deserves to be regarded on the same level as Master of Puppets.
B000002B5L|5.0|Aight, I just bought this album a couple of days ago.  I was sitting in my room listening to the radio, and I hated some of the mainstream hiphop that they were playing.  I needed a old school hiphop group that i could listen to.  So i went out and bought the Fugees cd cuz i heard their stuff from the past, and thought they were fresh, so i bought it.  I dont know what the hell took me so long to go buy this record.  This is possibly one of my top 10 albums of all time.  I think that the old school beats, the lyrics, the flow of the group is crazy fly.  I think that all hip hop fans should go cop this album right now, if you dont already have it.  This is no doubt a classic album, one of the best of all time.  If you want a old school real hiphop album, this is one that you should go buy.
B000002USN|2.0|I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew.  Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value.  This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It totally blows my mind that people are still whining about how Pearl Jam no longer sound like they did on Ten. Well that was only fifteen years and eight albums ago. (Plus two compilations and about 150 live albums.) Well here's a new flash, genius &#8211; the only Pearl Jam album that sounds like Ten is Ten. They quickly left the power grunge behind and turned to a garage/classic rock focus, while leaving the flannel kids stuck in a 1991 time warp. Besides, they're in their forties now, and long ago grew bored with what they were doing in their mid-twenties. For the rest of us who can appreciate the developing talent and vision of serious musicians, not to mention the passage of time, Pearl Jam has now delivered the strongest of their latter-day \\"mature\\" albums.<br /><br />After a few rather dreary albums, Pearl Jam seems to have gotten their spark back, and maybe the critics are right in crediting the current political situation. The best rockers on this album, such as \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"Comatose,\\" and \\"Severed Hand\\" have a crunch that hasn't been heard since No Code. Even a few of the slow-burners, especially \\"Gone\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" (which features the first-ever lyrics from Mike McCready) have a sense of menace that hasn't been present in Pearl Jam's ballads since &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; Ten. And believe it or not, Eddie Vedder is still developing as a singer and lyricist, as he finds more and more subtle ways to convey every emotion from righteous anger to solemn empathy. This new album is a return to form that will satisfy serious Pearl Jam fans and lovers of real rock. There's not an ounce of grunge here &#8211; and there shouldn't be. [~doomsdayer520~]
0345440900|5.0|I can't believe some of the bad reviews about this book.  It is my baby bible and I recommend it to first-time parents.  Tracy Hogg was a registered nurse from England, specializing in children with mental disabilities. She became especially in-tune with her patients' body language because they lacked verbal skills.  She came to the USA, became a private baby nurse and found that her skills were also applicable to infants.  All in all she had 25 years of experience with countless babies.  Yes, the author does \\"classify\\" childrens' personalities (I read other reviews bashing this).  This helped me understand my anxious child and how to help her cope. <br /> <br />I had never been around babys and felt overwhelmed the 1st two months after my baby came.  She had nights/days mixed up, feeding issues and there was lots of crying on both our parts.  This book changed our lives!  In two weeks I had her sleeping 6 hours at two-months-old (thanks to the Dream Feed) and I didn't have to let her \\"cry it out\\".  I learned how to stop, look, listen, before picking her up when she cried so I could connect with her and read the physical cues she was giving me.    I learned how to set boundaries for her as she got older, while still showing her respect.  Now she is a confident 3 yr old who loves to sleep in her own bed. <br />  <br />Some lucky folks seem to have that natural parent instinct or were fortunate enough to have lots of experience with children --  they won't get much from this book.  I did not fit into this category.  This book quickly tought me the ropes and helped me be the mommy I always hoped I'd be.
0060581808|5.0|\\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" gives a picturesque look at pioneer life, including methods of food preparation and storage that are now mostly a lost art.  Laura and her sisters help Ma and Pa make cheeses and put them up to ripen, slaughter a pig and turn it into all sorts of delicacies (they used every part of the pig except the squeal), and tap trees for syrup when the \\"sugar snow\\" appears.  During the bitterly cold Wisconsin winter nights, Pa entertains the family with stories and his fiddle.  Laura has only a corncob for a doll, but she is satisfied with it.  What a difference from the life of the average American girl today!

B000001GAM|5.0|I am writing this review immediately after having listened to this immense work.  I have realized much about this symphony after this hearing even though I have heard the symphony many times, and I will leave out many things that came to me while listening to this symphony but here goes.  Bruckner's 9th is by far one of the most intense and personal symphonies ever written.  It is his most advanced and modernistic work, however like all his other symphonies one can hear archaic and bygone sounds; for Bruckner and his music sometimes seem to be anachronistic.  In his counterpoint the listener can hear pre-Romantic music and this is one of the reasons why I love his symphonies.  The adagio of Mahler's 9th was clearly influenced by Bruckner's last adagio.  Just compare the opening phrases and the last few bars of each adagio.  Of all his symphonies Bruckner's 9th displays the man...the human being most clearly.  It is a testament to the human condition, but particularly Bruckners'.  The first movement contains much despair and anguish, and we must immediately recall that Bruckner was writing this symphony during the most troubling part of his life.  His 8th had been rejected and his health was failing him- I encourage all who would listen to Bruckner's 9th to pick up some books and become familiar with his life.  Death, doubt, despair permeate this work.  The work embodies subjectivity.  Then comes the scherzo.  The originality of this movement is amazing and its content can be terrifying. I interpreted this movement as the \\"demons\\" or psychological plagues which Bruckner endured throughout his life and particularly during this time.  The incessantly repetitive rhythms and notes portray this most vividly.  Lastly we have the adagio and again comes the anguish, fear, and sadness.  But then after the first few minutes we hear a most unexpected fortissimo major chord, which banishes all darkness-perhaps Bruckner's faith in God is displayed here.  When I first heard this part I thought It might be the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. Finally we get the ever pressing feeling at the closing notes of the adagio that there is no resolution, only acceptance and perhaps some hope.  Bear in mind Mahler's closing notes as they seem to indicate the same feeling.        Bruckner left a some parts of the finale and its coda unfinished, therefore the finale can never be exactly what Bruckner would have written, despite noble attempts at a reconstruction.  However I believe what music we do have(in the finale) should be used in recordings and concerts. For Bruckner would most likely never have approved of performances with just three movements. That being said this is still my favorite Bruckner 9th performance, until I hear one with the reconstructed finale and with the first 3 movements played with equal or surpassing beauty and power. There is so much that can be said about this symphony in fact I'd love to write a book on it.  Bruckner's 8th and 9th are in my opinion the most profound, intense, and beautiful symphonies ever written.  I have left out any mention of the objective values of this symphony since I am merely a layman, however I am sure they are many. Truly this symphony is Bruckner's soul bared before us, and like all great art it affects us so greatly because we can relate to it- and furthermore It speaks directly of the human condition.      Now for a review of the album.  When I first heard this version of the Ninth I immediately felt that it was the superlative reading.  However I have not heard many other recordings.  Guilini and his orchestra play absolutely magnificently.  Again words do not describe the performance.  I recommend this recording to anyone who wishes to experience Bruckner and great art.  So stop reading and go listen, for music like this can truly only be heard and felt! 5 Stars in the sky do not equal the grandeur, breadth and power of Bruckner's 9th symphony.
0451529065|1.0|This mans theories have been taken too far. Sure he wrote the book well but the content is laughable. In order to prove the theory proposed, he requires future findings of fossils that, to this day, haven't been found yet. 1/5 Stars for Charlie.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|after hearing foxy foxy a couple of times i went out to buy this cd, and let me tell you..you won't make a mistake by buying it. although i don't think its quite like rob's other albums..it rocks but its not exactly rob zombie. as soon as american witch kicks off on your cd player you'll be thinking, this cd is kickass! if you are like me though, it might take a while to get used to.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Tool is one of the most important bands of the 21st century. This album, while good (compared to other progressive bands, like 10 Years), pales in comparison with Tool's earlier work. Lateralus, for example, is arguably one of the greatest albums in rock history. Somehow, 10,000 Days seems a little flat and self-conscious. \\"Vicarious\\" will get a lot of radio play, but the album lacks the provocative, edgy, ground-breaking qualities of Tool. The stereoscopic packaging is annoying and very hard to store.
0440237688|5.0|I really enjoyed Lois Lowry's The Giver because Lowry uses a variety of literary techniques that contribute to the overall style and meaning of the novel.  Imagery, metaphors, symbolism, irony, style, and language are a few of the devices used to create this piece of science fiction literature.  Science fiction novels, in general, involve some sort of technology and often pertain to the relationship between man and society. The Giver portrays these characteristics very obviously and, therefore, is placed in the science fiction genre.  In this case, the technology is so far advanced, that inhabitants of the city, in The Giver, no longer have to worry about problems that are contained in the \\"memories\\" such as pain, fear, and warfare.  As a downside to this, they also cannot experience all the wonderful feelings and emotions of the past, such as love, color, exuberance, or immense joy.  Society has decided that \\"sameness\\" is how the city will survive and endure.  If everyone is the same (personality and routine), no one will argue, and virtually there will be no major complications.  This style of living became habitual for the citizens and they eventually knew no other way to live. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|2.0|I've been a RHCP fan forever - have loved everything they've done (with a minor execption of One Hot Minute, which was mediocre). I thought By The Way was superb, and have been waiting on Stadium Arcadium for years. Well, it's here, and it quite simply stinks. I am shocked and amazed at how bad this compilation is. Dani California is a rip-off of Tom Petty's 'Mary Jane's Last Dance', and is surprisingly the best song on either cd. Of the 28 songs, only 4 others I would categorize as 'decent' songs - not great but decent enough to listen to. The other 23 songs are dull, lackluster, and void of 'IT'. 'IT' is what the Chili Peppers have always seemed to have in their music, but not this time. 'IT' is gone. I heard Anthony say that this is the 1st time the 4 of them have been together to record a new cd where they were all happy and had nothing wrong with thier lives. Well, that is all good, and I'm very happy for them, but these songs reflect this state. There is no ATTITUDE in any of their new music, making each song seem fluffy, over-produced, and (I hate to say) BORRING! If you are having problems sleeping at night, just put in Stadium Arcadium - it is sure to get you sawing logs in a hurry. I've been forced to see the bright side...  The best thing about Stadium Arcadium is that by this lame effort being released, it just makes it all that much closer to their next CD coming out in a few years. I for one will be looking forward to it, and will buy it, because I love these guys, and I have faith they will make a triumphant comeback.  Sorry RHCP, but I call 'em like I see 'em.
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black is an Album I did not hear until I was 15 and that was a cassette, since then I have purchased three CD versions of the album because my friends have always liked stealing that album.  Honestly, who could blame them?  Back in black is one of the greatest selling albums of all time and is stilling selling, partly because friends keep stealing them and overuse.  Back in Black made me a life time AC/DC fan.  Yes sadly I was introduced to Brian Johnson before Bon Scott, but that is alright I still love them equally like a father loves his children the same.      There will be girls shaking their thighs to You Shook Me for another 20 years to come.  Have a Drink on Me from the opening rifts is an amazing tribute to Brian Johnson from the boys.  The rest of the album is cleverly woven with songs in my opinion meant to either incite a fight or sex.  The sound is powerful yet sexy at the same time.  Let Me Put My Love into You, Giving the Dog a Bone and What do you do for Money Honey are vulgar but the women still love them.  Angus Young is probably one of the most underrated guitar players of all time.
B000002BYD|4.0|<br />This is without a doubt one of my favorite PJ efforts. It's dirty, thoughtful, rhythmic, pounding and it rocks. <br /> <br />To many cuts to mention, but the openning 4 tracks amaze. And from there, things only evolve.  <br /> <br />This is a mature progression that I for some reason want to \\"group\\" with Vitology and No Code. I liked those very much as well, but this to me is superior. <br /> <br />The recording has a \\"flow\\". Each song makes the other even better. Vedder's lyrics are insightful and most importantly...the music makes me \\"feel\\". <br /> <br />\\"In Hiding\\" and \\"Pilate\\" are my dark horses. <br /> <br />Fans of PJ who have not yet gotten this...wait a minute no more.

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow set a very high standard for herself with her previous CDs.  Even if C'mon, C'mon doesn't quite live up to that lofty standard, it is still a 5-star, excellent album.  She sings with tons of energy.  The songs provide a nice range from slow country-like ballad to the quick, driven opening track.  The songs at both ends of the spectrum are well written, well sung and highly enjoyable.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well I must say this is quite the listen.  I for one haven't \\"forced\\" myself to like 10,000 days...mainly because I had a similar experience with Lateralus, where it took awhile before I could wrap my head around the songs.  But strangely as others have said, this thing unfolds and really blossoms in your brain over time.  If you give it the chance of course.  I really pity the folks who've hastily judged it as crap and now probably won't ever be able to really hear the thing, mainly because their ego will get in the way and not allow them to consider the possibility that OOPS maybe they were wrong. <br /> <br />I tried not to have any expectations about this album, mainly 'cause Tool is on their own trip and I think they're the most important rock band of our time.  So, might as well respect their musical vision, right?  Some people on here act like Tool owes them something.  I feel the other way 'round, these guys just keep giving and giving.  I don't know how they did it but they topped Lateralus, with a very different, very personal, and DEEP record.  AND WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR (Rosetta Stoned).  Classic.  Give it a spin on GOOD reference-quality headphones.  Light-years beyond their earlier albums.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|People honestly I dont understand wtf is up with the negative reviews. I've listened to this album maybe 15 times through since I bought it on the day it was released and I cannot hear what you guys are griping at. Personally, I discard the rest of the Chili Peppers work when I listen to this because it's a totally different sound. I take it for what it is and that is truly great rock music. I agree with some other revies I have read that say this could be the best rock album in the last 20 years. To me, this blows away the other RHCP albums because it moves the band in an alltogether new direction. These arent the same wild, uncontrollable, life of the party frat boy rockers of the late 80s and early 90s. With Stadium Arcadium, the Chili Peppers become mature rock artists with a genius to their music unmatched by any other band today. Every single song means something, whether you like the song or not. For me, I thought every song on the album was incredible but other people may have a few they dont like. I dont care about that. Its the 1 and 2 star reviews that I see saying that the album is full of fillers? How can you call these songs fillers? How can you complain about something so much just because it may be a little slower than the other albums? Do you really want a band to stay the same their entire duration? If thats the case then listen to a group like Linkin Park or Nickelback. Dont waste your money on something that you wont understand. In thirty years this album will still be talked about and considered a rock classic and you 1 and 2 star reviewers will look stupid. So keep them coming all of you \\"music experts\\" who think your doing the world a favor by letting people know that this isnt as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Im sure some people will take you seriously. I know a few people who WONT take you seriously though. They are the Red Hot Chili Peppers and they're never ever gonna get back to the sound of the late 80s and early 90s. That sound is goneand replaced by something BETTER and MORE MATURE. And theres nothing you complainers can do about it. I say keep it up Anthony and co. If this is your curtain call then its a truly incredibly way to end an incredible tenure as a staple of rock music for decades to come. If theres more where this came from then I'll be the first one to buy it and rock the s**t out of it. Thanks for some truly spectacular rock.  <br /> <br />For the record I have been a Chili Peppers fan since they started out in the early 80s. I love all their stuff but this definatley is the best yet. Not all of us hardcore, Chili Peppers fans are disappointed with this album.
B000002UAR|5.0|I was all of twelve years old when this album came out. My best friend Jeff Brown and I tagged along with his irritating older brother Steve to his best friend's house. Steve's best friend had the new album. We kicked back on the couch and got comfortable. Revolver started playing and I remember so clearly,as if it were yesterday,the feeling of amazement, joy, and pure happines as I fell under its spell. I truly look at it as sort of a mystical experience. Suddenly the world seemed full of endless possibilities. We listened to Rubber Soul as well and the effect was the same. Somehow Jeff was able to borrow both of these records and every chance I got I headed over to his house to have a listen. Carried away in our exuberance, we would often grab a couple of brooms and enthusiastically play along to the great songs. We became the Beatles!  <br />   Now, forty years have passed and I am 52 years old. I have, over the years, developed an appreciation for many other types of music. My 800+ CD collection is quite eclectic. I enjoy opera, classical music, world music, blues, classic and modern Jazz and of course a lot of classic and contemporary rock and pop. Yet nothing moves me as much, nothing awakens in me the pure joy of living, and gives me such a burst of sweet and simple happiness as listening to this incredible music of the Beatles. I've listened to this album thousands of times and I never tire of it. <br />  To those of you who have not made the journey yet, how I envy you! How I wish there was a magic pill that could erase my memory and let me hear this amazing music for the first time, second time and third time again. If you haven't heard Revolver yet, buy it and play it once a day for a week. Keep an open mind, and know that this music will still be played and loved a thousand years from now. Give in to the genius of The Beatles!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Wow...I got this CD when it came out in 2006, and was really not that crazy about it on the first few spins.  So, like a fine wine, I let it age in my collection and have been listening to it more in 08 and 09...and WOW.  I can fully understand a lot of the bad reviews from the fans, since all are compared to absolute classics (Aenima, Undertow, Lateralus) and yes, a lot of the songs don't seem to show us anything new or exciting on the Tool landscape.  I kind of regard this album as their 'Pink Floyd - Animals'.  Yep, the Floyd did a lot more 'accessible' and better stuff before Animals, and that CD is hardly the fan fave...but yet it has a certain element and history that cannot be ignored.      The bottom line is that this is not for the 'sound bite' world, as there are a lot of tracks that could easily be called 'filler'.  The real line is that this is really a 'concept' CD, and the hard and soft stuff really needs to be taken in as a 'musical journey'.  Vicarious is an absolute Tool classic, with all the signature riffs and Maynard vocalizations.  But overall, there are really no surprises sound-wise, as there are tracks that could have easily been part of Aenima or Lateralus.  Are the 'growing musically'...mmmm...tough one...hope so.      I am dying to see what Tool will give us next...in the meantime enjoy this one!

0553260111|4.0|Though I do not include Robert Ludlum among my favorite authors I have chosen to read The Bourne Identity since it was listed as a \\"must read\\" in a list compiled by fellow thriller authors and also had a good rating by readers from Amazon <br /> <br />The plot very long and convoluted with many storylines and associated subplots becomes a maze, forcing the reader to wonder many times and sometimes to read some pages more than one time to get a full comprehension of what is behind the events <br /> <br />Though there is a lot of action, the plot is focused on the main character Jason Bourne, a former top rank agent suffering from amnesia and rescued from the sea near France <br /> <br />Is Jason Bourne actually Jason Bourne?  <br />Who is behind Jason Bourne? What is behind Jason Bourne ? <br />Why Jason lost his memory? Why did they do that to Jason ? <br /> <br />The action is complemented with Bourne rival  colossal terrorist and international assassin Carlos, who felt challenged by Jason Bourne past activities and began to chase him around the globe to kill him in order to attain supremacy in his ruthless business <br /> <br />Another interesting point arises in the plot, will Carlos and Jason Bourne finally clash ? <br /> <br />Actions goes on mostly in Zurich, Paris and New York locations, involving Swiss banks secrecy laws, the CIA, French  Security Agencies, and US military clandestine organizations <br /> <br />The novel is exceedingly well written, however I did not thrill me the way I wanted (this is the magic I look for in the book) and that is why I took one star off. <br /> <br /> <br />
0385474547|4.0|Though the book was really interesting, the ending seemed to have had some holes in it. During the transition between the last two chapters, it seemed to have left something out that was important, it went from a high element of suspense, to an feeling of \\"what the heck just happend?!\\", to make the main character do something so tragic and then just to end the book in that fashion was disappointing.
6303020089|4.0|Ah, the hunt for the one armed, one<br /><br />legged, one eyed man. Whoops, other<br /><br />film! Seriously, the best Harrison<br /><br />Ford ever did and aside from JFK<br /><br />(and Men in Black [?] - just kidding)<br /><br />the best also for Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />Great from start to finish. EVEN<br /><br />the made for T.V., edited edition<br /><br />isn't much worse. That's rare to<br /><br />be abel to say that!
B0002S94OS|5.0|Actually, with this release, they have put themselves at the forefront of the present metal scene. <br /> <br />\\"As the Palaces Burn\\" made people aware of LOG. \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" puts LOG on the map permanently. LOG made a huge leap between these two discs -- not just signing with a major label, but in a musical sense. This is without a doubt the single most crushing album I have ever owned. It is absolutely relentless in its brutality and craftsmanship. From start to finish this album is as perfect as extreme metal can get. There are absolutely no weak links -- each song takes on the personality of the previous song and adds on to it. The CD just keeps getting better and better until it comes to a perfect end with \\"Remorse is for the Dead.\\" <br /> <br />What seperates bands like Lamb of God, Shadows Fall, Soilwork, Strapping Young Lad, Killswitch Engage and In Flames from the rest of the neverending pack of \\"extreme metal\\" bands? It's really very simple. Two things -- their mastery of their instruments and their imaginations. They aren't content to keep writing the same songs. They take this powerful brand of music and they try to expand it. They aren't afraid to try new things. They try to steer it into new directions. <br /> <br />They have a sense of purpose in what they sing and play and how they sing and play. Unlike a myriad of mindless bands who growl for the sake of growling, and who beat on drums and chug on guitars as fast as they can with no real direction, these bands have a vision in mind and they wield their instruments and microphones with purpose. <br /> <br />This is what makes LOG such an exciting band. Who knows what \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" will lead to? I have been anticipating the follow-up to \\"AOTW\\" since the day I first listened to it. This CD rewoke in me the passion I had for heavy music. 10 years ago I never would have imagined anyone would have (could have) made an album as sonically ferocious as \\"AOTW\\". <br /> <br />With this release, LOG has kicked open the door and taken over the steering wheel for heavy music. Wherever they go from here, new bands are sure to follow.
B00028HBL6|4.0|Two versions, one with less gore.<br /><br />Heartfelt piece about the lord's<br /><br />last 12 hours here on earth. If<br /><br />you can stand subtitles or under-<br /><br />stand latin, it helps. Not quite<br /><br />as good as 'Greatest Story Ever<br /><br />Told' but close enough. Like the<br /><br />Ten Commandments, very well made.<br /><br />Really three-and-a-half stars out<br /><br />of four. Good job by Mel, who's<br /><br />views I don't always agree with.
B00005JOYA|5.0|I loved the games and i loved seeing the images that were in the first game, on the big screen.  The movie was great, it gave all the same fear and chills that you got while playing, but i was disappointed that Harry was not the leading character, as he was in the game.  I think that Rose should never have been put in.  We had lots of women, why replace the character that all players know and love?  If you can get past that or if you never played the game, Rose probably won't bother you.  Overall, good movie.  It was actually better than i expected because it was based on a video game.

1400079179|3.0|With over 3000 reviews already what's one more going to hurt?<br /><br />I'm not really into the whole secret-code-conspiracy-theory genre, but this book does have its redeeming features.  From the very first chapter to the last chapter, the book is non-stop excitement.  It never lets up.  There's never a dull chapter.  But that's about the only thing good I have to say about it.<br /><br />Most criticism of this book involves the historical inaccuracies.  There's some real howlers starting in chapter 55, but since there's so much that has been said about that, I'm going to ignore that right now.  I have a much different criticism that I haven't heard much of.  I just found the whole plot to be so unbelievable, it didn't really capture my enthusiasm.  Brown seems to recognize this because he did try to patch these things up a bit in the book, though unsuccessfully in my opinion.<br /><br />First, it doesn't seem realistic to me the Priory of Sion would care so much about protecting the secrecy of the whole story about Mary and protecting the royal bloodline.  According to the story, Jesus is just a regular guy--a prophet at best--and there's no reason to think there's anything special about Mary Magdeline except that she's female.  I'm sure David and Solomon had lots of descendents.  Why would anybody care specifically about keeping track of their royal bloodline?  And why, especially, would a bunch of Goddess worshippers care?  The royal bloodline of David and Solomon shouldn't be of any interest to anybody except Jews who hope to have the kingdom restored to that bloodline some day.<br /><br />Second, the existence of the Priory of Sion seems pointless in light of Teabing's assertion that historians already know about the Jesus' marriage, the bloodline and all that.  The only thing the Priory of Sion is keeping secret that isn't already public knowledge is the location of Mary Magdeline's grave.  But who cares where she's burried?<br /><br />Third, if the Priory of Sion is so much against Christianity, why wouldn't they jump at the opportunity of proving the church false?  People have been trying to prove the church false from the beginning, but especially since the enlightenment.  There would be no shock if the Priory of Sion did as well.<br /><br />Fourth, it's never really clear on who \\"the Goddess\\" is, but you get the impression that it's Isis, Venus, and even Mary Magdeline herself.  And that's another strange thing.  The book makes it clear that Jesus was not God, yet it seems to make Mary out to be some kind of deity. She is certainly venerated, but no reason is given for it.  The only reason I can think of in the book for her to have been so venerated was that she was of royal lineage.  But lots of females are of royal lineage, and they aren't venerated like Mary is.<br /><br />Fifth, supposedly you're supposed to be a really good secret keeper to become one of the four leading members of the Priory of Sion.  They're the only ones who know the truth and where Mary is buried and all that, because they're the only ones who can be trusted to keep it a secret. And the Grand Master is supposed to be the best secret keeper of the four.  Now here's the strange thing.  Leonardo DaVinci was a Grand Master, yet he seemed to go out of his way to leave clues about the truth all over his art and writings.  He seemed to be about the worse secret keeper out there, and he seemed to WANT to get the truth out in the open.  Fine Grand Master he was!<br /><br />Sixth, leaving aside the whole Jesus/Mary/Priory of Sion thing, I have a problem with the more immediate plot involving the main characters.  Langdon, Sophie, and Teabing were all working together to try to find the Grail, and Teabing told them ahead of time he intended to make it public once he did.  Langdon and Sophie seemed perfectly okay with that.  It seemed totally ridiculous to me, then, that Teabing all of a sudden revealed that he was the one behind the murders, and he'snow going to force Langdon and Sophie to help him solve the riddle.  Why would he do that when they were helping him already?  Once we found out his true nature, nothing about his mission changed.  We knew even when we thought he was a good guy that he planned on finding the Grail and making it public knowledge.  There was no reason for him to reveal himself to Sophie and Langdon.  Why force them at gun point to do what they were willing to do already?<br /><br />Seventh, it seems silly to me that Langdon and Sophie would change their minds once they learned the truth about Teabing and Sauniere's murder.  Sophie was led to believe that Sauniere intended to make the Grail public knowledge, but he changed his mind when most of his family was killed and he wanted to protect himself and Sophie.  So the only thing keeping him from revealing the Grail was fear of the Catholic church.  Yet when Sophie \\"learns\\" these things, she made what seemed to me to be a very odd decision.  She wanted to make sure Sauniere's wishes were done.  But which wish?  That the Grail be public or that the Grail be kept a secret to protect himself and Sophie?  Well, Sophie decides to keep the Grail a secret because that's what Sauniere wanted.  That just seemed ridiculous to me.  Sauniere was dead, so the only possible reason he could've had left to keep it a secret was to protect Sophie.  His real wish was for it to become public, and he only kept it a secret because Sophie was in danger.  If Sophie wanted to honor Sauniere, she should've wanted to make the Grail public knowledge.urders, and he's now going to force Langdon and Sophie to help him solve the riddle.

B00007KWHP|5.0|It's always been hard for me to get into Yes. The first yes album I bought was THE YES ALBUM (1971). I wouldn't say that would be the first place to be to look for a Yes album to start off with. Fragile is in many ways an excellent album. I noticed that it talks about nature a lot. Summer, snow, sunshine, etc.. But that doesn't take me away from listening to the album. I would reccomend this and THE YES ALBUM (1971).<br /><br />SoNgS:<br /><br />1. Roundabout (5/5) everyone knows this song. this is a Yes song everyone should know. also this was many peoples introduction to YES.<br />2. Cans and Brahms (3.5/5) a cool little piano song. not the best song on the album, but still good.<br />3. We Have Heaven (3/5) the weakest song on the album. a very annoying track, just Jon yelling \\"tell the moon dog - tell the march hare\\".<br />4. South Side Of The Sky (5/5) I love this song. excellent percussion. its a heavy rocking song.<br />5. Five Percent For Nothing (5/5) excellent track by Mr. Bill Bruford. the song should have been longer.<br />6. Long Distance Runaround (5/5) another great track. very catchy tune. i think the other single from this album.<br />7. The Fish (5/5) I swear Chris Squire is the best bass player of all time. THE FISH, is just a funky song, short but sweet.<br />8. Mood For A Day (5/5) Steve Howe at his best, I think. Very relaxing and soothing track. Sounds like a Spanish guitar.<br />9. Heart Of The Sunrise (5/5) A F**KING AWESOME CLOSING FOR AN ALBUM!<br /><br />The bonus tracks, who gives a [...]! Alex (A Yes Fan)
079213690X|4.0|Well filmed and made (real actors<br /><br />doing real roles) but not 100%<br /><br />historically to point. So what!<br /><br />A fine actioner-drama that shows<br /><br />what kind of good work Mel can do<br /><br />when he isn't doing 'Lethal Trash'<br /><br />films...(Heck even Sam Jackson<br /><br />and Emilio Estevez in Loaded<br /><br />weapon One are better!). Pat Mc-<br /><br />Goohan is outstanding as evil King<br /><br />'Longshanks'. Gibson's \\"Frreeee-<br /><br />dooommm\\" is a haunting reminder of<br /><br />how ours is slipping away!

B000EULJLU|1.0|Everything has been said that needs to be said about this album but I just couldn't sit back and not air my disgust after how ripped off I feel regarding the purchase of this new TOOL album.  Are you kidding me!  This album only has about 5 or 6 real songs on it.  After a 5 year hiatus TOOL actually thinks it's acceptable to sell a full length album with only 5 or 6 tracks on a proclaimed 11 track album.  I have tried to listen to this album for 2 straight weeks and all i can say is the songs that are on here are awesome and when you hit a track without a song it's absolute garbage.  Shame on you tool.  This album is equivalent to the garbage that Metallica put out with after the 'And Justice for All Album'.  I hope it's at least 10,000 days before TOOL releases another dud like this!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|FF AC is a fair movie at best. I cannot deny the gorgeous graphics and vibrant actions (almost too fast for audience to catch up with) are the best out there. But the story is poorly written. The movie is somewhat difficult for fans to follow and leaves its audience a sense of hollowness after watching it. It certainly recalls memories of FFVII, yet if you look beyond the graphics and actions there really is not much left. <br />Any mature audience should be able to spot the problem right away. And for all you FFVII fanatics out there blinded by the superficial features of the movie, grow up please.
B00005NUZN|4.0|\\"Thriller\\" (1982) represents the peak of Michael Jackson's recording career before its gradual dissolution. This phenomenally successful album lives up to its title, with the exception of two forgettable tracks: the lackluster \\"Lady in My Life\\" and Jackson's notorious \\"Girl Is Mine\\" duet with Paul McCartney. Producer Quincy Jones helps deliver the knockout punch with classics such as \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something.\\" Unfortunately, \\"Thriller\\" scaled such incredible heights that Jackson's subsequent work suffered by comparison. Two decades later, it's easy to see why everyone jumped onto the dance floor with such reckless abandon.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|You know, I really enjoyed this film. It's pure action-entertainment. Pure silliness at times. The dinosaur pile-up had me shaking my head at the absurdity of it. But I mean that in a good way. This is a film that harks back to different age of filmmaking. I suppose that's fitting. It is King Kong, after all. Jackson doesn't mind combining good acting by good actors with an interesting premise and a load of special effects fun.  <br /> <br />If anything I wish there was more of this. Big segments are missed out. Like how did Kong get transported to NY? I also couldn't help but wonder about the incredible discoveries made on the island and how that would've rocked the world. Dinosaurs alive! Giant insects! An undiscovered race of aboriginal people! Any of these things would - if they really happened - be earth-shaking events. Considering this it seems a bit silly that the best Carl Denham can do is stage a show we're he displays a chained up Kong. In truth, if it's wealth he's after there would be a whole host of ways to turn the discovery into a fortune. The possibilities make displaying Kong seem like a sideshow that wouldn't even be worth the effort. Jackson deals with all this by asking us not to think about. He just fast forwards from the island to the big night in NY and keeps the engines revved up.  <br /> <br />And, honestly, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed this more than any film of it's type since Jurassic Park. It's a tribute to the filmmaker that I wish there was a super-extended DVD version. I'd happily watch six hours of any Peter Jackson film, but especially one starring Naomi Watts and a giant ape. I hope the director stays interested in big epics. Nobody, I think, does them better.
0679422714|4.0|This is an important book, and although it has some flaws, it is a book that everyone interested in the history of the Twentieth Century or in the variety of human experience or in the nature of tyrannical minds should read.<br /><br />Several books in recent years have revealed some details of the horrors of China's Modern Dark Age, the period under Mao, notably including Jung Chang's own book on the Cultural Revolution, Wild Swans. But nothing can quite prepare the reader for  the story Chang and Halliday tell here.<br /><br />Mao apparently lacked even the slightest impulse of conscience or ethics, and one comes away from this book thinking even the murderous tyrant Hitler had overtones of boy-scout values by comparison. Apart from the sheer toll of Mao's ruthless and often idiotic decisions - estimated at 70 million souls - there are individual stories here that simply leave one gasping.<br /><br />Were even half of what is reported accurate, one must conclude Mao was a sadistic psychopath. He cared almost nothing for wives, lovers, children, colleagues, the people of China, or even the secular religious idealism of communism. He didn't care for most Chinese culture or history, although he was a man who spent a lot of time reading. He enjoyed watching private films of rivals being tortured or killed. He wasted vast amounts in a poor country on protecting himself and trying to gain super-power status.<br /><br />Mao was utterly about Mao achieving control over the lives of others, and he valued anyone not a minute longer than he or she was useful to that end or until Mao's paranoid fear and jealousy over potential rivals were aroused.<br /><br />The first part of this book is less well written and less gripping than the second part, starting at the end of World War II. Flaws, especially in the first part, include things like repetition of points, sometimes as many as three times; an annoying habit of highlighting a key phrases of a document in italics and yet adding the bracketed information that the emphasis is the author's; and some awkward phrasing. Also, this is not a complete biography of Mao, dealing as it does largely with his public life.<br /><br />The authors are relentlessly negative about Mao, not a good approach to biography. Even so great a tyrant as Mao surely had achievements and qualities that should be included and analyzed.<br /><br />Still, this is a valuable book. Because archival material on Mao's rule is still not available from China - after all, Mao's portrait graces every denomination of the national currency, the yuan, and his body lies pickled in his Beijing tomb the same way Lenin's does in Moscow - the authors were able to secure a huge wealth of material from Russian archives. A remarkable number of documents and copies of documents concerning Mao are preserved in Russia. The authors also interviewed figures who survived Mao's Terror.<br /><br />The second portion of the book also gains force from specific stories of certain people who dealt much to their regret with the Great Helmsman. What a gruesome story it is when Chou En-lai (who is viewed here as a brilliant, ruthless, and murderous servant rather than a sensitive man trapped in a madhouse) is diagnosed early with cancer. Mao, who had to approve special medical treatment for high officials, refused permission for an operation. Only when it was too late did Mao relent. And this was Mao's treatment of an extraordinarily talented man who had given him years of exhausting, faithful service!<br /><br />Another harrowing story is Mao's treatment of Liu Shao-ch'i and especially his remarkable wife, Wang Guangmei, one of the few authentic heroes in the book, who was selected for torture and imprisonment only because she and Liu Shao-ch'i were such a loving couple.<br /><br />Mao's betrayal of Luo Ruiqing (known as Luo the Tall) is breathtaking. Luo served him slavishly, and Mao valued his unquestioning, prompt carrying out of idiotic orders. Yet when Mao was planning the Cultural Revolution (actually a cover for launching a huge purge and vengeance against figures like Liu Shao-ch'i), he badly needed Lin Biao's cooperation, and Lin hated Luo as a rival. So, after a brief reluctance, Mao threw Luo to the wolves to secure Lin's support.<br /><br />A number of times, Mao saw to it that certain Red Army forces were slaughtered by Nationalists only because it served his interest in defeating a rival for power.<br /><br />In an early missile test, Mao insisted that a then-undependable Chinese missile carrying a live atomic warhead be tested on a target across 800 kilometers of China containing many towns and villages. The test succeeded, but the same missile, minus the warhead, failed and crashed in subsequent tests.<br /><br />The Great Leap Forward, which is widely known to have been a terrible failure, here takes on the added dimension of an entire nation being reduced to near-starvation in order to have something to export to the Russians in exchange for military technology. Other officials were reduced to tears on seeing the miserable hardships and death induced by the Great Leap, but no words even slightly moved Mao who cared not a whit that millions died slowly and miserably. Indeed, saying the least wrong word about the Great Leap was a sure ticket to expulsion, torture, and execution.<br /><br />Go read a light comedy after you finish this book.ng a huge purge and vengeance against figures like Liu Shao-ch'i), he badly needed Lin Biao's cooperation, and Lin hated Luo as a rival.

B00008OLYN|5.0|It is hard for me to explain to people who are not familiar with Opeth that they are called by many the current 'gods of death metal'.  Listening to this album, however, can easily fool somebody into not believing that.  A complete change of pace for the band, although not unbelievable as most of their albums have truly melodic moments.  The influence of Stephen Wilson on this album is apparent, and this stands as perhaps the most beautiful sounding album I own by any band or solo artist.  Everybody I know that has heard this album has been completely awestruck, regardless of whether they like metal or not.  A great addition to ANY collection!
078681859X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was funny, and filled with adventure. I totally recommend this seris. (Please forgive my poor spelling, I'm an avid reader not an avid speller). The righting style takes a bit to get used to (hint pay attention to the footnotes) but after you figure it out.... you just keep on flipping pages and before you  know it... your done... and wanting more. Luckily there are 2 more books to devour.
B00006IU73|5.0|Alright folks, check this out.  I will not gush about Porcupine Tree's past achievments, because I was not aware of their previous albums, and this and Deadwing are the only two I've heard.  However, let me say this about 'In Absentia':  This CD is absolutely necessary.  Like Radiohead?  Buy this.  Like Pink Floyd?  Buy this.  Like Opeth?  Buy this.  Like Katatonia?  Buy this.  I can keep this up for about three more lines so I'll call it quits now.  Bottom line:  this is good stuff and it should be heard by all!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|OK, so we've heard all the hype about this flick. Affectionately dubbed the \\"gay cowboy movie,\\" viewers everywhere giggle naughtily whenever it's mentioned. However, those who cannot get past that will seriously be remiss in viewing one of the most powerful love stories of all time. <br /> <br />This is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys who meet each other in the summer of 1963 deep in the mountains of Wyoming. They are both hired to herd and protect a large flock of sheep through the mountains for several months. Every day their friendship progresses little by little as they spend the summer working with only one another. One night they are shocked to discover that their friendship had transformed them into lovers. This begins a tumultuous relationship that spans twenty years of broken relationships, deception, and ultimate tragedy. <br /> <br />This film is amazing in every sense of the word. It is beautifully directed and executed. The stunning cinematography displays the stark beauty of the American wilderness that mirrors the wild, untamed love between Ennis and Jack.  <br /> <br />Heath and Jake's performances were legendary. I honestly have never seen better performances from two straight male actors in terms of heartrending, accurate portrayals of homosexual men during a critical time of the history of American society. This is a story that is moving and haunting. It stays with you and reverberates through your soul for a long time. It is a movie that will continue to affect me because it revealed to me the brutality of human nature, and how love is so powerful that it has the might to act simultaneously as salvation and destruction to so many lives. Absolutely amazing. <br /> <br />

Her meddlesome yet loving sisters try to force her back into the dating pool, but Sarah is still a little timid after the fresh scars of the divorce. Eventually her sister goes behind her back and posts Sarah's profile on perfectmatch.com, which launches Sarah into the whirlwind realm of dating. Along the way she is set up with a boat builder played by John Cusack. She clicks with him, but a series of confused emotions and other men puts their relationship in jeopardy. <br /> <br />This movie was enjoyable, but forgettable.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|It's a wierd time for America. A conservative hoodlum is in the White House, a $200 million blockbuster about a giant ape is the top film at the box office, and the main film critics and moviegoers with any kind of sense are talking about is a quiet love story between two cowboys in the Wyoming mountains playing in a handful of theatres. Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, based on the tragic short story by Annie Proulx, is worth the hype. It is a startling film about the connection between two lonely souls in the bleak landscape of the midwest. Heath and Jake have amazing chemistry which slowly pulls you into the film but eventually turns you inside out as their relationship grows darker. Love, homosexuality, prototypes of machismo, these are all dealt with with rare restraint and sensitivity by Lee as a compassionate but almost indifferent observer. It is only in the film's final shot, and Ennis' final weary line that the power of this story becomes apparent. This is a film which needs to be seen. It is the film of the year.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This film takes place in rural England during the 18th century. My favorite actress Keira Knightley plays the witty and head-strong Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five daughters who come from a modest family. The daughters have reached marriagable age, and when the handsome, wealthy Mr. Bingley comes to town, of course the whole household flies into an uproar. Elizabeth's older and stunningly beautiful sister Jane (who is played by Audrey Tautou look-alike Rosamund Pike) is established as the inteded for Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth meets her match in Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy, whose dark wit and forlorn manner somehow spark her interest, but when a series of misunderstandings arise that involve her beloved family, Elizabeth must learn to put aside her pride or else risk losing the man who completes her. <br /> <br />This movie was exquisite and beautifully directed. The sweeping, epic shots and stunning cinematography served as the perfect backdrop for the delicate love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth was so amazing that it should serve as the standard for all romantic heroines. The chemistry created by lingering glances and touches is electrifying, and conveys the love arising bewteen Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy more fully than covert displays of affection that afflict many movies made today. <br /> <br />So utterly romantic and heart-felt. One of the best films I've seen in a very long time. <br /> <br />
B00005JL0I|1.0|The jokes aren't funny and  the plot doesnt make much sense but there are tons of \\"A list\\" stars in this terrible Bond spoof. <br /> <br />Not really watchable even for the fun of it. <br /> <br />The soundtrack however is one of the best ever. <br /> <br />Bond fan or not...it was awful then and still is.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Heath Ledger travels far away from Brokeback Mountain all the way to 18th century Venice, Italy to shoot a movie about a scandalous, womanizing writer named Giacomo Casanova.  <br /> <br />Casanova's life is full of female conquests and pursuits of pleasures of the flesh. Subsequently, he pens stories of all the experiences he's accumulated, which apparently do not paint a pretty picture of the female species. Just down the canal lives the beautiful and intelligent Francesca Bruni, a young woman who challenges the archaic values that the Church and society hold against women. She does this by infiltrating university meetings held exclusively by men, and by writing seditious pamphlets touting the freedom and equal rights women should be bestowed. Of course, she writes beneath the guise of a nom de plume: \\"Bernardo Guardi.\\"  <br /> <br />Casanova's free-loving life takes a turn for the worse after he sleeps with a nun who also happens to be the cardinal's little sister. As punishment, the doge of Venice tells him to marry a respectable woman from a good family or else risk permanent expulsion from Venice. A series of events leads Casanova to meet the free-spirited Francesca Bruni, and he finds himself falling in love with her. Unlike the other women of Venice, Francesca turns out to be a conquest much more difficult to attain. The movie takes off with a flourish when Casanova's desires leads him into a brilliant tangle of clever lies and intrigue. <br /> <br />The film starts out a little slow, but once we get one third of the way in, it becomes exciting. The movie is clever, funny, and surprisingly adorable. Even Sienna Miller, whom I normally despise, is very likeable as Francesca. How can I hate a woman whose passion is writing?  <br /> <br />The one thing that gets me, and it's hard to admit because I liked the movie, is that the ending is a little weak. Other than that, it's an easy, enjoyable film. <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam, while being too earnest and hard-working to release a truly terrible album, hasn't put out a really great album out in some time (many would argue that either 'Vitalogy' or 'No Code' is their last strong effort, or even say that they peaked early with 'Ten' and 'Vs.'). Every album since the mid-90s has had some very strong material on it (like 'Light Years' from 'Binaural' or 'I Am Mine' from 'Riot Act'), but no real killers like the early singles from the first few albums.  <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's self-titled release delivers the most straight-forward rock that they've put out in ten years. 'Life Wasted' starts off the disc with as much force and passion as 'Last Exit' does for 'Vitalogy', and 'World Wide Suicide' has given them the most radio exposure they've gotten since the 'Last Kiss' single quite a few years back. The politics are here, but aren't overwhelming and less polemic than they were on 'Riot Act' (check out Bu$hleaguer). The band also manages to expand on their sound while managing to look back into the past. 'Come Back' adds a very slight element of R&B to their sound; very similar to 'Last Kiss' only in more of a crooning mode, where 'Parachutes' has a lilting, slightly \\"McCartneyesque\\" feel to it with gentle off-beat acoustic guitars and a touch of keyboards. The 'Wasted Reprise' would stylistically fit in with the artsier parts of 'Riot Act'; whereas 'World Wide Suicide' and 'Comatose' go straight for the gut, sounding more like the rockers from 'Vitalogy' or 'Vs.' than anything else from the Pearl Jam catalogue.  <br /> <br />This record should satisfy most who were looking for a good solid rock album from the group, and should even satisfy the minority of people who prefer the group's more stylistically broad latter albums. This is as close to an honest 5-star album that the band has gotten in a long time.
B00006M183|3.0|Right now I am going gaga over the new Pearl Jam record (dubbed The Avocado Record by an Amazon review), but I have not felt this excited about a new Pearl Jam record since Yield, so the question is what would someone say about Riot Act, who is gaga about Yield and Avocado?<br /><br />The answer is Riot Act had enough memorable highlights to maintain my interest in Pearl Jam, but was not good enough to make me a huge fan of this time-period of their career. Riot Act is a very dark and murky sounding affair and showcases a band trying to be deep, for my ears it was mission accomplished, too accomplished. Good rock, in my opinion, requires a sense of energy (or heaven forbid fun), and on Riot Act that sense is missing. Songs such as Thumbing My Way and Love Boat Captain have a desperate feel to them that can be very off-putting even though there are heartfelt sentiments throughout each song.<br /><br />In order for a deepness to not drown a record, the songs have to have an overall quality that demands attention (A Long December by the Counting Crows is an example of a song that wraps you up in its beautiful melancholy despite its somber sound). On Riot Act that quality just isn't there. Not enough epic riffs, not enough choruses that penetrate, not enough moments that make you forget about the downer pill you're being asked to swallow.<br /><br />There are moments on Riot Act when the songs reach a high level of engagement. Can't Keep gets the album started off with great acoustic guitar work hinting at a mystical listening experience while at the other end You Are has a dark atmospheric quality created by some of the heaviest guitar work I've heard from the band.  Those examples, however, can't save the collection.<br /><br />The best example of the qualities I believe the album needed to work can be found on I Am Mine, a haunting song whose signature guitar riff penetrates your eardrum. I Am Mine presents a fully realized, densely layered sound that pulls you in and reveals some larger then life lyrics. If Pearl Jam reached that level of intensity more often on Riot Act, I would have gone gaga.you in and reveals some larger then life lyrics. If Pearl Jam reached that level of intensity more often on Riot Act, I would have gone gaga.  <br />
B00005JOYA|3.0|I confess, I played the game, actually all SHs. Parts 1 to 3 took place in the town of silent hill. The movie is a bit of a mess/mix from the first and second entry. In the first SH, part of the big thrill was not to know anything. The game began with a really confusing introduction, actual events and such that will happen during the game: actual events involving a couple finding a baby (think Moses), a skinburnt girl in pain, a cop getting a call, a man with his daughter in a car, meeting up with the cop from before, then they have an accident... <br /> <br />SPOILERS AHEAD:  <br />the game began right after the guy awakens in the broken car, realizing the daughter's gone. From then on, the quest for finding her became secondary when he finds that the accident brought him to a deserted town, with snow falling in the middle of summer, raising questions like \\"what's this place? Where's everyone?\\". During about half of the game there was this eerie feeling only due to lack of knowing what's going on. That doesn't mean the player was just doing one puzzle/fight after the other, the story evolved around the idea, that the guy might have been killed during the accident as the town has two faces: one being in thick fog, the other in darkness. Just as in the movie, the darkness transformed the environment and brought up different kind of enemies. The cinematic aspect of it was the brilliantly told story and the feeling of total isolation it caused as the few people who meet are just as confused as the main character. Slowly, there was story being built around the situation: that of a town in which the police once was looking for drug dealings, that of tourists once buying them, that of a hospital with a secret strange place in the cellar, that of a doctor drifting around town with a strange bag, that of children books with monsters you actually met (=fears becoming reality), that of the abusing of a girl by her own mother... slowly we got the picture and the idea that theown daughter might play a specific role in all this.  <br /> <br />In SH2 it was obvious that the town of silent hill was a ghost town that existed for real. It was left alone and deserted as many american ghost towns. From there the main character gets a letter from his dead wife, inviting him to the place they once loved. So he's not caught in another dimension, he was walking throught a real life town, but as in part one, it changed its face every now and then.  <br /> <br />The movie is mixing up both ideas: that of a person searching for her daughter in a strange town and that of a person actually looking for a really existing ghost town named silent hill (in the games you were always asking yourself if this place exists or not). I didn't like this fusion that much as it takes away the individual basic feeling of both games. It's a bit hard to explain unless you've experienced the games.  <br /> <br />The monsters are a bit too digital, the pyramid head and the nurses (!) looked like from a music video clip to me and were placed in a ridicoulus situation, like a table dancing group they stand there. I had to giggle there.  <br /> <br />Not my movie, but I liked the atmosphere and the pictures. The way Gans is trying to explain it all is ways ways ways overdone. I think especially this material would have done for a great rewatch-movie, only to understand more of it, but never fully.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Cee-lo was definitely talking about himself in the song \\"Transformer\\". If you think he has always had a very good voice you have no idea. As a vocalist, he is fantastic.  Dangermouse is a genius, nuff said.  Thier talents combine for an unforgettable listening experience.  There is so much music being made out there that you can become jaded by the many repetitive choices. This one stands out big time.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|It looks to me as if some very bitter people are posting reviews here. I'm not talking about the occasional person who dares to find fault with the movie, either! I mean some reviews of the less complimentary reviews are pretty personal and somewhat unbalanced, in certain cases. Dare I say that I myself also found it \\"not bad\\"? It could have been better... (I can already hear Heath Ledger style voices grumbling \\"That thar's faghtn' tawk, stroinger!!\\") <br /> <br />\\"Not bad\\" is a reasonable assessment as far as I'm concerned. But I can already hear the howls of indignation from those to whom this film is clearly something of a sacred cause. I just hope more balanced readers and film-lovers will be able to differentiate between honest, fair criticism and what looks to me like campaigning, the kind of thoughtless hissy fit that belongs on the soap-box rather than in a film-review. I'm willing to bet that a lot of the film's virulent defenders are talking more about their private convictions, more about the issue than the film. That mind-set makes for poor judgement. And mediocre film-making, come to think of it. <br /> <br />Assessed purely as a film, Brokeback Mountain is quite good. Lovely photography, atmospheric in places. The acting is good but not great. A bit uncomfortable in terms of audibility from Ledger and lack of gravitas from Gyllenhaal. The morality of \\"tough guys\\" subjected to romantic longing and unrequited love is touching. The ethics of the way these two subsequently treat their families is seedier. <br /> <br />All adds up to nothing as special as you'd think from the ululations of its apologists. And this is the crux of the problem: expectations set too high, at least for the even-handed viewer. When we compare the film to its reputation amongst certain hysterics, as we can hardly avoid doing, then the movie falls probably flatter than it deserves. <br /> <br />Apart from the Big Issue, which is not dealt with in Brokeback Mountain as well as it istreated in Desert Hearts, for just one example, Ang Lee clearly inhabits some kind of Praise Only Zone. What we might call the \\"orthodoxy\\" of received fan \\"wisdom\\" is a barrier to fair judgement. This is also the case with Ledger, a good actor who is indulged in mumbling and so inhibited (presumably by the director) from delivering his best performance. Although you wouldn't think it from some of the ravings here. <br /> <br />The other lead is undeniably pretty, if that's what unholsters your pistol. But those who shout here about his \\"talent\\" protest a bit too much, methinks. It all reminds me of screaming teenagers who think the pop-children on their bedroom wall posters are great musicians. And just because something is relentlessly depressing doesn't necessarily make it profound as tragedy. Quality and discipline are required for that to happen. This film lacks in both areas. <br /> <br />If this film fills a hole in some people's lives, if it's just what they were looking for, mainstream cinema coming to the rescue of what they've seen as some neglected special-interest area of their own, well, that's fine. But don't tout your \\"opinions of the film\\" as anything more than wish-fulfilment, in that case. Those squealing here about the \\"integrity\\" of others are pretty lacking in that quality themselves, as far as I can see. Get real: it's not a bad film. But neither is it anywhere near as good as it's cracked up to be. My best advice to the film's truculent defenders would be to shut up and let sensible people make up their own minds; otherwise you're going to do more damage to your precious movie than it probably deserves. In brief: a film in danger of being spoilt more by its bitchier fans than by its own minor flaws.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a must-see for anyone, featuring the gorgeous Gyllenhaals, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle.. It has a dream cast, amazing plot, and perfect script. The actual movie is undescribably mindblowing; it contains everything the ideal movie should need. Action, drama, horror, sci-fi, comedy. It fits every genre, so why shouldn't you like it? I'm surprised it hasn't been more popular than it already is. Donnie Darko is perhaps the deepest movie ever made; skip the video rental store and head to Best Buy for this one.

B00005JOFQ|3.0|A tale of love that happens to be about two men who battle with their guilt in being gay and facing the repercussions of an intolerant society. Set from the 60s to 70s in the middle regions of the USA.    Based on a short story. Script adaption was very popular and floated around Hollywood for several years until someone was brave enough to touch it and turn it into a film.    Worth a look but I feel CAPOTE and CRASH were better.    I'm sure bitter people will click NOT HELPFUL just out of spite, so, go for it, people.  Show me your rage and lack of an open mind.  Come on, do it. :D
B000EULJLU|5.0|And by \\"sounds better\\", I mean the sound engineering is sonically superior.  I've gone back and listened to Aenima and Lateralus again and quite frankly I think the 10,000 Days mix is much more....ummm....LUSH.  Absolutely huge sound.  If you are judging this album based on crappy 128kbps mp3s downloaded via bittorrent and piped thru your crappy iPod earbuds, I pity you and your tiny tiny brain. <br /> <br />I do not understand people saying Tool is \\"selling out\\" with this record.  If Tool is trying to sell out, they are going about it all wrong.  Generally if you are going to sell out, you try to make your music MORE radio-friendly, not LESS.  Creating a 76-minute album of 10-minute compositions interluded with esoteric psychedelia after five years of no releases does not sound like a winning strategy to become a Clear Channel Darling.  THINK, PEOPLE.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is the best show on TV--ever. It is addictive and I guarantee you will become an obsessed fan of this show. Looks like a teen show but it is not. You'll soon find out it is so much more. <br />Fall in love the characters as they struggle with their lives, try to solve the weekly mystery with Veronica and collect the weekly clues to solve the season mystery.  <br />The writing and dialog are so good that you will want to know every single word spoken and will find yourself watching each episode over and over again. You'll see something new every time you do. <br />Buy the soundtrack at the same time. If not you'll only have to buy it later! <br />I already have my season 2 reserved.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back with their first album in four years with \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" (2006) a rather eclectic body of work that requires a few listens to appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Stadium Arcadium\\" shows the band take up where they left off with their more mellow recent offerings \\"Californication\\" (1999) and \\"By the Way\\" (2002) but not without showcasing a fair amount of the band's signature funk. The album is divided pretty evenly between the two.<br /><br />With two discs worth of music, twenty-eight songs total, there is a lot to digest. While there are a few songs on \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" that grab hold of you right away, like the 70s AOR /funk of \\"Tell me Baby\\" and the infectious melodic \\"Dani California,\\" most of the album takes a few listens to really dig. The reason for this is two-fold. One, much of the album is pretty laid back and mellow and these songs don't really grab hold of you right away. With just one listen, you may even be bored with the album's slower cuts. With repeated listens, however, you will gain an appreciation. Of the softer songs, their true triumph lies in their subtleties, the little nooks and crannies that one is likely to miss if the album is not given repeated listens. John Frusciante's captivating and often psychedelic playing is easy to miss the first time around, but starts to grab hold of you once you are more familiar with the songs.<br /><br />A second reason \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is hard to get into is that while there is a fair amount of infectious/radio friendly songs, they are simply buried in the vastness of the over two hours of music. After spending two hours with the album, it's hard to remember what is what, as everything is one big blur. That said, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is a focused album. While diverse, it's not overly ambitious or self-indulgent.<br /><br />\\"Stadium Arcadium\\" may take a few listens to get into, but it's worth spending time on. It's a rich body of work that succeeds on all levels.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0009WFF7M|5.0|An amazing album, truly.  From the hard hitting yet humorus \\"Money For Nothing,\\" to the dark, melodic Viet Nam inspired \\"Ride Across The River,\\" this album pulls no punches.  Be sure the check out the jazzy \\"Your Latest Trick,\\" with that soul stirring sax work.  And, of course, the powerfully deep title track.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I don't get it. Crucification was a brutal way to die. It was a method left for the lowest of the low of the criminals. Gibson simply took what was independently attested history and placed it on film. If you don't believe me, all you need to do is to simply research this issue starting with the first century Jewish historian Josephus. So, this is not a horror flick or the production of some type of extremist. It presents a historically accurate presentation of a type of Roman execution. And yes, it's not pretty. <br /> <br />The beauty of The Passion (i.e. suffering)of The christ and this movie is that it tells a story of someone who chose to suffer and die for what he thought was the salvation of human kind. Long after we have died and our children's children have been forgotten in history, this amazing narrative will continue to be told. Gibson is simply one link in a 2,000 year chain of sharing this remarkable moment in time.
0312995423|3.0|Digital Fortress is a good novel when you get down to basics, ignoring everything you know about computer security. There's plenty of suspense and it reads quite well. <br /> <br />However, I winced when I read the references to cryptography and computer security. Dan Brown really needs to research the subject he is writing about before he writes. There were a lot of things that just didn't make sense. A few examples: <br /> <br />At one point the characters are talking about different encryption algorithms. They refer to Diffie-Hellman as a cryptographic algorithm, however in reality DH is a method for secure key exchange over an insecure network. It's a major piece of any cryptographic suite in use out there, aka. SSL but is not encryption in itself. <br /> <br />At another point they are talking about the NSA supercomputer, TRANSLTR (which in itself is unrealistic but I'll let that one go since it's a major part of the story) overheating and burning up since it has been trying to decrypt something for over 18 hours. In the real world this would not make sense because there would most likely be thermal sensors, which would shut down the machine if it really started to run too hot. <br /> <br />Also the whole concept of a virus getting into a machine like that is unreasonable. A machine like that would certainly be quite proprietary and writing viruses for a machine (which is not even known to exist outside of the NSA) like this would require a great deal of understanding about the machine's architecture. Given, the person who wrote the virus had worked with the machine before. Still, it seems very strange that they would blindly run untrusted code on a multibillion-dollar machine. <br /> <br />I would suggest this book to anyone who knows very little about computers / system security / cryptography in general, or someone who won't mind these inaccuracies. However, if you are into computer or software engineering, or know quite a bit about these topics you might want to stay away from this book, since you might find yourself wincing at every new plot twist.
0743454537|3.0|I had recently read and enjoyed Jodi's novel The Tenth Circle, and thought she had a unique voice worth reading. This novels premise sucked me in right away. Fast paced, I really enjoyed the different narrators. I will say, however, that I could have done without the sideplot dealing with the attorny and the guardian. It was simply not interesting and destracted from the main plot. All that aside ,I was ready to forgive the somewhat two-dimensional characters because they were still interesting. Until the last chapter and eplogue, I was ready to sing this books praises <br /> <br />Then came the ending. That god awful, cop-out sorry excuse for an ending. I couldn't believe my eyes. What was Jodi thinking? Here we have this wonderful book forever tainted by a totally unbelievbable conclusion. Anna did NOT have to die, especially in a car crash LEAVING THE COURTHOUSE, WTF? It would have been much more satisfactor for Anna to have refused to give up the kidney and have Kate pass away. That would be predictable, yes, but still realiztic and ultimately would have just made more sense. It could have been very touching, the family greiving and yet pulling themselves together now that Kates illness does not hover around them. To make Anna a martry was just silly. I will not stop reading Jodis novels, but I will be weary in reccomending this particular book.
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd has really had four major eras.  The first was the Syd Barrett era, where they focused on psychadelic rock.  Next came the transitionary era, which lasted until Dark Side of the Moon.  This started the famous era, and then Waters left, so there was the Gilmour era. <br /> <br />Meddle is the odd album out, as it doesn't fit into any of the eras.  While the albums before it and Obscured by Clouds right after it are both in the transitionary era, this album does not fit.  They found their sound on this album, and their music from the breakthrough era can mostly be heard here. <br /> <br />Arguably, this is the best Pink Floyd album.  There are several reasons why this is the case, or rather, several factors that make this true.  The first is that it cannot be defined by any formula.  It is not transitory, like in the transitionary era, but it is not lyrically dark, like Dark Side of the Moon and everything in that era.  In fact, it is probably Pink Floyd lightest album. <br /> <br />The next reason is that everything that THE Pink Floyd sound, the one that they are famous for, can be found on this album.  Listen to Shine On You Crazy Diamond before the lyrics start in part one (about 1:30 before).  The style they use to introduce the lyrics can be found in Echoes, before the first set of lyrics in that song.  Listen to Is There Anybody Out There, and you can hear the whale song from this song.  Listen to all of Dark Side of the Moon, and you can catch little things that they took from this album. <br /> <br />The third is that this is not heavy music.  It is very accessible, I would argue more so than Dark Side of the Moon.  It isn't music that you have to sit and ponder what everything means, it just comes to you.  It even has a love song, A Pillow of Winds, probably the best true love song Pink Floyd has put out (not counting Wish You Were Here, because that is a tribute to a friend and bandmate). <br /> <br />The fourth is Echoes.  Words cannot do justice to this song.  From the opening pinging to the closing wind, this song blows me away.  It sounds great, and it is the first true piece of genious the band would put out.  The lyrics are the most poetic that Pink Floyd (a.k.a Roger Waters) would ever write. <br /> <br />Also, the album flows really well (though it flows no better or worse than any of the next three albums).  If you have time on your hands, listen to it on repeat, so that when Echoes fades away, it goes back to One of These Days.  The flow is great.  The former ends with howling winds, the next opens with them. <br /> <br />This is not a concept album in the traditional sense.  Lyrically, there is no link between all of the songs.  However, if you look at the cover art (an earlier reviewer has mentioned this) it is a closeup of an ear with waves superimposed over it.  Waves of Sound is what is represented by the cover.  That is an especially apt idea, as this album made waves musically in their later work. <br /> <br />A must have for any fan of good music.
0805047905|5.0|Books for young children should be both enjoyable and predictable.  Bill Martin, Jr.'s Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? is exactly that.  Children will enjoy the patterns, the colors, and the animals.  The first predictable feature of the book is its title, which is the opening line of the story:  \\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?\\"  Pictured on the first and second pages is in fact a brown bear, who replies, \\"I see a red bird looking at me.\\"  The next two pages predictably show a red bird.  \\"Red bird, red bird, what do you see?\\"  He replies, \\"I see a yellow duck looking at me.\\"  This question and answer format continues throughout the story.  Children will quickly learn the patterns and after having heard or read the story once or twice, will undoubtedly follow along.<br /><br />The book is a concept book as it teaches children common colors and animals.  Colors mentioned include brown, red, yellow, blue, green, purple, white, and black.  Animals mentioned include a bear, a bird, a duck, a horse, a frog, a cat, a dog, a sheep, a goldfish, and a monkey.  The story ends with, \\"Monkey, monkey, what do you see?\\"  He responds, \\"I see children looking at me.\\"  There are pictures of children of different genders and ethnic groups, which is something to look for when evaluating illustrations in children's books.  Then, the children reply that they see a brown bear, a red bird, a yellow duck, a blue horse, a green frog, a purple cat, a white dog, a black sheep, a goldfish, and a monkey looking at them.  This conclusion is a creative way of summarizing the entire book in just two pages.  Seeing and hearing the animals and colors again will reinforce the content to the children.<br /><br />Eric Carle's pictures are perhaps the most important part of the book.  Imagine reading a book about animals and colors with neither the animals nor the colors shown.  How will children easily grasp what the animal looks like if they cannot see it?  How will children easily grasp what a certain color is if they cannot see it?  Carle's pictures are large and bright, which are important in grabbing and keeping the children's attention.  As each picture takes up two pages, they are also helpful when reading the book as a class.ily grasp what a certain color is if they cannot see it?

0440238609|5.0|Where to begin about these books is almost beyond me, as was everything else about them. But like my journey through the His Dark Materials trilogy, this review has to start somewhere. <br /> <br />I was introduced to these by my mom. I was thirteen at the time, and, having recently devoured the Harry Potter series, my literary life was feeling a bit empty. Starting out the Golden Compass, I must admit I thought my mom had gone senile. The first few chapters of The Golden Compass were AWEFUL. I'm not sure what kept me going, but whatever it is, I believe I'm a better person for it. <br /> <br />The plot picked up eventually, leading to an enthralling narrative that captured my mind and forcibly hald my eyes to the text on the pages. The stary was perpetuated in The Subtle Knife, introducing new characters, a darker feel, and the elements that would later provide the platform for what has become my favorite book of all time--The Amber Spyglass. <br /> <br />Philip Pullman not only reveals his prowess as an author in this last installment of the trilogy; but also stunning themes and ideas about politics, religion, science, philosophy, and God knows how many others. It's all here.  <br /> <br />What's so great about the trilogy as a whole is its ability to be read on so many different levels. The story is fantastic on its own, but the thematic materials in this series is so profound and heavy that any english teacher (or intellectual) can squeal with delight. <br /> <br />But the thing that I remember most about these books was the power that everything conveyed, climaxing with an ending to them that positively rips your heart out. Imagine me, a boy, sitting in class with a book in his hand, crying for what must have seemed like no apparent reason to everyone else. These books touched me deeply. I began to look at things my own way, not in the one \\"they told me to.\\" I began to feel a need to figure things out for myself. It changed me in the way that I want to grow upas just that--me. To be my own person. <br /> <br />I avidly reccomend these book s to anyone I can get to listen, and am usually thanked enthusistically when they give me back my copy of the last book. Don't be put off by this \\"Pullman is spoonfeeding our kids heresy\\" crap. I am a kid, fourteen now, and I can hinestly say that I disagree with his almost cynical view of religion and so forth, but that's part of what these books are about--forming your own opinion. <br /> <br />So pick up and do it for these books. I garuntee it'll be an experience you'll never forget.

1400079276|5.0|This is my first Murakami, but most definitely not my last. Considering that KotS got less than full rating by the average reviewer in amazon, I am in for a treat with his other books.<br />What had kept me away until now? I remember that somebody somewhere had classified HM as \\"postmodern\\", a label which is likely to scare me away. I am quite happy with modern or even older, why do I need anything more modern than modern? Most previous samples of this \\"direction\\" (is it one?)were less than fascinating. Also, my previous attempts at digesting East Asian fiction were not always successful. (Wasn't there somebody called Banana?) Maybe it was just the translations, but definitely I was not hooked. Now I may well be.<br />What made me overcome my postmodernism-phobia? Persistent recommendations from different sources, plus a certain curiosity what Kafka might mean to Japanese teenagers.<br />After all, Kafka is a major fix star in my literary planetarium. Seems I can share that with Japanese teenagers. First pleasant surprise.<br />The book is a much more straightforward narrative than I expected. Two storylines are developed in parallell, one is Kafka's, a 1st person narrative of a teenage, yet mature runaway, the other a 3rd person story of a mentally handicapped older man named Nakata.<br />There is magical realism: Nakata is unable to read or write, but can converse with cats. Johnnie Walker is a suicidal murderous maniac and has a talking Doberman. It is all perfectly plausible. (Nice bit of product placement by Johnnie Walker, that story.) It rains sardines and mackerels in Tokyo, or leeches on a parking lot. After the frog rain in LA from Magnolia, nothing surprises us much.<br />There are strong elements of Greek mythology. Is K. going to kill his father and love his mother? Or will it develop more into a sibling conspiracy?<br />There is mystery and there are elements of a thriller. Suspense is not lacking: what is the meaning of the blackouts experienced by both protagonists? Are we up for a larger conspiracy yarn?<br />It is also funny, like in the great scene when the two women from the women's rights organisation find fault with the library. Hilariously incorrect, as in not pc. Also a touch of Middlesex.<br />It also has the concept for a script for a great road movie: The Illiterate Hitchhiker.<br />In other words, if this is postmodernism, so be it.<br />Great stuff. As the Chicago Tribune allegedly said, according to the book cover: a striking experience in consciousness expansion. Well put. It reminds me of Robert Anton Wilson, but HM is more poetic and less flimsy.p for a larger conspiracy yarn?

0743455967|5.0|Though not intended as an instruction book for writers, I did learn some very good pointers about the craft within the various chapters of this book. There are more individual memories than the 'how to create the blockbuster, etc' found in many books on writing. In King's own words, \\"What follows are some of those memories, plus assorted snapshots from the somewhat more coherent days of my adolescence and young manhood.\\" There are very good descriptions of King's childhood that shows us what may have helped mold him into the talented writer he is today. Some memories had to have been painful to dig up, especially regarding the death of his mother and the horrible accident that landed him in the hospital. In all, I have a different awareness of the human being behind all those bestsellers.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />Author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
B000F1IQN2|3.0|SPIELBERG WANTED FOR PLAGERISM -  <br />READ THE FOLLOWING AND DECIDE WHICH MOVIE IS DIFFERENT <br /> <br />All I can say is \\"Munich\\" was well done as all of Spielberg's movies are.  <br /> <br />Spielberg shamelessly ripped off a movie from the 80's called \\"Sword Of Gideon\\" He even copied scenes shot for shot. He also gave no credit to the \\"Sword Of Gideon\\" Filmakers  \\"Sword of Gideon,\\" is now available on DVD premiered on HBO in 1986. Like Steven Spielberg's film \\"Munich\\" about Israel's response to the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games. <br /> <br />Not as bloody as \\"Munich\\" but not as slow. <br /> <br />Close to three hours long and nearly 20 years old, this TV movie from HBO fares decently for what it was and is-a look at Israel's legendary counter-terrorist initiative following an attack on its Olympic athletes in Munich.  <br /> <br />Based on George Jonas' book Vengeance, \\"Sword of Gideon\\" spends most of its time portraying how Israeli agents crossed the globe killing Arab extremists-including members of the \\"Black September\\" organization that masterminded the \\"Munich Massacre\\" killing 11 Israelis in September 1972. <br /> <br /> <br />The movie stars Steven Bauer(Scareface) as Avner, a commander in the Israeli army who is recruited by the Mossad (Israel's intelligence agency) to lead the team of spies that will exact revenge for Jewish deaths. <br /> <br />The first couple of minutes show a re-creation of the attack in Munich; the rest concentrates on Avner's recruitment, training and executing of mission ... and men. One of the movie's most significant features is the way it depicts Avner and company killing their targets in cold blood.  <br /> <br />\\"Gideon\\" also shows how Avner's work affects his personal life, especially his relationships with his wife (Leslie Hope) and father (John Hirsch).  <br /> <br />Colleen Dewhurst makes a cameo as Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. She personally appeals to Avner to take the assignment, telling him that\\"the guilty must not go unpunished.\\" <br /> <br /> Israel, she says, \\"exists to protect us from our enemies and to provide us with a haven in this world where we can live in peace. But they will not let us live in peace.\\" They are killing Jews everywhere, she says-even in Munich.  <br /> <br />SOUND FAMILIAR KEEP READING... <br /> <br />\\"Meanwhile the rest of the world is playing volleyball and winning medals,\\" she continues, referring to the fact that when the terrorists seized the athletes in Munich, the Olympic Committee initially decided to carry on with the games. <br /> <br /> Avner says he needs to think about the offer, but it doesn't take him long to accept. He is guided by a top-level official named Samuels, played convincingly by Rod Steiger, who introduces him to the other team members. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />There's Hans (Robert Joy), who specializes in documents; Robert (Michael York), the explosives expert; Jean (Laurent Malet), who's in charge of transportation; and Karl (Peter Dvorsky), whom they call the \\"sweeper\\" because he makes sure they leave no traces.  <br /> <br />Then it begins: hit after hit after hit, with a fair amount of attention to the conflicting feelings of Avner's team. For example, as they prepare to whack one of the terrorists in France, they are concerned about the man's young daughter and the effect his killing will have on her. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Avner and his men become targets themselves as word of their executions spreads among their enemies. The last hour of the movie gets a bit weighted down as each planned killing becomes less interesting than the one before. <br /> <br /> IT's THE SAME MOVIE. SPIELBERG DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT. AS A JEW I SEE HIM AS BEING GUILT RIDDEN. HE OPENS THE DVD BY BASICALLY DEFENDING HIMSELF AND THE MOVIE (WHICH HE STOLE) <br />    <br /> <br />
B000FIMG68|4.0|Season 2 of Lost, as many reviewers have stated, does indeed leave the viewer wanting something more.  Episodes often shown 2-3 weeks apart on TV never quite seemed to deliver - viewers learned lots about the island and various characters' backstories, but somehow still had their appetites unwhetted.  Very little of substance was revealed; there were few shocking revelations; burning questions from season 1 were left unanswered (although the season finale has yet to be aired).  That being said, Lost is still one of the highest-quality shows on television, with a truly unique premise and acting that is unusually good for a primetime drama (with a few exceptions), and I would definitely recommend buying season 2 (and 1, for that matter).
0385513755|4.0|I finally decided to read the Da Vinci Code.  More so out of curiosity than anything.  I must say that the start of the book was just BORING.. However, as I continued to read, the more fascinated I became. I feel that Dan Brown has a gift for pushing the boundaries of Innovation.  I do not consider myself to be a religious person, but very much so a spirtual one.  I was not at all offended by anything depicted in this book, because it is a work of fiction. I am always suprised when people express such strong views about this book, because it is a work of fiction.  In addtion to the fact that there are so many other things that we could worry about ( Abuse in the catholic church amongst these things.)This book is meant to be both thoughtprovoking and entertaining. Both of which Dan Brown has been able to convey well.

0385474547|3.0|As far as being a novel, I found Things Fall Apart to be pretty good. The description of the scenes was wonderful. He a;so found a way to draw you into the book, you never wanted to put it down. But, the plot was fairly dumb. Nothing really develops until the near end. Plus, all the character names were confusing. I know it was to make it seem more African, but the name choice was bad. I would not recomend reading it in school. It was plain and lead to a two weeks of boredom.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|No doubt...Stadium Arcadium is the Red Hot Chili Peppers best release since Blood Sugar Sex Magik.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium is Jazzy. It's funky. It rocks. It's a move back to the Pepper's style that was predominant on 1991's 5 star disk Blood Sugar Sex Magik (BSSM). Every song on BSSM was listenable...no need to skip around the disk. Sure some of the songs were better than others, but overall BSSM is one of those disks that you can pop in at a party and not have to worry about programming in only select songs.<br /><br />Well, the Peppers have one-upped themselves with Stadium Arcadium. Literally...you pay the price for one disk and get two! I'm not saying Stadium Arcadium is better than BSSM. It's two disks full of great music instead of one. 14 tracks on each Stadium Arcadium disk.<br /><br />Very similar to BSSM, Stadium Arcadium is a fun, very very listenable disk. Something went wrong on 1995's One Hot Minute (no John Frusciante for one), 1999's Californication (John's back) and 2002's By The Way. On the last three studio disks the guys moved away from fun music to trying-to-be-funny music on some of the tracks. I hate funny music. The Pepper's that sold millions of copies of BSSM are back with an awesome double CD.<br /><br />Anthony Kiedis is really on with his vocals...no funny business; just real singing. Flea shows his bass talents all the way through both disks; he can really play, and he aint no just-keep-the-time-in-the-background bassist. Chad Smith does some great, more than his usual time keeping drumming on this disk. And John Frusciante...man is good that guy came back to the group. It took a few tries, but all of the guys are definitely in top form again on Stadium Arcadium.<br /><br />Add it to your cart.
0393327655|5.0|This is the most important book written in the past hundred years - maybe the most important book ever written. And I do not know what the runner up would be. Not only did it take great intellect and a sophisticated prose prowess but it also took guts to write this book.  The human race is at a point of no return. Irrational thought and technology are combining to create a threat to our very existence as a species. With the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance, the finger is pointed at religion; and religion is undressed to show it for what it is. This takes a great amount of backbone and deep knowledge because religion sits on that side of things where criticism dare not go. The irrational do not like open criticism. <br /> <br />Yet with so much hanging in the balance, most of us do not have the mettle to say what we know to be true - religion, faith (the acceptance of belief without reason fact or observation) will kill us all if left unchecked. Yet how do we stop its insidious march? It does give comfort to people who have lost a loved one, who have suffered much pain in this life, who have been wronged and only though the chance at another existence promised by religion can this be remedied. How do you change the minds of billions of people who do not understand deeply the difference between reasoned belief and faith based belief? How do you convince the masses that religion is not net-net a force for good but rather one that could more reasonably have been fashioned by the devil. Perhaps Sam Harris can reach the right people with logic and philosophy. Perhaps those people can lead human kind out of the darkness. Perhaps not.  <br /> <br />But if not, then human kind will go the way of other extinct species because of the unrelenting logic of evolution.  We will never propagate our species to the stars. We will never reach the higher levels of consciousness because we are fundamentally defective. Or maybe we will split into factions. Those whoascribe to faith and those who ascribe to reason. Or perhaps we can create a political party with Sam Harris as our leader. It is no slam dunk but can you imagine the enlightenment and the progress that would seep in with a President Sam Harris? Whatever the result, Sam Harris's book will have a major impact on the future of the human race. And that is why I say it is the most important book written in the past hundred years - maybe the most important book ever written. <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|4.0|I must say firstly that all the negative reviews Back to Bedlam and James Blunt have been getting are from 'Chauvinistic Wanna-Be Macho Men', who are afraid to express themselves or show any emotion and also in fear of themselves. I am straight so it has nothing to do with sexual preference. I guess these days are about macho attitudes of `pimpin' and `in da club'. The collection of songs on Back To Bedlam is not for macho-men that can't relate to women. Anyone who really enjoys music and is objective is sure to at least like one of the songs on Back To Bedlam.  <br /> <br />I am a DJ at a Music bar so I try to keep updated with new music on the market anything from zydeco to a capella. This is not the genre I usually play. However I listen to this type of music on my own to relax during my day-job as an IT manager. <br /> <br />I had this CD for about 5 months without listening to it. A friend had given it to me and I put it with the rest of the CDs that I will listen to when I am less busy. Well I picked it up by accident one morning last week and I had no idea who James Blunt was until now. I popped it into my CD player and I was actually impressed by it. The first track High is optimistically truthful and the lyrical content of the other tracks that follow are basic to the point of truthfulness. The lyrics are simple and he is blunt (pun intended). This makes the songs catchy, contradictory and playful at times and also makes one think. <br /> <br />All in all it is a good collection of songs that would be fitting for most people who actually appreciate the musical efforts of musicians/songwriters/singers.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|10 TRACKS OF B SIDES...CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE IT...NOT A HELL OF ALOT OF IMAGINATION WENT INTO THIS ONE FROM THE BOYS<br /><br />SHANE WALKER..TASMANIA
B000000H3Z|5.0|The guitar riffs are so damn aggressive and rythemic that your forced to like it and obsess over it... Max's Vocal's are some what limited but, that mixes well with such songs as inner spirit which is just punishing and creatively brilliant with its aggression... Most of the album takes on the inner spirit song tone which is great due to the great riffing and drum work that goes along with it... <br />Love this album, love the music, Get back together sepultura, you need each other like a fish needs water otherwise your just not in your right element.. Soulfly and the current sepultura are missing an element of attitude and aggression which only the Max and the rest of the guys from Sep can fill..
B000EMGAOY|3.0|This is an average album.  It really isn't as good as most people here make it out to be.  Honestly a double-album isn't that good of a deal.  Sure you get more songs, but you don't enjoy those songs as much, especially when the song structure is so similar each time.  Seriously, on the second disc, I could've sworn the last 6 or 7 songs went like this:  intro for a measure or two, vocals kick in (verse or chorus comes first), chorus/verse (respectively), repeat 2 or 3 times, bridge, chorus with maybe a couple of lines repeated at the end, solo to finish.  Now that may look complex, but there IS NO VARIATION in any of the parts.  Maybe Mr. Kiedis forgot how to vary the parts to keep it interesting.  Okay, fine, maybe there is an additional layered vocal and Flea rarely plays the same fills twice, but the general melodic character does not change and it does get boring.  I understand that on such a long CD some of the tracks will be filler.  I wasn't expecting 7 in a row to close the final disc. <br /> <br />There are a few wonderful tracks.  The single (Dani California), Snow (Hey Oh), Hey, maybe a few more.  Just like any average CD, there are a couple tracks out of the whole that are very well done.  You just have to suffer through some boring tracks to get there. <br /> <br />Also, don't believe it when they say they brought the funk back.  A couple songs are mildly funky at best.  And do you know what else?  Yes, it isn't like any of their previous albums (Blook Sugar Sex Majik most noteably), but their previous albums had hooks and variety; they kept me coming back.  Stadium Arcadium is something that, now that I've listened through a couple times, I can put down and let dust settle.  I'll pull up a track or two from time to time but its no Californication or By the Way or Mother's Milk.  Each of those albums were fundamentally different and unique but still oozed Chili Peppers.  Each track had something to offer, which is characteristic of a good CD.  (aside:I didn't really care for BSSM other than Under the Bridge.  It is very funky and I'd rather listen to it than Stadium Arcadium, though).   <br /> <br />Bottom-line: <br />This album has 28 tracks, most of which are over-produced, over-overdubbed, and ooze of sameness.  A couple of tracks are very-well done and will stay on your playlist long after you get tired of the rest.  This is an average CD.  The only real difference is that it is 2 CDs long.  They could have made one amazing CD if they wanted.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|OK, so the album is good. That we know already. Way better than Riot Act, at least. I have a couple of bad comments, especially about the way the verses are squeezed into the music... in various occasions it doen't really flow at all, and that is sometimes frustrating.  <br />I'm not going to comment on the guitar riffs and solos, cause they're great.  <br />I could use a louder bass though. <br />Drums are good. <br />I wish Eddie would've sung Inside Job with a deeper voice (I don't know something like Immortality or release). <br />One of the best songs musically (Army Reserve) is one of the worst lyrically (not complaining about what it says, but how it is fit into the song). <br />The best cuts are definitely Marker and Severed Hand. Very cohesive songs.  <br />I expected more from Gone. <br />Come back is a pretty nice one and so is Parachutes. <br />Big Wave and Comatose are fun to listen to. <br />Suicide is also a pretty good track. <br />Unemployable, a filler. <br />Life Wasted I guess is alright. <br /> <br />Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Again, they prove to be awesome musicians. They'll need to do something about the verse timing for their next work. The album lacks choruses (remember In Hiding, Spin the black circle, evolution, alive, even flow, hail, hail, red mosquito, animal, etc, etc???) <br /> <br />I guess there's no need to say, but here it goes away. I am a huge Pearl Jam fan. But truths should be told.  <br /> <br />I agree with the 3,75 stars reviewer... it is not a masterpiece and all the hype is overrating it. The songs will be good live, I especially see Inside Job as an opener... like Long Road sometimes was. <br /> <br />Take care, and enjoy.
0399103422|5.0|Mario Puzo's bestseller about a \\"Benevolent\\" Mafia chief in New York and his family inspired three classic movies from director Francis Ford Coppola (\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\"; see my review of that excellent movie and \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\\" on which he served as producer, with the wonderful Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh directing, starring, producing and co-writing the awesome script). The novel \\"The Godfather\\" is an unflinching look at the underworld of the Mafia (God preserve them). I strongly recommend anyone who's a fan of Mafia literature and or great movies to read the novel first before seeing any of the films. Rated R for graphic violence, some strong language and sexual content, including dialogue and nudity.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|That is the way I first found the short story. I knew nothing, had only read Accordion Crimes and Shipping News, and loved them both. Fast forward and I hear Ang Lee is making it into a movie, with two good actors to boot.  <br /> <br />Some of the reviews here have rightly asked if this will play Red State USA. No it won't and it never will, it'll barely play Blue State. Nodding acceptance on the coasts is not \\"in my backyard\\". It is the antithesis of what they will let themselves believe in. If you've read or seen it, most of the US are more like Ennis's father, showing him the consequences of even unobtrusive homosexuality. Stating that now, could it have been more explicit in it's moments of physical passion? No, he did it just right. It wasn't about the mechanics of sex, it was about love and missed opportunities.  <br /> <br />Heath Ledger deserves all the praise in the world, Jake Gyllenhall as well. Jake as Jack was a bit easier to play, more of the 'acceptable' face of gayness that we see, especially in the internet world, i.e. married men cheating with men on their wives. Also Heath's,Ennis's wife, Michelle Williams as Alma, was perfect, both as a choice and her portrayal, and talk about a sympathetic role! In the showing I attended there was a group of womyn who in unison 'awwwwwed' at the appropriate time.  <br /> <br />Overall one of the best romantic dramas in a long time and you know there are now going to be a LOT of Wyoming holidays being planned from either coast by pairs of men.
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is the first book for a long time I have struggled with putting down.  Being a long book, it would appear daunting but once you start reading, you find the pages dissolve beneath your fingers.  This book is moving, powerful, symbolic and above all, beautiful.  The characters are excellent, well moulded and loveable.  The setting is tragic but very real, as it is obviously based on war-time Germany.  I would reccommend this book to anyone.  Although the target audience is named as young adults, I believe this may be because Zusak has also written other books aimed at this market.  This is one of the best books I have ever read and I would recommend it it anyone and everyone.

1400062756|3.0|Dr. Carol S. Dweck's new book, \\"The Psychology of Success,\\" encourages us to take what she calls the \\"growth mindset\\" approach to our lives and learning, rather than a \\"fixed mindset.\\"  In her terms, individuals with the fixed mindset feel pressured to BE the BEST.  Their fear of failing to BE the BEST, keeps them from even making an attempt to accomplish a task.  Those with the growth mindset have been brought up - or have learned along the way - to DO their best, with the emphasis on the attempt rather than on the final result.  The growth mindset allows us to learn from our mistakes; the fixed mindset says that when you are the best, you do not make mistakes!   <br /> <br />To make her point, Dr. Dweck uses examples from her own life - how she worked to overcome her fixed mindset tendencies and develop, instead, a growth mindset approach to her life and her work.  She uses, as well, real-life examples from the world of the arts, sports, business and education, comparing, for example, John McEnroe's fixed mindset to Tiger Woods' growth mindset - and how their different mindsets made one a loser and the other, a world-class champion.   <br /> <br />Although the book may be useful to anyone, parents may be its biggest beneficiaries.  There's a world of difference in the message a child receives when told to \\"be the best\\" versus to \\"do his/her best.\\"  Without mistakes, there can be no growth...people who are willing to take risks and learn from the results are the ones who will be successful, says Dr. Dweck.   <br /> <br />
1400079179|4.0|As far as the book itself goes I would recommend this book to most anyone.<br /><br />It is no Dickenson or Hemmingway. But then again, that is also the very reason I would recommend it most anyone.<br /><br />What I mean is, it is an easy read. Fast paced. Painless to digest.<br /><br />As far as the debate surrounding this book goes I would still recommend it to most anyone.<br /><br />I have found that most people who've protested \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" have never even taken the time to read it. This is a shame.<br /><br />As a Christian I feel that reading this book actually strengthened by beliefs, instead of weakening them. It has also allowed me to take part in the international dialogue that surrounding it.
B00005PJ6M|2.0|This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time.  I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie.  It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!).  My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it.  If you love it--buy it.  If not--don't.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There is no heavier, darker, more ambitious and less compromising band in modern metal than Tool. Crank this loud enough with the windows open, and your neighbor's lawn will die. In fact, your neighbors might even consider leaving town altogether. This stuff is as vicious as it is brilliant. Fueled, as ever, by lyrics expressing complete disgust with the common man's complacency, lack of imagination, thinly veneered thirst for the blood of others, and seemingly endless capacity for rolling over and playing dead while the world goes to hell in a handbasket, Tool's symphonic approach to thick, dense, knotty metal is so far beyond the reach of the band's peers that it qualifies as oft-imitated, never duplicated. Part of the reason for this is the idiomatic virtuosity of the group, which can shift time signatures on a dime, move from lulling, atmospheric washes of sound to menacing slabs of amplified doom with the ferocity of a shapeshifting primordial beast, and spend nigh-on 10 minutes creating a baroque, architecturally fascinating mid-air vision of hell, at will, and to the listener's simultaneous horror and delight. Top shelf, this stuff.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Oh yeah, that guy from Mondo Generator again. (Great band, by the way) <br /> <br />This album is not like Songs For The Deaf, it's not superior nor inferior. SFTD was blowing you away, Lullabies is haunting you and keeps haunting you. <br /> <br />The song opens with \\"This Lullaby\\", a song with The Most Underrated Vocalist Of The Grunge Era, mister Mark Lanegan and is likely to catch you off guard before \\"Medication\\" blows you away. I don't know what kind of medication Josh is referring to, but it  probably refers to those 'medications' that make you hallucinate and all trippy. \\"Everybody Knows You're Insane\\" is probably one Hell of a classic and only track number three. The verses are haunting, the chorus is able to make any pit go crazy.  <br /> <br />Track four \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\" is just scary and creepy. A bad dream out of which you don't want to wake up, argueably THE best track on the album. Number five is Burn The Witch, a song about witch hunts but, in my interpretation, is just a metaphor for the media and they're not getting away lightly. \\"In My Head\\" is a bit too pop-like for me, and one of my least favourite tracks. \\"Little Sister\\" makes up for it, a great song that perfectly matches the mood of the album. \\"I Never Came\\", also an average track, but it'll let you get your guard down for \\"Someone's In The Wolf\\". THE most creepy song ever.  <br /> <br />You don't have to be on drugs to lose all touch with reality at this point. The creepyness continues with great tracks like \\"Skin on Skin\\", \\"Broken Box\\" and \\"You Got A Killer Scene There, Man...\\" <br /> <br />Conclusion: <br />If you loved the hardrockin' rollercoaster ride that was called Songs For The Deaf and if Nick Oliveri makes you horny, you MIGHT not like this album. But if you're openminded and into progressive rockmusic. This album is a must have. <br /> <br />In my eyes, and this is purely my opinion, this album has a longer expire date then SFTD, if it has any. It needs to grow on you, but once it has grown on you, you're paralyzed and haunted by it for months, perhaps years. <br /> <br />Best album in recent years.
0893815187|4.0|this is an interesting book of photographs which have been deemed controversial by modern society.mann photographs her children sensitively and you really get to know them through these photographs,in saying that i was surprised the photograph of the wet bed is legal,as it clearly shows the genitals of the child,this is the one photograph i found disturbing. <br />a good book for any art/photography fan.
B000001E3V|5.0|Whether or not you believe this is EC's best playing, this is no doubt one of the most AMAZING rock concert albums ever recorded; regardless of the absense of a rhythm guitar or of Duane or of sobriety. Every song is turned into a 15 minute plus jam session with the most disgusting & passionate solo's I've ever heard a guitar make. Equally as great as Layla. An absolute MUST HAVE for any guitar/clapton/rock music enthusiast.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Let me just say that I have been listening to Tool since 3 weeks after undertow came out.  I was sophmore in highschool and from the fist listen I was hooked.<br /><br />  I must also mention that I did not really identify with my alternetive rock generation.  I liked hard rock and metel music more from the 70s and 80s. While most kids were listening to Nirvana I was rocking out to Motley Crue.  Most of the rock music from the 90s I didn't really relate to.  However, there were a select few bands from the 90s that I did heavily listen to and still do.  White Zombie, Nine inch nails, Marilyn Manson, and most of all Tool.  I personaly don't think there has been a better more unique band to come out of that decacde.<br /><br />  I have been one of these Tool fans that has had to wait between the release of each of their albums, which has been a bit hard to do.  With each album I have never been unsatistfied.  This time with 10,000 days I don't know about that.  With all my favorite bands from the 60s, 70s, and 80s I have a large of amount of albums to take in all at once throughout the years.  Take Black Sabbath for example, when I first started to listen to them I had like 15 albums to choose from.  I had the opportunity listen to them all at once an see their progression.  A lot of people bash any non Ozzy Ozbourne Sabbath.  I however love it.  I own every Sabbath album.  But I can see how the Sabbath listeners from the beginning might have a hard time with it because they saw the changes as they came.  This is the same with all bands.<br /><br />  I think 10,000 days is a very different Tool album but it still sounds like Tool.  They didn't do a 180 like bands such as REM, and U2.  I have a really hard time listening to bands who change their core sound, and Tool has not done that with 10,000 days.  Tool are musicians and they have the right to go in what ever path they feel fit. But not every piece a artist creates is their best, and for me this is not my favorite Tool album.  I enjoy it, but it's a little too avante guarde for me.  When I bought the album I listened to all the Tool albums back to back in the order of their release, and the album doesn't grab me as much as the others. I would recommend the album to any Tool fan.  For a newbie listener I would recommend some of their older material first, but that is what I am most fimiliar with.ol album.

B000EHSVOG|4.0|The movie was great when I saw it in the theater. This DVD has an incredible video transfer,  sharp, great detail and vivid clean color. The box and original copy said Dolby 5.1, but what do we get, Dolby 4.1, never heard of it. Where,s the 5.1???????
B00005R87Q|5.0|I don't think I have ever read so much bitching in my life. If you want to give out about the film go find a forum to piss other people off with ok? And stick to the point at hand, reviewing the film. I dont care if ye deficate on graves of those who died in street races, or glue ironing boards and coffee cans to your cars in an attempt to try and be funny. You're not. And you sound completely RETARDED. Oh, and nobody gets any critical value from your stupid opinions ok? IF YOU HATED IT THAT MUCH WHY DID YOU EVEN BOTHER WASTING YOUR TIME WRITING ABOUT IT???? Leave the reviews for people (like me) that actually enjoyed the film and want to tell others about it, and dont ruin it for everyone cos you missed the plot of the film. <br /> <br />If you cared to take any notice it takes a look at the world of street racing, which is already popular all over the world and didnt happen as a result of this film. Also, it does not make truck hijacking or violence cool.... tell me who is going to jack a truck or beat up thier friend... or wait...have a hundred grand in their ass pocket to buy a skyline and do it up just coz they saw this film? <br /> <br />It's a bit of fun and a look at racing in California, with a detective plot. The charcters are likable, there's a good mix of music and excellently done stunts in the hottest racing cars....where's the problem? It's hardly meant to be serious.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This album is one of the most unique collaborations I ever heard. Danger Mouses amazing and eclectic beats combined with Cee-los soul-grabbing voice has captured me in this new genre of music. It is a mix of funk, soul, and rock. It is definitely an album for those who are tired of the same ol stuff. The first single, \\"Crazy\\", is just what it says. My favorite songs on the album are Crazy and Smiley Faces. Cee-lo has always been one of the most soulful voices in Hip Hop to me. From his days in Goodie Mob (Soul Food) to his solo albums (Cee-lo Green and His Imperfections Cee-lo Green is the Soul Machine), I have found that Cee-lo is always Cee-lo. This album sounds like the evolution of his solo albums. I am always impressed when artists go against the norm. Though I am not familiar with any of Danger Mouses work, this album makes me want to buy something else from him. The album is absolutely worth the money you pay for it.
0062502182|5.0|there is a message for everyone in this book one just have to find it & apply it to our lives!<br /><br />dreams do come true!
B000007SPU|5.0|This music tames the penned up violence in my soul, the rage against injustice.  It...  touches me.  Really.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This CD completely changed my opinion of Avenged Sevenfold. I can not get enough of it!! I listen to 'City of Evil' daily and I have yet to get tired of a single song. The unique style and individuality of every song makes for a never repeatative tune. The most generic song I found was \\"Bat Country\\" which completely rocked the charts. These tracks aren't short either, which I've grown to love. Songs like \\"Sidewinder\\" and \\"Strength of the World\\" time in at over 7 minutes, but I promise that if you approach the CD with an open mind you will never get tired of this music. The guitars, which at times seem a little chaotic, never become obnoxious and the musicality is undeniable. The layers are awesome and M. Shadow's voice is incredible. He (THANKFULLY!!) moved on from his emo screaming and screeching days to a raspy voice that captivates the mind. The imagination is vivid and I simply can't get enough of it. This is the ONLY album I've ever heard (and I've heard a LOT) that I can honestly say deserves a 10/10 for every song. <br /> <br />Long, long, long story short this album ROCKS and has stole my heart! Go buy it now!!!
B000007SPT|5.0|quite possibly on of the most influential \\"wave\\" albums of all time.  jon stone is an idiot.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I absolutely love this album! It is now a permanent resident of the CD player in our car. I enjoy the mellowness of the first CD, it really shows what kind of a place the Chili Peppers are at right now. The other night, there was a special on MTV about them, which said that everyone in the band, as well as their manager fell in love over the years in between albums, which accounts for the mellow sounds of the album.  <br /> <br />I have listened to both cd's quite a bit, but I must say, I like the first one a lot. \\"Dani California\\" is awesome, and apparently, relates to the woman mentioned in the song \\"By the Way\\". I love the guitar licks in \\"Snow(Hey oh)\\" as well as the funky, quirky sound of \\"Charlie\\" which happens to be my favorite off of the CD. It hasn't gotten many good reviews, but I love that song, however, I've always been one for the songs no one else likes! \\"Hump de Bump\\" is fun, and quite humourous, and I laugh everytime I listen to it! \\"Slow Cheetah\\" is quite a sensual song, and really expresses quite a bit of emotion. \\"Torture me\\" is great! so upbeat, and again, very entertaining! I don't know why, but \\"Strip My Mind\\" is slowly becoming one of my favorites. The lyrics are quite powerful, and the tune is quite catchy. \\"Especially in Michigan\\" makes me laugh, that's all I have to say about that one, because it's so true, it's funny! I love the lyrics to \\"Wet Sand\\", very soft, and emotional, and I loved \\"Hey\\" from the very beginning, the harmonies are great. <br /> <br />I won't get into the second disc, because quite a few people have done so already. I really do believe the Chili Peppers have matured quite a bit between \\"By the Way\\" and \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", but I also believe they still know how to stay true to their music, and still play and write what they love. And congratulations to them on their new found relationships!
B000AL730Y|4.0|good side:Paul's playing most of the instruments (26 to be exact) himself, wonderful arrangements, lyric sheet, bonus DVD <br />bad side:no sign of his son James on the CD, could have used more pictures <br />standout tracks:fine line; how kind of you; jenny wren; friends to go; riding to vanity fair; promise to you girl; anyway
B0006M4SO6|3.0|To clarify a bit: As with many great artists (Coltrane, Jarrett) Metheny has very different colors in his musical rainbow. For lovers of serious jazz there's \\"Question/Answer\\" with Holland and Haynes. For acoustic guitarists there's the baritone solo CD. If you have an appetite for truly adventurous and outside playing there's \\"Song X\\" with Ornette. This CD will appeal to those who like the Pat Methey Group (think New Chataqua, Offramp etc.) It is ulitmately unproductive to get all twisted up by comparing \\"Song X\\" with \\"Missouri Sky\\"; I like this CD, the compostions are subtle and explore new territory somewhere between and beyond other PM Group efforts. My favorite? No. My favorites for now remain \\"Bright Size Life\\", \\"Missouri Sky\\" and \\"Q & A\\".
B0009HLDFU|3.0|good side:two disc set (2nd disc which is the highlight),good band pictures, drummer Taylor Hawkins sings a song <br />bad side:no lyric sheet, insert could be better <br />standout tracks:best of me; no way back; free me; resolve; still; another round; over and out; cold day in the sun
B00005JNBQ|1.0|My son (who is 10) asked us to get this via NetFlix - since one of his classmates saw it and told him it was funny.  Well, we rented it, watched it and I was totally unimpressed.  This has to be the lamest movie I have ever seen in my 41 years of living.  It was as mind numbing as an episode of the Teletubbies. <br /> <br />I laughed twice: when Napolean botches jumping the ramp with his bike and when Kip runs over the tupperware bowl.  His dance at the very end was pretty good.  Two songs used in the soundtrack: Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" and When In Rome's \\"The Promise\\" were the high points in the film for me. <br /> <br />The rest of it left me wondering \\"what the...?\\".  Very bad.
068484267X|5.0|This is a rare autobiography where you are given the subject's eyes and ears to experience, seemingly first-hand, their unimaginable and tragic reality.  McCourt describes everything in its raw form, as if straight from his senses to the page, without any filtering in between. <br /> <br />Frank McCourt grew up in Ireland in a very poor family, his parents loved him, but they could not provide for him or his many sublings.  This is perhaps the first story and can recall which so clearly states that loving a child is not enough, rather to be a good parent you must be able to provide for them financially. <br /> <br />This book is not all depressing, and at times it is completely hilarious.  And in the back of your mind, it's always comforting to know that eventually the little boy will grow up to become a best-selling author, but try not to think about the other 99% of the poor children that never get out.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|A Fever You Can't Sweat Out - where do I start??  Hmmmm.....<br /><br />What an awesome CD. From start to finish it's nothing but fun and clever writing. With great hooks and even better chours's. WOW!<br /><br />Someone asked me about 2 months ago (at a bar) if I liked Panic! At The Disco - I said \\"I have no clue who that/he/she is\\". Now, I do and am honored to own this brilliant CD. It fuses just the right amount of rock/punk with a splash of dance and the finished product is so infectious. I play this CD on my iPod constantly. Not only are the songs really catchy they are different as well. The lead singer (Ryan Ross) has a very good and distinguishable voice.<br /><br />My take on the tracks:<br /><br />1. Introduction - 5/5 (Good for an intermission)<br /><br />2. \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage\\" - 5/5 (My favorite on the whole CD!!!!!!)<br /><br />3. \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\" - 5/5<br /><br />4. \\"Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks\\" - 4/5<br /><br />5. \\"Camisado\\" - 5/5<br /><br />6. \\"Time To Dance\\" - 5/5<br /><br />7. \\"Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\\" - 5/5<br /><br />8. Intermission - 5/5 (AWESOME dance/club jam!!!)<br /><br />9. \\"But It's Better If You Do\\" - 3.5/5 (Not one of the best songs on the CD)<br /><br />10. \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" - 5/5<br /><br />11. \\"I Constantly Thank God For Esteban\\" - 5/5<br /><br />12. \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\" - 5/5<br /><br />13. \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" - 5/5  (My 2nd favorite song on here)<br /><br />Clearly a great CD.<br /><br />Get the CD today. The Panic! has already started, you don't want to miss out!!!

0385338082|4.0|I admit I thought that the Shopaholic series was good at the beginning, but Becky Bloomwood's character just started to get old and her escapades even more so.  I thought Emma (from this book) was more realistic.  For one thing, she has aspirations of becoming a marketing executive at her company . . . and she's actually done work to prove herself, but her superiors haven't noticed just yet.  I sympathized with Emma more readily than Becky because Emma seemed more sincere about her aspirations.  Becky just seemed too deluded and thought that she was capable to do any job that required half-a brain.  Unfortunately, she doesn't have that either.  I highly recommend this book over the Shopaholic series.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|good side:lots of musical experimentation,wonderful packaging and imagery,more singing less whining, their most powerful effort yet <br />bad side:no lyric sheet,no second guitarist Brian <br />standout tracks:liar; coming undone; tearjerker; hypocrites; souvenir
B000ETQRCM|5.0|What is everyones problem? Why isnt this hailed as being the best album of the year by EVERYONE?! So many of you people giving this album 4 stars & less are so simple minded & impatient you declare it's not a masterpiece just because you don't want to take the time to explore the depth of the album lyrically & musically <br /> <br />It's ok for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, The Rolling Stones, The White Stripes, Tool etc... To make the same similiar albums time & time again.. But if any Pearl Jam album sounds similiar to another PJ album, all of a sudden it's not brilliant.. <br /> <br />Why is Pearl Jam treated unlike any other band in history? People expect every Pearl Jam album to be the best album ever & if it's not... 4 stars, that's really what it's like. <br /> <br />Compare this album to other albums this year... This album is brilliant & a masterpiece. <br /> <br />******** THE BEST ALBUM OF 2006 ***********
B000000Y1H|4.0|This is one of those ominous recordings that manages to somehow steal the spotlight away from some of the more in depth work of the artist due to this album's attempt at \\"getting everything right\\". Don't ask me to explain what that means, all I know is that there are many albums that achieve legendary status due to their pitch perfect recipe that delivers all of the prescribed ingrediants in the right order. Somehow that formula for sucess yielded many jazz classics, but overshadowed more personal, detailed work. This applies to most artists then, and as a general forwarning into gageing many composer's true strengths when it comes to buying most recommended titles. They are often ideal first purchases when discovering someone, but usually misleading as well.   This album itself is perhaps 1/2 dominated by the man of the hour, giving way to yes..some brilliant corners. There are some amazing musical concepts going on brought on  undoubtedly by a total collaboration at times with some pretty free form plotting by all players. As exciting as some of the swingin tunes can be, the problem of overshadowing genius cannot be remedied when tunes like \\"I surrender Dear\\" are played, the depth of that writing on display towers over the majority of the disc's mood of playfullness.  Nonetheless, this is one of his more popular albums for a reason, each track on this album has stood the test of time and will continue to represent such a special hybrid of piano induced, frenzied yet organized beauty in it's 5 eclectic compositions that go everywhere from avant garde to ballad to bee bop to solo.
0446613444|4.0|The Black Ice by Michael Connelly is one in a series of Harry Bosch mysteries that I have read lately, and I am impressed with the consistency and the quality of his work.<br /><br />Christmas night finds LAPD homicide detective, Harry Bosch, eating alone when his police scanner announces the discovery of a body of a fellow cop, Calexico Moore.  Moore was a narcotics officer who was under investigation by Internal Affairs, and it appears to be a suicide.  The next day, Bosch is given a pile of unsolved homicides belonging to another cop who has pretty much stopped doing his job due to alcoholism. Bosch's boss is hoping that Harry might solve a case or two, thus boosting their rate of unsolved cases to over 50%.  The two most recent cases keep bringing Bosch back to Cal Moore, and the detective gets the feeling that his is a homicide made to look like a suicide.  The common denominator in these cases is Black Ice, a combination of heroin, cocaine and PCP being imported from Mexico and Hawaii.<br /><br />Connelly brings a realism to his books that comes from his years as a LAPD crime reporter.  The author takes us into the mind of a cop in ways that few writers have before.  Bosch muses most \\"murder victims know their killers... But Hollywood was different.  There are no norms.  There are only deviations, aberrations.  Strangers killed strangers here.  Reasons were not a requirement.\\"  Or about solving a case, a partner once told Bosch \\"facts aren't the most important part of an investigation, the glue was.  He said the glue was made up of instinct, imagination, sometimes guesswork and most times, just plain luck.\\"  There's a lot of truth in that.<br /><br />I am almost done another Connelly mystery in the Bosch series, The Narrows.  While this is also a great book, my only suggestion is that you read these books in order.  Doing so will greatly enhance your enjoyment of each book.
038533348X|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. Vonnegut continues his outlandish writing style of satire and suspense with this short (but very well written) novel.
0307276902|3.0|I was watching The Wizard of Oz the other night, and I thought, \\"what an inspiring story of overcoming adversity\\".  Little did I know that it wasn't at all true!  It was one of my favorite movies of all time until I found that out, and now it's just a waste of time to even think about!<br /><br />The same goes for the book American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.  I thought, \\"man, you really get an insight into what this guy is thinking\\".  But then, after I finished reading it, I found out that it wasn't a memoir!  That renders any value the story may have completely worthless!<br /><br />So when I heard that parts of A Million Little Pieces were fabricated, I figured I wouldn't even bother reading it.  It simply cannot be at all entertaining or inspiring if it isn't entirely true.  As we all know, everyone remembers things exactly as they happened, so when we read a memoir, it is an exact account of what really happened, because human memory is completely objective.  So to find out that a memoir isn't entirely an exact account of everything depicted is a major disappointment.<br /><br />It's too bad, because I heard it's a pretty interesting story, and some people have been really moved by it.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|good side:Noel Gallagher let's other people showcase their songs which in turn are quite the highlights,Noel sings 3 and a half songs.  strongest set of songs since the new line-up and now sober approach to living.

B000003JBM|2.0|I got this CD used based on some of the reviews on here. Don't trust them (except me, of course). <br /> <br />I really like Gang Starr. Guru is in Gang Starr. Guru makes a Jazzmatazz record. The next logical step would be for me to like this record, right? Wrong. <br /> <br />One of the problems I found with this album is the music. I don't see how this is a Jazz & Hip-Hop fusion. It sounds like a bad Hip-Hop record with samples of bad Jazz melodies - not new recordings with musicians. The Jazz portion doesn't feel like genuine Jazz. Furthermore, there are too many choruses and hooks. I felt like I was hearing too much of the same thing. Longer verses, musical breaks, anything else would have been better.  <br /> <br />My advice: sample it before you purchase it. This is NOT a no-brainer pickup like the review score and the name on the album cover may lead you to believe.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I just have one point.  This movie gets funnier every time I watch it.  And it will never stop getting funnier.  At least, I hope not-I've watched it at least 30 times.  If you like the Cohen Brothers, give this movie a chance or three.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Since my typical approach is to talk about some cheap little movie that no one takes seriously and discuss it at length I believe here I shall discuss a well-known, controversial film and consider it in a very shallow, brief manner.  So here I go:  'Munich' is an extremely sharp, well-done thriller.  So many people are solely interested in considering this film from a political standpoint, I can't help but point out that this is still a movie, a frequently exciting and tense movie at that.  Though I've always  assumed that such covert operations exist even in so-called 'civilized' nations, notions of government funded assassinations and the like have never really seemed real to me, which makes this movie all the more fascinating, turning it into a glimpse into a hidden, but apparently real world. (And it goes beyond this, giving us glimpses of amoral, anti-government, mafia-esque groups in europe and lone seductress-assassins, the latter of which I hadn't assumed actually existed in reality, but perhaps they do...)  Of course, I have no way of knowing how closely the team here resembles the real squads sent out to off Black September, but I've somewhat arbitrarily determined that this is probably pretty close to the truth.  More to the point, film itself makes it very easy to do this, as it simply feels utterly real.  Or, I should say, utterly real at least in terms of how the characters act and their general motivations and whatnot-- The film itself is very stylishly, often expressionistically made, not generally gritty or documentary like or whatever.  It stradles the line, managing to be cinematic but not over the top or anything like that.  Performances are all top-notch, with particular note going to Eric Bana as Avner, leader of the team.  He is the most, well, normal guy in the team, so naturally he is the one who gradually becomes the most affected by their operations.<br /><br />Still, I can't help but discuss the political aspects of the movie to some degree.  Suffice to say, I think it's best to take this film most purely at face value, as an exploration of how violence is bound to effect those who inflict it on others, even if the violence is just and the target deserving.  Killing is neither simple nor pleasant, and gunning people down unarmed men in hallways and bombing others is likely going to have a pretty adverse affect on you regardless of any other details.  This is, perhaps, a fairly obvious point, but like all films that actually work on a thematic level, 'Munich' makes you actually *believe* it with your gut rather than just be consciously aware of the concept in an abstract way.<br /><br />The film isn't w/o a few problems.  Firstly, it takes a bit too long to wind down after the operations are over.  Some of this is necessary, yes, but not all of it.  We're made plenty aware of Avner's deteriorating mental state during the later portions of the operation, we don't need to have it pointed out to us so much after the fact.  Also, the juxtaposition of Avner and his wife having sex and the bloodbath on the runway is pretty damn heavy handed and over the top.  The slow-motion shots of Avner, umm, thrusting with droplets of sweat spraying everywhere as he screams and screams are just a bit much for my taste, thank you.  But that's about it as far as problems are concerned.  This is simply a very good, very believable and intense thriller.  Check it out.<br /><br />Lastly, I've only got the single disc DVD.  It looks very nice, though the artwork itself does make me laugh.  Makes it look like it's a video game.<br /><br />Grade: ASuffice to say, I think it's best to take this film most purely at face value, as an exploration of how violence is bound to effect those who inflict it on others, even if the violence is just and the target deserving.

But that's about it as far as problems are concerned.  This is simply a very good, very believable and intense thriller.  Check it out.    Lastly, I've only got the single disc DVD.  It looks very nice, though the artwork itself does make me laugh.  Makes it look like it's a video game.    Grade: A
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|One word Amazing!!! This movie is what people wanted when the first Final Fantasy movie came out.  The graphics make you drool and the story stays true. It will make you remember things about the game you forgot and if you didn't play it you would still love it. I think this is in my top anime list and it might be hard to push it out.

B000002L99|1.0|Van Halen from 1978-1985 was one of the greatest bands of all time.  Just listen to how awesome their self titled 1978 debut album is.  What style, what showmanship!  They epitomised rock n roll! <br /> <br />The Hagar era Van Halen on the other hand is truely pathetic and horrible.  This is when Eddie and the boys decided that money was more important than musical quality.  They pu.s.s.ified their music in order to have a hit on the radio.  This album sounds so wimpy compared to their earlier albums!  Where is the showmanship?  Where are the dazzling, flashy, over the top guitar parts?  Where are all those things Van Halen are famous for?  Oh thats right, that kind of thing doesn't sell on the radio, so they quit playing that way.  Instead they decided to play wimpy radio rock tailor made for top 40 radio, like an 80s version of Creed or Nickelback! <br /> <br />If you want to hear a great rock band in their prime, go pick up Van Halen, Van Halen II, Women and Children First, Fair Warning, Diver Down, or 1984.  And if you love the bland \\"Radio rock\\" of Nickelback, Creed, or 3 Doors Down, go ahead and get anything from the Hagar era.  You'll probably like it too!
0385121679|5.0|This is the first book by Stephen King I have read, and if the quality of writing on offer here is anything to go by, it sure as hell won't be the last. This isn't just a high point of the horror genre; \\"The Shining\\" could well be one of the best works of fiction seen in our time. <br /> <br />The Shining is a work of brilliance in almost every possible way, in plot, characterisation and atmosphere. The fact that there are only three major characters (well, four towards the end) would make you think that the story would be a little slow to get off the ground. However, Stephen King incorporates so many layers into his writing - Jack and Wendy's ailing marriage, Jack's alcoholism, Danny's \\"gift\\"... the list is near endless - that \\"The Shining\\"'s grip on you never lets up. The suspense present in the writing is omnipresent, and only grows stronger and stronger as the story goes on. The sense of isolation present in the Overlook gives the Shining its near-tangible atmosphere. As the reader, you are bound to become paranoid, always looking over your metaphorical shoulder for something just out of sight. King's style and lushly descriptive writing can make even remotely unusual events chill you to the bone. And what's more is that you are well rewarded for sticking with the story: \\"The Shining\\" has, in it's pages given me the kind of scares that I previously didn't think were possible to get from a book. <br /> <br />And amidst all of this atmosphere, King doesn't compromise on characterisation. On the contrary, Wendy, Jack and Danny are three of the most three-dimensional, inately human characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about. Jack in particular was an interesting one. Seeing his progression from loving father and husband to a malevolent killer, due to the seduction of both his alcoholism and the supernatural forces at work in the Overlook, was a fascinating experience. There is an obvious parallel between Jack and Shakespeare's Macbeth, a famous literary character. Both were basically good people, but both were moulded into something evil by outside forces, ultimately leading to their demise. Wendy and Danny are both interesting to read about too: Wendy playing the role of the protective mother and suspicious wife, Danny the role of a child who'se eyes have seen things someone his age should never have to. All fit their roles like a glove thanks to King's subtle writing and cleverly event based character development. <br /> <br />And even amidst all of this atmosphere and character building, King never becomes lost in needless description the way a lesser author would. He keeps events in the Overlook moving at just the right pace; not so fast that the reader can see what's coming, yet not so slow that we can't see that the situation in the Overlook is growing progressively worse. <br /> <br />OK, I can see that by this point I'm probably just rambling. Even so, I've barely scratched the surface of \\"The Shining\\"'s excellence. It's harsh, dark, and sometimes terrifyingly suffocating, and yet still lush and inately human. I honestly can't reccomend it enough, and I'm certain that it will live on as a classic in generations to come. Praise be to Stephen King.  <br /> <br />

For those interested in improving their lives,their parenting skills, their leadership skills, their teaching skills and their relationship skills, this is a must read.<br /><br />Napoleon Hill, in Think and Grow Rich, stressed the importance of a positive mental attitude.  Normal Vincent Peale, in The Power of a Positive Mental Attitude, stressed the importance of a positive mental attitude.<br /><br />Dweck picks up where both of these very famous works fell short.  Both Hill and Peale understood the importance of a positive mental attitude.  But Dweck shows us how we develop fixed mindset attitudes in many areas of our lives and the damage our attitude inflicts on us and on those we interact with.  Instead of dwelling on positive or negative attitude, Dweck used the term fixed mindset and growth mindset.<br /><br />The book is not just theory.  Dweck explains how the fixed mindset was in part responsible for the downfall of Enron.  She also contrast the fixed mindset of basketball coach Bobby Knight with that of the growth mindset of legendary coach John Wooden (UCLA). The contrast and the results are startling.<br /><br />As far as parenting and teaching skills, there are some very valuable lessons.  We should learn to praise work and not talent.  No one ever failed by striving for constant learning.  History is littered with failures who relied on their God given talent.<br /><br />The book is a real eye-opener.  The fixed mindset verses growth mindset is not an either or situation.  We can possess a growth mindset in certain areas but a fixed mindset in other areas of our lives.  If you are honest, you will do some \\"Ahha\\" when you discover some fixed mindsets traits about yourself.<br /><br />If you are a teacher, you will be challenged to ask yourself are you doing the best job you can do.  There are some very inspiring stories about teachers doing outstanding jobs with childern everyone else had written off.<br /><br />Lastly, Dweck tells how we can develop a growth mindset and improve our lives and the lives of those around us.ildern everyone else had written off. <br /> <br />Lastly, Dweck tells how we can develop a growth mindset and improve our lives and the lives of those around us. <br />

0765315246|4.0|What a marvelous, actually old fashioned, hard scifi story!  When I read the blurb that compared the author to Heinlein, I thought \\"sure..... impossible!\\"  But I really did feel like I was reading some of Mr. Heinlein's books!  And I mean that as the highest possible compliment!  This was pure adventure -- no complicated social issues, but I can see how, in a series, such might arise!  Imagine a universe where 75-year-olds sign up for a kind of galactic army, fighting aliens that threaten earth colonists.  Imagine having youth again, but this time \\"augmented,\\" so to speak.  I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to readers who enjoy the genre!

The things that I did like about the book is the bonds between the mothers and their children and also how the tribes come together. This book should be taught in school but no below the 11th grade because some people may be to immature to read it before then.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers started in 1983. It is now 2006. Does the music still hold up? First, the music is different. Let me throw out the funk/punk/alternative rock description everyone gives to their beginning sound. In truth, the Red Hot Chili Peppers defied those sounds and played music they felt was uncompromising, gritty, and fun. They melded the music they loved into a sound they loved: the punk, funk, rock, rap, hardcore, soul, blues, jazz, and whatever else, even classical. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were lovers of all music; if it was good, it was music.  <br /> <br />I'll skip over the album by album previews and get to this one (you can get those anywhere, but listening to the albums themselves is the best way to determine where your loyalty to the band lays). Stadium Arcadium is a double-disc album. I have listened to it about six or seven times over. The beginning sound I spoke earlier about was much mellowed and forcefully subdued. In other words, popified. Some tracks did harken back to Californication, but more were reminiscent of By The Way, the most disappointing Chili Peppers album. Being a double disc, there are more songs, so the disappointment is not as pronounced. But, the feeling that the album could be condensed into a more managable and better mixed album is irrepressible.  <br /> <br />This could have been a step forward to taking what they had in Californication ,destroyed in By The Way, and revving it into an incredible \\"comback\\" album. Unfortunately, this is The Red Hot Chili Peppers complacent and pop-fueled, just less so than in By The Way. People will like it, people will buy it, just as they did with By The Way. But, true fans will compare and find what they loved lacking.  <br /> <br />Also, the misconception people have of \\"Under the Bridge\\" being a crossover tune must be debunked. It was a step to maturity for the band, much like \\"Everlong\\" was for the Foo Fighters. The same argument for it to be a crossover tune could be applied to \\"I Could Have Lied\\", but nobody even mentions the song because of the fact it very clearly states its maturity in both the music and lyrics, as did \\"Under The Bridge\\".
B000002KMY|5.0|This is  one of Sabbath's best albums. They seem to have it all at this point...great songwriting, vocals, guitar hooks, bass-&-drums. Fantastic heavy sond. From start to finish this collection of songs takes you on a fantastic listening journey. It doesn't matter if you like OZZY or DIO this is one excellent album!!!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I and my family enjoyed this movie immensely.  It is the story of wayward, impossible children taught to behave by a strange,magical nanny.  Sound familiar?  What makes this one stand out is the outstanding performance by first-rate actors, an absolutely fabulous visual realization in set and costumes, and a certain strange, not so sweet bit throughout.  The father, for example, is the undertaker of the little village -- his two assistants played amazingly and wonderfully by Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow.  And who will ever forget Imelda Staunton in a showpiece small role?  I recommend this DVD 100% to those who enjoy silliness and happy endings with a bit of flavor!
0385474547|4.0|I like the book some parts were quite interesting. At fiorst it was very capturing I enjoyed this book alot. I would encourage everyone read it.

B000001GRZ|5.0|This is such a beautiful album. True it is not for the mainstream, but it is a great work of art, and you can easily hear it. I have other versions of the Cello Suites, but this is the best.  If you are looking for some music to relax to, or want to start a classical collection this is a great place to start. You may have heard a lot of bach's melodies, but did not know that he wrote them. Very enjoyable music from a true legend. I am giving it a 6 star rating.

1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is told by a 15 year old English boy named Christopher Boone. He is a high-functioning autistic, quite brilliant at Maths but with considerable difficulties in social interaction. He lives with his father in Swindon, and his mother is dead. One day he notices his neighbour's dog dead on her lawn, apparently killed with a garden fork. He decides to investigate this killing. <br /> <br />But this investigation isn't much to the liking of his father or the dog's owner or the police. And in the course of his investigations he makes some rather shattering discoveries, that shed not entirely pleasant light on his father's character, his father's relationship with his mother, and on Christopher's future prospects. Christopher doesn't precisely solve the dog's killing (though he does learn the identity of the killer), but he does learn a lot about his own life. <br /> <br />The heart of the story, of course, is Christopher's character. He is an appealing narrator, and very interesting. His -- not precisely disabilities, but differences, are fascinating. His parents, and their difficulties, are portrayed, it seemed to me, quite fairly -- they are real if quite flawed. And the story packs considerable emotional punch. <br />
B00008O31H|5.0|This is without question the best CD I have bought in years!!! I have had it for 48 hours and have listened to it over a dozen times and turned at least 6 other people into fans!!Buy this  CD and try to play it only once. These songs will stay with you for hours after listening, that is if you can go hours without cranking it back up. If you like any form of the Blues this is a MUST have CD. I will sum it up with Raw, Nasty ,Grimy and powerful a 2 man band should not make this much sound!!!! Buy IT Now!!!
0385474547|3.0|This book was an okay book but it was just alittle hard to understand with the words. But tha t was messed how they took Ikemfuna in the forest and killed him and the ending was also messed up how Okonkwo killed himself at the end of the story how how you going to end the book with the main character killing himself. But in other words the book was okay.
B00000K3CM|4.0|Macaulay Culkin rose to fame as Kevin McCallister in 1990's blockbuster comedy Home Alone.    2 years later, and with an 8 million dollar salary, the highest amount ever offered to a child actor, Culkin returned to the big screen after the mild success of 1991's My Girl in a sequel to his starmaking hit.     Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is another hilarious movie produced and written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire). Returning for the sequel are Joe Pesci (Goodfellas) and Daniel Stern (City Slickers) as dumb burglars Harry and Marvin, John Heard (187) and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice) as Kevin's parents, the McCallisters, and the entire McCallister family. On board this time around is a hilarious cast including Tim Curry (Oscar), and Rob Schneider (Demolition Man).    Exactly a year has passed since the fateful winter, and the McCallister family again rush to the airport, this time to catch a flight to Florida. Kevin lags behind and accidentally takes the flight to New York, hence the title. It turns out that the 'wet bandits' Harry and Marvin have escaped from prison from Illinois and made to the city that never sleeps. The two theives set a plan to rob a local toy store called Duncan's Toy Chest that Kevin find interest in because the store's manager donates all of the money he gets on the holiday to the children's hospital. In the meantime, Kevin tours the city and checks himself into New York's finest hotel, The Plaza, where the Hotel Concierge, played by Curry, and the bellboy, played by Schneider, become suspicious of the young boy who's dad they never see. Anyways, the burglars bump into Kevin again and are in for yet another failed heist due to Kevin's wit and all the goodies and traps that he has set up for their painful pleasure!    The movie is funny, but it has a similar plot to the original. I'm sure many people who watched the movie in 1992 felt they were watching Home Alone again, which explains why the sequel made less money at the box office than the original.    Keep an eye out for former brat-packer Ally Sheedy, who worked with John Hughes in the 1985 classic The Breakfast Club, as a New York ticket agent.    Recommended    B+
B00005JOVN|4.0|This energetic, fast paced remake does not waste any time with tedious character development.  It cuts to the action and never lets up.<br /><br />Here's state of the art filmmakling by a pro director who know exactly what he's doing.  Great sets and claustrophobic sequences with flooding and fire and falling objects look real.<br /><br />Yes, it's all over the top stuff but this is what popcorn movies are all about.  I liked this one a lot better than the ridiculous M:I:III.  No one going into this movie should be surprised at the premise or plot, that's not the point.  The idea is seeing a high tech remake of something with which we are already familiar.  And on that basis, this movie delivers.  This is not an art film.  So the bashing by other reviewers is uncalled for.
0066620996|2.0|As someone with a business degree (University of Alabama), \\"Good to Great\\" was simply one of those books that you just had to read. The book simply sold so many copies and generated so much publicity that it was almost impossible to ignore. I even heard fellow undergraduate students, who generally do not have the greatest penchant for reading, talking about how good it was. So I bit the bullet, and for Christmas a couple of years ago I got the book and read it over the next few days. To be brutally honest, I came away very unimpressed. The book was so incredibly simple that it was almost painful. It says \\"great\\" companies have \\"Level 5 leaders\\", whatever in the hell that means in real terms, and as far as I can tell it means little, if anything at all. Furthermore, \\"great\\" companies stay focused, don't become complacent, have passionate workers, and have cultures that openly embrace constant change. But of course there is absolutely nothing profound about that; almost anyone could probably figure that out if he really thought about it. I mean really, what business scholar has ever advanced the argument that to be a great company, you need an egotistical leader who takes all of the credit, an organization not focused on anything, an organization that is wholly complacent, have workers who have no feeling for anything, and have rigid structures? <br /> <br />Of course, any leigitimate student of business inherently knows that generally speaking all of the things that Collins describes are things that you want in your company, that isn't the problem. The problem is figuring out how you do those things. Exactly how do you recruit great leaders, how do you keep your company focused on what is important, how do you make your workers care? As the saying goes, the devil is in the details. <br /> <br />All in all, the book was simply not thought-provoking. When I read \\"In Search of Excellence\\", or one of Drucker's great books, they all made me think deeply about the subjectat hand. With great business books such as those, you really do not read them as much as you fight through the them, with all of your intellectual abilities at full capacity trying to wrap your mind around the nuances of the text. \\"Good to Great\\", however, does no such thing; it reads more like a fiction novel, something not to truly analyze, but something to read over in a few days. <br /> <br />All told, if you have a few bucks to blow on a management book, I would suggest countless others before this one. I really do not see where this book gives a deep analysis of management problems, and I really do not feel that the \\"solutions\\" that it offers are unique to this book. Much to the contrary, the majority of the \\"solutions\\" in this book are your typical, generic ideas that are easy to think of, but are hard to actually implement in an organization.  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I heard sooooooo many good things about this movie, then I finally got to see it.  I turned it off halfway through.  I mean, come on!  This is just some listless Gen-X slackers plodding their way through their banal lives, barely caring enough to even react to anything.  It's like they're watching their own lives on TV and aren't the least bit involved or even interested.  I've seen this done so many times before, and every one of those efforts was vastly superior to this one.  Check out Clockwatchers if you want to see this movie done with sympathetic characters and genuine wit.  Check out Free Enterprise if you want to see the Trekkie spin on it, once again with sympathetic characters and genuine wit.  In fact, if the makers of this film would like to come over to my house and watch me and my roommate and our girlfriends sitting around bored for a couple of days, you'd have a film that was 10 times funnier than this rubbish. <br /> <br />I didn't even make it to the part with the zombies.  They probably had more life to them than the living characters.  They couldn't possibly have had less.
B00005JOVN|3.0|MOVIE: Wolfgang Petersen has been a pretty consistent director when it comes to big bombastic CGI driven movies. He has never really made an excellent film, but he has done good work.  The Perfect Storm was a good story and handled very well, while Air Force One was an intense thriller that had all the right ingrediants to work so well. Troy was considered by many to be a bad movie, but I found it to have a great vision on Petersen's part that resulted in a very enjoyable blockbuster. Now Wolfgang Petersen hits the screen with his next blockbuster wannabe, Poseidon. A remake of the 1972 The Poseidon Adventure. Nothing new to report here, but remakes never capture the essence of the originals, it just seems like a fact that Hollywood doesn't care about. The film tells the disasterous tale of a cruise ship that gets hit by a rogue wave in the middle of the ocean, and that's about it. The film is a short 1 hour, 48 minutes. Short in terms of movies in the same genre. The script is contrived and full of cardboard characters and wooden dialogue. It's nothing but one clich? after another and just makes excuses to show more amazing CGI and \\"been there, done that\\" escape sequences. Sure the movie has incredible CGI and some amazing set design, but at what cost? My rule of thumb is that you cannot sacrifice story for action, which is just what this movie did. The dialogue and the characters were merely lead-ins to the next action sequence. No character development was done, which basically says \\"okay, don't care about the characters, just watch this ship rollover.\\" Mark Protosevich was the film's screenwriter, and this is only his second screenplay, which shows his lack of experience and really his screenplay is the thorn in this movie's side. Petersen does a great job at directing the action, William Sandell's (Master & Commander) production design is spectacular, and Klaus Badelt's score is intense and in your face. However it is the script, the backbone of a film, that is lacking and thus creates a very lackluster experience.<br /><br />ACTING: When you hear a cast listing like this movie has, you have certain expectations. There is some great talent in the film, but what can you say about the acting if the script is horrible. Some of the lines that are delivered are laughably bad. In one scene Josh Lucas tells Kurt Russell who is a former firefighter, \\"I work better on my own . . . no offense\\". In which Russell replies, \\"None taken\\". You can't get much better than that.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Is it clich?d? Yes. Has it been done before? Many times. Do we care about the characters? No. However, you can't help but feel a little entertained by the overwritten score by Klaus Badelt and the bombastic CGI scenes as the ship turns belly up. It'll be a good DVD to give your home theater a workout.lacking and thus creates a very lackluster experience.

1904920209|4.0|The book won the IACP  award for the \\"Best First Cookery Book\\" and was overall winner of the \\"IACP 2006 Cookbook of the Year\\". With a recommendation like that, it would seem that this is bread book that is hard to beat. I have made a few of his recipes, watched the very good DVD, and studied the book closely. I made fougasse, bread shots, baguette, epis, focaccia, and a couple of others. <br />    I had to be very careful using the book because of the numerous confusions and inconsistencies. For example, a recipe ( page 33) calls for \\"1/3 ounce (10g) fresh yeast, 18 ounces (no grams specified) white bread flour, and 12 1/2 ounces water (or 13 fl. oz. in a measuring cup - just over 1 1/2 cups, but weighing is more accurate). Notice the confusion between avoirdupois ounces and fluid ounces. Other recipes combine fluid ounces, avoirdupois ounces, and tablespoons. I am also unsure if he uses British fluid ounces or American fluid ounces; there is a difference in weight.  <br />    Bertinet is a French baker who runs a cooking school in Bath, England. It's interesting that in the list of credits, among the Copy editor and the Indexer, there is an \\"Americaniser\\", a job I have never heard of before! It is obvious that no one proofed this book as well as they did the bread. Indeed, I wonder if, in picking this book for the prize, anyone actually made any of the bread or if they just liked the look of the book and the fact that it had a DVD with it.  <br />    Actually the book is good and the recommended way of handling the dough makes an excellent crumb. The baguettes and epis were great. I think it's a pretty good book for the home baker once the reader can figure out the recipes.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|What I like best about this movie is that I can see the story played out thousands of times in real life. Our American society isn't as progressive as a lot of people may think. We may pat ourselves on the back, thinking we're glad \\"those days\\" are over, but be careful what we take credit for.  <br /> <br />Brokeback is ultimately about one person realizing that just because you love someone it doesn't mean you can be with that person. Life won't let you or maybe it's society, or maybe you're not allowing yourself. Regardless of the why, it's just not possible. And knowing you can't be with that person makes you miserable. But just because you're miserable doesn't mean you can go against something you know in your heart to be impossible. Love concurs all? No it doesn't. In 2006, it can still be dangerous to love someone of a different class or race or of the same gender.  <br /> <br />So why watch the movie? Because the story is excellent. Because it shows the debth of what love can be. Because this is real life. To me it represents the lives of people who for whatever reason haven't been able to be with the person they really want to be with in life. From an artistic standpoint, it really delivers. The actors are brillant. This movie is art, not about putting any kind of story together to sell tickets.  <br /> <br />I don't know how many of these nearly 800 reviews you'll read before you decide to watch the movie. But you're in for a real treat.
B000065KH4|3.0|This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile.<br /><br />Vianne is kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town. What happens in this town, however, ultimately changes the lives of its mayor, the villagers, and even Vianne, forever.<br /><br />This is a lovely, well acted, and moderately entertaining film, that thematically deals with the mystical, sensual, and palliative properties of chocolate. It is a frothy, pleasant confection. If you want a film, dealing with a similar theme, that will fully satisfy an appetite, however, one need look no further than the superb film, \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\".y until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town.

0385474547|1.0|I can't type anything because I did'nt read this book or I did'nt pay much attention to the story because it did'nt catch my intrest; but I could tell you that Onkonkwo was very abusive to his family and he made his son feel low because he wanted him to be a man and he did'nt want him to be like his father because his father was an man who did nothing but play a flute and ask people for money to drink up. He also treated him that way because he wanted him to keep continue a strong family and not make an mistake to weaken the family. He also treated his wives like crap and he showed no respect to them, but when Ikemefuna came to his house most of the things change because he quit beating his son and he treated his son with some respect.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|...and I have to say \\"Wow!\\". What a movie it was back in the late 97, and still is today after this sorely missed proper treatment. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. And having been, since I was a little boy, very interested in the facts and myths about the famous and haunting ocean liner, you'd have no idea how much I was looking forwards to see the beautiful Titanic brought back up to the surface again... and again and again. I think I saw it three times in the theatres which is to say I was not disappointed. Maybe I thought that they'd overdone the action just a bit the first time, but still. I was overwhelmed by the amazing effects, the ship, the filming, the music, the acting, the presisements of the shots of historical facts between the story being told on the screen (you really learn how to value all that planning and timing watching the extra material on the new edition, really impressive and a reason to love the movie itself). <br /> <br />Many reviewers have stated this already and written excellent facts about the movie and the various editions so I wont waste anymore of your (nor my) time. If you haven't seen \\"Titanic\\" already, well, what are you waiting for? And if you likes the movie, and you're curious about how they managed to do some of the amazing shots, my response is the same. This should belong in your dvd-collection. <br /> <br />About the deleted scenes (one of the main reasons why I bought this) I have to say I would have enjoyed an extended edition of the movie. This because a lot of the edited material would have done anything but ruined the film. Some of the shots I can understand were cut, but a couple exlaines a little more about the eager for \\"The heart of the ocean\\" the treasure hunters were having despite the old lady Roses' story about what really happened on the ship before it's tragical fate.  <br /> <br />Thank God they didn't use the alternate ending, what an extra disaster that would have been. I was actually surprised they'd even come up with that as an outcome of the amazing story, and it actually looks like a parody or something -but they didn't use it, and that's what's important. The original ending proves that sometimes less is more. And what a perfect ending! <br /> <br />Highly recommended, if not larger it is as large as life! <br /> <br />
B000002U9E|5.0|I saw Kate Bush in a dream last night, for only the second time (the first was before the release of _The Sensual World_). This is why I am here now. <br /> <br />I first heard Kate Bush on the radio while on the graveyard shift at work, in 1985.  I was intrigued by the unusual sound of the music, and for a wonder, the DJ actually gave the name of the song, the album, and the artist -- it was Kate Bush singing \\"Running Up that Hill\\" on _Hounds of Love_.  I went and bought the album, and though it didn't hugely impress me at first, it grew on me.  The music on this album has a cryptic mysterious quality that one finds only in the greatest of art.   <br /> <br />All of Kate's albums are at least very good, but this one is the best, and is my all-time favorite (see review title).  There is a remastered edition of this CD with bonus tracks, but the original edition maintains an artistic unity which in my opinion is vitiated by the extra material.  You would do well to buy either. <br /> <br />
B000000OQF|1.0|guns and roses what can i say except for the fact i hate them with a passion any questions about this non talented band.....
B000EGF0B4|4.0|I waited to see this film divorced from the hype on it's initial release.  Anybody reluctant to see this film can relax because it's not going to change your inclinations.  Is this a great film?  That's debatable but it is a very good one.  I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.  He allows the story to develope deliberately.  He doesn't shy away from the provocative nature of Ennis and Jack's relationship but it is told with discretion and taste.  Another thing that impressed me was the towering performance by Heath Ledger as Ennis.  Ennis is a taciturn man who does not verbalize his emotions but allows them to burn inside.  This kind of role in the wrong hands could come off as one note but Ledger pulls it off brilliantly.  Jake Gyllenhall is fine as Jack but his performance pales in comparison to Ledger's.  Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.  Another bonus is the splendid cinematography and the touching score.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I've been going through the reviews, whereas most of them are positive and sensible, some others make me wonder what the hell is wrong with mankind.  Don't get me wrong, I truly believe everyone is entitled to their opinions, but most negative remarks on this subject seem to preaching their own sputter as fact and not realizing the beauty of FICTION. <br /> <br />Very few movies will I ever give 5 stars, but don't for a second think that means I'm not a movie fan.  I'm a movie FREAK.  I love everything about the industry and am even working towards being a part of it.  I (try to) write my own screenplays and, although biased in my opinion, I think I'm pretty decent at it.  This movie, to me, is the kind that I would gladly be a part of making any day.  From the original ideas that it was structured upon, to the visual effects - gritty and as dark as the environment they're placed in, to the actors and actresses chosen for the characters.  And, let me be VERY clear, I'm not a big fan of Portman in the least.  However, the more movies she does like this one the more and more I will come to appreciate her talent. <br /> <br />Those of you looking for a review about this movie because you have yet to see it, here is my opinion and some background to the film (no terrible spoilers included): <br /> <br />A harsh, dark reality is painted from the first few moments of this movie, that make you appreciate how our society is now and what you have.  And our society isn't all too wonderful in the here and now, but you will relate IMMEDIATELY to the characters within.  Although Evey Hammond doesn't match the attitude of the original comic character in this movie, she still portrays the type of person you'd expect to find in this society.  She's scared of the powerful regime running the country and she's trying to follow rules, but she still has just enough fight in her to make it obvious that she's one of the few who would understand V's plight. <br /> <br />Now V, although sometimes cheesy and quite odd (not sure yet if his \\"v\\"-words speech was well placed), is a perfect lovable and deeply interesting anti-hero.  He's a terrorist, make no mistake.  But his terror is aimed at a totalitarian government that would rather own its citizens than protect their freedoms.  How can you say the fight isn't a just one?  If you disagree with terrorism as a means to fight unjust powers, then you need to read Fahernheit 451 and Orwell's 1984; watch Logan's Run, and so many more.  Get over yourselves.  Terrorism is only wrong to the powers that it opposes. <br /> <br />The story is woven perfectly, giving just enough background and plot at the right moments.  Right when you're asking questions in your mind about why something is the way it is, you're given the information from dialogue or imagery...but JUST enough without spilling too much too soon.  The middle section is definately slower than how the film starts, as some others have mentioned, but what did you expect?  If a movie stays in a constant climactic state, it would be useless.  QUALITY people, not QUANTITY.  I don't think people understand that anymore, especially Americans.  We (most of us, not all) want more, more, more and when we don't get it we complain.  If you got to eat your favorite food every day for months, do you honestly think it'd still be your favorite anymore? <br /> <br />The power of this film is not in its action sequences, it's not in its dramatic struggle, it's not in its good acting - it's in its thought-provoking questions that it raises.  As bizarre as it is, the personal questions you will be asking yourself at the end are exactly why this movie will remain on the \\"A List\\" for a very long time.  Because those questions can never be answered until something horrible changes our lives forever.  \\"What would I do in that situation?\\"  \\"How could a government ever get that way?\\"  \\"Why must terrorism be used to counter-act political giants?\\"  They can be debated, but untimately fall to nothing more than opinion.   <br /> <br />You'll read some negative reviews here with people saying, \\"Don't see this movie because it exonerates terrorism.\\"  \\"It's fascism rhetoric.\\"  \\"The characters are two dimensional and unrelatable.\\"  The point of this movie is that people, as narrow-minded as they are, are still free enough to have those kind of opinions.  You'd think they'd appreciate the irony more. <br /> <br />Personally, I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD so I can study it and learn how to craft my own beautiful and horrific stories...

B000F0UV0E|5.0|From his first album, I became fan of Mark Knopfler and I think nothing he's done as a solo artist can compare to this new album of duets with Emmy Lou Harris. To date this is Knopfler's best effort. One of the highlights of this release is Emmy Lou's vocals, his impressive once again!<br /><br />\\"This Is Us\\" is remescient of Knopfler's later Dire Straits days (\\"On Every Street\\" Album), and makes the perfect hit single! \\"Red Swaggering\\" has a very upbeat country/bluegrass sound and is also an instant favorite. The two songs Emmy Lou wrote \\"Belle Star\\" and \\"Love And Happiness\\" are fantastic. \\"Belle Star\\" is upbeat and what a perfect blend of M.K.'s voice with Emmy Lou's! \\"Love and Happiness\\" is a beautiful ballad, as well as the title track: \\"All The Roadrunning.<br /><br />This was something of a risky undertaking for Knopfler given his macho guitar image (which is normally a guy thing). However the ladies are gonna love this album also. The music and lyrics are all originals are are beautiful!
B000002LVB|2.0|But this would have worked so much better as a Lou Reed solo album.  After 3 masterful albums, including one that could make a serious claim as the best of all time, with another as the most inifluential, they put out this poppy rock album that was so loaded with pop tunes it largely overshadows whatever merits it has.  As far as being avante-garde, it doesn't compare to their first two albums at all.  As far as stripped down rock songs go, their third album destroys \\"Loaded.\\"  The actual sounds remind me mmore of Lou Reed's solo stuff, like \\"New York\\" or \\"Transformer,\\" only I think those albums had more passion and guts than this one.  But, still, it has it's merits.  The songs aren't terrible, though none are great.  The real problem I have with the album is the name.  As a Lou Reed solo album I wouldn't be so harsh.  As a Velvet Underground album, it fails miserably.  I wouldn't trade a single \\"Venus in Furs\\" or \\"Sister Ray\\" for this entire album, and that should never happen.
B000002J0N|4.0|Right when you see the album cover, you know that something is very different here. I know that these guys didn't release Deja Vu, and then dissapear for six years, but when you look at their first album, with the same three old friends on the cover, and then this one, you can't help but feel like time had so quickly gone by.  David Crosby's hair line is now on top of his head, Stills doesn't look so young, and the wrinkles on Graham Nash's face are so strange to see. <br /> <br />So obviously these guys had grown up at this point, and certainly, so had the music.  Most all the songs are very laid back, and many of them trade in the guitars for pianos.  There's no epic \\"Carry On\\" on this album.  To tell the truth, there really isn't a track on the whole album that really carries it.  It's just easy-going, well evolved music.  These guys weren't kids anymore at this point, and it shows. <br /> <br />But it still is the same three fellows.  The harmonies are there, and every song on here is solid. I think the only down-side here is that you see your heros getting old.  Listening to this album was like watching your father getting old.  He's still the same man he's always been, but he's slowing down, and can't quite do the same things he used to.
B000005S37|4.0|Not a great album, but none the less a good one on it's own terms.  This album is the epitome of being an artist, and one should go in and know that this is a museum piece, not a cruising on a saturday night piece.  All I know is, i've drawn on it as an influence, though I don't know what a good idea it was as an entire album.  But seriously, outside of Zappa, who else ever would have had the balls to make this album?  And who else could have pulled it off like Reed?
B00005RFGF|4.0|Great film all in all.  Shame about Mel Gibson's acting, and various historical inaccuracies.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a film that is able to locate poignancy in the most foreign situation, one that is completely removed (at least ostensibly) from the experiences of your everyday Joe. There is a cord of universal truth that Ang Lee strikes through the film's central relationship, and the director explores with unerring grace and sensitivity the heartbreak that results from its inability to grow into something real and definable. Ennis (a flooring Ledger) and Jack (a very good Gyllenhaal) are constantly at odds with the constructs of their society, and as a result, their relationship remains perpetually thwarted; the realization that they need each other in the most primal way stymied. Lee draws the trajectory of their relationship with notable restraint, mirroring the social climate of 60s/70s Wyoming and also hinting at the insatiable thirst for personal freedom that writes underneath its machismo-laden surface. The tragedy of Brokeback Mountain ultimately lies in the failure between Ennis and Jack to reconcile their desires for one another, and it is the moment of recognition on the part of the former that marks the film's soaring emotional crescendo, the power of which is only deepened by the sense of loss that precedes it. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie in the most fundamental sense; it is a love story set amidst the backdrop of an imprisoning society, and a haunting study of how people can sometimes only change after it is too late.
0060989157|5.0|This was an awesome book. From how they first started out right up to current, sparing no one, gory details galore. The best writing, hands down, was from Nikki.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Ok, first off, about the review titled \\"A Kid's Review\\", you gotta ask yourself, should \\"a kid\\" really be watching a movie thats rated R? The film is gritty, dark, violent, and recreates the comic books its based on perfectly. That individual had a problem with having to suspend disbelief. To me, thats a given with a movie like this, ITS ESCAPIST SCINEMA THATS BASED ON A SERIES OF COMIC BOOKS FOR GOD'S SAKE! Its not supposed to be realistic, its set in a made up location specifically so the viewer knows its not supposed to be realistic. If thats your main gripe about this movie, you should be giving it more that 2.5 stars, because thats a given with movies, it isn't a problem with it.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|like many other people have written this movie is a lot more than a couple of gay cowboys. this is a testament to the type of hold love can have on people, especially when it comes from the most unexpected places. it also speaks loads about the way some places in america engender a way of thinking. ennis is the prime example of this thinking. as a boy he was shown a hate crime by his father and to ennis that is what will happen to him if he and jack twist were to be together. although ennis does not speak very much, when he does open his mouth he means what he says. he is the type of character that really does think before he speaks and acts. he is a very simple man, but on the inside he is full of conflict. everything is very basic and straightforward, he knows what he can and cant do. he really only comes out of his shell and is his true self only when he believes that people are not looking. ennis is the realist and jack is the optimist. jack can see them together and wants them to be together. he sees a future for them and is completely crushed every time he has to leave ennis because it can never be how he wants it to. ennis states that \\"if you cant fix it then you have to stand it.\\" that is the truest statement in the movie. it holds true for both men, but it seems to manifest in different ways for them. this movies gathers it's power from basic human needs. the whole relationship stems from the need to be with another person, not only emotionally but physically as well. both men are thrown together and the reason they turn to each other is because they only have each other. the fact that each man realizes that the love they share is pure is also the root of their torment. both do what is expected of them from society, married and children, however neither one can really shake the other. both men hold onto the love that they share. both of their lives would be simpler if they could let each other go but love in its most basic form will not release them from it's bonds. eventually one falls to the reality that ennis fears the most, and in my opinion the other is left to regret not being able to have said goodbye or for that matter be with the one person he truly loved. everything about this movie is moving. i think that it is a shame that heath ledger is garnering most of the attention for this movie. i do not mean that he does not do a good job, he is excellent as ennis del mar. however, there are two actors in this movie and jake gyllenhall deserves just as much praise as ledger. i think that this movies stands a very good chance to capture the oscar for best picture and i think that it would be a great day if a movie dealing with gay issues of this magnitude would be step forward in the constant war of equal rights. this movie shows that there is love between same sexes and the only reason that it is hidden is because society cant handle what it finds different and i think that this movie shows that love is love no matter who you give it to and who it is shared with.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This is a smart, well-crafted heist movie, which I enjoyed much more than the earlier The Heist (which was just too overly clever what with all the back-up plans and the self-consciously cool dialog). The three main actors, Brando, Norton, and De Niro all turn in exemplary performances, probably the one and only time all three ever worked togegther. Watching De Niro use all his safe-cracking skills is fascinating, something most of us probably know nothing about. After all, one doesn't meet high-level safe-crackers every day. :-) The safe-cracking scene with the thermal torch made for some spectacular cinematography what with all the sparks, and the way De Niro figures out how to open the safe so quickly is inspired. In the commentary on the DVD, they mention that's the way it actually happened when they filmed it, and it's another spectacular scene, but I won't say anything more so as not to spoil it for you. But you'll see what I mean when you come to it. The ending is also a surprise, and the unobstrusive musical score adds drama and some nice mood touches where they're appropriate. Overall a good flick and worth your time and money.
B000067CPX|5.0|By the Way is a logical progression from albums Californiacation and Blood Sugar Sex Magic, and whilst the album may not quite possess as many of the timeless classics of it's predecessors, the chilis have certainly become more consistent with hardly a skippable track on the album. <br /> <br />1- By the Way: 9/10 - Great rhythm, bass, and rap/rock voacls.

B00012QM8G|5.0|I wished someone could picture all the genocides that happened and happens throughout the world as touching as it was pictured in this movie.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|We swore not to compare it to the BBC miniseries. You can't improve on perfection. So, after hearing the rave reviews, we decided to throw caution to the wind and watch it, after swearing never, not once, to compare between the two.<br /><br />All in all, it wasn't a bad movie. The main problem lies in the confusing storyline which simply cannot be covered in such a short time. If I hadn't such an intimate knowledge of P&P before the movie, I would have been quite lost. This affects character developement and relationships. There are moments of quiet and pretty music but very little interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy.<br /><br />The feel of old-England society was lost, which leads to a lot of confusion. Why is it so terrible that Darcy won't dance with Elizabeth? Why are her sisters such an embarrasment when the parties they are in are as raucus as themselves? Being familiar with the book, I already knew, but the impact of the embarassing and moving moments were lost because the society that made them embarassing and moving were gone. Also, Elizabeth going out into the rain to get herself a towel off the line? *shakes head* The Bennets are not poor; they happen to be quite well-to-do, the only thing they don't have is dowries for the girls. You can have a huge income and not any money saved up. And admiring nude statues in Darcy's home? Uhh.. that's not right.<br /><br />The society portrayed in this movie was not the stuffy, prissy life of the upper-middle class, but more suited to the lower. Perhaps they meant to liven it up a bit by showing us the nitty-gritty side to life, but instead they spoiled the feeling of the whole society. Elizabeth and Jane giggling in bed? I don't know.. that's just not.. English.<br /><br />Keira Knightly is not a bad Elizabeth Bennet. She did justice to the role. Darcy talked to fast and was more quiet and laid back than arrogant and imposing. Also, he wasn't good-looking at all. Part of his personna is his hot animal attraction! Wickham was not only very likeable but gorgeous! That's not right! Darcy should be more cute! (Ok, enough juvenile complaints) Mr.Collins was.. not stupid. He was almost.. conniving. And handsome, too, if short. I really couldn't understand why Elizabeth could object so strongly to marry him especially considering her family's condition. It seemed.. selfish of her. Again, this is only looking at the movie as though I had never read the book before.<br /><br />THe movie was pretty, with beautiful music and nice acting. It had its good parts and carried the essence of the story pretty well. However, it left much to be desired and the characters weren't Jane Austen's own. I would have to recommend the BBC version.. the book there is played to perfection. But this is a good movie for your weekends as well.attraction! Wickham was not only very likeable but gorgeous!

B00005NB8K|2.0|If one word had to be used to describe Oliver Stone's rambling, chaotic, yet somehow peculiarly mesmerizing tribute to 1970's rock n' roll icon and \\"Doors\\" frontman Jim Morrison, it would have to be \\"disorienting\\".     Morrison's short life, if Stone's account is to be trusted, was a confused and hedonistic mess, a fact belied by the movie's lurching and delirious structure, which, in short, makes one's head spin unpleasantly and induces a sick, queasy feeling in the pit of one's stomach, a sensation which increases steadily as the film progresses and Morrison's biography becomes harder and harder to follow. The atmosphere of the 1960s and '70s, though, is vividly evoked, with lilting shots of colorfully costumed hippies, artists, and various eccentric loafers. The implication, however, is that these people, particularly the rebellious Morrison and his ilk, were \\"stoned\\" out of their gourds the entire time, thereby rendering their career and accomplishments meaningless (the lines between fiction and reality, for example, become inextricably blurred in one laughably excessive sequence in which Morrison & co. sit in the middle of an imaginary desert getting high on Acid, in the proccess coming up with the remarkable lyrics to \\"The End\\". I am an admirer of \\"The Doors\\" music, and would like to think there was a deeper significance to that song than some random \\"trip\\" Morrison took one day in mid 1964, or thereabouts).     Yet there are nevertheless exciting moments in this flawed feature, such as when Morrison defies the censorship of a couple of \\"square\\" music producers by refusing to alter the lyrics to one of the band's songs. The acting is generally without fault: Val Kilmer's performace captures to a T the confused wildness of Morrison's personality, his rebellious stance and desire to be seen as a poet (early scenes reveal subtly the influence of Arthur Rimbaud and Antonin Artaud). The last scene of the movie shows the subject's gravesite in France, making the point that he is more revered and remembered than a host of intellectuals and artists who preceded him (including, among their ranks, Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Moliere, Chopin and others). Whether or not Morrison is deserving of such prestige is a question the film leaves unanswered (though there are numerous implications toward the contrary), and it is one which the viewer will ultimately have to answer himself.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Even though as a muslim we do not believe that Jesus was crucified but was sent to heaven and Judea was taken mistakenly instead of him and he was the one who was crucified, I still loved the movie.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I loved this film. I have always been a big E. Annie Proulx fan and the movie certainly did her short story (of the same title) the proper justice.  <br />Aside from the absolutely breathtaking cinematography and perfectly customized soundtrack, this film encompasses the turmoil and heartbreak of an impossible love story. It is sad and touching and yet also a harsh reminder of the current of prejudices that comes up hard against homosexual/homosocial behavior.  <br />I praise Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger for their performances. They managed to be both passionately sexy and boyishly uncertain in their characters...tough and yielding simultaneously. I imagine they have done the author of this story proud. There was very little deviation from the original text, which, unfortunately, is a rarity. In my humble opinion, it will be difficult for either of these actors to top what they have done here. Bravo. Highly recommended.
B000002VCQ|4.0|Here's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  I listen to this album for the songs popularized on the radio.  They are the strongest on the album musically also.  \\"You Give Good Love,\\"  gives me goosebumps.  It has it all, Whitney hitting the high notes, clever lyrics, great music.  The songs that didn't make the top 40, I find to be pedestrian musically; yeah, you do get the great Whitney voice though.<br /><br />Buy this CD for the songs you know and love, \\"Saving My Love For You, \\"You Give Good Love,\\" etc.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I pre-ordered this cd about a month before it's release and had to endure a grueling wait for it's arrival.  Naturally, with the peppers being one of my favorite bands, I had high expectations.  When the day finally arrived and my cd showed up, I immediately played it and thought to myself wow.... this is dissappointing.  I thought the same thing most everyone reviewing this cd has, that there were too many consecutive slow songs, none of them very memorable, none very fresh.  It was a bummer, really.  But there was hope on the horizon.  I listened to the cd again a few times and suddenly the songs began to grow on me.  A few listens later and Stadium Arcadium is now my second favorite Chili Peppers album (the first being Californication).  This is not a cd that the peppers meant to be background music.  If the songs are not closely listened to, they lose all their beauty and become the \\"monotonous mid-tempo\\" songs most negative reviewers are complaining about.  Truth be told, the mid-tempo songs can be absolutely beautiful songs (Snow, Hey, Desecration Smile, Slow Cheetah, just to name a few)  If slower, more ballady songs aren't your thing, there is also a decent amount of rockers on Stadium Arcadium that would satisfy all but the most diehard early Peppers fanatics.  Keep in mind, my favorite Chili Peppers cd is Californication.  Many would argue and say Blood Sugar is the best, but I just can't resist the emotion and beauty of Californication.  It gives me chills every time I listen to it.  If you are among those who prefer the more Blood Sugar-esque albums to the later stuff, then this cd may come as a dissappointment to you.  For those of you like me who love the funk, but LOVE the more melodic Chili Peppers stuff, I strongly suggest you purchase this album and take time to listen to and absorb it.  In a time when the radio is cluttered with drek like Panic! at the Disco and Fall Out Boy, this cd gives me renewed hope for the survival of good modern rock music. 4 and a half stars
0765342294|4.0|Ender's Game is an emotionally powerful beginning to one of the Great Sci-Fi series. The writing is superb; Card genuinely evokes the emotions of his characters on every page. Ender's Game is one of those rare books that even years after reading it I can still recall how I felt as I turned the pages. I must say, however, that I found the Ender series to be profoundly disturbing and creepy - the the exploitation of child genius, the militarization of the world, not to mention the sadism of more than a few characters. Nonetheless, it took me three books to (I suppose reluctantly) reach the conclusion that as good as the writing was I really did not want to experience reading any more of it. John Updike (the Rabbit series) is the only other author I have felt the same way about; brilliant writing but a take on life I could live without.<br /><br />The writing is good enough that you really should read the book and decide for yourself whether the Creepy Quotient is too high.
1400032717|5.0|If you've ever wondered what it is like to be autistic, this book might be the closest you could come to discovering that. The narrarator is Christopher Boone, who is autistic. Through his story-telling, we see what his world is like. He doesn't understand sarcasm or jokes, he is overwhelmed in a place with too many signs because his brain must record them all instead of blocking them out and focusing on the task at hand, and he feels much greater kinship with animals than he does with other humans.  <br /> <br />But Christopher is forced to do many things he wouldn't normally do when he discovers his neighbor's dog has been killed. He becomes a \\"detective\\" to discover who killed Wellington, but he begins to discover a whole lot more than he bargained for, and much that was kept secret from him becomes revealed. Along the way, Christopher must talk to strangers, defy his father, find a train station, and navigate London's tube system, among other things. The story is touching and humorous as told through Christopher's eyes, making this a wonderful and fun read.
0393324818|4.0|\\"Moneyball\\" is an inside look into the mind and habits of Billy Beane, the general manager of the small market Oakland A's. Faced with the daunting project of building a roster on peanuts, Beane turns to the statistical analysis of Bill James, an outsider to baseball, a fan, a former bean factory employee. James now works for the Boston Red Sox.<br /><br />This is a book about baseball statistics. But it is not boring because Lewis profiles the players behind the numbers, like Chad Bradford, a terminally shy pitcher with a knuckle-scraping-ground underhand delivery, and Scott Hatteberg, the catcher with a bad arm who thought his playing days were over, only to be resurrected as a first baseman because Beane saw something valuable in Hatteberg's on-base percentage and ability to work the count (Hatteberg's lifetime batting average and power, stats most scouts consider essential, are nothing special).<br /><br />Jeremy Brown, the pudgy, overweight catcher (5'10'', 210)profiled in \\"Moneyball,\\" made his major league debut May 9, but has yet to appear in a game.<br /><br />\\"Moneyball\\" is a fun, brisk read. It gives a human faces to the baseball cattle market even as it portends the rise of the Harvard grads with their laptops.
0385474547|2.0|Two things I liked about this book was that Okonkwo was a brave and fearce man, and I like that Okonkwo was a pimp in his on way. <br /> <br />Two things I didn't like about the book was that I couldn't pronounce some of the names, and the way the book ended. <br /> <br />I think this book should not be read in school due the violence and killing.
0375703764|1.0|House of Leaves is about a story within a story.  It follows a drug addict loser from LA who finds various types or written material only to discover that it is a blind man's narration of a fictional film made by an amatuer film maker.  This film maker discovers that his new house is not all appeares to be as it is \\"alive\\" with many secrets.<br /><br />Throughout the book we read fictional footnote written by people that don't exist.  The point of these footnotes are to add atmosphere and realism but they are so abundant that they quickly get annoying and you will find yourself skipping them altogether.  The story of Johnny Truant (the deadbeat who finds the material) is weak and unreadable.  He slowly deteriorates psychologically as he gets further along and the whole time I was thinking why doesn't he stop but after a while I completely stopped carring.  Danielwski gives us no reason to really like any of the characters and the only redeeming part of the book is the actual exploration of the house which is probably 20% of the book.<br /><br />Along the way you have these incredibly lame sequences with one word per page.  Is this supposed to be dramatic?  You also get pages and pages of names refrenced as footnotes and pointless lists of nothing.  Reading paragraphs of commentary by fictional authors about secondary characters (like Karen) turns out to be boring and pointless because Danielewski just can't sell the environment.  Like other reveiewers, I felt the best part of the book was the exploration of the house and the letters from Johnny's mom.  In the end when you sort through all the garbage you have a decent short story that could be something more.  It's a shame the author didn't just commit to the \\"house\\" aspect and focus on that.<br /><br />I also found the book to be a physically wierd shape (which was neccesary because of the odd structures, crossed out sections and footnotes) and extremely hard to get used to holding.<br /><br />I commend Danielewskifor trying something different and to trying to create an almost external mythos and hype a la \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".  I agree with the Amazon blurb about how this is the literary equivalent but therein lies the problem as they are both lame.  (Although truthfully this is actually much worse as at least Blair Witch was fun for a few minutes)  In the end this book was just really boring and it was so pretenscious that I found myself laughing at it.  Also like other readers 2/3 of the way through I started skipping paragraphs here and there until I ultimately just started skimming the last 1/5th.<br /><br />Also, this book in inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18.  Explicit drug use and sexual situations.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Don't come to this House...
B000EMGAOY|5.0|On track twelve of the Mars disc titled \\"We Believe\\", lead singer Anthony Kiedis dares his listeners to answer the question. He sings...\\"the risk is it worth it? the disc is it perfect?\\" Allow the number 1 status this album currently holds on the top 100 albums chart and the number 1 spot that the single \\"Dani California\\" currently holds on the modern rock charts across the country and the rave reviews that \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" has been met with so far to answer your question. Yes the risk was worth it. And, while nothing in life is perfect, the disc comes pretty dam close. From the opening drum beats of \\"Dani California\\" to the powerful closing statement of \\"Death of a Martian\\", this record brings the listener into a world of pure rock bliss and musical perfection unlike any other album in a very long time. It is difficult to steer away from it and it is also difficult to not find yourself in a mellow, subtle groove when listening to the jazzy brilliance of tracks like \\"Hey\\" and \\"Desecration Smile\\". Im not one to harp on people's musical opinions, but if you dont find this album to be an incredible example of what music can do for the soul then there is something very wrong with you. Enclosed in this album are twenty eight songs that will offer something for everyone. This album is more of a valediction than a musical effort. It is one band saying to the world that they are changing. They are growin up. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the best out there right now, no matter what anyone will say. This album proves it. I do not wish to compare this to the Chili Peppers albums of old, but I think that the music contained in this album is far superior to anything they have done yet. Time will tell if songs like \\"Dani California\\", \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", and \\"Make You Feel Better\\" will become rock classics. As of right now though, it sure as hell looks that way.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|This album is absolutely perfect from start to finish.  This is what all these nu-metal bands WISHED they sounded like.  It has the perfect blend of singing and screaming, so as to not alienate anyone from any genre, while staying both heavy enough and catchy enough.  This is exactly what I was expecting after \\"Hand of Blood\\" and it's amazing.
B000060OFT|3.0|Okay, this movie is the kind of movie you either love or hate.  For me it's okay but not the best.  I saw this in my english class and I thought it was hilarious. <br /> <br />Some good points are that it appeals to a younger audience (ex: teens) and it still sticks to Shakespare's words.  Also just watching it it's hilarious!  It takes place in modern times.  Instead of swords they have guns but when they say \\"Put up your swords you know what to do,\\" they zoom in on the gun and it says swords.  It thought it was hilarious.  Also Leo Dicapro is in it. Enough said. <br /> <br />Some bad things about the movie is that it just doesn't make sense.  I think Shakespare's probably rolling over in his grave.  The passion between Claire Danes and Leo Dicapro just isn't there.  Also many people really don't like how it's so out of place because it takes place in the 90s.  It kind of seems like a \\"gangster\\" movie.  And also the famous balcony scene, the scene I was toally looking forward to, was a total disappointment. <br /> <br />Anyway, I don't really criticize films because I'm the kind of person that either loves it or hates.  So overall this was okay.  I give it a C-.  But, like I said, you wither love this movie or hate it.  I would recommend the `68 version of Romeo and Juliet over this version, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is extremely diverse, fun to listen to, and sonically impressive.  I'm not sure what more you can ask for. <br /> <br />This is one band that has NOT lost even an ounce of enthusiasm for what they do, and it shows!

Since then I have sold three short stories in the genre and know I could not have done it without the wisdom found in this book.

B000002H2H|5.0|In 1984 Metallica was finally ready to release it's 2nd album titled 'Ride The Lightning.'  This is a big step up from their debut 'Kill 'Em All.'  It's packed with great guitar riffs and beats by all the members.  These are the days with their original bassist, Cliff Burton, and he was definitely great at what he did.  Unfortunately he was killed not to long after this album was released, RIP.  As a huge Metallica fan, I am not at all disappointed with this album. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"Fight Fire With Fire,\\" starts off with a soft melody but don't be fooled by it.  It goes in to a great head banging beat, as does all the other tracks on this album do.  The title track \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is another fantastic track with a great opening.  The slowest song is \\"Fade To Black,\\" a song about suicide.  It's considered the best track on the album by many people.  This album has great lyrics all the way through and James voice was decent.  He gets better in the later albums, but it's a huge improvement compared to his voice on 'Kill 'Em All.'  My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Creeping Death,\\" \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fade To Black.\\"  The final track on the album is an instrumental song.  No lyrics what-so-ever in it, just Metallica rockin out for about 9 minutes.  It's also one of their finest instrumental tracks they've done.  Clocking in at about 48 minutes total, they do a good job of not going overboard with the length of their tracks, which they have been known to do from time to time.  I would suggest this album to any fan of rock music.  It's definitely heavy metal at its best.
1400079179|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a novel that wants to be a history book.  Dan Brown claims in his preface that the story is based on truth.  The truth he claims is that there is evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was not God incarnate but a mere mortal man with a wife and child. Jesus was executed and the line of His wife survives even today in the 21st century.  All this is tied up with \\"Holy Grail\\" mythology and a current time murder mystery.<br /><br />The \\"truths\\" Brown claims are based on what adherents claimed was \\"secret knowledge\\" about Jesus.  This is known by Bible scholars as \\"the Gnostic heresy\\".  These old blasphemies were dealt with in their initial, undeveloped form by Jesus' Apostles in their Biblical writings.  For example, the Apostle John quotes Jesus, in addressing the Sanhedrin as He was being tried for blasphemy in John 18:20.  This Scripture reads: \\"I have spoken openly to the world,\\" Jesus replied. \\"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.\\"<br /><br />Here Jesus Himself says that there is no secret knowledge about His ministry or teachings.  The premise of Dan Brown's blockbuster revision of Christianity is founded on the Gnostic heresy that was originally addressed by the New Testament writings of the Apostles John, Peter and Paul.  Gnosticism was further developed in the 2nd and 3rd centuries when the Gnostic \\"gospels\\" were written (gospel of Thomas, Philip, Mary, and the recently found fragment, the gospel of Judas, etc).  Gnosticism is about \\"secret knowledge\\" of Christ, given only to the anointed few.<br /><br />The above quote from the Gospel of John was written as early as 50 AD (twenty years after His crucifixion) and no later than 90 by John the Beloved, cousin of Jesus, brother of fellow Apostle James (who was beheaded for his faith in Christ).  This is historical fact agreed upon by virtually all Christian scholars, both liberal and conservative. This statement alone debunks the Gnostic heresy.<br /><br />Dan Brown's premise is that these old stories, which died on the vine before 400 AD,  says that there is secret information from Jesus about salvation and God that only the entrusted initiates into this truth may know.  Jesus was merely a prophet Who never claimed to be God.  Brown's premise continues by claiming that the Gnostic gospels were worthy as Scripture just as much as the Biblical Gospels.  In one point of the novel one of Brown's characters in the book claims that the Gnostic side was just the one that lost the argument but was really the truth.<br /><br />By writing this novel Brown does create one important opportunity for readers.  They can consider whether they believe his fiction or whether the Biblical accounts of Jesus are more persuasive.  He offers the reader the opportunity to become one of the Gnostic initiates into the secrets of the \\"truth\\" about Jesus.  It is apparently a powerful draw for many weak thinkers and poor students of truth.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a good pulp-fiction novel, but certainly not literature.  His premise of making his fiction \\"fact\\" makes a poor novel and is not history, just yellow journalism; it is the definition of pulp.  This story is based purely on Brown's imagination and old, washed-up, pagan religion. Gnosticism died a victim of its own nonsense by the end of the third century.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code falls woefully short in telling a relevant story about the realities involving the life of Jesus of Nazareth and Christianity.  There is only one foundational question about Christianity that really needs addressing.  How a person deals with that question will determine his or her world-view.<br /><br />The historical facts known today are this:  Jesus of Nazareth was a man Who lived in the first century in Palestine during Roman occupation. All historical documents report that He was a miracle worker. We know He taught about the coming Kingdom of God, He had devoted followers and He created dissonance within the Jewish establishment. Historians are unanimous in agreement that the Jews arrested Jesus, convicted Him of blasphemy in a trial and took Him to Pontius Pilate for execution.  There is no possible reason to believe that Jesus the man did not die in the execution meted out by the Romans, who were professional executioners.<br /><br />There is no evidence that any of the Gnostic gospels were ever considered to be anything other than pagan efforts at undoing the truth of Christianity, which was sweeping the world in the greatest culture revolution of all time. They have had essentially zero influence in the civilization of the world for the last 2000 years. So that leaves us with that one simple question:<br /><br />Did Jesus of Nazareth rise physically from the dead on the 3rd day after His execution, as unequivocally stated by all the New Testament authors in the Bible, as well as mentioned by secular first century historians?<br /><br />Not only is this question easy to ask, it is easy to answer.  It is a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question.  But the ramifications of the answer chosen, if it is truly the correct answer, are the most profound in life.<br /><br />If Jesus of Nazareth was only a man who died in 30 AD on a cross outside of Jerusalem between two thieves, then there is no evidence in this world for a deity of any kind.  Islam is an off-shoot of Christianity and Judaism.  Judaism anticipates a Messiah Who has not come, leaving all the Old Testament prophesies (beginning with Genesis 3:15 and 49:10) unfulfilled and well overdue.  Buddhism, Hinduism and other eastern religions are atheistic philosophies with no promise of an afterlife or knowledge of a personal God.<br /><br />So if Jesus was just a notable figure in history Who today is just as dead as everyone else from His era, then there is no indication or evidence for a revealed God anywhere in human experience.  If this is reality, it would be profound because the moral relativists would be correct; there is no good or bad, holy or evil.  There is only materialistic, naturalistic existence.  As a wise man said, we should eat, drink and be merry for only oblivion awaits us.  Man, in his allotted time on earth, can muse about morality, but ultimately the best morality is the one that makes each individual life the most comfortable and pleasure filled, since when death arrives there is nothing else forever.<br /><br />But what a difference in world-views if the answer to the question about Jesus' resurrection is in the affirmative.  IF Jesus really did rise physically (bodily) from the grave, then everything is different from the above.  IF Jesus rose from the dead bodily, then He is God Almighty.  Every word of the Bible is true IF Jesus rose from the dead. How much more impossible is the virgin birth, walking on water, turning water into wine, etc. than being raised bodily from death?  IF Jesus is God, then He can and did produce through the men he chose to inspire a book (the Bible) that is 100% accurate with the purpose of revealing Himself to His creatures.  Then man is faced with a morality not of his own making.  This morality also has a hook in it:  if we reject God in this life and live as though there is no God (as described above), then there is an afterlife for those people who will suffer outside the presence of God for eternity.  However, if the person does not reject God, then at death that person will be blessed in the presence of God for eternity.<br /><br />It can only be one of the two options above.  Dan Brown's novel is a fiction with a false premise; it has no foundation in fact or reality. Reality in this life is this: either Jesus rose physically from the dead or there is no God.  Every person must ask themselves that question and be prepared to accept the consequences.  Picking The Da Vinci Code option is merely saying \\"no\\" to the resurrection and then deluding oneself with pulp fiction.<br /><br />Brown's novel does frame the opposing viewpoint to the Bible.

B000002H97|5.0|This is the very first Metallica album I heard and I every track on here is amazing.  The first single, \\"Enter Sandman,\\" is still one of my favorite Metallica songs.  They've definitely came a long way from their debut album 'Kill 'Em All' but this album is still great.  A lot of people accuse them of \\"selling out\\" but I don't think that at all.  As the world turns you got to be able to change with the times and keep up with the music.  If you don't, you'll just fall off the face of the earth and never be mentioned again.  However, Metallica chose not to do that and I'm happy they didn't.    Unlike the previous Metallica albums, this one has quite a bit of radio-friendly tracks on it.  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"The Unforgiven\\" are 2 examples and they are both fantastic tracks.  Metallica didn't have as many guitar solos on this one as they usually do.  Kirk Hammett is a really good guitar player in my opinion and he's always done a nice job with the solos in the past.  Hetfields vocals and lyrics are great all the way through on this album.  He was definitely in his prime as far as the lyrics and voice goes at this point.  Lars does good on the drums also like always.  They got lots of catchy lyrics and beats on this album which is a big plus to me.  My favorite tracks are \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"The God Taht Failed.\\"  There's not much I can say about this album that's bad but it could be just me because I'm a huge Metallica fan.  I suggest everyone goes out and buys this great album to add to your collection, it's definitely worth your money.
B000CNFC76|5.0|If you love golf, you'll love this movie. Even if you don't love golf, you'll enjoy it. The cinematography is phenomenal. The makers of this movie used a specially designed camera in many scenes to follow the ball from shot to stop. One of my favorite shots was Ted Ray's blast through the woods, between the trees, and onto the green with the camera following the ball all the way! As others have said, it's the best golf movie yet, largely because the camera work and film editing added much to the magic of this true come-from-behind story. I also think the close working relationship between director Bill Paxton and the author of the book, The Greatest Game Ever Played, Mark Frost, added to the movie's charm and authenticity.<br /><br />Francis Ouimet and Harry Vardon had something in common. They were `common', according to the societal standards of their respective times. One is American, the other English, born a generation apart. Vardon grew up to become a world-renowned golfer, but could never join \\"the club\\" in his own homeland because he came from the underclass. However, he did become a hero to growing boys in Europe and America, including young Francis Ouimet, who grew up across the street from the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. Francis began caddying at a tender age, and there were those who saw something special in him. These gentlemen, and Ouimet's mother (at least in the movie), encouraged him to take his love of golf from the caddie stage to the player's arena. With the odds against him from several directions, he played his way into the hearts and minds of his American countrymen and the world, and into the record books, by playing as an amateur in the 1913 U.S. Open and winning.<br /><br />Shia LaBoeuf (Holes) is perfect as Ouimet, and Stephen Dillane portrays the stoic, haunted Vardon. The movie overall was well-cast, and Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, almost stole the show!! It's a good bet you'll be mesmerized by this wonderful film. Just remember, in the immortal words of 10-year-old Eddie, when holding onto that golf club \\"Easy squeezy, lemon freezy!\\"<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillfilm.

It's 2006 now and they have evolved into better musicians than they wereback then...They haven't shyed away from the funk either, it is alive and well on Californication and on a few tracks on By The Way...If anything there is WAY more funk tracks On Stadium Arcadium than By The Way so idk what the fuss is...I like the mixture of funk and beautifully crafted songs with John's beautiful soloing on practically every song on the album  <br /> <br />As Flea stated \\"If you don't like this record you dont like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, period.\\" <br /> <br />^pretty almost all you need to look at about this album if you dont like this album and consider yourself a fan of them

0385474547|4.0|I like the fact that the book was very catching. It informed you of another culture and the way that they thought about certain things. I did not like how it ended, and at points it got harsh. I felt that the aurthor was't very open minded. It seemed as if they were stuck in their own world and not concerned with the rest of the world. I do think that this novel should be read in the classrooms of America because this book spreads around a variety of subjects. From religion the racism and back to the beliefs and way of life of another culture.

6305127646|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater in '97 and though I soon forgot the plot, I came away with a general sense of having enjoyed the film. So I grabbed the DVD when it was on sale for $5 and just watched it again. Now I remember why I enjoyed it so much the first time.<br /><br />What I really liked:<br /><br />1) The two lead characters are multi-dimensional.<br /><br />Simon is nuanced, a bad guy with a code of ethics. I know, nothing new there. But in Simon's case, he seems unaware of his own ethics, only discovering he has them when he comes into contact with someone else whose moral code is so powerful (Dr. Russell). I love the moment when he starts to see the moral implications of what he's about to do---steal from someone he respects---and realizes he can't do it. A moment of redemption, all too quickly followed by another ethical quandary: he is forced to steal her formula anyway in order to protect her.<br /><br />Dr. Emma Russell so closely resembles the many super intelligent people I've known that she resonates as genuine. Yes, it's very likely that a genius would have palpitations when faced with public speaking. Yes, it's also extremely likely that a genius would be socially awkward, shy, and suffer a lack of social self confidence. In addition, Ms. Shue portrays Dr. Russell with a bit of clumsiness, and sweet innocence and enthusiasm, making her an approachable and likeable heroine.<br /><br />2) Dr. Russell's heart condition---as near as I can figure without it having been explicitly named---is accurately portrayed. Her symptoms and the need for a pill at specific times does match an actual rhythm disturbance (I have a relative with the same condition). As a discriminating viewer, I find little details like this a thrill, because so many Hollywood movies get sloppy.<br /><br />3) The movie manages to tell it's story without unnecessary cursing, bloodshed and explicit sex. Sex is even part of the romance, but in a touching, understated way. I'm not against the use of these elements when they're germane to the story (as is the violence, for example, in Saving Private Ryan). However, many modern movies indulge too much in sex, violence and profanity just for audience titillation, or because it's thought to be expected. This film does it all tastefully, placing the violence and sex in the context of the story, and not the other way around.<br /><br />4) Mr. Kilmer seems to relish playing such a diverse array of characters. I found his accents to be quite realistic and his adoption of each persona was fascinating. Watch his body language--it's distinctly different with each new 'identity.' That's what is called 'character acting,' and I think it's a true mark of talent when an actor can pull it off.<br /><br />5) It's pure, escapist fantasy fun. You're not supposed to take this movie seriously. This was never meant to win an Academy Award. It's just a popcorn movie, but one with refreshingly rich characters and incredible backdrops in the capitals of Europe.<br /><br />What I don't like about this movie is mostly nit-picky, but I'll throw it out there:<br /><br />1) The science of cold fusion is ridiculous. The writers would have done better to not attempt to explain it, as anyone with an ounce of understanding will quickly see through Dr. Russell's 'explanation' at the start of the film. Despite this flaw, I do still greatly enjoy the story and I can still suspend belief enough to go along for the ride. I just wish they'd have treated this with as much care as the heart condition.<br /><br />2) Speaking of the heart condition, it plays a major part through the first 2/3rds of the film, then abruptly disappears. A miracle cure?<br /><br />3) Given that the main characters are well-drawn and believable, it's a bit bewildering that Dr. Russell so quickly forgives Simon for his betrayal. After one quick scene where she justifiably rebukes him, she then rather happily trots off with him and all is forgiven.<br /><br />4) There are two 'false' endings. Just when you think you've reached the end ... you haven't. It goes on. And then on some more. I suppose this was the result of an inability of the writers to figure out how to get where they wanted to go.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, I wish there were more special features, at least some deleted scenes. Maybe for the Director's Cut version?and all is forgiven.  <br /> <br />4) There are two 'false' endings. Just when you think you've reached the end ... you haven't. It goes on.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|I bought this album based off a long love of Pink Floyd music and various solo albums done by the members of the band.  Sonically, the album is above par, but the lyrics stink.  Dave should move to an island for the next effort and make sure to leave the Mrs. behind.  He can do much better then this.  As for the die hards who are giving them album 4-5 stars, put down the pipe and be honest.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has done it again, and then some! <br /> <br />10000 Days is mesmerizing and addictive, with its climactic build-ups and breakdowns verging on the mystical psychedelic structures usually only heard in dreams. These compositions are not songs so much as they are journeys of the mind, meant to unveil parts of the listener's subconscious they recently didn't know were there. <br /> <br />Forget the hype, and go with the Flow... This is not pop-music; this is Magic realized. This is meant for the inner person, not the mainstream Ego-inflicted collective consciousness. <br /> <br />It will be a blast seeing all of the people now giving bad reviews of this masterpiece return in a year or two admitting how wrong they were. Those of the naysayers who don't have simply never had the perseverence to give this album a chance; and I suppose that is just as well, because they should probably stick to their mainstream radio-pop superficiality and leave the Real Deal the hell alone anyways.
B00000IQW0|5.0|When I played this movie for the first time and the theme music began, I got goose bumbs and my adrenaline levels were sky high.  I felt like a kid all over again.  Battlestar Galactica was my all time favourite movie and then series when I was growing up. <br /> <br />This movie is great for any true Battlestar Galactica fan.  True, you don't really need to buy this movie if you have the complete series (it is included in the series with added scenes that weren't in this original movie), but it takes you back to the excitement of seeing Battlestar Galactica for the very first time on the \\"Big Screen\\".  It is one of the ground breaking movies of its time and a movie that is able to be enjoyed by the whole family..... very uncommon for movies that are released these days (including the recent re-release of BG and the subsequent series..... definately NOT for kids!) <br /> <br />In my opinion this version of Battlestar Galactica is the Original and THE BEST!!!

1400079179|3.0|Dan Brown has produced a fair adventure/action/mystery novel. The characters are a bit one dimentional and seem to serve only the purpose to advance the theory he is trying to sell.<br /><br />The only thing I take fault in is the page where Dan Brown claims that the facts in his book are acurate in an attempt to sell the book's premise as plausible. The problem with that is that much of his theory is from the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail In the late 80s it came out that the prime source for that books was nothing more than an elaborate hoax purpitrated by Pierre Plantard in an attempt to tie himself to a royal blood line in France. The Priory of the Scion was not a secret society protecting the Holy Grail, it was a shell created in the 50s to advance one man's delusions of grandure. While the names of many people/groups that were \\"used\\" in the book actually existed their portrayal is completely fabricated.<br /><br /> There is no evidence to support any of Dan Brown's claims, plan and simple. He should stop attempting to sell this story as factually based.

B000001GPX|5.0|I am totally confident when I say that this is the greatest recording of anything EVER. Yes, you all have a recording of the fifth and every single conductor in the world has beat the thing to death. But the reason why this recording should be so highly praised is because it does something dangerous. Kleiber takes the most known and popular symphony of all time, which has been played and re-played since the day it was premiered, and made it timeless. The recording just never gets old. <br /> <br />The term \\"fate\\" has never sounded so shocking or terrifyingly perfect. The first notes are played with such a deep tragic sound that we are left speechless and vulnerable to the power that Kleiber will gather and the very essence of Beethoven's masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Technical errors are just non-existent and the sound is ideal. The Vienna really opens up their sound, which has always been bright and pretty, and turns it into an emotionally-shattering mix of sound. The 4th movement begins with this huge wall of sound that signals the heroic ending. <br /> <br />I was duly impressed the moment I heard this. See for yourself. Be prepared to experience the greatest half hour of classical music available on disc.
0143039830|5.0|I think these three novellas have been termed \\"post-modern detective stories\\" by someone with a fancy literature degree and chances are that description isn't too far off.  But I'll say now, if you're here looking for a Raymond Chandler type detective story, with sultry women and missing money and men who say very little beating up men who say even less . . . you are going to be terribly disappointed.  Because what Auster does here is take the very shell of a mystery story and invert it and mess with it until you're not left with much of a mystery at all, until the mystery is secondary to what's actually going on.  It's a neat slight of hand, the more you pay attention to the mystery at hand, the less you're going to notice the more important stuff going on in the background.  Or the foreground, depending on where you're looking.  As I mentioned already, it consists of three interlinked short novels, City of Glass, Ghosts and the Locked Room, all of which can be read on their own but when read in order certain elements crop up that relate them to each other and sort of inform the other works, so that by the end a consistent theme has developed.  The biggest subject that the novels tackle is the question of identity and all of the main characters come to a point where they question who they are and start to devolve into someone else.  In City of Ghosts, mystery writer Quinn pretends to be detective Paul Auster and goes about trying to solve one of his cases, taking things to the point where it's curious what he's even solving anymore and who is investigating what.  In Ghosts, the main character is watching someone else, for reasons that he's unsure of, and at the same time it appears that his subject is watching him, leading to a neat bit of identity crisis at hand.  And finally, in The Locked Room, a man's childhood friend disappears and the man finds himself immersing himself deeper and deeper into the life of his old friend, until he's not even sure what he's looking for anymore.  These are not easy novels to read, Auster gives us enough information to work at it but not enough that he has to sit there and explain it all to us, at the end, the only judgemnet we can make is our own and maybe that's not totally accurate.  There are threads dangling, lives cut off, people who aren't what they're supposed to be and aren't sure when the change happened, or what it really means.  Auster delves into what makes us what we are, and who we think we are and how the quest can change us, like not looking into a mirror for too long and forgetting what you really look like.  When you finally see your reflection, you're surprised, because you think it's someone else, after all this time.  This is the kind of book that probably needs to be read and reread, in order to catch the interlocking themes, the tiny clues that carry over from one book to the other.  But even from one reading I can tell it's a thick work, thought provoking and constantly evolving.  I may not have gotten everything, but what I did get gave me a lot to think about.  As I said earlier, there is a central mystery in each book, but that's just the window dressing, an excuse to get you to read.  The real meat of the novel lies elsewhere, somewhere in the mind.ing for anymore.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|You can always expect certain things from a Terry Gilliam movie. When he has a budget as he did in this one, it will look beautiful, the story will be an odd one with some cool effects and sense of humor. These are all present in the Brothers Grimm, but the movie still doesn't completely work. <br /> <br />The Grimm Brothers are con artists. They fleece money from villagers by setting up a myth about a witch or creature and then showing up to destroy said witch or monster. They are eventually captured by the French army and sent into the Thuringian forest to battle an actual ancient myth. The performances are good and it's a clever story but it just doesn't grab you. I was bored part way into it and never accummulated a great interest in how it would turn out. <br /> <br />I think more humor might have helped. Also, the story didn't flow as well as it should have. Some scenes seemed just to be an excuse to show you some special effect they had thought up. The characters had little history and could have a used another dimension. This wasn't a bad movie, but something was missing.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is an outstanding animated movie, which essentially spoofs all fairy tale stories, but eventually delivers much more as a heart-warming and hillarious tale about an big green ogre finding his true love. <br /> <br />The big ugly ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who only wants to save his privacy on his swamp, is forced into a mission by the evil midget Lord Farquad (John Lithgow), to save princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. But the ogre can't get rid of the annoying chatterbox donkey (Eddie Murphy) who schleps along with him wherever he goes. <br /> <br />One of those rare movies that can be appeciated equally by a five-year-old and a fifty-five-year-old, it's just great, fun entertainment for kids and adults. It also conveys important life lessons about the importance of friendship, and the importance of inner beauty over external looks. <br /> <br />It's best known however, for its side-spliiting comedy, thanks in great part to Eddie Murphy's extraordinary comedic talents.
1400079179|3.0|In the preface to the hard-cover version, Dan Brown claims that although his is a novel, therefore a work of fiction, \\"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" Additionally, Brown has made use of every opportunity to present his novel as historical fact. In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC Today (Oct 10, '05), Brown claimed that \\"absolutely all of it ... is historical fact.\\" If he himself were not so insistent that his novel is based on legitimate history, I would be happy to dismiss his work as mere whimsical fiction. Sadly, that is not the case. There are many instances of his historical blunders. I'll cite just two examples here.<br /><br />Brown is a talented story-teller, but a poor historian. On page 232, he claims that pagans and Christians were \\"warring\\" so fiercely that the conflict \\"threatened to rend Rome in two. Constantine decided something had to be done. In 325 A.D., he decided to unify Rome under a single religion. Christianity.\\" The fact is, Constantine simply granted freedom of worship to Christians in 313 in the Edict of Milan, for Christianity was not regarded as a legal religion at that time. Not until 381 during Theodosius' reign was Christianity made the state religion. And if state and popular persecution of Christians can be considered \\"warring,\\" I suppose Brown may not be too far from the truth on that account.<br /><br />On page 233, Brown also claims that it was at the Council of Nicaea in 325 that Church leaders decided by vote to make Jesus divine. \\"[U]ntil that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet\\". However, the Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with deciding Jesus' divinity. The main subject was Arius' contention that Jesus was not co-eternal with God, a notion which was condemned 300 to 2. As early as the latter part of the first century, documents have been found which demonstrate that Jesus' followers regarded Him as God (\\"My Lord and my God\\" - John 20:28, 1:1 [AD 85-95]; Titus 2:13 [AD mid-60s]; Hebrews 1:8-10 [AD pre-70]; 2 Peter 1:1 [AD 68-90]).<br /><br />Although Brown has written a good yarn, his repeated and outspoken claims to historicity mar an otherwise enjoyable read.rd and my God\\" - John 20:28, 1:1 [AD 85-95]; Titus 2:13 [AD mid-60s]; Hebrews 1:8-10 [AD pre-70]; 2 Peter 1:1 [AD 68-90]). <br /> <br />Although Brown has written a good yarn, his repeated and outspoken claims to historicity mar an otherwise enjoyable read.
B0009X7664|5.0|Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villian, Bob Ewell. <br /> <br />Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a holywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly. <br /> <br />The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham. <br /> <br />In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production. Almost the entire cast comments on different aspects of the filmmaking, including Philip Alford and Brock Peters. <br /> <br />
0446672653|1.0|By Sumit Chawla <br />Thisis a critical analysis of the story `only love is real.' It is based on the novel written by Dr Brian Weiss. I would like to begin by defining the impression of the novel verses the ulterior motives of Dr Weiss for writing his novel. I would then like to throw light on the powerful story line selected by him but the poor and unintelligent method of his handling the story.  <br />Only love is real' the name inspires love. It gives the impression of being a true story of two helpless romantics who coincidentally met, fell in love and realized that it was meant to be. `the story of soul mates reunited' goes on to giving the impression that this book will express the soft subtle realities of two people meant to be together separated by time. But for all those readers who believe this book will satiate those warm feelings of true love or rekindle a spark of hope in our barren lives please reconsider. Dr weiss has tried to use this book as a tool to increase clients in his clinic. I have been appalled at the way an individual can manipulate the emotions of his readers to satisy his own ulterior purposes. The book has an undertone of a corrupt priest preaching at a church in the medival times trained to only increase the faith of his followers to believe in the church. The more people that the priest can con the greater will be his power in that area. False rituals, fake beliefs and artificial fears are implanted artificially into innocent people. Then the church uses the priests as a medium of communication to solve these self embedded problems. Similarly dr weiss has created a lot of artificial pain and suffering and then used hypocritical means of hypnosis to solve them. He has made people believe that he with his powerful methods of hypnosis is one of the chosen few who can create a medium between the diseased person and the supernatural. And gone on to manipulate the situation to earn a lot fame and fortune. <br /> <br />Sumit Chawla <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I like it because it has a lot of songs(thanks rhcp). Maybe only one or two that would make it to your radio playlists but I am actually glad if it went that way. Dani California is not the best song in the album. I like both cds but Jupiter to me is slightly better. Flea stepped up with his unique signature grooves. He still has it. A lot of wild guitar solos by the best guitarist today, John Frus. There is a guess solo by Omar Rodriguez from the At the drive-in/mars volta in Still the Michigan. New listeners will get a taste of their last 8 albums without having to listen their greatest hits. I personally dont like their greatest hits cds because they are poor impressions of the band. Better than their 8 previous albums? Maybe By The Way or their self-titled. This is definitely a great album maybe the best this year but it's hard when comparing with their previous masterpieces.

Or maybe the problem is that the musicianship is more advanced.  Gee.  Or maybe the problem is that the guitar mix is more spacious and the vocals are pushed back a bit, creating a more balanced sound with much crisper bass response.  Gee. <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned is a masterpiece.  Must be amazing live. I would say Tool is the Led Zeppelin of our time, except that Tool seems healthier (lifestyle-wise) and more musically capable right now than Zep ever was at their peak.  Thanks Tool for an amazing new album.  Now I'll step aside so the angsty \\"BOO HOO I WANTED ANOTHER AENIMA BOO HOO HOO\\" gripe-n-moan fest may resume.

B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Where do I start? Ok, first off I'd like to say that this band rocks. I know that it sounds like black sabbath mixed with zeppelin and deep purple with jack white filling in for vocals, but that is exactly why I love it. I appreciate their taste for music and I am glad that somebody is finally getting the point that people wanna hear some rock n' roll. You gotta be glad people that somebody is trying to bring the classic rock sound back. And as for the guy who said there were no solos on this cd... I really don't know what kind of crack you were smoking because if you actually listen to the album, you will find many. And for the person who said the intro to joker and the theif sounded like the who's baba o'reilly... I should smack you. Did you even listen to both songs at the time to compare?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Wow.  I see a lot of old fans complaining about the direction \\"their\\" Peppers have taken here.  Well, if you don't like it go form your own band and write your own \\"perfect\\" music!    There are a few common fallacies being repeated here:    1) \\"This album is soft. Too many ballads. Boo hoo.\\"  Huh?  Maybe you are not playing it loud enough, but I hear plenty of blistering guitar and slammin beats for my tastes.  The bass tone is as good as it has been since BSSM and the drums are bright and present.  There are quite a few mid-tempo pieces, but they usually resolve to scorching bridges of pure rock power.    2) \\"The Peppers have abandoned their roots!  Boo hoo.\\"  Please.  Just because they are not retreading their young punk vibe over and over again it does not mean they have lost their integrity.  I personally think punk AND metal sound best when a young band has something to prove.  If they keep at it, without maturing, it sounds pretty stale.  So I appreciate that they have moved on.  I still love the old records and they are not going anywhere.  Bottom line, if you want a dangerous punk sound look underground, this band has grown up.    3)  \\"They mailed it in.  It's all about Frusciante now.  Boo hoo.\\"  Nonsense.  They bring it all to the table on this record.  Yes, John's layered sounds are a huge part of the post-Californication sound, but I personally think this is Flea's best work.  He is master of a ridiculous number of styles and still manages to sound like himself.  No imitators possible.  He practically invents a new style of bass on \\"Hard to Concentrate\\".  I defy you to tell me you've heard anything like that stuttering little groove played on a bass guitar before (he seems to be pulling modern hip hop grooves into his own brand of upper register playing) and the next tune \\"21st Century\\" is a clinic on creative funk bass groove.  Flea has reached a perfect balance of his  relentless power and a \\"less is more\\" approach.  If you have seen them play \\"Subwayto Venus\\" at a billion beats per minute recently you know that neither he nor John have lost their chops, they just make different choices now.  They are playing exactly what they think is beautiful and powerful and funky, no more no less.  The reason I buy every album they make is because I trust them to make THEIR choices not MINE.  I do that in my own band.  I like where they are going as much as where they have been.  Anthony Keidis has NEVER sounded better.  His lyrics are on par with the other albums, equal parts sublime abstract genius and quirky Keidis nonsense delivered in his unique style.  Again if you think the lyrics aren't good, then grab a mike and let us hear yours.  Keidis is doing his thing well here.    4) \\"It's still not as good as Blood Sugar! Boo hoo.\\"  Of course not, but it is not trying to replace that album.  That was 15 freaking years ago folks!  That was the perfect album for that time. I was 19 at the time and it absolutely consumed me, but that was a young man's album.  This is an album for the same man 15 years later.  It may not be for everyone, but it's not the Pepper's problem if you haven't grown up or if you just don't care for the music they like to make.      5)  \\"They only care about singles now!  Boo hoo.\\"  More nonsense.  They are making the best music they can in the style that they like which includes more flavors than almost any other band out there.  It is an insult to them or any other band to tell them they are half-assing it.  It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to put together even a so-so band, so when a band like this goes in to make a double album of \\"over produced\\" material it is NOT because they are just trying to sell a few more albums.  These guys are already independently wealthy.  They are making music, period.  If you don't like it...hey...there are more bands out there than ever before...good luck finding one that cares as much about their music as these guys.      Oh...the album... (hee hee)    It istwenty eight songs of pure \\"grown up\\" Peppers.  If you like the last two albums there is plenty here to digest for the entire summer.  If you just like the old \\"real\\" Peppers then go dig up your old albums, stay in your cave and dream about the \\"good old days\\" when you thought they were \\"your\\" band...or you could come out into the sunshine with the REAL living Peppers and enjoy the ride.    \\"If you don't like this album, then you don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Period.\\"  - Flea
B000EHSVQE|5.0|It is true that this film is different than most you've ever seen. There's not much of a plot, and the pacing is quite different. If you're locked into liking only the Hollywood formula for filmmaking, you may not like it, and I guess that's what these negative reviewers are coming from.  But personally, I think it's one of the funniest movies to come out in years.  I have seen Napoleon Dynamite countless times along with almost every college-aged or younger person today, and laugh hysterically everytime. My friends and I can recite almost all the dialogue whenever we watch it. Everyone has gone to school with \\"the geek.\\" Now we can see what life might be like for such a geek. And while he's not necessarily a likeable person, we like him! We root for him. If you can lay down your film-watching sensibilities and just go with the flow, you just may be surprised how much you enjoy this film.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've bought in years. There's not a throw away track on the album. <br /> <br />Hayley's voice is amazing. Love the chick rockers!!!!
0143034901|1.0|Overly long and tedious.  Plot is intricate and clever but characters never come to life.  Some exceedingly witty dialogue (especially Fermin's).  Fumero is the villain, not so pure but quite simple.  Carax is the tragic hero.<br /><br />Daniel is the means to uncover the ins and outs of this complex but ultimately boring novel.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|\\"Persona\\" is not the easiest of Ingmar Bergman's films to understand, but it is certainly one of his most cerebral. And there's the rub. He picks our brain, exploring the depths of guilt and despair, both of the mute actress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) and attending nurse Alma(Bibi Andersson). And yet, it is not a depressing film. On the contrary, it makes you think about the healing process the psyche undergoes to recover when it is hurt.<br /><br />The film itself marks Bergman's break from the symbolism notably seen in his earlier works such as [[ASIN:6305174083 The Seventh Seal - Criterion Collection]] and [[ASIN:B000BR6QIW The Virgin Spring - Criterion Collection]]. Albeit the allusion to Sophocles' [[ASIN:1854597566 Electra (Drama Classics)]] (the role Elisabeth Vogler's character played when she became speechless) cannot be discounted, nor the masks worn in ancient Hellenic theatre to portray an actor's persona or character role. If you scratch the surface deeper, you might even find this psychological film alludes to the Freudian or Jungian concepts of the feminine persona.<br /><br />Aside from these references, Bergman deconstructs the film before our very eyes as though he is probing the make-up of one's personality. He splices cartoon frames, silent films with his own creation. The film is burnt at one point. The images of Elisabeth Vogler and Alma are melded together to suggest similarity and resolution. A young adolescent boy is seen at the beginning with seemingly no purpose, until at the end we realise this child represents their shared guilt.<br /><br />Photographer Sven Nykvist's close-ups of Ullman and Andersson are intimate, allowing us to scrutinise their facial expressions and body language for telltale clues to their problem. Bergman's common use of silhouettes on white backgrounds and vice-versa are here too. So are the cleansing seascapes with the lone figure.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing scenes in the film is Alma's walking on shards of glass without cutting her bare feet, as if her own soul is on edge. The erotic scene where she confesses to Elisabeth Vogler of a sexual encounter years ago and her abortion is the climax (pardon the pun) of the film and foreshadows the revelation to come. And that revelation is Elisabeth Vogler's own guilt; it is her inability to deal with the responsibilities of motherhood, hence her silence and the teenage boy touching the image of his mother at the end.  It's a powerful image depicting disconnection, isolation and loneliness.<br /><br />All in all, MGM has put together a credible DVD package inclusive of the film, trailer, an Ingmar Berman interview in 1970, interviews with Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann in 2002 and analysis with film critic and comments from Andersson and Ullmann. To be honest, I was reluctant initially to buy this MGM version, but I must confess after having reviewed the content that it is comparable to any Criterion package and well worth the purchase.hards of glass without cutting her bare feet, as if her own soul is on edge.

B00007E8V4|5.0|I own every album of System of a Down, and when Hypnotize came out, I didn't understand why they didn't release more material like this. I also don't understand why they still broadcast songs from Toxicity and not this album. I love every song on this album because of the diversity. Of course it surrounds metal, but you never get the feeling it's going to be the same. Although I'm a big fan of Disturbed, these guys know how to make you wonder what's coming at you. I think songs like Streamline and IEAIAIO and Mr. Jack should be on the radio, or something, because this album shows (from what I think) their potential. Mezmerize and Steal this Album are my favorites. You may want to try Toxicity to get the style first though.
0780021967|5.0|Hitchcock's first great masterpiece, this suspense yarn contains many of the thematic features the brilliant director would utilize in many of his later films: the \\"innocent victim\\" who through his wits and perseverance alone can prevent a major calamity, usually of national importance; the unwitting partner of the opposite sex who is co-joined (often literally, as here, with the use of handcuffs) to the hero who refuses to believe him at first but soon is persuaded otherwise as they fall in love; the use of wild, unforbidding landscapes; the taut suspense that builds to a tremendous climax at the end. Robert Donat gets mixed up with a spy ring after a woman he's just met is murdered in his flat. Wanted as the murderer, Donat flees to Scotland to find the real murderers; while aboard the train taking him there he encounters Madeleine Carroll, who becomes his unwitting and disbelieving (at first) partner in the chase. Suspense builds as the two get closer to the truth - and closer to each other. Comedic relief was a great tool used by Hitchcock to keep the tension building. The final scene brings them back to London and the theatre where the movie began, and the mystery of the \\"39 steps\\" is revealed. It's a wonderful movie from beginning to end - one of Hitchcock's best and a true movie classic.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|You have to respect his resume...Reservoir , Pulp etc , however when did Tarantino start putting his name out for tender? I can not believe he is associated with this movie.  <br />Although essentially a good idea for a simple plot , this film casually meanders into the realms of gratuitous violence and Human depravity, gently interspersed with mild nudity and whimsical suspense. This movie would have been labeled a video nasty ten years ago, due to its graphic content and lack of any believable dialogue. Films that create suspense do so by excellent acting, imaginative cinematography , good direction, the power of suggestion and dramatic musical score , this film lacks all of the aforementioned!  <br />However if your 'thing' is to be titillated by violence , unnecessary gore , malicious use of torture instruments and pain , then I suppose this trash ' hits the right spots '  <br />Entertainment.....No.  <br />I believe this is a film that Taratino needs to propel narcissism , money and his own unpublicised writers block...I know it's not actually his film...but putting his name to this, is a confirmation of sell out and lack of creative imagination.

B000683VI4|5.0|Wow! I saw this movie on a transatlantic flight and was ready for another tired retelling of the basic romeo & juliet story. Instead, I found an original, moving love story that left me with tears rolling down my face (on a 747!).  <br /> <br />So what's so good about this movie? The story is well-told and the dialogue avoids triteness & cliche. The story-within-a- story framework is a nice touch. For those sick to death of wooden leads like Brad Pitt, the leading actor and actress display old-fashioned chemistry that leaps off the screen. Though the film does not need it, James Garner adds a final layer of credibility. <br /> <br />Trust me, if you like love stories, this is one for the ages.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'm not a HUGE PJ fan, but I do like a handful of songs from their entire catalog. I listened to this new one the other day and was quite impressed how fresh they've been able to sound after 15 years of doing \\"the same thing\\". The songs have good hooks, they rock, Eddie sounds good, the vocals are top-notch, and the musicianship is the best its ever been. If you are a PJ fan, I'd imagine this one will pump you up. And if you're new to the band, I imagine this one will wake you up. These guys are still going strong and show no signs of letting up.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Two amazing CDs.  I can't even pick a favorite song because I love all 28 of them.
0440238609|1.0|Pullman's trilogy seemed to me a hodge-podge of scattered bits of oversimplified popular 'theoretical physics' and something that vaguely resembles theosophy.  They periodically pop up but don't linger long enough to enlighten the narrative nor to captivate the young reader.  The off-handed references to complex theories in quantum mechanics, for instance, take an unsuspecting reader by surprise and are fillers at best.  At worst they are simply pretentious.  <br /> <br />The books are not very well written and are full of violence and 'action.'  The author never takes his time to allow the narrative its natural flow. <br /> <br />The moral relativism that prevails in the books is useful for young people to reflect on but Pullman takes it to a radical extreme and ironically turns it into a sort of absolutism by stripping the characters' moral choices almost entirely of any context other than that of 'the epic war.' <br /> <br />As to the Tatars, they are the peoples of the Steppe of Asia and used to roam in the present territories of Mongolia and the former Soviet Republics such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.  They were dependent on their cattle and never settled at the North Pole.
B000EULJLU|3.0|as a huge tool fan, i must admit i am a little disappointed with their new album. tool has always pushed the metal (sorry maynard. hard rock) envelope with one great album after another, but for a band with as much creativity and talent as tool, and given recent world events, i guess i expected more than this. i agree with another review i read, which said this album sounds like a collection of lateralus b-sides. most 16 year old bands, as we all know, would a have a catalog of 10 albums by now, and as fans of tool, there is an understanding that good things come to those who wait. i hope in time this album will grow on me, but i am doubtful. i vividly remember listening to lateralus for months after it first came out, and getting chills every time i heard it. it has only been a week or so, but still, not even one goosebump.
B000EDWKXS|1.0|I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too. <br /> <br />Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it. <br /> <br />Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library. <br /> <br />No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it!
B0002IU988|4.0|THE BAND: Myles Kennedy (vocals), Mark Tremonti (guitars), Brian Marshall (bass), Scott Phillips (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2004) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 55 minutes. The disc contains an 8-page foldout containing song credits and lyrics, two bridge and barn pictures, and thank you's (no band photos). Recorded at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta Georgia, and Empty Studios, Orlando, FL. Label - Wind Up Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I like this album. It's main stream rock & roll. Driving guitars, mostly hard crunchy songs... with a few rock ballads mixed in for good measure. I was disappointed Creed couldn't settle their differences and keep producing music. I'll assume the Scott Stapp vs. Mark Tremonti quarrel was too much to bare. Stapp announced his solo career, and the 3 remaining Creed band members formed Alter Bridge with new singer Myles Kennedy. The race was on to see who would get the best album our first... and if I had to choose one or the other, Alter Bridge wins over Stapp. A lot of similar song hooks and familiar guitar chords can be heard here... that is, if you were into Creed. The first 3 tracks are the strongest on the album. Track #1 is a mid tempo heavy song, \\"Find The Real\\". Perhaps my favorite song on the disc is the title track #2 - hard, fast and catchy, featuring Tremonti trademark lightning quick rhythm guitars - \\"One Day Remains\\". The first hit released is the rock ballad \\"Open Your Eyes\\"... a great song with heartfelt lyrics. Kennedy is a more than adequate vocal replacement. \\"One Day Remains\\" is a solid rock album. Not as strong as any of the 3 Creed albums, but still very good and can stand on its own. Creed fans and Stapp fans alike will like this release (4 stars).
006441034X|3.0|Sophie is oldest child in her family and this means that she is doomed to a crummy fate. The superstition comes alive when she is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch of the waste. She runs from her little hat shop to find her fortune, but she is now old and doesn't get around so well. She meets the mysterious and vain wizard, Howl. She becomes a member of his strange little household in a castle that is enchanted and moves around the countryside.  <br /> <br />The book was amusing at times and at others frustrating because it was full of details, but the story never really went anywhere. Jealousy and romance in a fantasy setting are the prevailing thems. Howl is the typical pretty boy that no one ever wants to get involved with. All of the characters were completely unique and well thought out. The ending was satisfying but sudden. The book was entertaining at times, but was difficult to get fully interested in.
B0000509C4|4.0|After watching this I have to say it was worth it.  If you are into seeing people who have it coming \\"get it\\", you should check it out.  They could of did a ton more with the getting violent revenge in the first short, chief woodenhead, but it was funny nontheless.  The hitch-hiker in the third short is super funny with his \\"THANKS FOR THE RIDE LADY!\\" bit.  I think the writers of these series completely take advantage of the guilty mind and making sure those that have it coming \\"get it\\".  The second short \\"the raft\\" is partially dumb but you get a laugh watching each victim succumb to the oil slick.

0385486804|4.0|Nature is the refuge of those spirits bold enough to find it. Jon Krakauer strives to explain this belief in his non-fiction story Into the Wild, based on the life and death of Christopher Johnson McCandless. Chris McCandless gave away almost all that he owned, donated all his money to charity, hiked north to Alaska and was found a couple months later dead in a bus. The story of this boy's mysterious death was first told as an article in the magazine Outside, written by Jon Krakauer himself, in January of 1993, several months after the boy's death. The story captured the heart and imagination of Krakauer, who continued to follow the boy's trail and discover the thoughts and beliefs of this amazing young man. As Krakauer later found out, McCandless was influenced by the works of such classic authors as Dickens, H.G. Wells, Mark Twain and Jack London. Chris found a profound connection with the feelings the writers express through their stories. Chris had a special connection with the literature of Jack London. The criticism of capitalist society and the apparent beauty of the primitive world in London's writings reflected Chris's own hidden passions. Growing up under the influence of such writers, Chris began to separate himself from his parents, who were perfect examples of the capitalist society they lived in. In an attempt to discover the paradise of Nature, Chris gave away all the money he had, abandoned his car and nearly all he owned, burned the cash in his wallet and created a new life for himself. To show that he had severed all ties to his previous life, he even adopted a new name. He now traveled under the identity of \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", master of his own destiny. Setting off across the country, he took longer and longer trips away from society. On these journeys, he would travel to uninhabited places and live mostly off of what he could find in the land. The few people he did meet had their lives touched in ways that would never allow them to forget him. The story Chris told and the few people who learned his intentions were forever touched by his desire to seek out his perfect existence. Krakauer collects a few of these stories and tells them in his book. <br /> Jon Krakauer writes with a brilliant mix of factual research and eloquent description. Through thorough research and a sense for what trail to follow, Krakauer gives a detailed account of what really happened. Using his own talent for putting life into an image, he takes the facts he finds and creates them into a story befitting the finest writer. While Krakauer does have his own opinion on what Chris McCandless did, it does not affect the way he tells the story. By bringing in other sides of the story, Krakauer allows the reader to see all the different ways that Chris' journey into Alaska affected people.  He also allows the readers to develop their own opinion of the \\"Great Alaskan Odyssey\\" carried out by Chris. Instead of denying thought or existence of other ideas except for his, Krakauer either welcomes them as good thoughts or uses facts to prove that there was no way they could have occurred. Krakauer easily summed up the feelings that many people expressed towards Chris. \\"It would be easy to stereotype Christopher McCandless as another boy who felt too much, a loopy young man who read too many books and lacked even a modicum of common sense. But the stereotype isn't a good fit. McCandless wasn't some feckless slacker, adrift and confused, racked by existential despair. To the contrary: His life hummed with meaning and purpose. But the meaning he wrested from existence lay beyond the comfortable path: McCandless distrusted the value of things that came easily. He demanded much of himself - more, in the end, than he could deliver.\\" Krakauer brilliantly researches and tells the story of Chris McCandless and tries to shed some light on this mysterious young man and why he did what he did. <br />
1592400876|5.0|I do a lot of editing in my current job, so I got a kick out of this book.  For anyone who's ever gone off on a tangent over proper apostrophe use or the difference between \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\", this is a hilarious book!  Most of the actual teachings of the book are pretty basic, but you'll most likely pick up a trick or two along the way.  Overall, a very enjoyable read though.
0613846044|5.0|A lot of people claim to have been put off by this book because of its unwillingness to stick to the film that came out in the mid-eighties.  However, if you actually read the book, it becomes clear that Bastian's adventure is very similar, but far more complex than the film was able to capture.  The second film that they made actually delved quite a bit closer to the story, carrying on Bastian's adventure, but without seperating the two.  The overall moral standing out that when one has the power to do exactly as he wishes, those wishes will overpower him, until all he knows about himself is his own greed and lust for power. <br /> <br />It is a very powerful and compelling story, fun to read with children and containing what some might consider the lost values of yesteryear.
B000005YZM|5.0|I discovered \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" by accident. I enjoy '60's psychedelic music in general and bought this Cd because it contained \\"Time of the Season\\" on it. I was in for a pleasant surprise when I heard these beautifully melodic tunes. This is '60's psychedelia at its best. The songs were experimental without going overboard. Each song is concise pop psych. I was not born in 1968 when this album was released, but it does not sound dated at all. <br />
B000C65Z1G|4.0|It was clear for me before watching this film that I was going to see a story about political pressure and pharmaceutical scandals. And this is so, and it's well done. It makes you think about what we're doing for the lives of millions in Africa. It's necessary to take in mind that money and politics must not be over life. <br /> <br />Yeah, the world is so disgusting. But this film does not rejoice in showing gratuitous deaths, sadness and poverty. Faces of these people seem happy and confident about a better future. <br /> <br />But this is not only a film for denouncing life condition in Africa. It's the story of an activist and a diplomat. It's about love, confidence and faith. <br /> <br />The twists of the political story are easy to preview. But not in the love story, in which nothing is as you can imagine. Justin (Ralph Fiennes) seems to be so worried about his carrer and Tessa (Rachel Weisz) seems to be so worried about her ideals. The difference of age between both is another false clue about their romance. Their love is much important than this. <br /> <br />I have really liked this film. The book which inspired the film is a very good one. It's no wonder, knowing the author is John Le Carre. The soundtrack is also brilliant, and could have won the Oscar instead of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". <br /> <br />But the film has a black spot: Ralph Fiennes. I think he is making each and every time the same role. So dull and so even. I am not saying he is a bad actor. I only think he can do a lot better. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a very recommendable film.
B00000IBDY|4.0|Tomorrow released only one self titled album in 1968. Hilight's of album are \\"My White Bicycle\\" with backwards tapes and good guitar. Revolution and Real Life Permanent Dream are good psychedelia with some trippy lyrics. Tomorrow never overcame to excess in their songs. Songs were tightly crafted psych pop.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|so this is their best work to date; if you don't like it, then you don't like the R.H.C.P.<br /><br />Say Anthony and Flea.<br /><br />I got to know them at the time of Mother's Milk and became an instant fan, loved Blood Sugar Sex Magic, consider One Hot MInute their high point, like Californication only so-so, didn't even bother listening to the whole By The Way, the singles were clarifying enough. Now I've taken advantage of the fast internet connection and downloaded the tracks to listen to them. I didn't listen to them in the same order they're positioned on the CDs, nor in a single session. Yet, the monotony is striking. The sound is indifferent. The tunes are immediately digestible, but they don't evoke any emotion.<br /><br />This is just a watered-down version of the usual Peppers, a band which doesn't seem to have anything to say anymore, musically. They seem to enjoy the serenity of their present lives: I'm sincerely glad for them, I wish them well but I'm going to delete all the tracks I downloaded (save maybe for \\"Hard to concentrate\\" and \\"Charlie\\", which are cute background poppy songs), and NOT going to buy the double-album
B00005JOYA|3.0|I don't much like horror movies that make you think about the plot or lack thereof, because they distract me from what I like about these kinds of movies, the thrill of getting scared. Silent Hill strayed from its genre, and not in a very subtle way.   <br /> <br />The overall atmosphere of the film was excellent. CGI effects created an almost believable haunted town with great lurking beasties of all shapes and sizes. I enjoyed the massacre and burning scenes near the end, although, it was more disturbing than scary, and some of you more faint-hearted viewers might disapprove. <br /> <br />The story starts here. We have our heroine, young and beautiful, which I'm always partial to. She's trying to free her adopted daughter from the nightmares she keeps having, nightmares of a place called 'Silent Hill'. She decides to confront this place with her daughter, and somehow dispel the source of the nightmares. Things don't go smoothly though. She's hounded by a nosy cop, and on top of that, a mysterious apparition causes her to crash her car near the entrance of the haunted town. When she awakes, everything is covered in ash, and her daughter is missing. <br /> <br />And so the real nightmare begins... or does it? That's just one of the many nagging questions you ask yourself by the end of the movie. At what point do the mom and daughter really lose themselves to silent hill? Perhaps at the very beginning in the crash, or at the end during the massacre. Well, that's never clear, even by the end of the movie, and if you watch it, you'll know what I mean.  <br /> <br />Throughout at least half of the movie, mom runs around town on wild goose-chases searching for something or someone that resembles her daughter. In the interim, the landscape of Silent Hill changes from light to dark and back again. As you might guess, dark is not a good time to be roaming Silent Hill, cause that's when the beasties emerge from the shadows, and stalk our cute heroine. Well, this cycle repeats a couple of times throughout the movie, until we start to get a clearer picture of what's going on.  <br /> <br />As the story fleshes out, things become increasingly less discernable so that by the end of the film, the plot gets more holes in it than the evil fanatic cult leader (probably the most graphic scene in the movie). <br /> <br />Well not all is lost. If you can disregard the parts that don't make sense, and simply enjoy the attention-grabbing gore, and thrilling effects, then it does prove to be a somewhat enjoyable film. But if you're a straight-up horror enthusiast, then I would recommend Dawn of the Dead, or Resident Evil for your viewing pleasure.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|I think this CD is brilliant. Even though I am fairly new to Tool's music after having only paid much attention since they toured with King Crimson and the drummer performed with Adrian Belew on his recent solo work. I decided to give them a try and went out and bought a couple of their early releases. I was fairly impressed and enjoyed what I heard, but I did not feel they were up to the level of KC or bands like Porcupine Tree. However, with the new release \\"10,000 Days\\" they have now risen to that level. They have become a very important band that offers something more than your average experimental metal music. In fact the metal has just become another aspect or brush stroke of the art they are now creating and having the three dimensional artwork to be viewed through a pair of glasses only further emphasizes this to be true! It is a visual glimpse of their world and where the music comes from. They create music that is magic.
0385474547|4.0|The book was ok overall. I liked it because it was a different culture, and I didn't know nothing about it. I didn't like the customs they lived by.
0393327655|4.0|The idea's pitched by Sam Harris are cutting. I had a much more detailed review typed out but it (ah-ha!)got accidentally erased. Alas, I get to the salient points: <br /> <br />1. Great Conceptual Achievment. (Must read before one graduates High School). This mind stretch sends Faith back to \\"strawberry fields forever...\\" <br /> <br />2. At times, no kidding, I had re-read a sentence 3-5 times to either grasp it's profound meaning, or mete out the author's meandering boat to china syntax. That is my only criticism. Sam could have dumbed it down for a lay audience. I suppose THIS WAS the dumbed down one by Sam's standards. One needs to have an SAT score of 1600+ not to be challenged by the neuro acumen. <br /> <br />3.The copious footnotes are a book unto themselves, which I read separately as to avoid disrupting the flow. Otherwise you find yourself chopping and flipping.  <br /> <br />4. Bad reviews if you check, are sponsored by Faith mongers. I have spoken. Agnostic J. <br />
1400095913|3.0|I would have given this 4 stars if not for Dexter's sister Deb.  Dexter's narrative was hilarious and even his dialogue with most of the characters was okay, but his sister sounded like somebody from a really, really bad movie.  Also, I felt as though a couple of pages were missing towards the ending.  If you're worried about the violence, don't be.  Lindsay does not go into gory, graphic detail about each death.  Not sure if I will read the next installment as Darkly Dreaming was okay, but didn't love it.
0385474547|3.0|I think this novel is okay. The two thing I like about this novel is that the story is based on realistic events, and the fact that it shows tragedy to a man, Okonkwo, who strives for acceptance in his fellowmen. The two things that I didn't like about this story is that the story can be alittle boring from the lack of adventure, and action. The novel was interesting to read, but I won't recommend it to someone who likes adventure. It can get boring at times, but overall it was okay
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers a band unreconized in the 80's and adored by the early 90's.A band of Funk and amazing melodies and ever changing music.\\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" was their greatest achievment many will tell you, and in some sence it was, but that doesn't mean they can't wop out a new album and still make it marvelous.2002's \\"By The Way\\" caught the band in a mellowed out predicament very layed back featuring great melodies, this too follows that recipe with a few innovative twists worth relistining too for years to come.<br /><br />Opening with the catchy radio friendly \\"Dani California\\" The Chili's find them selves at the top of their game again.Featuring some of John's most amazing guitar work to date.Listen to \\"Dani California's\\" outro/solo or the breath taking solo to \\"Turn It Again\\" and be reminded of RHCP's earlier works.Oh don't forget Flea, tumbling out more quirky basslines like the intro to \\"Charlie\\" and the Tom Petty like bassline to \\"Dani California\\"(listen to \\"Mary Janes Last Dance\\" very similar)powerful basslines.Anthony too throws out catchy phrases and lines like \\"Born in the state of Mississippi/Pappa was a Copper/Mamma was a hippy\\".Even Chad who is often forgotten is at the top of his game banging his drum set like crazy with his own brilliant solo in \\"Hump de Bump\\".<br /><br />The albums comes in three doses,(the first) a slow as can possibly be tempo, or a funky all over the place good to be back tempo.The third is a weird surreal hard to describe sound.As if they wanted to make a follow up to \\"Venice Queen\\"(off of \\"By The Way, last track) for an otherwordly moving sound.\\"Animal Bar\\" catches the best of all three of these attributes starting off with a bizzar intro seasoned with effects, thus leading to a slowish mid tempo arrival then sharply cuts to a rockish section.Many of these songs weren't derived to be hits like the funkafied \\"Storm In A Teacup\\" (my favorite so far).Yet they still manage to have radio play, because they are so good!Some songs have some residue from the past on them like \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\" and a \\"Scar Tissue\\"(on 1999's award winning achievment \\"Californication\\")like \\"She's Only Eighteen\\".It's truly not a bad thing but will be taken into consideration.\\"So Much I\\" could pose as a \\"Californacation\\" era hit.All these songs in many ways feel like a sum up of the bands career, holding true to each of their many albums by grabbing thier potentials and shoving them into these songs.<br /><br />By this point you'll more or less think this is the ultimate album if so...not exactly, but close.Define the best album?High quality, a strong variety, no fillers, fantastic musicianship.Then yes this is the \\"ultimate album\\".When stacked up to classics like \\"Let It Be\\", and \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\",this doesn't hold too well.It's amazing and in my opinion the best album of 2006 and possibly within the last few years, but will it hold up to the test of time?Peek at older RHCP material if you agree then more then likley you'll agree with this too.<br /><br />The point is the Chili's are finally back after what felt like the four longest years of my life, and are in their prime.It's nice to see they are still together after all these years and still as strong as ever.A band like this will continue to grow and experiment wich today music needs more then ever.Long live the Chilis.ome residue from the past on them like \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\" and a \\"Scar Tissue\\"(on 1999's award winning achievment \\"Californication\\")like \\"She's Only Eighteen\\".It's truly not a bad thing but will be taken into consideration.\\"So Much I\\" could pose as a \\"Californacation\\" era hit.All these songs in many ways feel like a sum up of the bands career, holding true to each of their many albums by grabbing thier potentials and shoving them into these songs.

B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I was a diehard fan of Final Fantasy, and especially FFVII, until I saw this movie.  I've read alot of reviews that think the animation was this movie's saving grace, and while it was decent, not worth the agony of sitting through this piece of garbage.  Making an exciting movie following FFVII seemed to be a no-brainer task, yet someone the writers couldn't manage this task.  Although I don't want to ruin the plot for the suckers who just shelled about $15 for two shiny coasters, I will say that the entire plot can be summarized in about 10 words or less.  And Yuffie parachuting in...that was the point I turned it off.  Was there a Scottish accent I heard too?  Just when you think it was getting bad, it would get worse. And what was with Tifa's chest?  Was she hiding Materia in there?     The animation acting was jerky and kind of creepy to watch.  The solution to some of the problems the characters face makes no sense.  I could go on, but I am just still shocked at how badly they could drop the ball.  I wasted $20 and 1.5 hours of my life on this garbage.  Don't make the same mistake!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This is a smooth CD by a new group called Gnarls Barkley which consist of Rap Icon from the Southern group Goodie Mob the one and only Cee-Lo Green and from Grey album fame the DJ and producer is Dangermouse. This is a highly anticipated album in Europe so it is bound to be here. The album has a crossover appear and as I mentioned is just smooth and it goes into the line of Love Below by Andre3000. For something that satisfies your needs look no farther then the best rap album so far of 2006. I give this album 4 1/2 Mics
B000FGGE5Y|1.0|Normally, when a movie has its colors dulled or placed in super sharp contrast, its done to indicate either flashbacks or sentimentality. In the 2006 flick Ultraviolet, these color tricks are used in every single sequence, indeed in each and every frame. Ultraviolet looks incredible, but ultimately it is just another flash and trash flick.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a painfully bad mixture of fantastic cinematography and awful acting and direction. The film is basically a bad Matrix ripoff. And the script is just plain bizarre.<br /><br />In the future America depicted in Ultraviolet, there are two different kinds of people. The first group act just like characters from the Matrix movies, including the ability to dodge bullets and the like. They are also at heart vampires, although this aspect of the movie was poorly handled to the point that the vampire bit was confusing. The other group consists of normal everyday folks. Of course, the normal folks are at heart fascists and hate the Matrix types.<br /><br />The level of acting in Ulatraviolet is horrible. You can tell that the actors are in this movie just for the pay checks. They just go through the motions, not even trying to act.<br /><br />This is not the first movie directed by Kurt Wimmer that was basically a ripoff of The Matrix trilogy. He also made the hit Equilibrium. As a director, Wimmer specializes in lots of flashy action sequences. The end result is movies that look cool, but are ultimately empty.<br /><br />The basic problem with Ultraviolet is that its all surface gloss. Ultraviolet has a clear similarity to a somewhat earlier movie, Aeon Flux in that its all flash and trash. Both flicks are basically nothing more than godawful messes of gosh wow and would be cool and wonderful stuff.<br /><br />Only problem is that movies like Ultraviolet are anything but cool.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|This album is nothing special. To be honest, almost EVERY song sounds the same, the singer does not sing with emotion, every note is the same. FLAT. I have listened to IV prior to this, i liked IV, so i figured id listen to godsmacks earlier releases .....after listening to this crap, i dont EVER wanna hear GODSMACK evere again~
B000EULJLU|2.0|I think it's funny that Tool, straight out, records a poor album by their standards, & by todays standards, pretty average... <br /> <br />Yet many people try to FORCE themselves to like it. <br />Do you see all these reviews of people saying, \\"let it grow on you\\"? It's not a question of growing... 10,000 Days simply isn't very good & they're really saying, \\"Keep listening to it until you convince yourselves its great\\" <br /> <br />You're such sheep, it's pathetic.  Tool could literally record static for 1 hr 20 min & you sheep would talk about how deep & complex it is, & if there's any \\"hidden meaning\\" <br /> <br />You aren't smart. You're just annoying.
B000021XR5|3.0|I have to say, i really enjoy this album. Its suprisingly very good.....from the hard heavy tracks, to the melon collie ballads, to the soaring mid-tempo pieces....it has it all!!!!! <br /> <br />Its dark, and full of emotion, pick it up....its a good listen!
B00004XONN|5.0|the problem with radiohead is that it somehow achieved great popularity yet its style is inevitably a turn off to anyone looking for a quick hook. <br /> <br />There are several things you have to do to like Kid A. <br />1.  Throw away your expectations of what music should be <br />2.  Don't listen to what your friends say about the album <br />3.  Listen to it.  A lot.  It helps to listen to it alone.  It's hard to get into it if you're worried about what someone else thinks of it. <br />4.  Looking up the lyrics helps <br /> <br />Radiohead is completely deceiving.  I listened to the album for the first time and heard cold, electronic music with a tampered voice.  Many, many, listens later, I hear a warm, living, record that gets me every time.   <br /> <br />It's impossible to like this album without listening to it at least 5 times.  But after 15-20 listens, there's no way you'll not like it.  It's just that good.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is truly a GREAT album.......one of the greatest of the 90's..........its dark, murky, angry, raw...GRUNGE rock at its BEST!!!!!!! <br /> <br />This album is the one album where eddie vedder is truly at his best vocally....the way he hits the notes, the rage in his voice, the barritone.....SHEER PERFECTION!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />There a a few throw away filler tracks in here, but they are scattered towards the end of the album, to alleviate some of the intensity that this album builds.....man do i love this record!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />VITALOGY can NEVER be mimicked.....NEVER <br />If you dont own this one, go and pick it up ASAP.....and dont burn it, go and buy it....the artwork is AWESOME, its like a little 50 page book <br /> <br />MASTERPIECE!
B000065PUE|5.0|i don't know if there's any other album that's as fun as this one.    It has so much energy and it'll get in your head, but in a good way.  On the surface, they have the sound of any other punk or alt rock band, but their song writing is head and shoulders above the rest.   <br /> <br />Doolittle strikes the perfect balance between catchiness and depth. It's been out forever but I still love it.   <br /> <br />btw, Monkey gone to Heaven is probably my favorite track.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is amazing for a couple.  One, it breaks the barrier of the manly cowboy stereotype.  Two, it is a good story, and makes you feel all emotions possible.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is nearly impossible to like at first.  My friends highly, highly recommended it, so I left it on and listened to it on my computer and car as background music.  I must have listened to the album at least 5-10 times before I started hearing ANY melodies at all.  But then the songs start revealing themselves one by one, and it is absolutely mindblowing.  I've had OK Computer for about 2 years and I've probably listened to it 200 + times.  Still,  I just started to realize how awesome certain songs are, such as Climbing up the Walls and Let Down. <br /> <br />By the way, the first radiohead song I heard was creep, and it completely pales in comparison to just about any other song they've ever released.   <br /> <br />I just don't see how anyone who listens long enough to know the songs could NOT like this album.  It's just that good.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|the red hot chili peppers are going into the 23rd year in their careers. 23 years is a substantial amount of time. Its only natural that as these wonderful musicians enter their mid 40's, their music will start to differ from the ones they produced in their 20's. Yes, their music has drastically changed. The majority of this album is comprised of pop rock tunes. however, there are few tracks that do bring back some essence that we saw in the blood sugar sex magik album (i.e. warlocks and storm in a teacup). I myself enjoyed those tracks a lot. For the first time since BSSM album, you could really hear the bite in every note that flea plays. It felt so good. You can clearly tell that john contributed greatly to this album. John's solos have become more tone-ful than ever. chad is still lockin it down on the fat back beats. anthony's vocals have become more soft and intimate. One down side i see to the album is that it does not feel as \\"whole\\" as other chili peppers album. As i listen to each tracks from 1 - 14, i cant get a sense of a specific theme or emotions running through the record. The only explaination i can think of is the fact that it is a double album and a lot of songs were stuffed in.  <br /> <br />Overall, regardless of what many critics and reviews say, i believe this is a good album. Just because the style of their tunes have changed, that doesnt mean that their musicianships have downgraded to a lower level. this album is well worth its price.
0385474547|3.0|It was alright but i think it would've been better if i could acually understand and follow the novel or if i had a little more time to read it. But for other classes i would reccomend it to other teachers for thier classes as they arent rushed! But the two things i liked about this novel were the feelings that were captured and the different views of thier culture.Two things I didnt really like was the violence shown and some of the beliefs that the have.All in all i would recommend this novel to a class as long as they have enough time to read the book.
B000007ODM|5.0|I bought this album after hearing two of its songs played in the amazing aviation video \\"Jet Flight in Mountains\\" (do a google search for jetflightinmountains ... yes all one word, and you'll be amazed...views of the swiss alps from low-flying fighters, and a new appreciation of the Matterhorn!!) and I can see why the vid's producers picked the music...very soaring and effective mix of latin-like choral vocals with hip beats. As an aircrew member who flies in mountains, I find the music running through my head as we cruise in our helo....will be buying more of their albums, as one isn't enough.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Okay, I've loved Sarah since hearing 'Adia' a few years back.  I LOVE Surfacing, and when 'Afterglow' was released I knew I had to own it.  The only problem was I hadn't heard anything off the album except 'Train Wreck' and I was not a fan of the song.  A friend of mine had the track 'Dirty Little Secret' on a CD and let me listen to it and I loved it so much that I went out and bought the CD that day.  Now, the first half and the last half of this album are great, the middle is decent, and it's not that any track is bad really (I mean, I don't like 'Train Wreck' but it's not terrible) it's just that nothing on this album grabs me like Surfacing did.  There's no 'Adia', no 'Building a Mystery'...no 'Angel'.  'Fallen' is a great opening track, beautifully written and beautifully sung, and 'Stupid' is also a favorite of mine.  'Push' and the closing 'Dirty Little Secret' are probably my favorite tracks here, the later is so haunting it's almost breathtaking.  I love and always will love Sarah and her beautiful voice, I just wanted something earth shattering in 'Afterglow' and I didn't find it.  It's still worth the buy and well worth the listen, it's just not as good as Surfacing.
B00005JOVN|4.0|'Poseidon' suffers and then soars because of the same fact...it's not 'Titanic'.  Many critics critisized this film saying that it was 'Titanic' without any heart, without a love story and so it wasn't near as good.  But then again, if 'Poseidon' focused on a love story only to have the ship sink and everyone die the critics would say it was just a copy=cat of sorts.  It's pointless to try and be 'Titanic' because it's impossible to improve on that film unless you copy it frame for frame.  So 'Poseidon' decides to throw you almost instantly into action (I mean like within a few minutes) and doesn't let off until the credits roll.  Yes, some of this film is improbable, some of it is a bit cheesy, but for the most part it's a great popcorn flick with excelent graphics and some decent acting (most notably is Jacinda Barrett who plays a single mother)  The story line is pretty simple.  The cruise ship Poseidon is hit by a rogue wave and capsizes.  The captian of the ship orders everyone stay in the ballroom because it's airtight and they can wait for help, but two men think otherwise.  Josh Lucas plays a gambler who was once in the Navy and believes he can get out through the bottom of the ship, and Kurt Russell plays and ex-mayor who is trying to find his daughter (Emmy Rossum) who is in the disco with her boyfriend.  These two men end up taking some others with them including Barrett and her son and Richard Dreyfuss, a man whos lover just left him and is on the verge of suicide...(It's kinda funny to me how he spots the wave coming while he's trying to jump overboard...and I'm thinking 'nows your chance...you're sure to die now' but he turns around and runs...it's kinda funny)  ANyways, theres plenty of action throughout the film and plenty of suspence as well.  There are a few scenes that will make you tense, especially the ventilation shaft scene that everyone is talking about.  All in all the film is very well done and is sure to please fans of the genra...it's no'Titanic' but we already have one of those!
B00003CXAT|5.0|'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I first heard this album, I thought it was OK, but that some tracks were unnecessary. Then after repeated listens I thought it was amazing and that all tracks belonged and fit in well. But it hasnt stopped there... <br /> <br />This album just keeps getting better and better with each listen, I discover something new. I usually get sick of CDs after repeated listenings but not this one. I now believe this is their best album. And Ive been a fan since 93- have bought every album at the midnight sale and all that. This is a true masterpiece, unparralled in recent years by any band.
0393327655|5.0|And you can join him!  As Mark Twain said, \\"Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company.\\"  Where would YOU rather be: in sunny Heaven with Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly and Benny Hinn, or in smoky Hell with Groucho Marx and Bertrand Russell and Hunter S Thompson?  Oh, and Mark Twain, of course. <br /> <br />Read this thoughtful book as an exercise in shibboleth-challenging.  If you're an unbeliever (like me), you'll admire Harris' cogent argumentation, and if you're a believer, you'll enjoy testing your beliefs in the face of unmitigated HERESY, BLASPHEMY, and SCOFFING.  Either way, it's an excellent book.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Eli Roth has made an excellent 2nd film here and has now shown he will be in the game as long as he wants. A lot of movies try to copy the gruesome scenes from SAW and the violence of The Devil's Rejects. Some accomplish this in an entertaining way (Hostel) and some scare the [...] out of you (Wolf Creek).     Hostel is not very believable at times. The characters and situations were a little too extreme to really believe. Still, the idea is so fascinating that people would want to kill for fun, that you just hang on for the ride.      The concept of Hostel was based on true events and Roth has shown he can write an entertaining movie. The final half hour was so cool, that I have to believe Tarantino had an influence on how the movie wrapped up. You can see the movie go from all over the place to taking a very awesome ending.
0393327655|4.0|Most rational people have a vague sense that faith is not a good thing for society. Many of us utterly reject the crazy rantings of Pat Robertson or Jerry Fallwell and a great deal more proclaim our hatred for the acts of terrorism commited in the name of God (by either Christian or Muslim Extremists). This book places the blame for these acts squarely where it deserves to be placed, on beliefs taken without evidence. Faith in other words.  <br /> <br />Harris argues, quite effectively, that we must, as a world society, rid ourselves of this virus or face destruction. Faith has caused wars and genocide in the past and surely will in the future. When people truly believe crazy things about what happens after they die they are libel to do things that would strike any rational person as mad, like flying planes into buildings and bombing abortion clinics. When this kind of fanaticism is combined with weapons of mass destruction it is only a matter of time before they are used. This book is highly recommended although it will definitely keep you up at night.
0060254920|5.0|I first bought this book for my oldest son who is now 9 when he was still in his mother's womb, I couldn't wait until he was old enough for me to read it to him.  He loved it!  I always read it with much enthusiasm and he loved to ROAR the terrible roars and GNASH his terrible teeth and SHOW his terrible claws! <br /> <br />I just started reading it to my 20 month old son who simply calls it \\"the book\\".  He refuses to let me read any other book to him.  His favorite parts are the pages with no words.  We howl at the moon, make monkey sounds as we hang from the trees and march in the monster parade going hup, two, three, four and dance around the house like the wild things we are.  Then he will sit for ages just carefully turning the pages and make \\"wild thing\\" noises and look at the pictures where as he tends to eat and chew on his other \\"books\\". <br /> <br />I can't wait for Halloween so I can dress my youngest in a wolf suit and let the \\"wild rumpus start!\\" <br />  <br /> <br />
6305428352|5.0|When is comes to teacher/student dramas there isn't one better than 'Mr. Holland's Opus' for the main reason that it's believable.  Most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers, teachers that can do no wrong.  Here, we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome isn't always the best.  He's a man who knows how to do one thing, and that one thing he does so well, but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one's he loves the most.  Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss in a career best) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills.  His wife (Glenne Headley) is supportive, yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change.  Their relationship is tried as Glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who can't share his love of music is killing him.  Glenn is a very flawed man, but he has a very big heart and that's why this film works so well.  When Glenn starts to fall in love with a student you don't hate him as much as you feel bad for him.  He's far from a bad man, he's just a man.  This is truly one of the most touching, inspirational and blessed movies I've ever seen.  It's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time I watch it.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast and a very true to life feel to the script and to the performances you feel as though you know these people, and by the end of the film you'll want to.  As ispirational as 2001's 'A Beautiful Mind' this film stands tall as one of the best films ever made.
B000003CKH|5.0|From one of the best bands ever. LOVE THIS BAND.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion is angelic, and here with 'A Decade of Song' she gives us some of her most beautiful work.  What is so brilliant about this album is that instead of treading the same water that every artist takes when releasing their 'greatest hits' Celine takes another route and gives her fans more than just a hat trick.  She hands them her most impressive singles, the songs we all love and listen to on repeat ('Because you Loved me' & 'My Heart will go On' to be exact) but instead of filling the rest of the album with filler tracks she gives us, not one, not two but SEVEN new songs, and each of them is just as impressive as the last ('All the Way' is beautiful, but what would you expect when you sing alongside the great Sinatra).  Starting with her supersized debut hit 'Power of Love' and delving into new territory on the catchy, poppish 'That's the Way it is' Celine gives us all something to be happy with and delivers yet another solid album for her massive fan base!

B000093BDX|5.0|Sounds Of Summer: The Very Best Of The Beach Boys, is the perfect, and really the only complete introduction to what was arguably the second biggest band of the 60's (Of course with The Beatles taking first and The Beach Boys have to battle that spot with The Rolling Stones).  <br /> <br />     While The Beach Boys may be compared to The Beatles as they are both named \\"Pop Rock\\", The Beach Boys developed an instantly distinctive sound, that pulled them to the near top of popular music in the 1960's. As stated in the booklet of Sounds Of Summer, The Beatles and The Beach Boys had a friendly musical competetion that really brought out the best of eachother. This Album prooves this.  <br /> <br />     The first, almost half of the album are the more commonly known early, carefree, often surfing and beach related, as The Beach Boys derived from California, surely inspiring the imaginative worlds created by their songs. But as the album progresses, you feel you are actually wittnessing The Beach Boys mature as The Beatles did in their latter years. With the musical mastermind that is Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys put out some of their best music in the late 60's with songs like \\"God Only Knows\\", voted the best love song of all time. Another great track near the end is \\"Darlin'\\" not well known at all but just as incredible as the major pop hits that are \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\". But were The Beach Boys finished after the 60's? No, a great track hear from the 80's is \\"Getcha Back\\".  <br />     If you would like to find great music of the 60's beyond The Beatles, I highly reccomend Sounds of Summer: The Very Best Of The Beach Boys as an intro into California's most colorful band.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Actually, yes.  This album represents what I have come to love about Tool since I first heard Undertow.  The anger and harsh, overtly challenging lyrics of Opiate and Undertow changed into the more subtle, mysterious pounding of Lateralus and much of Aenima that quickly worked its way inside your head and refused to let go.  That, however, didn't change what Tool had established themselves on.  The groups' musical style hadn't changed, nor had their views.  It was their method of expression that was altered.  Namely, the lyrics.  Lateralus represented the largest change the band had yet achieved.  The interludes given us to set the tone for songs to follow were something yet unexperienced by Tool listeners.  In my opinion, they actually set Lateralus apart-far above my expectations of what was then their newest album.  In fact, it was completely different from what I had expected.  I suppose that is what made Lateralus such a terrific album.  We [Tool fans] had literally no clue what we were in for in that first listening period.  A good many fans hated where Tool had decided to go with Lateralus.  Apparently, just as many loved Lateralus for that decision, as did many others who joined the Tool fanbase because of that style.  10,000 Days represents a similar change in the method Tool have chosen to convey their thoughts. <br /> <br />Many have complained about the disjointed feel of 10,000 Days.  I would contend that it was completely intentional.  The melancholy, wishful mood we get in the first two tracks (yes, melancholy-just listen to the lyrics) are brought to a climax with \\"Wings Pt. 1\\" and the title track.  Once we have reached the climax of acceptance, we are hurled head-long into the reactionary side of the album.  Disjointed, lyrically unstable tracks are perpetuated by \\"The Pot\\" and continued through \\"Right in Two.\\"  We are then lead into \\"Viginti Tres.\\"  This disturblingly calm song gives listeners the feeling that something more is to come.  The same feeling as that had by someone who has recently lost a loved one, and has not yet reached \\"closure,\\" if there even is such a creature.  Gone is the repressed feeling of strain in every word, every note.  In it's place we have muted, challenging vocals almost occaisionally superseeded by the very free guitar of Adam Jones.  Perhaps I am reading too much into this, but perhaps this is Maynard's way of sharing his loss with us.  Perhaps he is drawing us into the experience by giving us a kind of play-by-play of how someone might react to the death of a parent.  Perhaps. <br /> <br />Is this Tool?  Absolutely.  The changes noted in 10,000 Days are the same as the changes of Lateralus from Aenima and so on.  This album is not at all what I expected, but in spite of that-no, not in spite of it, BECAUSE of it-I'm darn happy with it.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|A black and white movie which completely captivated me in the 1970's was  \\"The Last Picture Show.\\"  A film so outstanding it launched the careers of several actors.  <br /> <br />Frankly I never thought a film of that genre could impress me again.  However, I confess that the mold has not been broken, but definitely improved upon. <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback\\" is Ang Lee's masterpiece in color.  It's not really about two homosexual cowboys who get it on and shock us in their harsh and hard love scenes with each other (although this is included.) There is much more here than that.  <br /> <br />Like the \\"Last Picture Show.\\" this is about how folks really are or can be in small western type towns.  And it is beautiful in all of its theme of  longing...for unrequited love.  <br /> <br />Keith Ledger is convincing as Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaul is splendid as Jack.  They protray two sheepherders who make a life long connection as they have fallen hopelessly and sadly in love with each other in the 1960's.   <br /> <br />Nods to Anne Hathaway and Michelle Phillips as the long suffering spouses of the pair.  And Randy Quaid deserves a bow, because he is  even better than he was in the \\"Last Picture Show\\" or anything else he has ever done.   <br /> <br />Anyone who lets  the hype which came out when the movie was released,  the homosexual aspect, or that this one did not win the oscar(it shoulda)turn them away is missing a very good story.  We just don't see this kind of greatness very often.   <br /> <br />
B0000AI45P|5.0|Not enough people seem to know about Marquee Moon or to even have heard of Television or Tom Verlaine. As a musician, people always ask me about my influences and which guitar players they should try to get into etc... I am always amazed that they have not heard of Verlaine or Lloyd, both are amazing and unique. This album is more than just a sublime guitar album though, and even more than a tremendous debut. Marquee Moon is one of the most refreshingly original, breathtaking, fascinating, and enjoyable albums ever cut. Every track is amazing. When asked to describe the band, I usually, to the suprise of most who could not imagine such a thing, call it classic jazz punk. The sound, while it sounds like it could have been cut yesterday or today, is classic, but the attitude and vocals are almost punk and the interplay of the guitarists and the harmonies are almost jazz-like (especially the title track). Their second album Adventure, while not quite as monumental as Marquee Moon, is well-worth checking out and is still a tremendous effort that leaves one wanting more Television. Unfortunately the band would break up after their superlative sophomore effort:(
B000AYQLX6|5.0|This is one of my favorite Lennon albums filled with lovely melodies (Whatever Gets You Through the Night, #9 Dream), revealing and ironic lyrics (Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out; Steel and Glass) and a classy production.  It has a little for everyone from romantic ballads (Bless You) to rockers (You Don't KNow What you Got).  John's vocals are in fine form and he is backed by top notch musicians. <br /> <br />I noticed that another commentator stated that John was in an \\"artistic slump.\\"  I wish every artist would have a \\"slump\\" like this. <br /> <br />This release shows what John was capable of once out from under \\"The Yoke.\\" It is no wonder that Walls and Bridges features two top ten hits (Whatever Gets You Thru the Night and #9 Dream), was a Top 10 LP, and was one of his best selling releases at the time.
B000002UB3|4.0|5 Stars,accidentally hit 4 and can't change it now:( Abbey Road is without a doubt one of the Beatle's finest records. It is, at times, serious, and full of emotional weight (Oh Darling, with McCartney's powerful, gut-wrenching vocals), pyschedelic and dark (I Want You), sometimes hilarious and fun (Maxwell's Silver Hammer, such a gruesome song though it is presented in such a fun and upbeat fashion)and other times fanciful (Octopus's Garden). Nearly every song is a classic and many of them are even recognizable from the very first notes. \\"Come together right now, over me\\" is one of music's most well-known choruses. Those opening notes of \\"Something\\" are unmistakable and sublime. \\"Here COmes the Sun\\" is not only instantly recognizable but also so beatiful that it almost brings tears. Every track is truly worth mentioning, but I think that after reading what I have so far written, it is obvious to whoever is reading(if for some reason anyone doesn't already have one of the most popular albums by history's most popular group) would already be convinced that this album is worth a listen, in fact several listens, as each one is more rewarding.  To say these guys went out on top, may be the biggest understatement one can make.

Those who would pirate the music, large scale, will find a way around the copy protection anyway.  We consumers are the only losers.
0393057658|5.0|Whether or not you like baseball, Moneyball is an excellent read.  Out of obscure statistics and management minutia, Lewis creates an absolutely thrilling, thoroughly American account of market economics and how the smart little guy can conquer giants.   <br /> <br />While the business side of the book is very interesting, the account transcends management techniques and market theory to focus on several individuals whose careers are transformed by Billy Beane's unorthodox baseball reckoning.  This human touch rounds out the story and provides a needed counterweight to Billy Beane's rather cold, calculating personality.  However, the greatest quality of this book is the melding of economics, business and sports to create a highly readable account that is sure to appeal to a wide audience.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|It just keeps getting better. Any fan of \\"Underworld\\" should be very happy with this sequel. Those that missed the first one can watch this as a standalone but it will make more since if you go back and see Underworld first. I know I went back and re-watched Underworld before seeing Evolution. If you have never seen Underworld, but you are a fan of any vampire or werewolf movies you will probably enjoy these. Imagine a world where there are three races. Humans, Vampires, and Werewolves. Now imagine The Vampires and Werewolves are at war over an ancient dispute. The first Underworld clarifies why. The second Underworld is the evolution of lycans and vampires, reflection on past events, the the continuation of the relationship between a human that became part werewolf and part vampire and a vampiress, and a big Lycan vs Vampire showdown. Fans of the \\"Blade\\" trilogy should definitely not be disappointed. I recommend it for at least a rental to anyone that hasn't seen the first one and a go ahead and buy for those that enjoyed Underworld.

B00005T7I1|4.0|Dick Tracy is a wonderfully realized trip into a comic strip that stars Warren Beatty as the dedicated cop in the yellow coat, but Beatty doesn't just star as the lead, he's also the film's producer and director. Dick Tracy is filled with big names like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Madonna, Paul Sorvino and even James Cann, Kathy Bates and Dick Van Dyke in a couple of small roles. The film was produced by Art Linson and Barrie Osbourne, who also produced such films as Heat, Fight Club, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings and features a smashing score from Danny Elfman who previously scored Tim Burton's Batman and later scored Sam Raimi's very comic bookish Darkman. Elfman is pretty much the \\"go-to-guy\\" for comic book movie scores, having also done two Batman films, two Spider-Man films and The Hulk.<br /><br />Beatty does a good job as Tracy, but the real marvel of acting has got to be Al Pacino, covered in make-up and supporting a back hump as Big Boy Caprice. He tears into the role and really chews it up, going wildly over-the-top; constantly yelling and shouting at everybody. The tone of the film seems like a slightly revamped old school style film-noir, using traditional yet exciting scene transitions, dramatic lighting and set designs. Which reminds me, if Stanley Kubrick had ever decided to do a comic book film I think this is what it might have looked like. Visually it's a great film. It's only sixteen years old, gosh has it really been that long? Boy I'm starting to feel kind of old. The look of the city is done in what I think must have been extensive matte paintings, or possible models, but I don't think the film used that many computer effects, because in the early nineties or possibly the late eighties (when this film was probably made) CGI wasn't quite that widely used, and was only made much more popular after Terminator 2.<br /><br />The film is about Dick Tracy's battle to keep the streets safe from gangster thugs and Big Boy who has made a move to become the city's biggest crimelord, while at the same time a night club singer known as Breathless Mahoney (only in the movies or comics are people called such crazy names) played by Madonna, tries to seduce Tracy, but all he wants from her is to testify in court against Big Boy, who has recently taken over the club she sings at. Then things get really complicated when Tracy's girlfriend, Tess Trueheart (again, only in the movies) is kidnapped and is framed for murdering the city's District Attorney, landing the cop in the slammer.<br /><br />Dick Tracy is a well acted, visually glamorous and stupendous movie-going experience that's a fun throw back to old film-noirs and jazzy detective yarns filled with blazing tommy guns and screeching tires. I loved it! And I wished they'd make more movies like it, but I guess in some ways you could argue that they are making a bit of a come back, like with last year's Sin City for example, but instead of splashes of color here and there, Dick Tracy is an overwhelming tidal wave of color, and it sweeps you up off your feet and away.o become the city's biggest crimelord, while at the same time a night club singer known as Breathless Mahoney (only in the movies or comics are people called such crazy names) played by Madonna, tries to seduce Tracy, but all he wants from her is to testify in court against Big Boy, who has recently taken over the club she sings at.

B0009P42S2|3.0|While visually stunning, STEAMBOY suffers miserably for being a plot driven film with poor character development. Action, action, action, all at the expense of an interesting story. <br /> <br />A boy's scientist father and grandfather are at odds over a weapon they've devised, and the boy is thrown in the mix, conflicted, attempting to resolve who is right and who is abusing science. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the film's story develops at a too fast clip, spending more time loving itself for how great it looks. It's a shame, because the design and production values are top notch. <br /> <br />It's worth watching from an animation enthusiasts point of view, but know going in that it's a yawner. Action without emotional investment from the viewer amounts to boring viewing.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany s\\" (1961) is simply a classic, one of those films you just need to watch. I did that tonight. Why didn t I watch it before? I suppose I wasn t curious enough, and I didn t  think that this movie could live up to the buzz. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br /><br />The story takes place in New York, and is based on a novella written by Truman Capote, adapted to the screen by George Axelrod and directed by Blake Edwards. The cast is simply wonderful, and the wardrobe, stunning.<br /><br />One of the main characters is the exquisitely beautiful Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), an enchanting young woman with many secrets that lives off the gifts given to her by older men. Holly has a cat without a name, because \\"The way I see it I haven't got the right to give him one. We don't belong to each other. We just took up one day by the river. I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's\\".<br /><br />Holly s main purpose in life is to marry someone with lots of money, and finally be free. There is a small flaw in her plan, though: it doesn t take into account the fact that she might fall in love. However, that is just what might happen when she discovers a new neighbour, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a struggling writer financed by an older woman, that happens to be very handsome and easy to talk to. When Holly and Paul meet, a friendship begins to develop between them. But can something else happen, when Paul has no money, and Holly is afraid of being in love and belonging to someone? Watch this film, and find out!<br /><br />All in all, I think that \\"Breakfast at Tiffany s\\" is the kind of movie you will want to watch more than once. Again, a classic to be enjoyed  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat

As I read the reviews and hear the music, it brings me memories of how much I love this album.  It is my very first album I ever bought.  I saw the video for joyride, and liked the chorus very much.  I didn't know there were so many hits on this album.  Fading like a flower, excellent ballad.  Church of the Heart, another excellent song.  Excellent guitar arrangement, in my opinion. the Big L, catchy chorus.  I used to listen to this tape to fall asleep.  I think that's why this is one of the reasons why I like it, it is almost inbedded in my head.  I would recommend it.
0307277674|3.0|The Da Vinci Code gets three stars from me.  I found it entertaining, undemanding, inexpensive, and (slightly) informative.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />This book is well worth its paperback price.  Dan Brown tells a good fictional story, that most readers will appreciate from beginning to end.  I finished it in less than 24 hours and I'm a very discriminating reader who rarely reads any fiction that hasn't yet been agreed upon as \\"literature\\".<br /><br />Most readers will also learn something from reading this book.  I do not refer to the conjuectures that Brown makes from his non-factual premises.  Instead, there are a lot of small nuggets of information that even well-read people are likely to have never picked up on or else forgotten.  Examples include PHI, the origin of draconian, pagan, villager etc.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Symbol overload.  I realize that Langdon is a symbologist, but he makes himself see implications of the \\"sacred feminine\\" in virtually everything.  Learning more about roses was interesting, conjecturing that all troubadors were on a mission to keep alive the veneration of \\"the goddess\\" was a bit too ham-fisted.<br /><br />Brown's \\"Facts\\".  Previous reviewer's have pointed out these faults in exhaustive detail, but for those who dont want to read through 3000 reviews, I'll recap the one's that stood out for me.<br /><br />-  the priory of sion is a hoax...it never existed except through the machinations of a French career con-man.<br /><br />-  the 4th century Council of Nicea did not \\"first propose and vote\\" on Christ's divinity.<br /><br />-  the \\"marriage of Jesus and Mary\\" is NOT a matter of historical record.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Yeah I know that this is not the most original outfit out there, but I really care less. Anyway this cd for the most part is pretty sick. I do find this particular style of metalcore totally overated but there are a few groups in it that pretty tight, including this band. Unearth combines melodic metal with hardcore, very original. Anywho, they do a good job with it and definitely met my expectations with this cd. All the songs are good, but in my opinion 2,3,5,6,7,8,and 10 are the best. I think there is something that is missing, though I can't put my finger on it. Not much for me left say but do yourself afavour and check these guys out.

0894803123|5.0|Having spent some time in Vermont I have a special place in my heart for Ben & Jerry. This is a nicely written, often humorous book that includes not only some great recipes but solid information related to ice cream making in general. Experimentation is strongly encouraged and it is fun to read about what inspired some of the great flavors that make Ben & Jerry's what it is. I would have bought this book for the Cherry Garcia recipe alone!<br /><br />Several comments have been made regarding raw eggs and I appreciate those concerns. The book does provide three base recipes that you can build on, only one of which uses eggs. You can also cook the eggs creating a custard base for the ice cream.<br /><br />A nice addition to your ice cream recipe collection.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Long, meandering, insightful, ponderous are just a few of the words to describe Neil Young's ambitiously successful attempt to create interconnecting songs that describe the various personalities that make up the fictional town of Greendale.  As the CD progresses you will identify with the various characters that inhabit Greendale.  The lyrics are vintage Neil; sometimes straightforward and sensible while there are other times they are a bit obscure.  The music is a mix of slow blues songs, slow rock n roll and flat out rockin' tunes.  If you even remotely like Neil Young you should give Greendale a visit.  You won't regret it!

After all, haven't just about all of us at one point or another been imprisoned, if not literally at least figuratively?  Small wonder that this film has such a substantial following.      Featuring a script with no wasted scenes, superb lighting by the great Roger Deakins, a magnificently understated performance by Tim Robbins, an academy award-nominated performance by Morgan Freeman, and quite a bit more.    The world treating you bad?  This film might give you some pointers as to how you can hold on until you get a chance to break out.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I am going to go out on a limb here and admit that I consider Lateralus to be Tool's worst album (although Tool's worst album is still one of the best ways you can spend $12).  In a way I grew up with Tool... Undertow was the third CD I ever purchased way back in 1993 (after In Utero and Core), and only rarely left my Discman for both of my years in Junior High.  I consider it one of the best albums ever made - throbbing, grinding, living music, almost frightening in its perfect musical precision, Tool is the rare combination of an absolutely amazing vocalist with fantastic lyrics and a band with more musical talent in their pinkie fingers than everything you hear on the radio added together.   <br /> <br />I felt (and still feel) that after Undertow and the equally strong Aenima that Lateralus was a let-down.  I understand it is more of a slow burn or a prog-type soundscape, and people respect it for that, but I guess I missed the direct blast to the cranium and primal drive that those first two full-length albums possessed. <br /> <br />That brings us (finally, 13 years later) to Tool's fourth album.  On this one, Tool works to strike a balance between all of their work... and does so quite well.  I am having difficultly removing 10,000 days from my cd player, or finding the strength to scroll my Ipod anywhere else.  You can tell from the first song that this will be a classic.  Vicarious is probably the best track on the album, exploding like the Tool of old, with sharp lyrics and a slightly more traditional song structure, while still holding onto Tool's newfound sense of exploration and song length.  Its one of their greatest tracks.  Jambi is a strong track as well, after which the band slows it down with Wings for Marie, which serves as an intro for the already long 10,000 days.  This track sums up what I like about this album, and is a better example of Tool's recent prog leanings.  Clocking in at over 11 minutes, this song is essentially three tracks in one, and they are all amazing - this one builds and swells to a peak that goes on and on, and then cools off at the end with some provactive lyrics... wow.   <br /> <br />After that, the album's second masterpiece, The Pot, slaps you in the face - this song is classic Tool (sort of out of step with the rest of the album, this one just launches into itself, unlike the rest which ebb and flow... but that's ok).  After I heard this track the first time, I couldn't contain myself... its like being a kid in a candy store for a Tool fan.  I think I listened to it 10 times before I could bring myself to listen to the rest of the cd. <br /> <br />After the Pot, we get two intro/filler type tracks, leading into Rosetta Stoned, which is a decent track, but over 15 minutes of the album are devoted to it when you look at the three tracks together.  I consider this the weak point of the album to an extent, although I think Lateralus fans would argue with me on that... again, the track is solid, but to my ears it is slightly plodding and almost just... filler, for a band of Tool's caliber.  Intension is a cool track, but another more quiet and reflective piece, it does a good job of setting up Right in Two, but is somewhat weak in and of itself. <br /> <br />Finally, the last real song on the album, Right in Two, is the third masterpiece on this album.  This track is another example of what I like about Tool as their sound has evolved, as this song would've had no place on their earlier work, clocking in at almost 9 minutes.  The lyrics and religious imagery here are fantastic, questioning human nature and our inherent violent nature, and bookends the album perfectly as a counterpoint to Vicarious. <br /> <br />The first several times I listened to the album as a whole work, I liked it, but still not as much as their first two.  That has changed a lot as I continue to listen to this album over and over again.  It has three absolutely brilliant tracks, that are 27 minutes long addedtogether, and two more that I really enjoy (Jambi and 10,000 days), meaning that those five AAA-quality tracks are about 45 minutes long.  That's what seals the deal for me... even if the other half-hour still hasn't completely blown me away, there is a full-length album's worth of music here that is better than almost anything else you will buy this year, or for the next few years. <br /> <br />People will always argue over Tool, as they seem to be a band people obsess over, either to pointlessly bash, or praise, perhaps excessively at times.  Regardless, this cd is absolutely worth a purchase.  14+ years into their career, this band is still putting out music unlike anything else in the market, music that demands repeat listening and rewards it.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|My wife and I have been Enya fans for many years now. Her music is gorgeous, lush, and wonderfully layered. At the end of a hard day, nothing puts me at ease and restores my faith in beauty like an Enya CD.<br /><br />\\"Amarantine\\" is more of the same quality craftsmanship that Enya has faithfully assembled. But that is finally becoming a bit of a problem for me. I do have some guilt in spending money on an album that - at first listen - is almost indistinguishable from the ones that preceded it. It's like buying five copies of the same album.<br /><br />I'm not asking her to do a \\"Dylan Goes Electric.\\" I love her sound. I just wish she would expand on the possibilities in presenting that same sound beyond synth programming.<br /><br />Having said all that, I'll take her music over 95 percent of what's out there.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|This movie looks like a videogame. The musical score is boring and forgettable. Naomi Watts is far too old for the role. Jack Black is a horrible actor who does nothing but bug his eyes out and whisper all the time. Several extranious characters are added early in the film and then just vanish for no reason at all. Several sequences were so corney I almost laughed out loud wile others were simply mean spirited. The dinosaur sequences were imitations of those boring Jurassic Park films. The hero looks like one of the Ritz brothers. The characters were so poorly developed I'm still not sure if they were good, evil or just misguided and even the good guys were basically unlikable. The plot strayed too far from the original on several occasions. The movie ran way too long and was boring at times (\\"if you shake it an hour will fall out\\"). Oh and did I mention that Kong was way to small.  Other than that <br />its perfect. <br />
1400079179|1.0|The sad thing about this book is not so much that it is offensive to a religion shared by millions of people around the world, it is that the author is deluded into thinking that he actually knows something about history. The book is poorly researched, historically a joke, and purposely offensive to a huge percent of the population. The sad thing is that many ignorant people might actually believe this is historically accurate. I think the good news is that it is making people on both sides of the fence have to think about what they actually believe. If people don't believe in God, the best thing to do rather than listen to everyone's opinion, is ask God for yourself. I didn't find Jesus in church, or through people. I studied ALL the major religions with an open mind and then one day cried out \\"Dear REAL God, whoever You are, I want to know You!\\" In a period of 9 months Jesus Christ revealed Himself to me in a variety of ways, both natural and supernatural. Passages I had read in the Bible and couldn't understand  began to come alive to me and God answered all the doubts I had had about Christianity. I saw with my own eyes people that I knew get miraculously healed, and continue to see the same. If you reject Jesus or the idea that He could actually be the Son of God because of obnoxious Christians you have met, you are missing out. I left church initially because of Christians who were hypocrits. The whole point of Jesus coming to the earth was because we are ALL sinners (meaning we were all walking in disobedience to God, didn't have a relationship with Him, and were missing all the blessings He wanted to give us - plus the free gift of eternal life by receiving His Son Jesus as payment for our sins). Every other major religion says that you can get to heaven or afterlife by being good enough in your own self. Some people think any path to God is OK, but IF that's true, then God contradicts Himself, because Jesus said Himself \\"I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except through Me\\" - John 14:6. Christianity says that God sent His son to die in our place. The Muslim faith says basically that you have to die in a Holy War killing others to be guaranteed a place in heaven. If not, then you don't know whether or not you were good enough to get there until you die and find out. Other faiths believe in reincarnation. If that were true, then how come people aren't getting better and more loving after all these years reincarnating? If you die and return as a bug how could you possibly be a good enough bug to evolve into a better life. Maybe you could choose not to eat the food in the house of the humans. How could all these paths possibly lead to the same God? Also, don't be deceived by people who claim to be Christians. There are MANY people who say they are Christians who don't have a clue what Jesus taught, neither do they obey what He said to do. Please don't judge Jesus by humans who are all fallable. I hope that for anyone who reads this book and actually beleives the claims made, that they will take the time to examine the evidence for themselves. An excellent book to read is \\"The Case for Christianity\\" by Lee Strobel. An atheist/lawyer who set out to prove for himself beyond a shadow of a doubt that Christiantiy was false. The evidence he found was so compelling that he became a Christian, and a pastor.  I pray for peace, joy and truth for whoever reads this, in Jesus' mighty name., no one comes to the Father except through Me\\" - John 14:6.

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|'Tres Hombres' is the real deal. You won't find any of the MTV slickness, gimmicks and cartoonish parody of later ZZ Top here.<br /><br />'Tres Hombres' is soaked in cigarettes, Mexican beer and border food from a bar band touring small venues and hungry for success. The songs are rock power trio meets the Texas border with fine blues guitar riffs, jamming rythym and eccentric vocals that come together perfectly.<br /><br />Sadly, except for the follow-up 'Fandango', ZZ Top never came close to being this genuine again.
B000EULJLU|4.0|OK, OK, it's not their best CD, but do y'all want Tool to just keep issuing the same CD over and over?!? I can't understand why some people are trashing this disc. The more you listen to it, the better it gets. <br /> <br />Yes, it's not quite as good as some of their earlier efforts, but it's still an excellent collection of songs that proves Maynard and co. still know how to write some of the tightest-sounding songs. <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />- Vicarious <br />- The Pot <br />- Rosetta Stoned <br />- Intension <br /> <br />If you bought this disc and didn't like it at first, give it another chance. It's great stuff!
B000001EYO|4.0|I can overlook the omission of 'the Creedence' and the Eagles (I hate the f@ckin' Eagles, man). However, this soundtrack cannot be considered complete without \\"Venice Beach League Playoffs 1987\\" or some classic Autobahn.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|This latest PJ disc is why I love this band ... you can almost hear them telling people, \\"Screw you, we're going to write and play songs we like.\\" <br /> <br />It's nice to see there are still bands out there that don't pander to critics and fans and release CDs that are meant to please. \\"Pearl Jam\\" is a great collection of songs that just gets better the more you listen to it. <br /> <br />Yeah, it's not \\"vs.\\", but then again, why should it be? Pearl Jam has matured in their writing and still take an uncompromising outlook on the world. Great disc by one of the best (and most consistent) bands out there. <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />- Life Wasted <br />- World Wide Suicide <br />- Unemployable <br />- Gone <br /> <br />If you're wavering on whether or not to buy this disc, pick it up ... you won't be disappointed if you're a real PJ fan.
B00006G8G1|4.0|I've been an IM fan since 1981, seen them twice. While the Irons <br />are older, the energy is still there. Playing for nearly a  <br />quarter million enthusiastic fans, The band seems to feed off <br />the crowd's energy. (For a two-hour set, they needed it)The set <br />did contain some long selections- \\"Sign of the cross\\", \\"Ghost of <br />the navigator\\", etc., but they are played so well that this is  <br />really not an issue. The editing can be a bit annoying, jumping <br />from each bandmember every 10 seconds or so. This was probably  <br />IM's finest hour, glad it was caught on video. A great comeback!

B000002J09|5.0|This may not be your favorite album of all time, or not even your favorite album by Led Zeppelin, but you have to admit it is the greatest of all time. Ths is one of those rare albums where any of the songs of the cd could be a radio super hit, yet they still all feel like essential in their own seperate way to the album if you listen to Zoso all the way through. It is simply amazing, and if i knew someone who had never heard of rock and roll before i would give them this cd. No matter what they would be hooked.
B000244FDW|5.0|If you want a true-to-the-novel version of Jane Austen's most beloved work, then buy this dvd. It is by far the best production, beating most hands down. It stays true to the script without straying into 21st century speak, or dumbing down, the heroine is portrayed as Jane Austen described her and Mr. Darcey is to die for, the ultimate romantic hero. The English scenery is simply breathtaking, the costumes stunning and nothing is added, nothing taken away, and the Bennets certainly were not poverty stricken as this production correctly shows. There are very little studio based scenes, the fine country houses and gardens used really DO exist. Whilst other productions have been good, this one has the right amount of spirit,comedy and irony. Mrs. Bennet is played to perfection, as is her irritated husband. Jane and Elizabeth remain central to the production and there are places where you just melt with the romance of it all. I've watched it countless times and know it backwards, so I recommend it highly.
0743201140|1.0|I heard great things about this book and enjoyed the introduction as well as the premise. The problem I found is that a)3 of the 5 Questionnaire results did NOT match my description b)The discussion of the results and the application of the purported strengths was lacking and not helpful.
B000EULJLU|1.0|Being the major Tool fan that I am, I was excited when I heard that this album was coming out. To my suprise, I was excited over nothing at all.  I didn't think it was even possible for Tool to put out such a bad album.  Words can't describe how terrible this album is.  I wanted to like it, so I listened to the album at least 10 times around, it never grew on me.  The people that give this album a good rating are blinded by what Tool has done in the past.  Instramentals are extremely weak along with the vocals.  Nothing flows, everything sounds forced.  The first time I heard Vicarious I thought It sounded amazing, but each time after that it sounded worse and worse.  It just is missing something (and this is by far the best song on the album).  If an unknown band wrote this music, no one would ever sign them (local underground bands have better music).  I havent' been this disappointed over an album since Metallica released Saint Anger.
076790592X|3.0|I may sound a little cynical, but I thought the book was a bit cliche.  It was touching to know that there are people out in the world who live life the way Morrie did, but Mitch Albom's style of writing and some of Morrie's aphorisms made the book feel like a Lifetime movie special.  I was struck, though, by the depressing image of Morrie literally withering away and painfully dying -- Does anyone deserve to die like that?  Especially one who obviously changed so many people's lives.  The book is a quick read, and it's not an altogether bad book to read, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to people.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of Alice in chains or a hard rocker in genreal. Its definatley worth the money to get the 2 disk set over the one disk set. Jerry adds a range of beautiful songs with the new tracks.
B00004BZ16|5.0|This album is really so overated and i really can't see the reason why.Probably because it was released a year after London Calling (1979) which is one of the greatest albums of all time.So presumably the critics were expecting something that would match London Calling.True this is a mess throughout,but a \\"beautiful mess\\".One of the best albums of the 80's definitely.Invest!

B00005JOYA|4.0|Silent Hill is an original deeply thought out movie.  It uses dark, complex images to weave a long, yet masterful story.  I must say it gets off to a \\"bad\\" start, at least in my opinion, though the movie is very fast paced from the start.    The movie begins as a young girl is having sleep walking episodes in which she cries of a place called Silent Hill.  Her parents can't make sense of it, but against her husband's advice, the mother decides to find the town, now a ghost town, and take her daughter there.  On the way she manages to get into trouble with the law and lose her daughter upon arrival.  After arriving in Silent Hill, the air there is filled with something like volcanic ash.  This, and many other things about the setting let you know that something isn't right.  A sense of dread has been created and we are taken on a wild and entertaining ride.    There are many twists and turns in the movie and it isn't possible to guess whats coming next.  I have seen it only once, but I plan to see it again and would like to own it on DVD when it comes out.  My wife did not like it in part because of its negatives.  It contained many dark and disturbing images which include a woman being burned alive.  We see her face get burned off as she screams to her tormentors.  Its not the most sadistic scene I've ever watched, and this movie is no gore fest.  In many ways it uses just enough foul lauguage and violence to make it \\"believable\\", though I agree a couple of scenes were not needed and should have been cut.  Still, its an intelligent, well-done film that is worth the two hours invested in watching it.
0375831002|5.0|Put simply, words have power. Not an original thought on my part, but the theme of this book. That power, like all things can be used for good or bad and the story of the little book thief  forced  me  to think about that very power.Like Spielberg's film, Munich, it makes us think about another period in history with direct ties to the present. Words make us think. This book will make you think. Please read it. <br /> <br />(an odd note: as I read the book the voice in my head that reads to me was not the one that normally narrates my \\"inner reader.\\" The cadence and pitch were just slightly different. As some one who has listened to the same voice for 50 years, it startled me. It was as if Death was reading to me. Again, the power of words)
B000301YY8|1.0|I saw this guy performing on Oprah and I had to immediately change the station. James Blunt sounds like a dog with emphyzema. I don't know how anyone can just sit there and listen to this guy sing the same thing over and over again with *that* god awful voice. His music is utterly boring- it's not groovy, it's not funky, it's not jazzy, and it definitely doesn't rock. This guy isn't `deep' all. He's just being over emotional and his lyrics are corny and repetitious. James Blunt needs to lay off the blunts and disappear as quickly as he came. Hoolllllaaaaa!
B000BT97AO|1.0|This film was incredibly painful to watch. Someone needs to look up the word \\"pace\\" and read it to director Dave McKean. I was expecting a real cutting edge film here and if you are expecting the same, you will be let down. I subtracted a star for the lousy directing, one for shabby editing, one for a story line that doesn't quite know where it wants to go and one for the lack of acting ability, particularly in our 'heroine.' (her smirk really got on my nerves).  I highly doubt that Jim Henson, were he alive, would've had anything to do with this horrific waste of time....I also doubt that most pre-teens will find this film engaging. It may be a bit too dark and/or over the heads of children.  <br /> <br />Was this even in the theaters for more than a couple of weeks? No?? Now THAT makes sense. <br />
0671042858|3.0|This story begins inauspiciously enough as 9-year old Tricia McFarland gets lost on a family outing in the hills of western Maine.  Determined to find a shortcut to the path that her mother and brother are on, Tricia strays further and further from her goal.  The result is a defenseless child whose only resources are her youthful physical resiliance, limited knowldege of the northern New England wilderness, and nearly indefatigable mental determiniation inspired by her love and loathing of her own father and her love of a great professional baseball pitcher--Tom Gordon.  It is Gordon and her father who continue to reappear to her in hallucinations that guide her foward and ultimately to her salvation.  Her nemesis, the God of the Lost, who appears once as a human-like apparition and then later in the form of a black bear is very real causing physical destruction as he stalks the child for over a week through the woods.  By the time of the showdown between the two, Tricia has undergone an existential transformation--she no longer sees herself as a defenseless little girl but as a full-blown human being with icewater in her veins and the ability to stand up without fright to the demons of her mind and of the physical world.  Though a hunter with a high-powered rifle intervenes to injure the bear/demon, Tricia displays remarkable intestinal fortitude in launching her portable radio player at the beast emulating her hero Tom Gordon.  While this book has some references to sex and offensive language, and probably could be reduced to novella or even short story length, overall it could be quite compelling for young adult readers.
B00000K31Q|4.0|10 Things I Hate About You is what you would picture the typical upper-class family teen movie/chick flick to be. The movie that is set on a gorgeous school campus shows the different high school groups and how they are split. Although they are a little exaggerated, it shows what many high schoolers go through in trying to fit in. It is easy to relate to, not always being the most popular kid in class but still trying to fit in the \\"jocks\\" or \\"cheerleaders\\". Another great part of the movie is the stars. Heath Ledger is not only an amazing actor but easy on the eyes too. Heath's supporting actor, Julia Stiles, is also a good actor and they both fit their specific roles perfectly. After a game of cat and mouse between the two, the fairytale ending brings the two lovers together. The movie also has a wonderful sound track. Overall the movie is worth buying if you like the typical chick flick or Heath Ledger.
0553801503|4.0|G.R.R.Martin has got withour contest the best going series there is in this overpopulated fantasy market. <br /> <br />Caveat for those reading these reviews and having not yet read the Feast of crows: the common sense can tell you that if the first 3 installements are worth 5 stars (what they are), then the 4th is not worth 1 star like some reviewers would like to have you believe. <br /> <br />Now what's the deal then? <br />Well whether Martin made it up or not, he split the 4th installement in 2 parts. <br />What we get here is only one half of the same time period. <br />Follows that the other part is not here. <br />Obvious even if it can perturbate some, isn't it? <br />And then everything boils down to the choice what characters he will put in what half. <br />As in Feast of Crows the focus is on mainland, the characters are on the mainland (eliminates Daenerys plotline). <br /> <br />Then Martin takes profit of the liberated space to introduce some new points of view (Brienne, Greyjoys and Martels). Some may think that they could do without and some may think that it's nice to have them within. <br />As I belong to the latter category, I liked Feast of Crows very much. <br /> <br />An insight in the struggle for the vacated throne going among the Ironmen was new and refreshing. <br />Brienne's chapters allowed us to learn what happened to the Hound and meet again Cathlyn (hard to see how to do it otherwise unless through some random third party narration). <br />Arya's chapters were for me the best-in the previous installements we never got much of her and she's developping in a true Stark. <br />Also Sansa makes progress and begins to take some control over her destiny. <br /> <br />Sure the Lannisters took a hit with Tywin's demise and Thyrion being allocated to the second half. <br />Cersei is much less compelling and definitely turning paranoid. <br />Jaime's point of view makes furter progress regarding the opposition to the Lannisters. <br /> <br />All in all it is still Martin with excellent writing, consistent plotline and, like one reviwer noticed, everything beginning to converge to what will become the central figure for the last part of the series - Daennerys. <br /> <br />Why only 4 stars then? <br />Well I can't believe that it took Martin 5 years to notice that he has written 2 books instead of 1 and then to decide to publish only one instead of both at the same time.
0061001783|5.0|Firstly, I should say that I concur with most of the other reviewers: Georgette Heyer is one of my all-time favourite authors, and \\"Cotillion\\" is one of her best books.<br /><br />However, for the picky, I should like to add a warning about the Harper editions.  Not only is Miss Heyer's language UK English, it's a very specific Regency variety.<br /><br />US readers may not mind the Americanisation of the spelling (\\"color\\" for \\"colour\\", etc.); but there are numerous misprints, some of which apparently stem from the proof-reader's incomprehension of the dialect: in this book, for instance, \\"much-tired\\" for \\"much-tried\\" (p.74), \\"down\\" for \\"downy\\", and even \\"Kitty\\" for \\"Freddy\\" (p.323).<br /><br />This is of course nothing like the wholesale disembowelment that has been inflicted on American editions of Harry Potter; but if you're fussy about such things, you might want to get British editions from Amazon UK.
