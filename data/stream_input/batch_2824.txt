B00ECU2RGY|5.0|like it, i love Tom Cruise and this kind of futuristic film, also the effect was super realistic, it is a very good film.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|So glad I purchased this stylus for my Kindle Fire HD. I am not very good with touchscreen devices when it comes to typing and this stylus has proved to be a winner for me. I even use to turn pages of my books....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Was a great book and left me wanting more! I can't wait til the next book is released. Plan on reading more Sylvia Day in the meantime.
B00271B752|5.0|This was an awesome blast from the past movie to watch.I would highly recommend it. Al Pacino was great. Classic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles are original and challenging. Makes for a fun time and entertaining . I would recommend this game for all. Good job developer's.
B00DM12ANO|3.0|The love story is nice, but sometime very boring, the acting was good, the effect was to much confuse. thanks
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Possibly the best movie in the alien universe.  The cg graphics are absolutely amazing and they look even better in 3d.
0767802519|5.0|I love this movie!!! Shipping and price was great too! I have already watched it twice, and my daughter borrowed it too! she loves this movie! Thank you!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I thought that although the subject matter was at first a bit disturbing, it held my attention, and was written in a very approachable manner.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this game .  I like how that their are so many levels. I highly recommend this game and you won't regret getting this game . LOTS OF FUN .
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Of course, this TV program is intended for adults or very mature young adults.  What I like best about it is the portrayal of the people involved in both the lives of the murdered boy and those in the town who are deeply affected by the unusual event.<br /><br />The writing is excellent in digging deeply into the personalities & behaviors of those in the story, while spreading hints of possible illicit relationships the along the way.<br /><br />Also, the acting is so well done, that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is just a TV story. This is so memorable that we can keep the story & people clearly in mind from week to week & look forward to the next episode.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|I love his performance.<br />His sound is very clear, so it is comfortable for me.<br />I'd like to listen these CDs anytime.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I almost didn't continue reading past the first chapter - the idea that \\"Death\\" was narrating was just weird to me. I'm glad I kept going as I enjoyed the book. The courage of anyone during the Holocaust is amazing to me.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|We have played this game with family, friends, nephews, and nieces. Everyone of any age can enjoy this game. Very imaginative.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|Storyline is not good graphics are horrible then at the last mission the data of the game was lost but they left me with my guns then took them
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is the first book that I read where I came to dislike the main character such that I will not read any more books in the series. This is my opinion and you may find it otherwise.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This comic portrays the joker in a  completely new light. Dark and incredible. Definitely the greatest comic ever! Read it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun game but needs more levels. Maybe they will get more.  Once your done your done then it's not that fun.
B0089PWU2E|5.0|This is a great set for fans. It has a lot of tracks i never heard before,especially the early Waylon Jennings tracks with Buddy Holly on guitar. Just wish it would of had liner notes giving more info on some of the other little known artists.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read. And yes, it is hard for me to become so interested in a book!
B007FJUP2W|5.0|The fabric design makes these more special than a typical flat, and I always get compliments. What's better is that these shoes are very comfortable! I just bought the lilac and will not only consider buying this style in other colors but will also shop Toms shoes in other styles!
B006LXQID8|5.0|Amelie is such a heart-warming film about a French girl who is a little bit odd and a little bit of an outsider, which I imagine many of us are who are drawn to this film. I even recommend this movie for teens/tweens despite the &#34;R&#34; rating; the rating is due to the nature of the adult shop where Nino works and two brief scenes depicting...ahem...&#34;intimate moments&#34; in the beginning. If parents are uneasy with their kids seeing it, it's easily remedied by putting a hand over their eyes for a few minutes.<br /><br />The directing is superb and the film's story really plucks at the chords of both heart and funny-bone. Highly recommend.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I HAVE TO SAY THAT I HAD NO IDEA WHO CHANNING TATUM WAS UNTIL A GROUP OF US SENIOR CITIZENS WENT TO SEE MAGIC MIKE. WELL I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT HOW MANY MOVIES HE HAS BEEN IN. I ENJOY HIS ACTING. HE CAME ACROSS AS A VERY CARING HUSBAND.  IN THIS MOVIE.  I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've read a multitude of books on this subject but this one is by far the easiest to read and implement. It will be a reference handbook for me forever!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I liked it when batman had people thinking that he was a monster in the dark, i loved all the effects in the movie !!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a good game if you want a longer playing game (probably about an hour) and lots of strategy involved.  Our 9 year old plays without a lot of strategy while our 13 year old plays with strategy.  Playing with a non-stragetic player does not ruin the game for the rest of the players only makes it more interesting.  The rules were very confusing at first but watching the video helped.  Once you understand the rules, playing the game is simple and fun with as complex of strategic thinking as you desire to put into it. (think chess).
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I'm going to be generous and give it 2 stars because there were some very funny laugh-out-loud moments in the first half of the movie.  By the middle of the movie, however, I was totally sick of the couple bickering and whining and the rest of the film was just plain annoying without any LOL moments to break up the tedium. It just marches wearily toward the inevitable \\"everything's ok and we're happy again\\" conclusion.  I nearly stopped watching and I probably should have.  I don't fault the actors; it's the script that's the problem.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I LOVE THIS DISC. I PLAY IT A LOT WHEN I HAVE TO DRIVE  LONG WAY TAKES MY MIND OFF ALL THE BAD THING YOU CAN ENCOUNTER IN A LONG RIDE. I SIMPLY LOVE THIS WOMANS VOICE!
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Ben Rich's excellent memoir of his tenure at Lockheed's Skunk Works facility is a worthy read, not just for the technical nuggets but also for a view on management styles, including that of Rich's predecessor and mentor Kelly Johnson.<br /><br />The book begins with the stealth fighter project, then takes a look in the past at the U-2 and SR-71 spy plane projects along with some other experimental efforts (including a stealth drone and a stealth Navy ship).<br /><br />One of the technical details I found fascinating is how stealth technology works: it's mostly in the geometry of the airframe, not the coating or the electronic countermeasures.  Rich's explanation of how the basic shape of the stealth fighter was developed based on mathematical modeling is interesting.  It is also fascinating to learn that this technology works on sound waves just as well as radar waves: from bats slamming into parked F-117 fighters at night to Polaroid cameras unable to focus on the fighter to snap a clear picture, it is clear that this has applications beyond radar.  Really cool stuff . . .
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I believe the game is absolutely awesome. It needs no improvement. The graphics are awesome and I can't stop playing it, I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love playing the game.. all friends got me hooked on it. Would recommend to anyone.<br />So real..play it every day.
1118488768|4.0|A well written, comprehensive look at how PR and marketing have been altered by electronic communication.  The author sets the stage and then moves forward with practical, applicable tactics.
B005D4YHN4|5.0|This is the second pair of the KEEN Newport Sandals that I have purchased for my husband.  His old pair are probably 8 or 9 years old and he wears almost no other shoes all summer long.  And not that there is anything broken on his old ones - just that he has finally worn through quite a bit of the tread, but they have taken a LOT of abuse over the years and still wear just fine.  For those who are used to KEEN - I'm sure you know these are great for really anything, except they aren't such great beach shoes since you can't kick the sand out.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is one of the best shows that I have ever watched. My husband and I are hooked! It has a good story along with some interesting characters. Must watch !!!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|For some reason, the lives of artists intrigue me.  Watching Pete Townsend's life and career, I can see how he persevered and overcame obstacles in his life, some caused by himself.  Pete has taught me to see the potential in myself, work hard, and reach for my ever changing dreams.  That's a tall order for a man pushing 50, but how old is Pete, and he keeps on?
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Perhaps, this is the only film that I have watched more than 10 times (in theaters +DVD + amazon prime). Simply love the hulk and iron man ;)
B006I1OB0U|5.0|What can one say about this marvelous series -- beautiful photography, set design, character development, and script.  This series is one that needs to be in one's personal DVD collection.  I keep wondering where is season IV?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Makes bidding fast and fun. It is so easy to use. I wish I would have downloaded this application sooner!
B00CZXLJ8C|5.0|Very well put together album. Good mix of slow songs and fast ones. Great beat. All songs are also played on the show so there is a good crossover.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I wanted an app that didn't eat up my battery...based on reviews this was the one.  Seems to work just great.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As expected, Khaled Hosseini has delivered another compelling story about a culture that we know very little about.  Each story is heart-rendering, and I would have given five stars except for the fact that it was not easy to follow the many transitions from one story to the next!
B009A87X80|5.0|This has wonderful charts -- every cut is a winner!  I had never heard of Eva Cassidy or heard her until I was at a family cabin in Minnesota.  This CD does not disappoint!
B00B0IILHA|5.0|My son just loved this model!! Lot's of details, very interactive with lot's of moving parts providing a very good entertainment during the assemblage and after just playing with the model. Thank's Lego for creating this and Amazon for providing me with a good experience to buy this.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|Compact,honest and both sad and extremely funny.<br />It is a &#34; feel good&#34;  as well as introspective book.<br />Read it and love it!
B000F9RB8K|5.0|Highly recommended!! ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE! GREAT CAST! ALOT MORE ACTION THAN YOU WOULD THINK! ONE OF ANTHONY HOPKINS GREATEST PERFORMANCES!
B00000IREA|5.0|Oldie but goodie far fetched si fi porn lol  I had to add this one to my collection with Flesh Gordan another must see lol ! good luck .
0062197258|1.0|This novel of \\"suspense\\" has gotten rave reviews all across the web, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. It's such a Hollywood-derivative piece, a Sleeping With the Enemy Part Deux. The protagonist, Cathy, is a walking cliche of a victim of domestic violence, all beautifully wan and glamour-girly, and nothing about her is worth rooting for. She's unsympathetic and dreadfully dull (she spends the majority of her pre-abuse time partying and flirting and nothing else, really -- she's about as interesting as a pretty block of cheese). The abuser is a character lifted from Law and Order: SVU, a moody, sexy, macho type with a perverted streak. Oh, and he's in undercover law enforcement -- another cliche -- so that the \\"heroine\\" conveniently finds herself unable to escape.<br /><br />The secondary characters are also unbelievably drawn. There are the protagonist's so-called friends who are so charmed by the handsome sociopath that they would not believe their FRIEND at all (what kind of friends are these exactly? shallow?). Then there's Stuart, the new love interest, and (another convenient setup) a psychologist, who also doesn't seem to believe Cathy's fears, excusing them as a part of her OCD behavior. The only character who sides with Cathy, genuinely so, is a policewoman who doesn't appear until nearly the END of the novel. (Yet another rushed convenience. Almost a Deus ex Machina of a way out for our poor, OCD & PTSD-suffering heroine).<br /><br />I was primarily disappointed with the novel because the author is, supposedly, a police intelligence analyst. One would think she'd have an idea how to recreate a believable novel about domestic abuse rather than a Lifetime Movie of the week wannabe.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Well, I love the game but certain things cost way too much and take forever to<br />build, I'm not trying to play this game till I'm 80. 3 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very very addicting! I can't decide if I love that I want to play this game ever free minute I have. I also can't ever get enough minion. They always crack me up.
B005LAII80|5.0|I would recommend this movie, lot's of  non stop action! I exceeded my expectations! Watched on netflix, decided I had to have it!
B0073COMUW|5.0|These are really great.  My CFL bulbs were too warm in the fixture above my dining room table and they also left a glare on the items I was reading.  I almost baked when I was sewing.  Now I do not have to worry about that anymore.  These bulbs don't leave a glare and they are really bright.  AND I do not have to worry about the temperature in the room rising to 90 degrees if I leave the light on for a long time.  I recommend you try these if you have not purchased them before.  Finally, a bulb I can afford too.
B008602KQI|5.0|I know that this was supposed to appeal to the younger generation but I saw so much past history (and maybe future) in this story.  From the Roman gladiators to what we are doing with our athletics today, are we any better?  Good story, good ending.  I loved it.<br /><br />Colorado Grandma
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very much enjoyed this game. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer so I could keep playing!(:
B000U0O9FM|4.0|A suppressor is not just holes drilled in a barrel, and there is no Armalite 180. Still  a fun read.
080701429X|5.0|I ordered this book to replace my original copy that was lost in the move 3 years ago.  It still is a tribute to Man's power of spirit and determination in the worst of times.  It is a source of inspiration and I use it with clients to build an ark of hope when their lives are deluged with suffering, disaster, and discouragement.  I also connect Frankl's observations on suffering to the Buddhist view that life is beset with suffering and the need to transform one's mind into ways to work through and transcend that suffering.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|It's cool how you can download videos. The only problem is that you can't watch them. The browsing is not that good either.<br /><br />  DON'T GET THIS APP
B005DJREJS|4.0|Funny high school melodrama. It's been done before, nothing particularly new or amazing about it but fun and entertaining. It's a bit edgier than some other teen dramas, but not overly so. Kept my interest.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is every thing I wanted and more! Each disk has lots of special features on them! I'm so glad I spent the money for this! I would buy it again in a heart beat if I had to!
B000G75994|5.0|I don't have another recording of these pieces to compare this to and, actually, I don't feel the lack. These are wonderfully expressive interpretations of Mozart's music. There was one passage where the playing actually made me chuckle! Other pieces that had a more serious, darker sound were played with strong, serious feeling. Highly recommended!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I bought this APU to build an entry-level gaming rig, and it works perfectly.  MMO's like LOL and WOW run perfectly. No extra graphics card required. It plays Skyrim on medium setttings at over 30 frames per second, too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So far it has had no glitches for me. It is really fun! The only problem I had with it was when it was downloading, it was not downloading correctly. I waited a while and it fixed itself.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I've been reading up on anything about creativity.  I really enjoyed this book and learning more about the artist Austin Kleon.
0553381407|5.0|An insightful and helpful book to help you move on from the legacy of toxic parents. Don't let them continue to drag you down. This book will help you reclaim your life.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Tried to download to my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet , seemed to be downloading alright but when tried to use would not open , maybe it's just me but Abode works well on my home computer have had it for years
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Best book ever for lovers of vampires!  Have read so many times and will continue to read over and over.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is absolutely perfect for you if you're having problems seeing those tiny calculators on your phone!  The buttons are very large and it works exactly as stated.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|I've read several other guides to popular movies and have generally been disappointed.  Most authors in this genre seem to do most of their research by watching TV and surfing the Internet.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised by SCARFACE:The Ultimate Guide.  Having watched the movie over a dozen times (most recently this weekend), I was amazed at how much I didn't know.  This book covers everything from casting and location issues, struggles with the MPAA Ratings Board, continuity errors and public response to the movie upon its release.  What I enjoyed most was the author's examination of individual characters and important scenes within the movie that were extremely helpful in allowing me to better understand the messages the movie was communicating.  Scarface speaks to so many different types of individuals.  For me, it's the ultimate perversion of the American Dream.  Being just a couple of generations removed from immigrant relatives myself, I find that I think about the themes of this movie quite a bit.  This book truly enhanced my experience, almost 30 years after I first watched this iconic feature.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Face it, the GoPro Hero 2 has a crappy microphone. And for long road trips, the battery life is terrble. The solution? The Skeleton Housing so you can access the camera's inputs.<br /><br />With a pro level wireless microphone kit I'm able to get usable audio vs. the garbage underwater muddy sound the built in mic delivers. You probably don't need a pro level microphone but I own one already and it works well. If you have the latest firmware with ProTune (Hero2) audio is better in non-pro tune modes. It's a shame there isn't a 24p mode in non-pro tune modes.<br /><br />The Skeleton Housing also allows you to use your car battery (with the GoPro Auto Charger) instead of the OEM battery. Memory card access and video output is also made possible.<br /><br />The only issue I had with it was the black clamp (or whatever it's called). After only a handful of uses it is making a weird noise...as if I broke something. Hopefully that's not the case but we'll see...
B005PK57IK|5.0|I am a late coming to the Good Wife after intiially only watching a couple of episodes the first season.  I started watching it on Amazon Prime and now I can't get enough of it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun to play for all ages.  Some levels are harder than others.  When it gets too hard for the adults, the kids are able to get us to the next levels!
B0050KU3IY|5.0|Why don't they make this into a movie.  It would be a fantastic sequel to something borrowed!  Nicely written Ms Giffin.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard rocks, I have it installed on all my devices. As with all keyboards, YMMV. Some love it, some hate it.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I just bought this app a few minutes ago for my kindle fire hd and so far i really like it. It does what is says it will do.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|So so. Entertaining but not worth 6 dollars. Wait until HBO to watch. The trailer always shows the nest scenes but was not reflective of the actual mooe.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Although the movie can't come close to the excitement of the live play.  I highly recommend both.  See the play first, if you can.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|To be honest, I already own the HD Collection. The only reason I got this was because I wanted the book, as well as the Ashley Wood digital graphic novels. But, if you are a Metal Gear Solid fan (or you recently became one), and you want to have and play all of the games in HD quality, then you will want to get this. On the other hand, if you don't really care about the extras in the Legacy Collection, and you already own the HD Collection, then you may want to skip this one. I think it's a good deal though :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is brilliant it is just like having your very own horse very good app lots to do and its one and probably the only app that does not ask you for money!
B004D23BRU|5.0|A wonderful interpretation of a piece of music I grew up with and is close to my heart.  The imagery, development of the personalities and relationships, and twist on the ending all made me so happy.  I can't wait to share this with family/friends.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|These stories ALL are interesting, well written, tense at times and always a real heart pounding thriller.  I'm in the low teens now (they're sequential) and I hope Let Child keeps writing them.  I want a new action hero on the big screen.  Here he is.
B00821OX98|5.0|love it, love it, full of action and surprises, it keeps you focused on the tv all the time. very good.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Always love getting these specialty priced boxed sets from Amazon. Tons and tons of cool extras in this great set and this is a must have for any fans of these movies.
0385528787|4.0|I first became aware of Margaret Atwood through her novel The Handmaid's Tale, and while I found MaddAddam somewhat hard to follow because I hadn't read the previous novels in the series, I ended up liking it nonetheless.  There was a summary of the previous novels which made it slightly easier to get the gist of the story in this one, and I liked it because of the dystopian setting and Toby's interactions with the Crakers, the gentle, quasi-human creation of Crake, a brilliant geneticist who has passed away some time back.  Zeb, Toby's lover, also goes on some adventures of his own which add to the richness and complexity of the MaddAddamites' tale.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good book, although I would recommend to other readers that they start out with the first two novels, Oryx and Crake; and The Year of the Flood.
B009AMANH4|3.0|I found this to be a little boring.  I am very interested in the details of this assassination but felt this movie missed the mark, for me anyway.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Just as suspenseful and amazing as ever. This season will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nemo's  reef is a fun continues game  for kids of all ages.  ware  you earn money and algae  for your  plants. you give algae to your plants and buy plants with sand dollar's(money). it is a RILLY FUN GAME.
0385537816|5.0|THE PRODUCT IS THE BEST QUALITY. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR. WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE!! GREAT PRODUCT
B001AIRUP4|5.0|If you ever have the opportunity to entertain children, this movie definitely fits the bill.  It is amusing, interesting and colorful.  I highly recommend it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter never disappoints. If you are a fan of the show, order now! I binge watched the whole season in one weekend.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just an incredible series that surpasses anything you can imagine when viewing in Blu-Ray (even if you have seen them before)
1400049628|5.0|Read this book prior to reading World War Z. This is a fantastic read. Couldn't put it down, and read it in 3 days.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I'm not sure I knew what to expect but this wasn't it.  That aside, I enjoyed it very much.  I think it must have been very hard to pretend the tiger was there so much of the time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good book even for adults! The book is very captivating and keeps you interested. Would recommend to young adults.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Can't go wrong with the classics!  However, this is an OLD OLD OLD classic, and it's NOT the movie.  Remember - this is how people entertained themselves before TV and movies.  So it's long, and it goes into great detail on characters we might consider extraneous.  Take your time, and enjoy the scenic route  :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the second book in this series and I am looking forward to reading the third. Definitely recommend to others
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|It's well done, intense, interesting and gives you the sense that you are part of the story.  Good movie, great story
B002LVVCQM|4.0|Book is a great review of the overwhelming evidence for evolution,abut it won't do any good because it is preaching to the choir. You have to read a few chapters to really get to the meat and the meat is a little technical which will not be read by opponents of evolution who base their opposition to religious beliefs and &#34;What About&#34; questions.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Really gives you a glimpse of what I really think heaven will be like. It has to be true because of the type of doctor that he is. I am ready to go.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I am always sceptical about an 'addition' to a classic. This did not disappoint. The black and white to color transition was wonderful. Storyline was believable. Graphics, costumes, sets were very pleasing.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|There was a lot of controversy regarding Tom Cruise taking lead in this movie.  He was a pleasant surprise, indeed.
B000W91RUG|5.0|It was great to have a Bing Bang marathon and the extras and special features were great.  The interviews with the cast members were a real bonus, as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have had the first book for over a year before I finally sat down to read it. I loved it and wanted more. I purchased the next  two on my kindle. It's been a nonstop read for me and I finished with a smile, thank you E L James
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So simple and easy to use, works great with my Netflix. I have also used it with my google play items as well and it works great. The only issues I have had is keeping up the controls on both my tablet and phone when watching netflix which can make it a challenge to start another episode of a television show or turn it off altogether. Hopefully it will be fixed with a few more updates.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You can't go wrong having a calculator so easily and close at hand.  The hardest thing is that the older you get the more you need it for everyday use.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Liked the book. I heard a lot of things about it, and was happy that it wasn't as &#34;bad&#34; as I heard. Still some pretty descriptive parts, but it's not bad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the large keys which make this calculator so easy to use.  I also appreciate being able to view the last calculation while working so I don't lose track of my place in a column of numbers I am working on.  Nice job, developers!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Loved this book!  a real can't put it down read.  Great for &#34;believers&#34; and &#34;non-believers&#34; alike!  Will add real value to any discussion of Bible events.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I started with Reacher #1 and have gone on from there.  I'm in the teens now and hope he keeps writing.  I really appreciate the numbering system.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan keeps my students and myself interested in reading!!  I love how ties in mythology into today's world. Keep them coming Rick!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is simple to use, easy to program and when you add in dozens of alarm sounds and the ability to add your own music....You can't beat this free app for your Kindle Fire hd.  Have had it for months, and it has never failed me. The only drawback is that I have set my kindle fire hd to lock, and it takes until I unlock it to shut it off, and the sound continues to get louder until you finally shut it off.  But, that's a good thing if you have a tough time waking up.
B008220BLG|4.0|I wouldn't say it was the best &#34;zombie&#34; movie ever. It was nice having a slightly different story line but some of it was kinda cheesy love story. Cute and kind of funny.
B0018OFNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed Carlito's Way. My husband accomend it, and surprise, I couild not stop watching it. I am surprise I have not seen this movie sooner.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Does everything I need it to do. Would recommend it to anyone who needs a simple calculator. Haven't used the advanced part but it probably is just as good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting, medium challenge, but finished quickly. I took about an hour total. I look forward to more rooms. Hope to see them soon!
B005544V6A|5.0|The characters fit each other and play off each other fantastically. I love the story lines. Harvey and Mike make a great team.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This review is for the &#34;Coppola Restoration&#34; Blu-ray. The restoration work is fantastic, the movies all look vibrant and the original mood, color and lighting of each scene as determined by the Director and the DP have been retained. The extras include many scenes that have been included in the TV and alternate versions that have been shown, but the 3 films have been restored to their original cinematic versions. I am one of the fans who simply cannot not watch any of these films if I catch them on while channel surfing, and I am very happy I have these restorations. And yes, I even think part three was amazing despite the rather dull acting of Sophia Coppola.
0062215507|5.0|Beautiful book. A must for all Harry potter fans. So many great things in it. Very fast service. Thank you.
B009QU9X44|3.0|The majority of the book is spent on the time in the US and not actually on the time when the two lover meet in Nigeria. Too much time spent on their 'past' lives.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good graphics, gets more challenging as you progress. Has not caused problems with my Kindle. Recommend it to all levels of players.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Converting a movie shot in 2D to 3D can be tricky. Often the conversion is flawed and can show artifact and distortion, or just looks bad. The conversion job here is excellent, and it gives the move a much greater sense of realism, you feel immersed in the flight scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game would be difficult for children but if you are tired of temple run genre games give this a try. I can't stop giggling.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Love the Motown vibe. All the tracks are worth listening to. Glad I purchased it and plan on buying more of Mayer Hawthorne in the future!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Super show. It is action packed and keeps delivering more every episode. I keep wanting to know more about the island. Every episode provides a little more information and ties it in with his mission.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this amazingly awesome littlest pet shop game. I think Is a super fun game.is there any way it could be more fun
B000002ADT|5.0|Some of the greatest saxophonists collaborating with one of the best trumpeters ever! What more can I say?  one two
B008K9SG9K|1.0|I like the song &#34;Radioactive&#34; and the other tracks sampled sounded ok so I purchased the CD. Song sounds compressed and muffled, just like the other reviewer wrote. At first I thought it was only that one song but others were produced with the same flat sound quality. Too bad because I like some of the songs but I can't tolerate the recordings quality. If it was done intentionally, it was a big mistake!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!!  I'm so glad Season 3 was on Amazon Prime.  It was amazing.  I can't wait for Season 4!!
B005MMYT76|5.0|My girlfriend and I can't stop watching this movie.<br />most scenes are pretty funny. Recommend for anyone looking for a laugh.
B000002AGN|5.0|It's one of those &#34;must have&#34; albums that belongs in any audiophile's collection. Where did Rush get that 5/4 section in Tom Sawyer? Humm?
B000000W71|1.0|The disk don't work.<br />It can't start at all.<br />It can rip it on my computer and transfer to my device.<br />pls advice as I wish to change!<br />same as Wynton Marsalis Big Train.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This little piece of plastic is 8 grams of wonder... helps motivate and adds a little fun into keeping fit...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but this was a wonderful exercise in using logic,intuition and good old common sense. I can't wait for the next one!
B00AX6KMGS|4.0|Not a movie to take itself to seriously.  Plenty of stars, including Frodo before Lord of the Rings.  Would recommend this movie highly.  Not perfect, but not terrible by any means.
B00CU0UE0E|2.0|only really liked the single that's on the radio...safe and sound.  the rest of the songs are really to my taste
0743486285|5.0|great book crazy interesting about his whole life story and how addiction turned for the worst and came back from the dead.  highly recommend this book
B0081X8AE6|5.0|What more could one say.... &#34;what a gift&#34;<br />Defanatly a top chice for me<br /><br />Keep'em coming Michael.<br />Thank you,<br /><br />JD-
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I've tried every workout under the sun, and if you're used to the bodybuilding approach like I was, this book offers a very basic but highly effective change that works. As long as you're consistent, Matthews's program gets it done. Perhaps a little too much time is spent discussing the fitness &#34;industry,&#34; but it is a worthwhile inclusion. Highly recommended, especially for newcomers.
B0037VIBGY|3.0|Good viewing if you like Tom Hardy. I would recommend Warriors or Inception if you want a real good movie with Tom Hardy. It is a Hard R rated movie.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I stopped reading this book towards the end. It actually started to irritate me. Finally just finished it and have to say that I found it moderately entertaining. The first half of the book was a page turner.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 3 year old grandaughter and grandson loves playing this game!! It keeps them entertained while in the car. Perfect for toddlers!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Couldn't finish it  this book was a big fat nothing. Light no story. Total waste should change it to one star
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm clock.  Great for traveling and everyday use.  I do wish the dim light would work a little better because the digital clock is very bright.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This is not the only soundtrack release for Moulin Rouge. in case you didn't notice from watching his movies (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet etc.) Baz has a bit of ADD and the sound track was no acceptation. he released the first sound track and a year later released another. both are great but if you are looking for the songs as they were in the movie, buy Vol 2 (this is Vol 1). even with both you will still be missing a couple songs but hey Baz is both mad and genius... they go hand in hand.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun to enjoy with the family. shows everybody in my family what it takes to be responsible and ehat it takes to care for a horse
B008JFUO72|4.0|what the ... were they thinking!!!!!!? no ACDC? that was nwhat also made the movie great. a classic hero and a classic rock band playing the theme and action sequences. it get adrenalin pumping and made the movie more enjoyable in my opinion. you should add on to or take away from something spectacular. thats like replacing crowe in Gladiator. ............why ruin a good thing??????????????????  one star is missing. its probably stuck in an ACDC cd.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|We have already deleted it already from the kindle because it's only a level help guide not the actually game.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The original app worked better.  This one hangs up fairly often, is pretty darn slow, and does not have a combined rain and clouds setting.  Other than that it is ok and does the job I want.  I keep hoping they will fix the bugs
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Would like if there had been more floors to go to. Will not pay to go to added floors or for anything else in this game. The puzzles in solving were good.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Great songs on this Album, have always enjoyed his sound. I would recommend this to everyone. Also has a great price point.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I am about halfway through this book, but have lost my faith that an actual story line exists.  Just when ya think something is actually going to happen, it doesn't.  No excitement, no drama, no character development...it's like being in literary purgatory.  So far reading this book has been as boring as the author describes life in prison as being, and I've served enough time behind her bars...I'm outta here
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show - love it and can't wait for the next season.  Acting is superb and the story line is engaging.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am enjoying watching this show. Watching season 2 now and have not watched a bad show yet.<br />Look forward to the rest of the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game of the year.! Definitely worth every penny!!! Yeah!!! Get it now... or you will miss out on something awesome.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is true to the style of the rest of the series.  There are some interesting twists and plots.  Worth reading, but how could you not after reading all the other books?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome read, I can't get enough of Christian and Ana!! I've read this book and the others in the series about 7times now and I still can't get enough!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|BRUTALITY being a fan since october 2012 arrow is tv show most awesome humor pretty awesome!!!!! LOVING THE SERIE!!! \m/
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Simply put. I downloaded the app simply to read MSN and the occasional childrens app. I finally was able to download after several attempts. It didn't give me an option to to hit enter on my keyboard. Ended up taking it off of my Kindle.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app seems to work well. The accuracy of forecast is pretty good. It would be nice if there was an option to see the future radar images though.
B00DWHWOFC|3.0|First try on this type of puzzles.....enjoyed the challenge.  Good help explanations to get started.  Just never enough puzzles when they get you hooked..:)
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Another Nicholas Sparks book and it also, is wonderful book you need to also, purchase this book from Amazon.com now. I think they have a TV show now on called Safe Haven. I also have a granddaughter named Haven. How cool is that?
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game of solitaire to play. I got my sister hooked on playing spider. I would recommend this to any person who likes a challenge.
B004NJW96C|5.0|Honestly, I usually have lower expectations for artists going for the Nth studio album. Most of the time, we get something with less soul/heart just so the studio can satiate demand, make money, with little regard for the artist's essence - or what got him started.<br /><br />This whole album is so beautiful. Like some reviewers said, it is music not for dancing, but for reflecting, chilling. Moby likes to work in the minor key and this album, by far, is his melancholy best. I am in love with lacrimae (track 14). I don't know how he does it but the music manages to stir feelings associated with forgotten memories and heartbreak. It is gut-wrenching in a way, music best played late at night, driving fast in a deserted highway with the windows down.<br /><br />Love you moby!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love this show. Thanks Amazon for having it. I missed it on television. Very interesting and suspenseful. If you like scy-fi and alien shows, this is for you!!
B000SEI230|5.0|Nicholas Sparks really truly can write a good book. This is a real good book. so please purchase it now!
B003R0MF5I|4.0|The writers continue to develop the characters and there are enough twists to keep you engaged.  Fun series to watch.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Fantastic movies. Definitely worth buying in a  pack for added display value. Book is great with insight to set design and props. Very cool.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like it and I keep coming back to it. A new note-taking app appears every day, but evermore remains my default. I like the fact that they keep updating it; tweaking it. Seems like they care about end-users; a welcome change.
159514188X|5.0|I simply love this book. If you're a teen (or even an adult) who wants to read this book, then I recommend you do. I read this book about five times since I had it.
0071422943|5.0|A recommended handbook for all chemical engineer's. I review this book daily and keep it open on my desk as a quick reference for operations.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I sobbed like a baby through most of the book..I am making my English teacher friend and my teenage daughter read it..thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the fact that I finally could watch the season without all the commercial. In todays busy world, it's nice to take a weekend or two to watch a program you didn't have time to watch during the season.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|If you have not personally watched this movie, take my advice and buy every available version of it, even the VHS version. THE LION KING, in my opinion, is the best movie of all time. You can tell why it is Disney's highest grossing animated film, and why it has a huge following attached to it. No other movie has even come close to the quality of this movie, not even any Disney film that was also released in the Renaissance era. There is not one problem I have with this movie, which is extremely rare for any movie. Everything about this movie flows so well that it would hurt me to say anything negative about it, if anything.<br /><br />The animation and artwork in this movie is possibly the best animation ever penned in an animated movie. That's a shockingly amazing stunt considering most of the animators who were working on this movie either had never worked on a film with animals as the central characters, or were pretty much amateurs. All I can say is that any and every amateur animator on this film had turned immediately into a top dog after this film.<br /><br />But it's not just the animation that works in this film, of course. It's the characters and the story. All of the characters have a purpose in this movie, and don't just appear to be bland archetype characters. We have Simba, who is my favorite character, who is a relatable main character that is very easy to get invested in. I prefer Simba as a cub, but that doesn't mean the likability of this character is diminished when he is an adult. He's just as likable as an adult as he is a cub. Also, we have Scar, who is a very close second. Scar is the most likable and intimidating villain character ever, from the over-the-top performance given by Jeremy Irons to his strong motivations of taking over Pride Rock. Other good characters include the comic duo Timon and Pumbaa, who are actually funny and serve a point to the story, Nala, who is Simba's friend and later love interest, Mufasa, the obvious king, and Zazu, Mufasa's major-domo. All of which have amazing voice talents that work so well for their characters.<br /><br />Man, I could discuss this movie for weeks upon months upon years, and tell you how much of a masterpiece it is. I could tell you about the fantastic editing and camera angles, the lively soundtrack written by Elton John and Tim Rice, the fantastic script, even how the 3D on the Blu-Ray release makes it the best 3D movie ever, even if it is a conversion (oh, and by the way, I did see it in the theater during its 3D release, which was by far the best experience in a movie theater I ever had). But, I could drown in this sea of excellence if I even attempt to discuss this film any further. THE LION KING has aged much better than other Disney animated films, which have also aged pretty well, but nowhere near this. Even classics such as BAMBI and LADY AND THE TRAMP, and more recent pictures like BROTHER BEAR and PRINCESS AND THE FROG haven't aged as well as THE LION KING has. THE LION KING is a film that will be remembered for the longest of times, much more than the garbage that Disney is spewing out nowadays, including the highly unnecessary and annoying Tinker Bell sequels and the insufferable Disney Channel teenage sitcoms. I hope Disney makes another movie as good as this. They probably won't, but it's still healthy to hope for such an event to happen.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 starsazu, Mufasa's major-domo.

B008LXZFH6|1.0|ugh-juvenile humor that I hoped would improve as the movie continued. Unable to finish. Can't believe Will Ferrell would be in such a  movie with a weak attempt at humor.
B0052FDRI0|5.0|This album rocks from start to finish. Nothing I want to skip here while listening to this one. Superb vocals and insane killer metal high speed guitar licks. Good song structure and thought provoking lyrics. I recommend this.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Awesome album. Wish they'd come to Buffalo. 13 more words required? Ok. I rock out to it, especially in the car.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I won't recap the book - many others have done that better than I could.  This is a very good book.  I still think that The Forgotten Garden is her best book.  This story is told in 2 different times - it is a good mystery, love story and story of family ties.  Don't miss it.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Season 6 was good, but a good detective would have been on to dexter by the third season. This season just has to many give me a break moments, and loop holes to be believable.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I love Black Sabbath and Ozzy. Have been listening to them since the late '60's. I really was not expecting to much from this purchase, but I was wrong! This CD ROCKS!
B008CLI4N4|1.0|This movie is too overrated.... To much speeches, filthy languages and erotic scenes all of these are added imperfectly so that this movie looks great which in fact it's still a lame movie IMO.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. I wasted mine and I regret it. Spend your money on Rome or the classic Godfather instead.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very well done and great stories and insights about the studio and many of the artists who recorded there. Loved seeing Dave Grohil collaborating with Stevie Nicks and Paul McCartney etc.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Sounds like pretty reliable facts to me. The country should be worried. I would recommend everyone see this movie and make up there own minds.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Was not sure what I was getting into when I rented this, but it turned out to be pretty good. I am an old school movie person, thinking that most new movies suck. I prefer comedies. Blazing Saddles, American Graffiti and almost anything with John Belushi, Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson, John Candy. This movie was pretty good. Would recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome series! Can't wait for Season 4 to arrive on Amazon Instant Video. The season ended with quite a shocker.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Not typical, not expected. Big club sound in an approachable pop single. She continues to push the envelope of what pop music on radio will sound like. Easily better than any single on the radio today. Yes, talking to you Katy Perry
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was one of the most wonderful seriies i have ever watched.  I missed it when it first ran, and my daughter insisted i watch the reruns, which i did, and have now watched the whole thing three times and have found something new each time.  I'm almost inclined to wait until Season 4 is done and watch it without thae interruptions of commercials, but know i won't be able to resisr once it starts.  Reaomment it for all ages!!!
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|So I am not in the least bit dissapointed in this album. My favorites from it are Sweet Talk, Swan Song, Imagine It Was Us and Running. This woman has some amazing pipes and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|I have always liked this film.  Hitchcock's script is deliciously written with Grant's character Roger O. Thornhill being mistaken for an undercover agent named George Kaplan.  Given Thornhill's position as an executive one would think that the sinister James Mason and his equally sinister aide Martin Landau would check into Thornhill's claim that he is not George Kaplan, but I guess they figured \\"bird in hand\\"...  Jessie Royce Landis role as Grant's mother is lovely and amazing given that she and Grant were about the same age at the time this film was made.  I am not sure which scene I find most breathtaking and heart stopping - when Grant is chased by a crop duster plane on open fields or when he is trying to make his way across and upon Mount Rushmore with Eva Marie Saint.  I have been to Mount Rushmore and know that I would not want to make an attempt to climb it and especially at night.  I confess that I am surprised that the National Parks Service would allow anyone to climb Mount Rushmore, but this scene adds hugely to the suspense.  The musical score adds to the atmosphere of the cat and mouse game being played.  I own a copy of this film on DVD, but it wasn't until the 1990's that I finally could place part of the score.  I kept thinking that part of the musical score had been reused for another film.  Then when I purchased a copy of \\"V\\" {the first miniseries} I made the connection.  The part of the score used in the crop dusting scene was reused in part of this science fiction miniseries and was just as suspenseful as in \\"North By Northwest\\".  This film is one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements in movie making.  I have to admit that his \\"Rear Window\\" is my most favorite of Hitchcock's films, but \\"North By Northwest is next in line.  Grant manages to inject his own zany humor when he talks about his various ex-wives who depend upon his earnings and when he is trying to convince the police that he was not drunk, but taken to a big house only to discover that the staff at the big house has changed and no one remembers seeing Grant.  I have always wondered if the police were in on this deal or if the 'respectable' people at the house were so convincing that it was thought that Grant had been drunk instead of drugged.  The scenes between Grant and Eva Marie Saint on the train are delightful.  This is a film that calls for the phone being turned off, the door bell ignored and home made popcorn.
0670026557|5.0|Quite a brilliant book. I really enjoyed reading it.<br />Quite a lot to learn from the book and it will change the life for ever
0062255657|5.0|I read this book after Alif the Unseen because I wanted more of the unseen, a deeper sense of the unknown.  Unbeknownst to me my daughter was also reading it on the other side of the world.  We both loved it and it's more than what is seen and known reality and we both felt altered in our thinking by reading it.  I there is something to be gained by reading fiction it is surely to come away with a greater understanding of how little you know the world and how rich what you do not know might be.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|It's a quick fun way to play solitaire, and I like the little golf commentaries you here throughout the game.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|Loved this movie.  It's a true story involving friends that got themselves into mischief way beyond anything they could have ever imagined.  They were not bad boys, just didn't think about consequences.<br /><br />What happened to them next should never, ever, happen to anyone.
B007YC2YQU|5.0|I love this board.  It is my second purchase of this CPU board and I was not disappointed either time.  I did have the occasion to talk to ASUS technical support to clarify a driver question and their support was wonderful.  Great value, product, and support - the technical trifecta - in my humble opinion.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I'm not much of a reviewer but I really wanted to get my 5-star rating in on this one. I cannot think of a single thing to say that has not already been said perfectly in the other reviews. I am a long time Richie Kotzen fan and I impatiently awaited this release for that reason. For anyone new to Richie Kotzen, I would suggest [[ASIN:B0000076FK Mother Head's Family Reunion]], [[ASIN:B00004TBXN What Is]], and [[ASIN:B000ZHKANU Into The Black]]. I have loved Mr. Big since the 80's so I was already familiar with Billy Sheehan but I was only marginally familiar with Mike Portnoy's work, mostly from Dream Theater. For me, this is one of those collections that you hear in your head the minute you wake up in the morning and you can't wait to get out of bed and push \\"play\\". Like others have said, it is hard to pick one favorite here. All of the tracks feel warm and familiar to me because I already knew what to expect from RK. Like someone else said, one minute one track is my fave and the next it is a different song that is bumping around in my head all day. Currently it is 'Regret'. I cannot imagine anyone would be disappointed with this purchase. There really is something here for everyone.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Jay Asher did a magnificent job of intertwining the words of a tragic teen as she spirals into depression, with the viewpoint of one of her many on a list of reasons why...  I think this book should be mandatory reading in classes about bullying and suicide prevention!  A MUST READ!
B00E8B1358|3.0|Better than the first. It's still trying to be too many things to too many people...keep it kids, teen or adult no need to straddle here. Old fans will see it regardless, heck the GI Joe movie reference is zero or some long cartoon/s (prior to this recent franchise).  I liked the characters and use of them. This movie is great for hotel and plane viewing, simple, fun and not serious.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I felt as though this was a fairy tale but with adult material so not for children! I do believe that there are people who will respond positively to this type of plot but i personally not engaged by the subject matter. I will agree that the prose of that the author employs is interesting so i would not write off all of his books together- he clearly is a giftef writer I just did not respond to the story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The best thing about this book was how it provides a backdrop to the life of Jesus.  He explains the political and cultural world he lived in and the importance of it (particularly the Jewish rebellion) in the evolution of Christian doctrine.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Watched this in the theater and multiple times since.  I usually don't like watching movies more than once but this one almost seems to get better.  Great movie and even more incredible story.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Awesome movie in 3D.  I was amazed by the colors and the 3D effects.  It was totally worth the price
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|the game was just ok..but was shocked to have finished the game in such a short time give or take 20min. some of the pics, however, were a little kiddish and some didn't make sense.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed this series. Even if you took out all the sex it would still be a great story! Spoiler!!!...Broken guy meets normal girl, they fall in love and have a family. There is an INSANE amount of sex. I was actually mentally exhausted after reading book two. I would recommend this series.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Love this game, as I get to each level it gets more challenging. I will definitely download more like this.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read Khaled Hosseini's other two books, The Kite Runner was superb.  The stories intermingled in this one and was very interesting.  Feel much sympathy for the Afgan people, they have been through so much.
B003R0MEZ4|1.0|Disc three comes up with an error, so it won't even play. I've tried it in multiple players and it doesn't work at all. Disc four was fine for the most part until the last episode, which just continued to go back to the menu screen after small clips of episode. I haven't touched the last two discs yet. VERY disappointed and will spend the extra money to buy through Amazon directly and get a higher quality product.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this after I saw the trailer for the movie, and started reading it immediately. I will definitely read the rest of the series! I would definitely recommend this!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|as good as the 1st 3 seasons. why do you require so many words? I'll skip these ratings in the future
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is amazing!<br />I think anyone would like it.<br />It has romance and action, the best two things a book can have.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Was an extraordinary continuation of the trilogy \\"The Maze Runner\\". Spectacular details and lots of thrill and excitement.<br /><br />4 and a half stars for this one!
B00BQ1D90A|5.0|This was a gift, and I know my son loves it because he is always listening to it on Spotify.  Perfect gift for a guy who has everything.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is great and fun to play to calm down after a hard day of work or play and the best part it's free!<br /><br />In benja we trust for bacca we must our axes won't rust turn enemies to dust<br />#ty's foot
B00740FMTS|5.0|If you love BIOSHOCK the game you will love the book. I am a big fan so I love it know matter what. Read and enjoy.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so awesome that it costs less, updates itself, has butter(GOLD), has buckets, and has cake. But the only thing bad about it is it doesn't have everything that the regular version has, but they are working on getting everything on pocket edition. I hope this helped.

B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Very great show. Let three episodes for seen how the writer plan his story.<br />Me I love it in the start. Malsany gain in capacity to bluff us and we forget that Cosima, Sarah, Allisson ... aren't just Her.<br />And Felix make me laff a lot.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An eye opening book written in a layperson's terms. Excellent affirmation of a world beyond what we can comprehend. I highly recommend this book!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|A good thesis supported by solid data, this book is a good account of how humans came to be (and why some are ahead of others).  Although picky critics (see its Wikipedia page) pick on its details, plus the 'Why Europe? Not China?&#34; question being answered so briefly, over all this book is still a completed and valid thesis.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is fun. I would've gave it 5 stars but it can be difficult to level up unless you purchase more bits/gems. Other then that, if you're a fan of my little pony you should get it.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This is the app I've been waiting for. I tried many of the free music player apps for my Kindle Fire HD, but none of them worked correctly. Some of them just froze and did nothing. After reading the reviews for the EQ app and seeing that it worked with the Kindle, I decided to try it. Works as advertised and improves the sound quality of the Kindle's native music player. After starting the app, you'll see the volume screen. The EQ button at the bottom of the window will open the Equalizer section. You can get back to the volume screen by tapping the VU button at the bottom of the EQ screen. All in all a simple app.
0767919408|5.0|This is an entertaining and in depth account of a snapshot in American History.  Bryson's dry, witty take on the age of Babe Ruth, Lindbergh, Coolidge etc is detailed and well researched.  Have you ever read a 27 page article on some completely esoteric subject like ballet shoes or staplers and come away with a profound appreciation for the subject and the writer?  Bryson does this with travel and now history.  How could something so dry become so interesting?  This book is like that.  I wish that American History 101 had been this fun.  I'm a little biased because I adore Bryson's writing anyway, but this is good stuff.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The characters in this show are amazing! The main characters for sure, but even the lesser characters and villains are great! The plot! Each episode just keeps getting better. Watch it!
B00902MCVY|5.0|This album might be short, but man does it deliver.  The impact of these songs is extraordinary.  Ranging from simply beautiful, to harsh and fast, then technical, and back to beautiful again.  The amount of quality put into each of these tracks is astounding.  It's a blending of black metal vocals, Japanese influences, technical guitars, and power metal verses.  Truly a wonderful find as I stumbled upon them by complete accident.  This is truly a unique band, and audio experience.  I would recommend this highly to any fans of technical metal.  Cannot wait until the second part of this album is released!
B007IO1X5C|5.0|Invigorating, perceptive, relevant and necessary, this essay calls for an examination – both personal and societal – of how USA society is geared up for profitability and markets at the expense of moral values, and proposes an evaluation of the social price tag. These are questions worth asking, and we should have more people asking them. We should ask them ourselves.<br />It hurts to hear that we are not doing what we should do or being what we should be, but a fact is a fact. Societies the world over – USA included – are still failing to tackle historical problems like equality, justice, corruption, famine and accountability. Instead, we have been indeed selling out our conscience for convenience and the promise of consumerist bliss, and we’re not even getting our money’s worth, are we?<br />The author addresses some of these issues more by proposing problems than solutions, but he does it in a very illustrative manner that will set your mind in motion towards your own conclusions. The text is accessible and the examples are widely based on day-to-day common knowledge and good reporting of recent events. Some commentator claimed that the “economics” of the essay is faulty, but if you think of it, so is the economics of the nation, as envisioned by economists, industrialists, marketers and government. So, at the very least, the read is worth your time, so that you may start asking some questions of your own. The Kindle formatting could use a revamp, but that in no way hurts the message.<br />Another consonant book with a slightly different and wider focus is: Universal Utopia. I also recommend Henry Thoreau.
0316201545|5.0|The Lands of Stories: The Enchantress Returns is delightful, fun, creative, clever and full of edge-of-your-seat action. Author Chris Colfer exceeded all of my already high expectations for this second book in the series. The story grabs you in from the very beginning and makes it incredibly hard to put the book down. The book stands up very well to the classics that inspired it - not only the fairy tales themselves, but also the Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland and other classic tales of adventures in another world. It has definitely earned a place in my heart and on my bookshelves beside these classics that I read again and again.<br /><br />Chris Colfer has greatly matured and improved as a writer in the short time between his first book and this one. The writing is smoother, the story even more engaging, and the characterization is more nuanced. The book brings back all of my most favorite characters from the first book, as well as even more characters from classic fairy tales. I love how the author cleverly ties together classic fairy tale stories through making connections between the characters of different stories that you would have never thought of, but make perfect sense once you read about them in this book.<br /><br />The book also has several mysteries and puzzles that build throughout the story and are resolved at or near the end. The author does a fabulous job here as well. The mysteries are sophisticated and intricate and there are surprises throughout the book. Clues are given throughout the book and I found them simple enough to remember but also complex enough that they didn't entirely make sense until the end. This was very well done.<br /><br />I also continue to be impressed by the theme, continued from The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell, that evil characters have complex motivations for their evil deeds. I was even more impressed that the story has a great and inspiring message about the importance of compassion. I really love that the book isn't just entertaining, but also provides an important message - much like most fairy tales themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting both the book and the audio version. I read the book first and it sparked my own imagination to run wild with the characters, voices and scenes. It was great to then hear the author's take on the character's voices and the emphasis placed on words and phrases that gave even more meaning to the story. Chris Colfer does a fabulous job creating and acting out the voices for each character and it makes for a highly entertaining experience.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing is the archteypical PT album. If you want to buy progressive music, expect variety, and plenty of it. Incumbent in that, some tracks and albums it will appeal to different listeners more than others. This is no different. However Steve Wilson's talents in songwriting and production combined with his ability to draw top class musos round him takes this to a different level to most prog music. The hard edge of Deadwing and Halo is offset by trhe beauty of Lazarus. The lush atmospherics of Open car is countered by the almost grating repetition of the Scratching of the Mellotron song.<br /><br />However they are all overshadowd imho by 'Arriving Somewhere'. Awesome song, drfiting from a simple atmospheric opening, to a menacing verse /chorus structure, morphing into a truly thunderung instrumental riff section before lapsing back to the chorus and then fade.Wow.<br /><br />The heightened level of detail and care of Steve Wilson's work shows his true love of music as an art form. If the &#34;Sound Of Muzak&#34; from &#34;In Absentia &#34; album mourns the death of music as an artform (and the rise of its commercial doppelganger) then Arriving Somewhere is a statement that clearly says, to me anyway..... &#34;this is what music is like when someone has talent, passion and imagination&#34;. Tis a towering masterpiece.<br /><br />It's a very good album, featuring one of the great tracks of all time.
B00AC64JRW|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a well-directed and produced movie with great stars especially Sandra.  I like all her movies as she is a great actress.  My wife likes her too.  I liked everything about the movie as I like football and Sandra.  She was a great teacher and motivator for the young man.  I would recommend to everybody who likes her and her movies.  You don't really have to like football to like the movie.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|This show is incredible.  Unique and clever, it captured me in season 1.  I simply love this show.  If you haven't seen it, it's worth the money.

1423124111|5.0|I bought this as a gift, but now I wish I would have kept it for myself. It's not as good as &#34;Walt Disney Imagineering: A Behind the Dreams Look at Making More Magic Real,&#34; but this is still a wonderful book. I had no idea how much work could go into a poster!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm sure this book would help people who need advice in maintaining a good relationship. Highly recommended!! Not just for married couples.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As soon as one dramatic ordeal ends something new begins. If you don't watch this series you are missing out on some of the best drama ever.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theatre, I liked it well enough, but wouldn't have rated it 5 stars.  The book, however, is one of my favorites, and since I enjoy watching a good story come to life, I bought the DVD.<br /><br />I watched it the same night I bought it, and again the next, and the next . . . .  Then it occurred to me that it was Saoirse Ronan's acting that was so compelling.  Until this movie, I'd never heard of her, but I've probably watched it 6 or 7 times now, and I continue to be amazed by her portrayal of both Melanie and Wanda.  Her actions, expressions, demeanor . . . the only other time I was so impressed by someone's acting ability that it jumped off the screen at me was when I saw Cher in Moonstruck.  Bits and pieces, and sometimes entire scenes of movies are often brilliantly performed, but it's rare to come across an actor/actress who carries that brilliance through the entire film.<br /><br />One reviewer thought an older actress should have been chosen for the part, but I disagree.  I don't think someone older could have captured the innocence and wonder of Wanderer with the same poignancy Ronan projected.<br /><br />As well, though nobody likes the bad guy, Diane Kruger did an equally impressive portrayal of the hated Seeker.  And William Hurt was an excellent choice for Jeb.  As with Saoirse, it was as though they lived the roles they played.<br /><br />The script had a few glitches and repetitive sappy parts, but for me, the acting was so superior, I STILL gave it 5 stars.  Other reviewers found it lacking, and I've yet to come across a guy who enjoys watching a love story, but this movie resonated with me.  Some are like that, I suppose.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|This was a great book with practical suggestions and a lot of interesting examples and studies cited. The author is also very honest about his own weaknesses
B007V9N5R8|2.0|The product is easy to use but I seemed to have gotten a green tint in the skin tones of my photos.  I tried a few times to recalibrate and have not gotten better results.  In addition, my Mac book pro with mountain lion, seems to now change colors when loading Lightroom or CS6 after installing this program.  I am so far not impressed but will continue to work on this.  I have sent a note to x-rite technical support and their answer was a generic reinstall the software.  Not really feeling the love from them.
1476734941|4.0|I know a LOT about diets and I noticed that everyone responds differently to the same things. I know a number of people who managed to loose weight and now live much healthier lives. It is POSSIBLE!<br />Now, about the book... it has little content. There are other books you can read that provide much more info if you're interested, however the idea of intermittent fasting (= giving body a break from digesting food) is a good one. It is good for health reasons as well as for weight loss.<br />For me, personally, it is an easiest diet to be on. When I wanted to loose weight I did not eat at all every other day. I felt great, ran 5 miles 3 times a week (reasonably fast; I don't want to run faster than 8 min/mile; too afraid of leg injuries). Every time I felt like eating something, I just had to tell myself that I'd do it tomorrow. Why was it different than other diets for me, with which I was not successful? It is because I didn't have to think about food and I didn't have to change my eating habits. Surely, it is great to eat healthy, but I could still eat things that I like / used to eating (chocolate, bread) and loose weight or maintain it. With other diets \\"thinking of correct food\\" is a necessary part of what you do and it drove me crazy. Eventually, I was so sick of thinking of \\"proper food to eat\\" that I'd give it up. Fasting is easy - no thinking involved. One day I eat whatever I usually eat (trying to make it healthy, but not too concerned about gaining weight by eating a piece of chocolate), another day - I don't eat at all, so again, no thinking of food. Since I feel great both days (in fact, I feel better when I don't eat - lighter, less sleepy), I can go on like this for a long time.... which I could never do with other diets.<br />Ideally, I'd like to stay on 5/2-diet forever, which for me means not to reduce calories, but not eat anything (drink water, coffee, tea) 2 days a week. I don't know if I can do it, so I will write a follow-up to this review.Good Luck!
B0026PA05M|4.0|I would have given this CD a better rating if it had more songs that I listened to. I tend to skip a good half of the CD. It's not that the songs aren't good but they just aren't as good as what Halestorm could offer.<br /><br />This CD has some of my favorite Halestorm songs on it, don't get me wrong. Great voice, great vibe. But I highly recommend &#34;The Strange Case of... &#34; which came out in 2012 over this freshman CD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game its really fun I hope more people will realize how much fun it is and amazon should lower the price to 4$ thankyou good bye

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|UPDATE: went from a 1 STAR TO A 4 STAR.  I found out that my HTC Evo had Bluetooth 2 and would therefore not connect to it.  When I checked my wives, hers connected to her Evo 3d with Bluetooth 3 and the data was able to connect.  I got back my Samsun Galaxy S2 and the Pulse connected GREAT.  Now here's my news after 2 weeks.  Although I did not try the fit bit, I thought the water resistant would be a nice feature that the pulse does not have.  But in doing more research, you can shower with the fit bit, but not submerge it. My wife and I like to kayak, so if we fall in, either would be toast. And Because the pulse you can review DATA IMMEDIATELY ON SCREEN,and heart monitor and the wireless update to my phone, My wife and I have decided to stick with the pulse.  PS: Got a much quicker response from my second tech support email, within a day, but by this time I had figured out the Bluetooth problem.<br /><br />OLDER FIRST REVIEW:<br />Without getting this pulse to connect to the phone, the measurements are pretty useless for any kind on tracking.  It took about 5 days for a response back and all I got was a trouble shoot about the 15 second and reboot the phone.  Duhhh,, I told them I already tried all those steps before contacting their tech support.<br />I put in another request, but if no luck in a few days will RETURN THIS and try a fitbit.<br /><br />For any one else with this issue that got it to work, I have a sprint HTC evo and it shows paired but not connected and I continually get a message on the phone that says \\"OOPS THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONNECTIVITY ISSUE, PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\\"
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Here is a knife that will have everyone wondering what you are compensating for. It is a massive (and sharp, from the box) chunk of steel that should work unfailingly in a campsite, or during the zombie apocalypse. I debated about whether to purchase this knife, versus the ESSE 5, and honestly, for half the price, I was not disappointed.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Jamie McCloone was abandoned as a baby in 1934, to a convent in Ireland: a place where a priest abused him, and some hard hearted nuns looked the other way. Now 41 years old, living by himself in a run down 100 year old cottage in the Irish countryside, he is suffering from depression, dragging himself through each day with only the comfort of his dog Shep, and his neighbors Paddy and Rose McFadden. Rose worries about Jamie and suggests that he look for a wife by taking out an ad in the newspaper. In another part of town, Lydia Devine, a never married school teacher, is living at home taking care of her over-bearing widowed mother. Lydia doesn't date, and when she gets invited to a wedding she realizes that she'll need a date, so she takes out an ad in the same newspaper.<br /><br />The story evolves around these two lonely people taking a chance, hoping to find happiness. The author, Christina McKenna, has written a compelling story using their voices, and flashbacks to the abuse Jamie suffered during his childhood. Christina is an amazingly talented writer, who has crafted a piece of fiction that shines brilliantly in the midst of its underlying dark tale of abuse. Reading the first page convinced me of her writing ability, and in the last chapter my heart was racing and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. 5 stars; and a warning for anyone sensitive to child abuse; the scenes are graphic, but can be skipped over because you'll know when they are about to happen.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|This movie is a 3d sight for the eyes. and the performances are great .seriously Oscar worthy!. BUT, they REALLY didn't need to mix modern music into the background. Rap is a music that doesn't really mix well into most situations.  the party scenes of the twenties were some of the most infamous in history and that's correct. That part is true but we didn't need modern music to make this appeal to todays audience. So in spite of that huge problem this movie is still a fantastic flick to watch, in 3d that is. It's a feast for the eyes, and thankfully the rest of the movie takes place in the twenties like it should.  But I will be buying this on 3d blu ray for sure. It was a very good movie other than the soundtrack, but with the way it was set up , you can even ignore that bad music and just get caught up in the truly classic tale of the great Gatsby. F Scott Fittzgerald was one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century and this is a very good adaptation of the movie.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Glad I got this! Bought it after hearing \\"Royals\\" a few times on pandora, but ended up really liking \\"Bravado\\" alot.  Honestly all the songs are good, great work for someone who is so young!
B005ERX1Z0|5.0|I'm not a DOM, at least I don't think I am, but this movie has lots of relatively innocent elements that made it risque back in the day. The bar scene where Burt Reynolds notices Farrah early in the movie, has just the right lighting to showcase one of Farrah Fawcett's prime attributes! I mean, it's like... WHO WOULDN'T LOOK AT THAT AND DROOL, I mean really! Sorry, but watch it and you'll see what I mean. Guys will sit up straight and women will have eyes open wide, and that's not even a nude scene! It's just,...FUNNY and over-the-top in a 70s kind of way! NOW, I'd consider it cute! How weird is that?!!! Good fun when sexy wasn't hoary!

B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|'The Impossible' is an absorbing, well-shot, well-acted film with convincing special effects. It is based on fact. It provides the experience of having one's family caught in a catastrophe with a vividness few other films have had. My qualm is with the film-makers' decision, faced with an event that killed an estimated eight thousand people in Thailand alone and devastated countless families, to take for their subject an extraordinarily fortunate family of British tourists who were violently separated and endured terrific trauma, but who managed to find each other and return home with every family member alive.<br /><br />The story of this family is pretty inspiring, but should Bayona have considered making a film about a Thai family that did suffer loss, as innumerable families did? Is his message that when calamity strikes us we suffer great terror and difficulty, but it will all be O.K. in the end? And why are nearly all the other people we meet in this movie also European? Why are there so few Thai people? Why does nearly every one speak English? Amid so much destruction, why do we see barely any dead people? Did one of the only films made about this titanic South-East Asian cataclysm really have to star Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A splendid spin of the lives of the oppressed and the government who puts them down. The girl on Fire who rose to power and the companions that accompanied her. The sacrifices war brings and the horrors it causes. A very influential narrative to say the least. I bestow a five-star rating upon it because it truly deserves it and I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults of all ages and from all walks of life. Their is a lesson to acknowledge from \\"Mockingjay\\" for everyone.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|SO far this is working out.  I am very slow, but hope the practice will help me work up to a higher level.

0061122416|5.0|This book receives a 5 star rating because of the topics which it covered and how expertly these topics were covered. Paulo Coelho was able to clearly communicate many different messages about life in a very concise and engaging story. Highly recommended!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. Lots of puzzles, and hours of fun. Also there are many different trains from different eras. Would recommend buying this game.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|A simple logical interaction game... Sixteen cards, a handful of cubes to keep track of scoring, and that's it. Best with four people, well worth spending your money on. A wonderful little game.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Great for fans of the HBO show or those who haven't watched a single episode. It definitely gives you for background and understanding of the characters.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simple in concept, yet incredibly addicting.  Giving you awards throughout makes you want to kep playing to see what you can get next.  At times can becomee a little &#34;jerky&#34; which makes the gameplay very difficult, but turning off and then on again usually fixes.  Highly recommend it to those who wish to kill hours of downtime.

B007REV4YI|5.0|When i discovered this film was directed by Sam Mendes, I rushed out and bought it. Two of my all-time favorite movies were directed by Mr. Mendes--AMERICAN BEAUTY and ROAD TO PERDITION. So obtaining SKYFALL was a no-brainer. Btw, as expected, it is an excellent Bond movie; right up there with GOLDFINGER.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|I'm a sucker for fuzzy god stories. Or, stories that attempt to provide an un-mystical explanation of mythologies and gods and goddesses. While Stargate has a few inconsistencies in it's presentation of the mythology, it pulls it off well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is fascinating. The story is most addicting. Lovely costuming and good dialogue. It is worth the time it takes to see the whole series.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The app does what it says it does, although it does have a lot of adds. Other than that it is seriously one of the most important app for anyone who loves music and wants free music videos at the click of a button.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that a few of the characters are truly unlikable.  I enjoyed the book and felt it gave a pretty interesting take on life and how the decisions we make can change the outcome of everything.  The husband's secret is easy to figure out from the beginning but seeing how it affected soo many was well thoughtout and written.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Rented it for daughter's sleepover.  Tried to watch it again with the family, though (at child's behest) and we (adults) couldn't stay awake.  Your child (6+) will love it.

Defining and doing the one thing can make you very, very popular.<br /><br />This book pivots on one question: \\"What's the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\\"<br /><br />Short speeches take longer to write than long ones. And short, meaningful questions that require one answer take longer to answer than long, meaningless questions. I benefitted from answering the author's question. So will you.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|How to describe the excitement after watching The Dark Knight Rises for the tenth time (once in theaters, 9 times at home) is WOW!!! After Christopher Nolan finished The Dark Knight in 2008 he said he would not be interested in making another film, unless he had a story to tell and was compelling enough. He would go on to create his third entry in the Dark Knight saga with focus on Bruce Wayne. The majority of this film delves into dark, depressing circumstances that not only is affecting Bruce Wayne but with the city of Gotham. The relationship between Bruce and the city is shown through characters such as John Blake and the Wayne Foundation; Commissioner Gordon and how a lie weights down his life and the fear that everything will be undone. There may be little Batman shown in TDKR but when you do it shows how little time he has left physically and mentally.<br /><br />Bane is a great character choice to insert by Christopher Nolan cause it showcases the trials and tribulations both he and Bruce Wayne have gone through. There is more to Bane than mere destruction and brutality. Both characters were portrayed to have risen and fight with determination no matter what.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's score for The Dark Knight Rises is amazing and fits with the tone of the movie. Probably the best score out of the three.<br /><br />Overall, The Dark Knight Rises Successfully concludes the trilogy with a deep and heavy revelation that even heroes have despair and that there can be no true despair without hope.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|For all of the hype I was disappointed and found it boring. The writer used same phrases over and over to describe the characters. After awhile you wonder if she is just simple minded.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|i love it. It is very great sharpener and easy to  use.  so i recommend it. you can use any knife.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A great story from a great storyteller. First rate characters, and a fast paced plot. Highly recommended. I need a few more words to complete this review.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Of any film to be released with Christopher Nolan's name somewhat behind a project it was Man of Steel. What I enjoyed most was the first twenty minutes of the movie that took place on the planet Krypton. I would have enjoyed seeing more of planet Krypton be fleshed out. Then the story comes to earth and that's where I felt everything was rushed. To start, the story was all over the place and was trying to be told through action-set pieces, disasters, and chaos. It was difficult for me to care or understand what Cal-El was going through as he took on the mantel. Cal-El's relationship with Lois Lane was forced considering I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between the two. I think there could have been more character development for Lois and maybe carry the love element into the sequel rather than all in just one film.<br /><br />Another thing I wasn't a big fan of was there being too much action in the last 45 minutes of the movie. Now it's not like action is terrible to be in a movie but there needs to be balance. The story got muddled in-between with Zach Snyder's style and Christopher Nolan's vision. There were a lot of great elements in the movie: planet Krypton; the S symbol being a sign of hope; and the task in keeping your secret from others and the amount of responsibility placed in the hands of someone who is different from everyone else.<br /><br />Lastly I will mention one individual who did not disappoint and that was Hans Zimmer. If I can say the one thing that was great it would have to be Hans Zimmer's score for this movie. Hans continues to amaze me and every film he becomes a part of. So for Man of Steel I would say there was potential and unfortunately it became a disappointment. With the sequel of Man of Steel including Batman in the mix I am worried that too much will be forced into the movie; especially if they still have to introduce Lex Luthor, Batman, kryptonite, and how long after it has taken to rebuild the city.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A good program to keep home inventory, business contacts, recipes and emails you want to keep. And the nice thing is that it sinks to my IPhone and ipad and husbands android at the same time so I have the information wherever I go.<br /><br />It is great for keeping track of little notes. Scan into Evernote and then you can find it instead of looking all over the house. When you are through just delete it. Using Evernote can help organize your life
B001KS0THU|5.0|It's interesting, this movie has been remade 2 other times. All starring John Wayne. El Dorado is the second of the three. #1 Rio Bravo 1958 (John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson), #3 Rio Lobo 1970 (John Wayne, Christopher Mitchum *Robert Mitchum's son*,) This by far is my favorite of the three. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne, play their roles wonderfully. Not to mention the young and dashing James Caan as &#34;Mississippi&#34;. Would recommend it to anyone who loves a good western.
0393061310|5.0|Brilliant book that basically explains human history in a logical, consistent and completely plausible way. If you want to know why things have turned out the way they have, read this book. Some reviewers critiicise the book for some factual errors.  With so much information and so many ideas being expressed it is possible that a date or two might be wrong. The overall concept is still consistently and convincingly put forward.  One of the books that have most influenced me.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|One thing to consider:when I got this game it came with NO directions.Had to read the reviews to get a clue! Figured it out<br />and now love it. The Hohng company should INCLUDE the directions for their game.I would think that would be obvious...

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|House of cards is a true masterpiece in comparison to the other shows out there.  It is intelligent, funny, mature, and interesting... pure entertainment as far as I'm concerned.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  Buy/watch this NOW!!  Keep 'em coming netflix.
0060516402|1.0|These so-called built-to-last companies have some major trouble and in fact turn out to be anything but 'built to last'.  They may have had some good sounding data and analysis to sell, but it's anything but worthwhile in practical application of creating a business that is built to last.  Also terribly boring and nearly impossible to read through unless you enjoy boring books.

076115678X|5.0|I have fine, curly hair and have never been proud of my curls...they always felt very lifeless and were hard to take care of (thin and curly hair is not exactly an ideal combination). After having used sulfate laden shampoos and paraben ladedn conditioners until the beginning of this summer, I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend of mine, and out of curiosity. The homemade shampoos and conditioners I was using while effective at detangling, were making my hair limp, oily, and lifeless. I started reading The Curly Girl Handbook and figured out what curls I have (Botticelli) and how to care for them and was very excited. I had no idea curly hair DID have to be treated differently than straight hair.  I read about the DevaCurl products and actually just bought the No Poo and One Conditioner today, and they are a literal miracle; I had oily, lifeless, gross hair and LITERALLY while rinsing the No Poo from my head, my hair changed 100%. It was soft, strong, not weighed down, bouncy, light, etc. AMAZING. The conditioner is equally amazing as it provides SO MUCH nourishment and detangle in such a small amount.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the book. The book is essential for anyone with curly or wavy hair. Lorraine really does understand how unique curly hair is and her mantra is for everyone to embrace their curls, not try to conform to the current idea and standard of beauty (straight hair) and to be proud to have stand out curls. The tips are easy to understand (I especially love the homemade stuff she came up with, like the Lavender Spray) and everything is super easy to do, even down to how exactly you should wash your hair. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this....it's seriously going to change your life, because it did mine....and I'm a proud Curly Girl now!
B005K17RU0|1.0|The changes you made ruined a perfectly useful app.  I'm now shopping for a new weather app.  It is hard to imagine someone or some committee making this kind of business decision.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I am in love with this show! Zooey is amazing as always and the rest of the cast fit so perfectly together! Its almost like a modern day friends mixed with How I met your mother. I just cant get enough! I cant wait for season 3!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this controller and would never go back to a keyboard!  Nice ergonomics and plenty of customizable buttons.  Since I game in the dark, I really appreciate the LED clock.  I've had no problems with compatibility with the ~20 games I play with it.

B0000683DH|4.0|I was looking for the director cut for the longest.  Me and my kids love Star Trek.  It something that wee can watch together.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book was instrumental in changing the way I look at food. I am going to use this book forever. I loved the science behind it and the results after the challenge. I will use this book as a nutrition book in my homeschool.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I am a old school magic player , this game is a great way to get back into the series
B000FC2L1E|3.0|I LOVED the 1st book and the 2nd one immensely. This one was different though. It picks right up from where the 2nd ended which was good and we then read about what Jamie has been doing all this time. This takes us to about halfway through where the book abruptly changes direction toward a totally different and far fetched adventure that I had a really hard time getting into. It is as if there are two books here. I didn't like the way things reconciled between Jamie and Claire, didn't like who Jamie had become and how Claire turns a blind eye toward it all, and then didn't care for how everything Jamie gets involved in has to have this criminal bent to it. But I think fundamentally, I am not happy that 20 years have gone by - I wish they had come back together a little younger. Jaime is in his mid 40's and that's fine but Claire is late 40's yet seems so much younger. I'm in that age group myself, but I feel cheated (as I believe the characters feel this way too) of time they could have been together. On top of that, they are constantly facing life or death situations and it is exhausting. I would have preferred way more romance and connecting, more drama around the relationships, as opposed to their circumstances which changed a lot during their adventure. Want to go on in the series, but may take a little break.<br />flag
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and hard to put down once you start.  My wife is glaring at me at this very moment, but still playing.  LOL :)
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Unfortunately, I going to have to buy the whole season now!  My wife and I tried this after we watched (downloaded) some other show and this was recommended.  Great series.  I am going to buy the whole season.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Never had I read such a book that gave me such an intense insight into the life of another. You don't need to be a 'cancer kid' to love this book, you just need to be someone who loves love and knows that that the universe doesn't always honor it.
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|Bought it because I liked the color. The plastics are a little more matte than they appear in the images but the color is very vibrant. Fit is good and access to buttons is good too. I don't have any trouble with the silent switch like others have stated, I guess it depends on how big your fingers are. Apple chargers and headphones fit great, some of my other headphone jacks don't fit great but will work with a little convincing. A pretty good case for the money in my opinion.
B002VISNLC|5.0|Great book, it kept making you read more which is a great thing loved the book 😜💙💙❤💜💛 I would definitely recommend it<br /><br />JK
B00D6QUJ6U|1.0|Already purchased DVD, same quality...<br />This under the title blu ray is misleading. Either converted it fully to HD both video and audio or don't bother with it at all.<br />SD Blu Ray = Half Job.
B0053F042G|5.0|Excellent work, was that really Scott Bakula as his father's voice?  Plot was good, actors excellent, I would imagine a secret government organization to be really like what was portrayed complete with the proverbial lame director leading the lame, bent, sick and incompetent with the possible exception of Goodwin!
B000TERDJS|4.0|Purchased this album to provide \\"white noise\\" for the office based on a net recommendation.  Only worked for a while. Found myself actively listening!
B002VISNBC|3.0|Very easy to know what was going on and very short but ok 😜💙💚 should of bought another book but this is great for 5 year olds
0786948523|4.0|Great quality, as you can expect from Wizards books.  Used this to run a Summer-long campaign for my friends before one of my lifelong D&D buddies moved across the country.  Campaign turned out great.  Great book for any 4e DM to have.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|idk if watching the shows has that much of n impact on it but seeing and reading and being in related situations its hits the depth of emotions on the dot.if you can understand or relate mainly understand and truly put yourself in those shoes or know 1st hand its a good read but on a non understanding level it could be interesting bein it new and its reality.
B00002N9ER|4.0|This product worked very well to hold my flashlight in my truck. It was pretty easy to install and was decent quality.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is written from a scientific point of view. The author is a neuro surgeon who deals with his scientific training as relates to his near death experience.
B00CVCG87O|2.0|If you came looking for more songs like Noctune you'll be disappointed, the rest of the CD isn't as intense or catchy.
0345803485|1.0|I do not know how this book got the ratings it did. This book is very poorly written and very very repetitive \\"Jeez\\". Did the author even look up what BDSM is or do any decent amount of research \\"Jeez\\" ? My grandma who doesn't even know what BDSM stands for or what it is could have done better \\"Jeez\\". And worst of all the characters - Cristian Grey the psychopath, abusive, control freak who blames it on his BDSM fetish. Anastasia Steele how did she get into collage ? not with that brain, no email, or PC in 2011 ? she is so annoying and repetitive and just boring \\"Jeez\\" . This book is beyond horrible \\"Jeez\\" and will probably kill your brain cells \\"Oh My\\".<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this book are the 5,600+ 1 star reviews, those are more entertaining.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|The zombie genre has alot to live up to. A few bonafide classics, a number of movies of varying degree inbetween, and a whole lot of terrible, never should have wasted the celluloid atrociousness. This movie is no classic, but is way better than alot of the zombie fare.<br />Good acting, a fast moving plot, and a big budget that you can see in some of the fantastic, large scale special effects, are both refreshing, and something you don't see enough of. In fact, the big budget is the greatest thing this movie has going for it, and you get to see hordes of zombies, all over the world, and massive military intervention. There are a few clever twists, and it's nice to see a zombie movie get the big budget treatment. That said, there was little to no backstory, they cut the gore down to get a PG13 rating, and the whole thing ends a little too nice and neatly for a good horror movie. Definitely no classic, but worth a watch.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I loved the scribblenauts games for DS and was so excited to see it for Android. At first I thought it wouldn't work on my phone, galaxy S4. It turns out after you type in a word in text box (to spawn a new item), you have to the key with a down arrow in bottom right of keyboard. Usually the key to go to the next line. DO NOT HIT THE ENTER KEY as this will not work. Played a few levels of the game and it is good. Seems almost identical to the DS version, same problems to solve, at least for the first several levels. Will post back later after I have played more levels.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it it's very fun and addictive and I say that I'm pretty good at it because I'm very competitive. So what I'm saying is that it's pretty easy for me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just loved the book and got through it in two days. It is especially great for anyone who has ever lost anyone to cancer and likes a well written romance.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|All the elements of the plot you've essentially seen before, including the smaltzy \\"memories of human recreation\\" that are injected in the movies in an attempt to give it humanity. All of this might be easier to bear, however, if it wasn't for the ponderous filming that takes itself way to seriously for such run of the mill ideas. I heard they were going for that sort of \\"old scifi movie\\" feel. They forgot to make it interesting along the way.
0316044695|5.0|I've read this book three times and my 15 year old asked for a copy of his own. I can't wait for the movie to come out if for no other reason than to raise awareness for this unrivaled and unmatched spec ops community.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|I absolutely love this album. This is such an awesome live set; so much in fact that it ranks in with some of Garcia's finest, in my opinion. I read one of the original reviews for this album in the beginning of the review section here, and read someone's comment about the keyboards/synthesizer being over-balanced - causing it to overplay & power the rest of the music. I disagree with this comment. The keyboards in this session are fantastic. When the keyboards get the chance to be in the spotlight, its a great touch of electronica mixed with the classic sound of Garcia/the Dead. The solo's for all the instruments are played out near perfectly, and good ol' Jerry sounds excellent vocally. At times this album is extremely soothing (especially Russian Lullaby; my personal favorite) - great sound, great pitch, great everything. If you don't have this for your CD/MP3 collection, this is a must have. If you buy the album on Amazon, you have the option for an Auto-rip, so you get the MP3 version as an added bonus while only paying the price for the CD's (3 CD set!).
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|ok I like it but I uninstalled it because it froze and it had weird pictures and when it froze I lost about half of my 'villag'
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I didn't really like the first reboot of Star Trek, but the previews gave me high hopes for this sequel, and it was pretty epic. Way darker and more warlike than most previous Star Trek ventures, and you can see that they must have had a high budget, as the space battle scenes are amazing. It features a return of Khan, and I can't help compare it to the old \\"Wrath of Khan\\" Star Trek movie. That felt a little more horror, but this was more in line with Star Wars than anything Star Trek has done previously, but in the long running franchise, I think that was definitely a good direction for them to head towards. I could have done without some of the drawn out emotional scenes, but fortunately they were few and far between.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This application is awesome i use it every day and it works great. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for an alarm clock on kindle.
B00005JLEU|5.0|First things first - if you haven't heard or seen any of this director's work - Miyazaki - you are in for a real treat. His movies are always a delicate mix of fascinating artistry including colors, scenery and characters. The story in itself is amazing. It's a little Bizarre but seeing that this is based off of a Japanese book, some of the story gets lost in translation. In my opinion, it just means that its great to watch again and again. The voice cast in all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch, which helps give the characters that extra something making them all the more likable. All I can say is, this movie is absolutely amazing. It's freaky, it's funny, it's bizarre but beautiful. Even if you don't like Anime per say, whether its the look, the stereo types or whatever, don't judge a book by its cover - same goes for these movies. For one thing, they are backed by Disney, so they have to be quality - but these aren't your standard Disney Flicks. They are also highly praised by the producers at Pixar Studio's. Why? Because as said many times already, they are amazing - this movie in particular is a crown jewel. I won't go into the the story in this review, it's solely to let you know that this, and all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch and are just as memorable, incredible, and humorous for adults (if not more) than kids. See it, believe it - this is not to be missed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is great! It's  a cute;funny; amazing game with hilarious minions (of course) . it's a great game and I highly regimens it.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I just saw Pacific Rim in 3D. I heard a lot of naysayers decrying the human relations as \\"stiff\\", \\"cartoonish\\" and \\"cheesy\\". It's all true, they read like they sprung out of an '80s comic book. But you know what? They are a very small part of this film. You know what this film is really about? GIANT MONSTERS VS GIANT ROBOTS! Wait, did I not say that loud enough? GIANT MONSTERS VS GIANT ROBOTS ! So, if you are looking for meaningful human interaction, it's not here. If you are looking for jaw dropping fight scenes. Buildings crushed. Toxic auqua-green blood spewing, cars and boats flying through the air, and a twist that is a bit clever, this is the movie for you. I enjoyed it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I e joyed every book in the series thus far, however Book 2 did start to lag a bit. The action picked back up in Book Three and I'm looking forward to reading the next one!

B00EIBO8UK|4.0|This is a terrific movie for Christmas for those wanting the seasonal themes without the specificity.  Set in London, the film has all the appearances of one of those holiday movies we see several times a year (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) and in fact is.  The difference is that this one is well done.  The music alone (no not Christmas carols) is worth the price of admission (or purchase or rental).<br /><br />Several stories evolve at the same time.  The characters are loosely connected in some way, although it isn't all that evident for a while.  In fact if there is a dig at the film it may be that there are too many story lines.  Director and writer Richard Curtis assembles a cast that Robert Altman would have been proud of.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is a recent widower raising his step-son.  Hugh Grant is the recently elected British Prime Minister, single but looking.  Keira Knightley is a new bride who may have married the wrong man.  Andrew Lincoln (TV's \\"Walking Dead\\") may be the right man.  Bill Nighy is hilarious as an aging rock star trying again with a Christmas twist on an old song.  Laura Linney is a spinster-like office employee longing over a co-worker but obligated to care for an institutionalized brother.  Emma Thompson is the wife of an executive (Alan Rickman) who may be cheating on her.  Kris Marshall is the hound dog Brit who can't get a date so decides to go to Wisconsin (!) where he's sure he can find plenty of women who will love his accent.  He does!  They are Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Ivana Milicevic.  There is the couple whose job is too \\"stand in\\" for actors in a porn film and eventually fall in love.  Finally, there is Colin Firth, a writer who falls for his housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) who doesn't speak English.<br /><br />I know this all sounds so convoluted, but it works.  The writing is crisp and funny.  The film is sweet and moving at times.  There is humor, heartbreak and romance.  I'm also glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the \\"R\\" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.  Merry Christmas!<br /><br />The Blu ray version including the 10th Anniversary packaging (includes a DVD and a digital copy) may not be reference material but the disc looks very good and is certainly a step up from the DVD.  The colors are excellent, the skin tones look natural and the blacks are black.  Faint grain remains and video noise is minimal.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound track, again isn't spectacular but is consistent with the overall theme of the film.  The musical soundtrack does shine, however.  As previously noted the 10th Anniversary Edition adds a DVD,a digital copy, an Ultraviolet option and a Christmas ornament.  Here are the special features:<br /><br />* Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Richard Curtis<br />* The Music of Love Actually with Introductions by Richard Curtis<br />* The Storytellers<br />* Kelly Clarkson The Trouble With Love Is Music Video<br />* Billy Mack Christmas is All Around Music Video<br />* Feature Commentary with Director Richard Curtis and Actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangsterso glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the \\"R\\" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.

B008JFUN6E|3.0|Just saw Elysium and it was...ok. Good direction, good actors, decent storyline (even if we've seen the same theme before in plenty of Romero/Carpenter movies). You know, the poor, abused masses, the arrogant elites with all the money and privilege. And it was all moving at a brisk, entertaining clip until the last ten minutes. When they decide to get all sappy with the emotion, and wrap everything up in a Disney perfect end. Which might have worked with some more back story and character development. Which is so quick, and so picture perfect, it just rings false, and as a bit of a letdown. Not the worst movie of 1013, but hardly the best.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Augustus Waters is the type of boy that I want to fall in love with and that I would want my future daughter to fall in love with. He's metaphorical in a poetic, slightly pretentious in a way, but never rude, and it comes off endearing. His love for Hazel is simply beautiful, and the story is full of laughs, smiles, and tears. Like seriously, the further you get in the book, the more the feels on the bus go round and round, but I absolutely love it. This is the best book I have ever read.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I think that Kindle on the whole is GREAT and I certainly do appreciate your kindness in allowing me to get my books on my Android as well as my Kindle Fire and also my PC.  You all are just fantastic.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|We had to wait awhile for it, but this album met and exceeded my expectations! Can't get enough of Carlos Vives!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy playing this game to pass the time away.  I taught my grandkids to play this game when they were younger.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I recommend this to everybody. No one is safe from being sucked into the world of Supernatural. Taking old bedtime stories and childhood fears to a new level and then crushing them! yes please again and again. Great series, great season!
1781162646|5.0|Great book and fun to read.  Keeps you in suspense for the entire page turner.  I can't wait for Mr. King's next thriller.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this game when it first came out but I was pleasantly surprised. The controls work quite well and the graphics and additions are great.
1451695195|5.0|It was an amazing book that kept you wondering what was coming next.  I could not put it down and read it in 4 nights. How it all came together at the end was a complete surprise. I'd recommend this book for anyone but especially for someone who recently lost someone. I lost my nephew 19, my dad 57 and my Grandma 80 all in 14 months. Although I always had strong faith in Christ, this still somehow put me at ease. I'd recommend it for believer in Christ and non believers just the same. I'd say approach it with an open mind and see where it takes you.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love Supernatural. The storyline of 2 brothers out to save the world and mostly succeeding is compelling. Through all the seasons I have been captivated by these 2. Set aside the fact that you have two very attractive men to follow and you still have amazing story lines. I recommend this season to anyone. Even my redneck boyfriend gets absorbed by Sam and Dean.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's so cool and adventurous. It has a lot of suspense. I wanted to keep reading. I had a lot of time to read it as well.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Sweet read. Good choice for jr. high and high school age kids. This isn't my usual genre of books but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Sam leaves college to help Dean find Dad. Will they in time. Sam's patients is waning but come on Sammy the U.S. is a big place. Still compelling and entertaining. Find out where the nightmares really begin. I love me some Supernatural. Watch it and you will &#60;3 it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|So far it's a pretty good game. I don't like how hard it is to get the investment money; it make the game kind of a pain.
B002GHHHH4|4.0|My boyfriend wanted this and I thought &#34;um ok.&#34; But it was great! A father overcomes his distance with his son and in the end wins his love. Truly an amazing story. So touching and the end is awesome too. Lol not giving it away! Worth the order, good watch!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!!  It was not what I expected at all; it was better!  If you are in the mood for a great read, this is the book!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I absolutely can not wait for season 8. Give me more please these guys are always leaving me wanting more. Between heaven and hell and now purgatory!!!! I'm hooked. Demons, Angels and monsters. Supernatural has something for everybody. It takes your worst fears and shows you even monsters can be destroyed. Every creepy crawly thing you could imagine comes to life. I love how they grab your imagination and run with it!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Not good. Not bad. A decent action flick that does a good job of bringing back throwback action actors into the genre that made them famous.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Once you reach season 5 its impossible to stop. The road trips these 2 men go on makes me wish I had a sibling to have my back around every bend and turn in life. Of course not the kind of bends and turns these guys get into, but real life stuff. Love Dean!!! Just sayin. :-)
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I am a big fan of the alien movies. Even the b@$t&d child of aliens versus predator. It was great to see the defining moment of how it all started. This is definitely meant for true sifi fans. Please do not expect an aliens war movie. Part thriller and mystery with a little gore and a very beautiful story. The beginning of a perfect killer storm.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Drawing viewers in from the beginning and showing them a world we truly only see in our nightmares. Meet Sam and Dean Winchester. Brothers on a trek looking for their Father and the thing that killed their Mother. Monsters and Demons encountered and dreams unexplained. Where will it go from here. Anywhere the writers want they have a world of never ending evil at their finger tips. Fantastic stories for most ages but be careful if your squeamish, these aren't for the faint of heart. You will fall in love with &#34;the boys.&#34;
B004LWZWGK|5.0|great ending to a great series. Transfer and sound are perfect. Wish they would release a directors cut. Very happy with what i got.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is pretty awesome I like that there always updating items in the shop I would recommend this game to anyone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I enjoy the smart, urbane, sexy characters in this series...The acting is superb and I purposely wait until I have a quiet hour to give the show my complete attention.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Don't recall a book ever bringing me to tears before. This one did. Love the fact that it is written thru the viewpoint of a dog.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|This is a great movie in the sci-fi category of films.  Loved it as a kid and it is still awesome even today.  Great movie for those that can only watch things that could be real as the story is plausible and is entertaining due to a good story line as well.
1451627297|4.0|I can't really rate the book, because I just received it-after a long wait!<br />I haven't had a chance to read any of it yet, but it appears in god condition
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's amazing how these experiments work.. I was completely in shock after the first unexpected gift within 24 hours! *
B00005J6UP|5.0|GREAT 80'S MOVIE WITH LOTS OF ACTION AND ADVENTURE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, ANYONE WHO GREW UP IN THE 80'S WILL STILL LOVE TO OWN THIS....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is fantastic but we experienced streaming problems. The show actually froze and we had to restart the episode.
B00AEBBADG|5.0|OWNED THIS MOVIE ON THE CED VIDEO DISC BACK IN THE 80'S, AND FINALLY GOT IT ON DVD. STILL A GREAT ACTION MOVIE ALL THESE YEARS LATER.....
B008AK8FHM|5.0|SO amazing!  Very interesting.  Not sure if I believe 100% of what was written in here, but Dr. Alexander is very convincing either way and it definitely gives you hope for some sort of afterlife if you don't really believe in that sort of thing.  Read this!  You'll probably cry.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|TALK ABOUT HAVING A BAD DAY, STUCK ON A CHAIRLIFT, AND I WONT GO ON FROM THERE, SO NOT TO SPOIL IT. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF MOVIES THAT WE LOVE, GREAT ACTION AND SUSPENSE...
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I am a big Guy Clark fan. He writes what I like to call the real deal. If you like songs from the heart and stories of real people you'll like Clark. I hope he keeps writing them.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|IF YOU LOVE THE ORIGINAL 70'S MOVIE, YOULL LOVE THIS REMAKE. THIS IS THE WAY ALL DVD'S SHOULD BE.....THEATRICAL AND UNRATED VERSIONS ON THE SAME DISC, NOT MAKE YOU BUY TWO DISC FOR THE SAME MOVIE
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A lot better than most zombie apocalyptic tales. Real geopolitical strategies uncovered. Lots of good insight on how a zombie war would actually go down.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|NOW THIS IS WHAT REMAKES SHOULD BE.....SUSPENSE AND SCARY...WHO EVER THOUGHT OF SOME OF THESE TORTURE SCENES, I TIP MY HAT OFF TO YOU. IF YOU LIKE THE ORIGINAL, YOU WILL LOVE THIS REMAKE......
B009WUBERW|5.0|Great movie with humor and great selection of actors.  Everyone did a great job on filming and the action shots.
B00005R2IS|5.0|STILL A GREAT MOVIE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, LOVE SEEING MEL GIBSON AS A YOUNG STUD STARTING OUT. STILL GREAT ACTION AND SUSPENSE 30 PLUS YEARS LATER..
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Definitely worth watching if you like action movies with substance; rather than flashy special effects for good ratings like The Avengers in 2012 with Downey Jr...
B001JV5BIA|5.0|NOT MUCH UNRATED ACTION HERE FROM THE ORIGINAL, ACOUPLE QUICK SCENES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL, BUT STILL A GREAT COPY FOR YOUR COLLECTION. STILL GOOD SUSPENSE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS....
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Awesome movie. My only problem is toward the end. For some reason it felt like Space Odyssey and the evolution of S.A.L. returning to earth.
B004EPZ034|4.0|BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER AS SHE IS A BIG CHIPMUNK FAN. I WATCH IT OVER AND OVER WITH HER, AND IS STILL ENJOYABLE TO WATCH...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great kids game, and to show how much work it is to have a horse. Easy to level up. Good hand eye coordination practice for children.
B000AYELVU|4.0|Moving on from the first X-Men,  I found this 'entertainment' to be as much fun as the initial film in the series. Stressing the vulnerability of the new breed adds to the suspense in positive ways.  Will these supra-humans overcome the attack upon them by the Evil military scientist? That is the thrust of the movie and provides the suspense that should be part of a thriller. Regardless of how  you feel about movies made from cartoons, this should satisfy those looking for action.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very frightening - the ultimate manipulations. Clever and unpredicatable. You were not sure which way it was going to go at any time.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game. First fps I have ever tried on a tablet. Controls are easier than I thought they would be. Like it a lot.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Needs work should be able to rotate. Fun overall good game for younger kids should have a easier way to get money
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|This was one of the slowest Cruise movies I've seen in years. The story line was very disjointed and the action was extremely lacking. I'll admit I'm not a huge Sci-Fi fan and this didn't do anything to earn my following. Cruise is starting to show his age and I felt this entire plot was corny and forced. I rented this on iTunes and even watched it twice just to see if I missed something and to ensure I gave it my full attention. S-t-r-i-k-e 3 and you're outt'a there! Stick with your Mission Impossible movies, Tom. I think they're the best you can do!
B0043URV5U|5.0|Enjoyed this CD very much; a truly excellent compilation of Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet band's greatest hits that I have enjoyed listening to often since it arrived.  This was a two-CD collection and it cost less than the Hamilton, Joe, Frank, and Reynolds CD I purchased at the same time which was a total waste of money!
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Every time I open it up it tells me &quot;Users are not titled to use this content.&quot; And telling me I don't own it so it doesn't work. But I've played it on other devices an d It as a f un good app. I just wish it would work because I played money for it.
0425263924|2.0|Perhaps I was the only fan of the Crossfire Trilogy books that did not know Sylvia Day and her publisher had decided to milk this storyline for another one? two? books and not conclude it at the end of Book 3.  It was advertised as a \\"Trilogy\\" so she should have wrapped up this Eva and Gideon story with Book 3.  What a huge disappointment!!!!!!  Ms. Day mislead and betrayed the readers of this trilogy!  I see now that the name has been changed from the \\"Crossfire Trilogy\\" to the \\"Crossfire Series\\".  Your fans are not stupid, Ms. Day.  We know the definition of the word \\"trilogy\\", apparently you chose to disregard what was originally promised to your fans.  Another win for \\"money\\" at the expense of \\"ethics\\" and your readers.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I've enjoyed every minute of it. It is full of action and jokes, I think they did a phenomenal job selecting the cast too.
1455576387|5.0|A good read where you need to read to the end to know the outcome.  Typical David Baldacci! well written.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Worth the $4, but had many plot holes that were compensated by the action and effects.  We recommend to friends.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|\\"Love is hard but it's worth fighting for\\".  That message is masterly delivered from the eyes of 14 year old Ellis.  This is not your typical Hollywood product, it actually gives me hope that HW can produce something special once in awhile!  While parts of the storyline are a little implausible, it all fits in the framework of a 14 year old boy who is trying to figure out how the love thing works.  McConaughey does a great job as the lovable but dangerous \\"Mud\\", and the young Tye Sheridan is awesome as Ellis.  Well worth the time and money!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I picked this up because I wanted a seamless, Wireless way to connect my tablet to my flat screen. The set up was a breeze, the picture is amazing but the problem I have is that there are too FEW app's for it. Namely, no Amazon or HULU?!?! What's up with that?!?!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed solving.  NOT TO HARD BUT A GOOD WAY TO WASTE A FEWW MINUTES AND RELAX.Fairly easy to figure out what to tap on to find items and clues.  Believe others would enjoy playing.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Starting converting LPs the day that it arrived.  Now I can listen to so of my old favorites whenever I want.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER<br />Also I made a server on pc the up is 158.94.3478<br />It's not on the whole time<br />My minecraft name is Bobcat101
B006LSZECO|3.0|I will stick with this book but I was disappointed with the start, after all of the hype the book received. I sure didn't care about the decor of the inside of the bar.
B009YQJ322|4.0|I received the movie exactly when I expected it, and the condition is great! I have watched it twice already!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first then read the book.  I had heard all sorts of praise from friends about the book and much to my surprise I didn't feel let down a single bit while reading the book.  It was so good it made me like the movie a lot less.  If you haven't read it yet, do so asap.
0891419195|5.0|This book is the best first hand account of what a ww2 Marine in the Pacific went through fighting the Japanese and just living through every challenge in the Pacific war as a Infantry Marine. I learned a lot from this book and plan on reading it several times. This book is well worth the money and i recomend it to any one to read but HIGHLY recomend it to any Future Infantry Marine to read, Like myself!<br /><br />God bless.
1401923119|5.0|Awesome<br /><br />Better than I anticipated changed my understandiing of biology completely.<br /><br />something a little thick but you can get through it !!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|worked perfectly til it updated. now it gets weather updates about every 2 minutes, even when you're not using the app. when the application is closed it starts the app automatically. this app kept draining my battery so quickly that I went from charging my battery weekly to daily. the battey could barely last one full day!<br /><br />PS uninstalling the app solved the problem.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It keeps your mind active and your coordination well developed.it helps hand& eye coordination whether young or old. Highly addictive for me.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This speedlight is awesome. That's all there is to it. You have control over whatever you want it to do (light output, distance). It's a great flash! Now, just so EVERYONE KNOWS THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T:<br /><br />I have a D5100. If you want to remote flash, you need your flash enabled and the sensor needs to pick up on your flash to flash the speedlight. I don't know if that's the case with all cameras using this thing but I can only speak for mine because I figured it out when I got it. It's great, I use it in daytime (filling in shadows on sunny days), and I mean...It's awesome!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My little girl loves this thing! I even bought the elephant one for her and ordered one for a friends baby! Great product!!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|In reading Beyond Bridaveil Fall, i felt like i transported back to my youth. This story was so detailed that i didn't think i was reading but living it. There were moments in the story that I actually felt like I was standing right alongside Oria, fighting against the evil that threatened to destroy her. When I got to the end, all I wanted was more! I honestly can't wait to see what happens next. Find myself fortunate that i encountered Sheryl Seal, the author. I had an inkling it would be a good story but no idea it would be classic.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This set is worth every penny i bought it for. A definite collectors piece for every Walking Dead fan. It arrived FAST and in excellent condition.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This is a very good movie, I liked all the actors they did good job . I will be buying on Blu-ray when it comes out for sure
1449437524|5.0|I have had dogs all of my life. My husband understood that if he wanted me he would have to open his home to dogs (and more than one at a time). This simple little book explains male dogs like no book ever has before; and it must explain how dogs, in general, view us humans. Poor hubby, we currently have a dog that growls at him when he comes to bed. Apparently, one male of any species is all that is allowed in the bed.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|the doctor. car to get done. friend to show up. etc etc. A quick simple to figure out game that by no means is easy. With several different modes to pick from it does not get too stale. Love the different blades you can unlock. (Slice exactly 50 fruits in one game will give you a spiffy blade).
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Brand new in cellophane.  Shipped quickly.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Important to see 1st movie.... and the right price at streaming...  b4 going to theater to see the newly released sequal kick ass 2.<br /><br />Both are good movies!  they are predictable but if you need something stimulating  intellectually ....enroll in college ... these are great youthful movies!
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I couldn't figure anything out with that book or the two programs I bought for $40. and $23.  So, after months of figuring things out (as an author and tech guy), I wrote my own book, and it's as easy as pie (now that I have it figured out).  Now, my chapters link from the Table of Contents - like they are supposed to.  My links to outside websites all work - like they are supposed to.  My pictures and descriptions under them all line up, and the white space between paragraphs is awesome..on the books I have uploaded.<br /><br />As a result of my being able to figure things out for myself - without the use of other programs that cost money and did NOT work, I wrote the book that you will be selling - \\"How To Write For Kindle Publication\\".  Everyone needs that book.  I take the potential writer from blank page to a perfect Kindle layout - for only $2.00.<br /><br />John Tyler, Author
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Quite simply the best film adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy ever made. I saw it 3 times in 48 hours, enjoying it more each time.  Brilliant in every way. As though the Bard had anticipated 'The Philadelphia Story' and Woody Allen.  The black-and-white chiaroscuro illuminates the play perfectly, the direction is always inspired, and the actors all superb. If this film does not hook a new generation on Shakespeare, then nothing will. There are not enough superlatives for it, not even in Shakespeare's vocabulary....
B0009MAP90|5.0|Got the platter when I was a young teenager. Rough and ready guitar with Bob's strait harp playing. Nice to play it again.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I guess I expected too much from this book. I do appreciate Dr. Alexander's journey and strongly believe it's truth's. I just think I was the wrong audience.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Considering that this is a free app. It does what it should but does crash. Why can't Amazon just include basic apps such as a Calculator, Calendar and Clock vs having us hunt down a good app. After paying $200 for a Kindle Fire HD I'm pretty sure many others will agree.
B0073O0AME|5.0|The variety and the intimacy make this an outstanding DVD.  I felt like I was right there in the recording studio with these outstanding artists.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a fascinating book that takes turns being a science lesson and a sociology lesson.  Rebecca Skloot was relentless in uncovering the life, and death, of Henrietta Lacks.
B00181MHQU|5.0|An excellent production. The music is the very best. Too bad that we do not see this type of Play/movie anymore.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|greatest movie of all time ninja ninja ninja LOL you would have to see it to understand.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to a friend
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|The reviews look great on this, however upon downloading and trying it out it proved to be otherwise. Upon opening it did not respond and then after shutting down two or three times it started to work however  it also crashed shortly after. This was my experience on a new Kindle Fire hopefully yours is better
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Had the free version with ads.  When this came up as the 'app of the day' for free, decided to ditch the ad version.  Good game.  Well executed.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Because this movie comes from Hollywood, I was afraid it would be smacking me in the face and doused with the usual Hollywood liberal spin message.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I enjoyed the detail put into the history, research and effort that was necessary by our boots on the ground intellegence personnel to get Bin Laden.  I enjoyed that it showed what is required to get intellegence as well as how operatives have to fight our own bureacrats at home who are so caught up with spin, political correctness, approval ratings and the political games that they really, have no clue.  Loved the movie so much in the theater, I bought it on blue ray.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, it's so addictive! I started watching it and now I just can't stop. Was recommended from people at work.
B002LVUKIS|3.0|I played this game as a demo over a decade ago, and it was different from any other game i had played. I was able to play the full version a few years later when a buddy had bought it. I played the sequels on consoles, and have always enjoyed them. So I was pretty excited to see a complete set like this.<br />The drawback is if you have windows os past XP, or a cpu with more than 1 core, be prepared to go through several steps to be able to play the games. The product is not just installl an go, because the game engines were designed for older computers. But I will say if you follow the steps, and there are quite a few, then you can play the game. 4 stars for the game, 2 for the product,averages out to 3 stars. The price is the saving factor.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|If you look at any of the positive reviews for this movie, you'll see that they're faked.<br /><br />The script was corny and cliche.  The directing was wtf uninspired and unmemorable.  There's not one scene I remember as, wow that was awesome.  All the cool new suits?  Never see or explore their history or functions.  Wtf was this movie?  They even made the Mandarin nothing!  Literally!<br /><br />RDJ gave perhaps the worst performance of his life.  Or they chose the absolute worst takes ever to put in the live film.  Whoever is responsible for this steaming pile of crap should resign.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was so glad to find this on amazon since I really didn't want to buy the DVD.  It's a great show.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I have become addicted and I feel like I could spend hours playing it.  It is a challenge to get three stars
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved this season.  Well worth my time to watch.  I Was very glad to find season two on amazon prime.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like the dictionary because of the way it was written it gives you more than what you look for in a dictionary and it gives you facts about the ancient world that is why I think that this is a good dictionary.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show so much. I hope this is a new running show like Seinfeld or Friends will be like.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love this show. My wife and I have watched all three seasons in a couple of months. We now have to wait on season four. Great character development.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this show so much. I hope this is a new running show like Seinfeld or Friends will be like.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It would be hard not to learn something interesting about the first century and the culture surrounding Jesus. Weather one wishes to agree with all the assumptions the author makes or not can be left to the reader. The caliber of the writing and the thought provoking material is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
0812550706|5.0|This is the beginning of the best scifi book series ever. Orson Scott Card is a great author for scifi.
0812550706|4.0|The book came very quickly as I requested but I definitely paid for it. However, the first 45 pages fell out as a chunk on day 2.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Been playing mtg since beta, and I love I can play on my tablet. Excited for the campaign, and the challenges are awesome
032147404X|5.0|This book is good, I think ... I am pretty sure that if I were better versed in the use of a camera which is obviously smarter than me, I would appreciate this book even more.  Reading this book would be greatly complimented if you were studying your camera manual and taking a class at the same time.  I am not disparaging this author, I love his \\"to the point\\" approach to helping the reader.  I simply think that I will enjoy it more in a second reading and that his approach will seem even better as I improve my understanding of the subject.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I chose to review with book with five stars because I felt like this book could be used in many different aspects of your life, not just the artistic side. There are plenty of ideas and questions that get your head wondering and blood pumping to start creating!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It really makes you think. It puts life in perspective. When I finished the book I had a whole new perspective on my life. It had that Mich of an impact. I recommend it to anyone who wants a meaningful and impractical book.
0071766588|5.0|The book is very good for toefl.....it gives you full length test....which are very good measure for you real toefl exam
B0019IIPZO|4.0|To be frank with anyone who wants to see this movie, don't go in expecting a complicated plot that raises moral questions about yourself, if you do that you'll probably hate this film. But if you like a fun Scifi horror movie with some intense action sequences , then Pitch Black is definitely the movie for you.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This is an excellent reference when you need to tie a particular knot and have forgotten how.  Very easy instructions.
B008MM9630|5.0|I'm really enjoying Fairy Farm. I've read the other reviews where people are saying they are unable to obtain crystals without purchasing them. I'm only on level 6 and I have 118 crystals.....none of them purchased. I'd recommend that you explore the different crops you can plant, and consider planting in pots instead of plots.<br /><br />The game has some interesting quests, not to difficult, but somewhat challenging. I really like that I don't have to be hooked into the web to sit down and play for a few minutes. Haven't really found anything negative about the game at this point....don't really ex p etc to. Oh, and I really like the music! Usually I turn the sound off as I find it to be annoying, but the game uses a blend of Celtic sounding tunes that is warm and comforting. An easy 5 stars, and I'll be looking to see if this company has other games on the market as well. All in all, as a free games it's awesome, as a &quot;purchase&quot; game, it's one I would have happily paid for.
B004DTLK62|5.0|I never had a clue that Chaplin had such a life.  Assuming it is all true, it was most interesting.  I enjoyed it very much.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|Absolutely love this game, awesome puzzle game, lots of puzzles.  It is worth 5 stars.  Unfortunately the &quot;you must be connected to the internet&quot; to use this app policy takes it down to 0 stars.  Not sure if this is the developer, amazon or both, but not everyone has an always on connection.  If you rely on Wi-Fi and aren't home when this message starts appearing, you're out of luck and can't play the game.  This is inexcusable!

0143122916|5.0|EVER GET THE URGE TO CHIP FROZEN POOP OUT OF AN OUTHOUSE? YOU CAN MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY AT CAMP 14! THE CAMP THAT REALLY DOESN'T EXIST ACCORDING TO N.K.! This book illustrates the evil that exists in North Korea under the Kim dynasty. There is no freedom and you are guilty if your relative is guilty. If your relative is guilty he is punished and you are punishesd for life. A mistake can cost you your life. You must snitch on anyone so that you can get food which is in most cases salted cabbage soup or pickled cabbage. The people in these camps are worked to death from a young age and tortured at the whim of the guards, even beat to death in front of classmates, if the the guard finds five corn kernels in your pocket that you stole because you were starving. The closest thing to a BBQ is roasting a rat on a shovel (don't knock it if you haven't tried it). By having sex with a guard you can get more food and a better job, but if you get pregnant you disappear and are never seen again, because you are secretly brutally murdered. Don't damage your sewing machine or you may be beat to death or you may be lucky and only loose a finger. You can take solace in the fact that the guards working in these camps and their families also have to live as prisoners because they or their families cannot, for the most part, leave the camp, but they do eat better and are educated slightly better and are not brutalized. Even on the outside of these electric fences there is brutality and starvation for the average person. You are not free to leave your town without being cleared to do so for good reason like a funeral or job. Electric is scarce as are all other necessities. I do recommend reading this book! It is a very interesting and enlightening page turner.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|This book is difficult to refute because it is the personal experience of Dr. Alexander who has top qualifications in neurosurgery and, because of his background would not simply make up anything like this. I have read attempts to refute it but they do not ring true. As a scientist Dr. Alexander cannot offer objective proof because his experience is cannot be physically measured or calculated. How do you describe the flavour of an orange? It is not only difficult to describe such a spiritual experience it is impossible. The best that can be done is along the lines of this book.<br />It is, perhaps, a bit short and I would have liked to have seen more. Because of the credentials behind it this book should not only be accepted as being a true, legitimate experience and any thinking person should consider what it says. Is it a proof of Heaven? I don't know whether Dr. Alexander went to Heaven but it is certainly proof of another dimension and a life after this. All life is the life of God and cannot die.

B00D6BQPMM|2.0|there is too much filler (and music as sweetener to the filler) to make this really worth seeing. yes, teresa palmer is cute, but not 98 minutes cute, not by at least 40 minutes ... and then there's the acting. many young actors, including palmer, seem to have gone through the same acting courses and learned the same lip bites, brow furrows, eye bulges, gasps, grins and quirky head tosses and side glances and intonations of a dialog line to communicate the stereotyped emotions that this very thin script calls for -- as the zombie voiceover does all the work of telling the story -- and it's not so much that teresa palmer is a blonde kristen stewart, it's that they use the same stereotyped facial acting repertory. but let's move on.<br /><br />after the long title sequence of zombie voiceover and feeble zombie predicament humor, julie (palmer) is \\"captured\\" by her lover zombie (some pucker mouth actor) at about 15 minutes in, and then there is a very long sequence of the two back in the zombie's lair (an old commercial aircraft at an abandoned airport), listening to records, playing games, bonding by driving a sportscar on runways during a break in the zombie voiceover (happy teen love music takes over in this part); then comes the long sequence where julie tries to get back to her fortress home (more filler, dream sequences, zombie voiceover alternating with music, etc.), then ... oh, i'm not going to spoil it for you, there's so much more zombie voiceover and musical filler yet to come.<br /><br />and besides, by this point i was getting up to make a sandwich and looking at the starry sky out on the deck and trying to decide, should i just bail on this, or come back in ten minutes, or skip to the end ... ? well, i didn't bail, so i can tell you there is a plot twist of sorts that builds just enough momentum -- *just* enough -- to push the movie through the last half hour, at least after the \\"balcony\\" scene (this is where the whole shakespeare angle clicked, julie and R, get it? ha ha, except that means her dead boyfriend killed by R would be tybalt, which would mean she was lip locking her cousin, eewww, that's creepy ... ).<br /><br />so look: if you love zombies, and zombie voiceover, and mildly cute young actresses, and young love, and you enjoy music, and that pretty much is all you want from a movie -- and if you're 18 or under, and like your shakespeare with a twist of zombie -- then you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />for the rest of us ... and you know who you are and who dragged you into watching this flimsy business ... just gut through the first hour of zombie voiceover and music filler and the rest won't be so boring -- but not by much, sad to say, not by much.

B0024SQW2Q|1.0|unless you are a diehard \\"underworld\\" fanboy, and you are under 18 years of age and don't have a driver's license to prove it ... don't do it. just back away from the preview and click away to something better.<br /><br />the acting here is straight out of the 19th century. it's the first film in which bill nighy actually flares his nostrils. and that's the *subtle* aspect of his acting. rhona mitra looks like kate beckinsale but punched in the mouth (or with rilly bad botox). the action sequences are toss offs and the plot was written with crayons. the sets are low budget dungeon and the supporting cast inconsequential. the computer graphics are actually not that convincing or creative. it's a breadcrumb movie, something shaken out of a cardboard can onto a slab of fishy meat.<br /><br />ask yourself: why isn't kate beckinsale in this thing? she launched the franchise, she's gorgeous, she's smart, why doesn't she ride this juggernaut to its triumphant prequel? maybe she smelled something fishy.

B000OXHRRC|3.0|We spent three weeks in France in April and May of this year, evenly split among Provence, the Dordogne and Paris.  I had hoped this film might have stirred some longing for a part of France that I very much enjoyed (although it is the Dordogne that I find incomparable).  My problem was, first, the sound quality...but perhaps that was just me, and the musical choices were unfathomable.  What was Ridley thinking?  The second problem, for me, was a dramatically clunky tennis match in the middle of the film.  It came out of and went, nowhere. (my wife disagrees with this assessment).  But the film is saved not by the Provencal scenery but by the wonderful women in the film, from the 12 year old to the 60 year old, all of them just a joy to look at.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is full of the drama, turns of plot and search for clues that are worthy of a great detective novel, but it is much more than just a great read; it is the true and touching story of a family caught in a web of medical intrigue. Rebecca Skloot deftly brings the reader into the lives of a poor, black family whose mother's deathbed tissue sample leads to the development of the most widespread cell cultures the world has ever known. From her demise in the early 1950s until this day, the unusual cancerous cells cut from the body of Henrietta Lacks have benefitted millions of people by helping in the discovery of treatments for diseases ranging from polio to AIDS, yet the family, unaware of this for decades, has never reaped any of the financial rewards that have come to the major drug companies and research labs. This book had me riveted to every page, experiencing every emotion from curiosity to anger, from laughter to tears. You'll not only enjoy this book...you'll learn from it.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|This directorial debut of Dustin Hoffman is just beautiful.  The cast is stellar.  The story takes place in a rest home for retired musicians who have not lost their love for their respective talents.  The music throughout the movie is wonderful and authentic. Singers, clarinet players, conductors, violinists fill the halls with their talents.  The gist of the story is that a former diva arrives at the home and the residents  rally around her to bring her into their world to encourage her to renew her talents for a special quartet from Rigaletto at the end of the film.  Touching, lovely, and satisfying are the feelings you will take away after watching this film.  Maggie Smith,and Billy Connelly are outstanding. Bravo, Dustin Hoffman.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The beginnings of the book we great I was interested I felt like the story was leading me someplace I wanted to go. Of course there were a few things that irked me small things mostly like if say a 15 year old girl in Brooklyn wearing sketchers! Girl please... Or the fact that this girl didn't seem very interested in learning how to protect herself in New York City. Which I guess was explained via what happened to her as a child but still... It wasn't good enough of a reason. But I overlooked these things and kept reading because it wasn't half bad. Until the last few chapters...everything that was building up was just thrown away for the sake of a really awful twist that wasn't needed. It was like Clare was watch a marathon of the worst Soap Opera plot devices and picked the weirdest most awful one to digest. I'll only buy the others if Wikipedia says this horrible plot twist was corrected and proven false.
B00E1LTEG0|2.0|The White Queen is a ten-part mini-series based on three novels from Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series: The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter. Unusually for this sort of series, the focus is less on the men and battles and more on the viewpoints and experiences of three women who played important roles in the period. These are Elizabeth Woodville, the minor noble who becomes Queen Consort (unusual in a time when the king usually marries European royalty or nobility); the pious Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII); and Anne Neville, the younger daughter of Richard Neville and the future wife of the notorious Richard III. Other women also play important secondary roles, such as Margaret of York (Henry VII's bride-to-be), Isabel Neville (Anne's older sister) and Jacquetta, Lady Rivers (Elizabeth Woodville's mother). This presents an interesting female perspective on a period of history traditionally dominated by accounts of battles and manly men strapping on armour.<br /><br />Or rather, it would if the series worked. The White Queen may be the very definition of 'inconsistent'. The series lurches from mediocrity to being outright terrible to having a couple of pretty decent episodes and then back again. It's certainly no Game of Thrones (the huge success of which is almost certainly responsible for this series being made; the Wars of the Roses were a major influence on George R.R. Martin's books) but it often struggles to even be The Tudors.<br /><br />On the plus side, the casting for the most part is good. The actresses playing the central three roles are all pretty good, though Amanda Hale's Margaret Beaufort has to cope with some pretty awful writing at times (her reaction to any crisis being to proclaim, \\"This is God's will!\\"), with Faye Marsay (Anne Neville) being one of the few actors to convincingly age in her performance as well as appearance over the course of the series. James Frain's scheming Earl of Warwick is excellent, with his political machinations occasionally being interrupted by Gordon Ramsay-style explosive losses of temper at his allies' incompetence or bad judgement. Rupert Graves schemes admirably as William, Lord Stanley in the latter half of the series (and should be signed up for Game of Thrones as soon as an appropriate role becomes available). Aneurin Barnard makes for a convincing Richard III, who is here played as a more tragic figure doomed by circumstance rather than a cartoon villain (despite developing a passing resemblance to Edward Scissorhands by the series finale). David Oakes (George, Duke of Clarence) may be getting typecast as 'gittish medieval noble bloke', having played this role before on Pillars of the Earth and The Borgias, but he plays it very well. The weakest link here is Max Irons, whose oafish and dull Edward IV is lacking the charisma of the real historical figure.<br /><br />The series is at its best when centred on a short time-period. The sixth through eighth episodes (covering the relatively peaceful period between the Battle of Tewkesbury and Edward IV's death) are the strongest, as they focus on political machinations, family relationships and the characters themselves. The ninth episode, which jumps forward to the rise of Richard III and the situation with the Princes in the Tower, is also decent. However, the first half of the series is deeply flawed. Dialogue is almost exclusively based on exposition, with people reeling off information as if from a Wikipedia entry in a vain effort to keep the viewer up to speed on what the heck is going on. Weeks and sometimes months pass between scenes with absolutely no indication of the passage of time and the compression of seven years of fairly intricate history into just five episodes (the remaining five cover fourteen years) turns out to be a really bad idea. People swap sides, often for no apparent reason, and there is a lack of depth to events. It feels like the dramabits of a good docu-drama, only without the context for what is happening (a familiarity with the Wars of the Roses - or just keeping the Wikipedia page open as you watch - is useful). These early episodes are kept alive only by the heroic efforts of James Frain and, to a lesser extent, our three leads.<br /><br />That said, the series finale is pretty diabolical. The lead-up to the Battle of Bosworth and the battle itself are compressed into one hour, leaving no time for the aftermath, some of which is deliciously ironic (particularly the taught relationships between Margaret Beaufort, Elizabeth Woodville and Maragret of York). The series has no real ending, just fading out after the battle without much reflection on what's happened. This feels anti-climactic and fails to put the series in its proper historical context for those who are not already knowledgeable about the time period. My co-watchers had no idea that Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort were the grandmothers of Henry VIII, for example, and not ending with an epilogue where Margaret sees her grandson being crowned (she died only after Henry VIII came to power) seems like a missed opportunity.<br /><br />In terms of historical accuracy, the series is surprisingly good in its first few episodes. It doesn't dial back the complexity of affairs too much, although a few minor characters like the Earl of Warwick's brother, are missing. As the series goes on, however, it deviates more and more from actual history. A few times it shows some good judgement - such as managing to maintain the ambiguity of the fate of the Princes in the Tower without sacrificing the drama - but more often than not it makes baffling choices. The showdown between Elizabeth Woodville's brother Antony, guarding her son and heir Edward V, and the soon-to-be Richard III is ripe stuff for television drama but the TV show simply removes it.<br /><br />However, the series ultimately has two major problems which moves it from 'watchable tosh' to 'barely watchable hokum' category. The first is that Jacquetta and her daughter Elizabeth are witches. I don't meant they are accused of being witches (as both were in real life), but they actually are witches. They use magic on multiple occasions to summon storms to smash enemy fleets or delay them from sailing and put curses on people that ultimately kill them or leave their children dead. For a series based on real historical events, this injection of pure fantasy is jaw-droppingly stupid. They don't even sell it particularly well, with the participants discussing their magic-using ways in letters and everyone around them being relaxed about it.<br /><br />Secondly, the show looks cheap. It may have been made for $25 million (that's about $39 million, or a bit more than half the budget of a season of Game of Thrones), but that's simply far too little to tell a story of this magnitude. The costumes are good (blatantly visible zips aside) but the bulk of the action takes place on a relatively small number of sets or on locations re-used a few too many times for supposedly different locations. The budget problem is most notable when it comes to the battles. The Wars of the Roses turned on a series of major battles at Towton, Barnet, Tewkesbury and Bosworth Field. Towton predates the start of the series, but the other three battles are fought during it and all of them are fake, unconvincing and so poorly-staged they might as well have not bothered. In particular, the decision to film both the Battle of Barnet and the Battle of Bosworth Field (and that's 'Field', remember) in the same forest (!) is truly moronic. Armies are shown marching in single file and then rushing towards one another with zero semblance of formation, tactics or strategy. The production team only seem to have about 15 extras available and no CGI budget (a couple of shots of ships aside, there doesn't seem to be any CGI at all in the series, which is baffling as it means they can't stage any big events convincingly), so the battles then unfold in extreme close-up with no continuity from shot to shot, making it almost impossible to follow what's going on. So as to avoid showing the fact they have no extras, the director also sticks the camera on the ground aiming up at people, which gets distracting quite quickly.<br /><br />Ultimately, you cannot tell the story of 20 years of the Wars of the Roses (and not even the full conflict) in just ten episodes. The pacing is shot to hell in the first half of the series, meaning most people won't stick around for the decent-ish episodes in the latter half. The budget is woefully inadequate for the scale and scope of the series, and the attempt to stretch it to cover everything leaves it looking cheap. The writing is often excruciating (though this also improves in the latter half). All of this undermines the work of some pretty good actors heroically tackling the iffy material.<br /><br />The White Queen (**½) has moments when it almost works, but these moments can't quite make up for the crushing mediocrity and outright incompetence of the rest of the series.

There are a lot of characters that I don't like but you see a different side to them, which you might not like either. I found myself liking Andrea less, a lot less. But it's the strength of the acting and plot that makes it seem believable and makes you have such strong feelings of love and hate for the characters. Can't wait for Season Four.

1560100842|5.0|When my brothers and I were boys, long ago, our Mother purchased many Foster publications<br />that guided our efforts to paint and draw, and then to animate. These books were cheap,<br />well laid out and easy to follow. At one count we owned 25 Foster art books.<br />The Preston Blair series on animation were my favorites.<br />I happily purchased Cartoon Animation collector's series on Amazon because it<br />is a valuable reference. In my animation library, this is the book of choice.<br /><br />There are many books designed to show animation beginners the way.<br />Many are pale imitations of this book, replete with characters that<br />look like anyone with little to no experience imagine they can draw.<br />And are authored by people who envision an additional revenue stream.<br /><br />If you were stranded on a tiny island with a heartfelt desire to learn<br />animation, and your only possessions were paper, pencils and this book, and if you<br />applied yourself, in time you would possess all you need to draw animated stories<br />with attention getting movement. Of course there is more to creating animation than<br />line movement. But the principles in this book are timeless and invaluable.<br /><br />Some reviewers here express dissatisfaction with Blair. I liken them to<br />the example of Bart Simpson, who, in an episode of the Simpsons, obtains an electric<br />guitar and within a minute or so, quits the guitar because he cannot wail on it like Otto.<br />You cannot skim through this book and automatically animate images.<br />Animation is labor intensive. It demands an eye, a gift of sorts, to draw forms that<br />move in compelling ways. Everyone cannot be an animator, regardless of what teachers said.<br />The truth is, you cannot always be anything you want to be- and excel.<br />But with application and imagination, you can be animating ably with Cartoon Animation by Blair.

B00C6B7GTE|4.0|Recently, I bought this 'steelbook' edition blu-ray of The Big Lebowski at a Moviestop store. I was happy to have this into my movie collection, as well as having a copy for my i-tunes/ i-pod. Unfortunately, after putting in the code from the case and signing up into two web accounts (Universal & Ultra-Violet) I get a copy alright. Just not exactly as most people think. The copy you actually get is only for viewing on the web. I tried numerous times to find links or maneuvers to download the copy for my i-pod. I felt cheated. The blu-ray, however, works great, and the movie is also fantastic. I just wish the company who offers a digital copy of the film, actually *is* a copy. Not something that's semi-obtainable.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used Evernote for at least two years now, and I'm still in love with it. Whether I'm taking notes for class or just making a quick list, this program makes my life easier. Everything is in one place and I don't have to hunt for a specific thing because it is placed in a Notebook of my choosing. Yay for Evernote!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you've already plowed thru the 4,000 pages of books 1-4, you know you're gonna read 5, and 6, and 7, and however many it takes to the end. The story continues. Indefinitely.<br /><br />About the only thing that will make me give up is if the delay between books just drags on. The maybe I'll wait 20 years and re-read the whole thing from the library.
B006DX4PRC|5.0|This movie is fantastic!!! It is a great romantic comedy with an excellent cast and a great story line.  I would recommend it to anyone!!!!!

B005H9B44A|4.0|Action! Adventure! Aliens! Beautiful (rawrr!) women! And a pretty damn cool story! Thank goodness Marvel got movie rights and their own studio to do their (Stan's!) properties the way they shoulda been done the first time around (i.e. the ones they didn't do exclusively the first go round). Hemsworth is a fine God of Thunder. I know we as movie audiences take the special effects for granted these days. We (I'm guilty too) enter the theater at the latest sci-fi/fantasy/sci-fi fantasy, or whatever, blockbuster, sit down and more or less say &#34;K, I'm here. Let's see you wow me.&#34; Looked pretty good to me. Asgaard, as well as its surrounding environs looked incredible, the colors, sparklies and textures gorgeous. The god costumes were breath taking (damn, Heimdahl was near hypnotic).  They were obviously Nordic, but there was that Marvel jolt of sci-fi/fantasy too. The Jotun side was nasty and beastly looking, so were they! Natalie Portman was, of course, delicious, strong, and vulnerable in just the right amounts. And takes Jane in a new direction as a top scientist. The entire cast was really spot on and I really enjoyed all the portrayals. Just didn't get to see enough Kat Dennings!

B003E8P9G0|5.0|I absolutely love this book. A friend was reading it on the bus and I read it over his shoulder. I was hooked from the first page. I have read every single mythology based book of Rick Riordans. Love it. I recommend this to kids 9-13
B004QX07G4|3.0|I found this work to be entertaining though predictable.  Hardcore Ellen fans will love it. The humor wanes through repetition by the middle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Fast paced, good plot. It makes a very good pleasure read. I loved it very much.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|A lifetime resource manual.  Great for those who desire a deeper understanding of HOW Spirituality works in our lives as well as those who are metaphysically experienced.  Provides a solid foundation for Spiritual practice.  This work links the core of ALL religious values.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the book very much so. I think there should be more detail towards the beginning. I'd recommend it to anyone mature enough to read about evil presidents and morbid deaths. Trust me... it's not like every death is played out full. I just mean someone able to understand the plot.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I returned the 3D Blu-Ray movie Life of Pi because I was told that the movie would ruin the book for me and the book is always better.  Reading the book was definitely worth it.  Now, it's time to watch the 3D Blu-Ray!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I did like the book, but I found the details kind of... out there. Compared to the other books, it was mediocre. I rated it 4 stars because you really should read the last book. It completes the series.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is a fun book although it is a little bit akward and mysterious . The first time I read it  I really liked it
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I use this for my Canon 500D with a Tamron 18-270mm lens on it combined with a small external canon flash.  This case is perfect, and for my trips to the zoo, it protects the camera so that is doesn't pick up scratches or damage in the back of my car.  The previous case that I had wasn't quite long enough, and as a result became torn as the Tamron lens is pretty long.  I can cover just about any situation with this holster.  It can't carry multiple lenses, but I have a TAMRAC backpack for that, this is good when I want to carry one lense, and extra memory card and the external flash.  I thought it would feel cheap, the case that I got from the camera in Singapore felt cheap but this nylon feels stronger, and I like that it was adjustable.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Was entertaining and suspenseful. Anyone interested in science fiction will like this movie. Watch the preview if you are not sure you want to purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game..loved the way it made me really think about how each new object or clue interacted with each other or parts of the room to ed enable me to escape...wish it were longer, lol... I'm sure you'll enjoy. I can't wait for the updates
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is great for kids, my daughters both read it and loved it.  I recommend this book to anyone with a child.

B009VA1FN6|3.0|I chose this book as it came up as a recommendation from kindle.<br />I enjoyed it very much and although a little slow to start became a wonderful intriguingly plot with an unexpected but satisfying ending.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Joe Nesbo's character, Harry Hole, comes back to Norway. His stepson, Oleg, is accused of murdering his best friend, Gusto.  Both are drug addicts.  Harry naturally wants to prove him innocent even though the evidence is stacked against Oleg.  Nesbo does a great  job of weaving a fascinating story as Harry unravels the mystery.  Harry is a fascinating character - recovering alcoholic and intense detective.  I only wish I had read all of the Harry Hole books in the order which they were written because sometimes Nesbo makes references to events that took place in prior books that I wish I understood.
B0068THAGY|5.0|When I first saw previews for the movie I wasn't quite sure if I would like it. But when I watched it, it was absolutely amazing!!! Best movie I've seen in a while.
B0026S1XDM|4.0|Listen to this all the time, Mike Oldfield knows how to pump out a tune.  It's favourite listening in the car.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written and thoughtful. Expect many tugs on your heart. This book looks at the best and worst of people, but is real and a nice ending.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is actually an app used by my daughters, since I am completely inept at all computer games.  They find it extremely amusing, even at ages 11 and 14.  No sex or violence--just cutting up fruit.  Very cute app.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app will not allow me to browse any other videos now tht are downloaded from other apps and it will not let me watch videos online. Do not get unless u plan to use nothing but it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|well written book with some twists and psychology. I will not forget this book. It hangs on to me like Defending Jacob does and reminds me of it
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|It might be a nice app but I can't figure out how to use it.  It comes on and just sits there.  All I can control is the volume.  How does it work in connection with my music collection?  Very aggravating!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book, written generations ago by Betty Smith, is a classic, in my opinion.  It is beautifully written and tells the story of Francie Nolan in such a compelling way that the reader wants the story to continue forever!  Ms. Smith paints a sad, but probably realistic story of life in the early 1900's in Brooklyn, NY, with so much poverty and hard work among the people there, as the U.S. struggled with pre-World War I issues.  This is the story of one young girl's determination to rise above the poverty which has afflicted her family and emphasizes her strength, courage and the power of education and literacy.  I highly recommend the book as a good story and a window on life in urban America a hundred years ago.
B008602KQI|5.0|From all the hype I wasn't sure what to expect but it exceeded my expectations and I really enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton abbey is amazing!! I've watched the entire 3 seasons twice and can hardly wait for the next.  I have nothing else to say.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Did you miss any of the episodes on tv? This is better than seeing in on t.v. No commercials. Love it!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|It is kinda sad really - this was really the last GOOD space (based) show of its day - now we have aliens invading earth - and ground wars - yuck....<br /><br />- weak<br /><br />As a TNG fan  - this off shoot of StarGate SG-1, really took it to the level that many of us craved for - space based adventure....<br /><br />But not like StarGate Universe - nothing isolated -<br /><br />And New Battle Star Galactica?  Had a hard time with it - I guess mainly because 1980 was my base there - if not called Galactica - I may have liked it more good acting-<br /><br />Stick to the basics -<br /><br />Explore and meet new races, creatures etc - space ship fight scenes!<br /><br />That is why Firefly was so popular - they were exploring!<br /><br />Join the Atlantis Team as they explore another Galaxy, and battle to keep your neck up!<br /><br />All in all one of the best shows for this subject matter - you may miss a reference to somethings if you have not seen SG-1  -<br /><br />So if you have an open mind and like a space based story this is for you.<br /><br />Sure hope we see something soon that works for a space based genera - remember Babylon 5? look it up!<br /><br />*Like*<br />Robotech......<br />*Like*
B003VIWZNS|5.0|I did expect it to be a better movie than what it was, but it does show the true ways of the backwoods.

B0038Z5SEW|5.0|I saw this years ago when it came out.  Purchased the dvd and have watched it dozens of times over the years.  It is truly an amazing film.<br /><br />This is one of those masterpieces that is about *everything* in life.  Man vs. Man, himself, nature, everything.  Just an amazing tale of fortitude, perseverance, trust, perception, wealth, beauty, primal instinct....  I'd have to say that if you can't find something to relate to in this movie then you just need to give it some time and come back at a later date and watch it.  It's got lessons and observations in human behavior for everyone.  And if you're not into the human element, then just enjoy the absolutely gorgeous scenery.<br /><br />This is probably the most underrated movie I can think of.  I have loved it since day one.  Everytime I watch it I get all into it and get something from it with each viewing.  A true masterpiece.  Definitely in my top 5 faves of all time.<br /><br />Currently cheaper on walmart . com
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Some good dialogue but depressing and implausible story.  Had a hard time even getting through the audio book.  Can't understand all of the positive reviews
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This is a classic and touching movie. I think that leaders the world over<br />should watch this with their heart and stop the violence that dominates their lives.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Exactly as advertised.  Just what I needed to shoot star shots I was wanting to try.  No lag like the wireless remote release I have.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun. Addictive whether you love slots or bingo. Hours of fun collecting tokens,coins, and completing locations. You have to try it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Ok, so I've come to love almost all of G5' s games. And this one is just as good as the rest.
0553386697|5.0|I loved this book. As a school counselor, and as a parent, I highly recommend it. This book offers practical ways to enter into tough parenting moments. There isn't always an immediate change in the moment, but over time, it does seem to be impacting my relationship with my kids.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|Apparently the producers felt that making the ponies into humans for this film was a great idea.  I don't agree.  The pony population is what makes this series fun, and not just for children.  Why would you make changes to a successful formula?
0802473156|5.0|This book is great for newly weds. I read it before getting married and it makes you conscious of how to love your spouse. Also, this seller was great and a speedy shipment
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the presleep tones.  Headphones are a must! This app has a lot of variety, something for everyone. Great price.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This is more of a documentary than a story.  I like a story with a strong hero, dark heros are good, or heroines.  This book had none of that and that made it hard to read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|extremely inspirational.  ignore the negative reviews the press gave this book, if you're a working woman (or married to a working woman, or have a working daughter), just read it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to play but takes a while to win diamonds back and energy but it is very fun I recommend to other people who love horses
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is a very good game the graphics are excellent and the formmat is understandable.and is easy to use I highly recommend it for all game lover
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was so good. I wanted to read it from start to finish without stopping!  Looking forward to reading the next one.
0804164223|5.0|This writer is excellent,and I have read 2 of her other selections from Amazon.com,and they are terrific.Dark Places starts off with excitement,and builds your attention from that point.Anyone who enjoys the written word that can take you to emotions, tender and terrifying,and does it in a way that pulls from thoughts of fear,and reward.Excellent choice for one who enjoys a good read.
1451695195|5.0|Although I know about reincarnation and that the soul/spirit never dies, the journey Dr. Alexander took was a one of a kind read.<br />Most people have his former self mentality about death and the soul, so his perspective was a refreshing insight from one who<br />was in denial that the &#34;other side&#34; ever exists at all.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This was another fabulous acting of Meryl Streep,and captured the Prime Minister of England very well.It is a movie worth seeing.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The rivalry between the two magicians is fantastic. It keeps the tension and action riveting, sometimes brutal and sometimes comical. It is also a pretty good example of the movie being more compelling than the book.<br /><br />Great movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very good movie that should be seen by everyone.I liked all the mini-plots that went on,all through the movie.Very entertaining
B00CX7TOOG|3.0|De Niro and Travolta make this movie work, along with the rugged landscape and the one-on-one war between them.<br /><br />This is a revenge movie, turned hunter and the hunted, and kill-or-be-killed. De Niro and Travolta hunt each other in the mountains, setting traps and stalking each other in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart. In one scene a steel rod is pierced through De Niro's open wound and he is hung upside down by it. But there is some exciting scenes too, real pulse-pounders, as one could only imagine what it would be like to be hunted by a trained killer in the mountain fog.<br /><br />This movie definitely gets the blood pumping and it's worth a look if you are either a De Niro or Travolta fan or both.<br /><br />Enjoy
0142429414|5.0|I ordered this for my son because he was making a long trip by auto,and he loves CD books when he drives.He said it was good,and that he really thought it was read well.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I had heard Tenant interviewed about this show, so I had built up anticipation, and it delivered because of realistic, flawed characters, a great context, and beautiful cinematography. I agree with Tenant's notion that the slow build over several episodes is more watchable and engaging than the tidy 45 minute solution of many crime series.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|This movie was sort of a bit of craziness.I did not enjoy it but my son said that it was OK in a &#34;nonsense&#34;sort of way.I would not watch it again,and I donated it to the public library!
B002KGEORM|5.0|Best show on TV Internet anywhere. All small towns in the United States should have this kind a love for their own.
0307943259|5.0|This is a book on CDs that I ordered for my son for his long auto trip.I was afraid that it would not arrive in time,but it arrived prior to his leaving.He said it was great in the car and made the trip very short because John Grisham's books always keep you in suspense!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|It starts off easy and then gets more challenging and I enjoy the time I spend playing this game.  There are some puzzles that I wish had clues but then that's the fun of it
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Good portrayal of J.EDGAR HOOVER.I ordered this for my son,and it arrived prior to his visit.There was a lot in the movie that was accurate,and I thought it was a good movie.It came packaged well,for the mail.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|It loads quickly and is as much fun to play on my Kindle as it is on my computer.  I love it:) and play for way too many hours
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Not a cheerful topic, and yet, this novel is fresh, powerful and hopeful. Not a traditional YA romance, but so much more. The non-sentimentality of the voice makes the emotions even truer, deeper and more moving.<br /><br />Almost every teenager thinks about death in some form or another. This story opens up the world of life and death and the fine balance between them: the loss, the pain, the longing and the will to never let go,<br /><br />But this story is told from the perspective of the girl who is balancing on the edge of death, deciding which way she wants to go: to die or to fight for her life and all the terrible ramifications of overcoming the obstacles of life after a devastating accident. And as we follow her awareness, her thoughts and memories that she uses to decide this balance,  we view her life from her own perspective as a loved one lost and a loved one who may yet be saved.<br /><br />Like going to your own funeral and vicariously seeing who shows up and what they say. But this is no joke: her decision to live or die will determine her fate and that of all those who stand to lose her.<br /><br />Excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This games is good although I wish I could regulate the speed of the runners as I would slow them down a bit

B0086700CM|5.0|I'm getting better at this game and I enjoy it.  I wish you could slow down the run for us old folks
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I was really not overly enthusiastic to see this film, but after seeing it on cable, I bought the blu-ray.  The quality of the transfer is excellent...  it's one of the best-looking discs I've ever seen.  On a decent modern television, there are literally scenes that look almost three dimensional.<br /><br />The film itself is a hoot.  Johnny Depp turns in yet another excellent performance.  Anyone who's even passingly familiar with the 1970s will howl with laughter at some of the sly humor in the film.  And though I didn't watch the original series way back when, what research I've done seems to indicate that the film doesn't stray all that far from the basics of that series.  Also, the use of classic 70s songs (you'll love how they used the Carpenters' &#34;Top of the World&#34;) must have cost the filmmakers a pretty penny, but I loved how they used the music to dovetail with the story.<br /><br />I can see how everyone might not love this movie, but I did.
B00005J6T0|5.0|With the radio and MTV exposure she earned from her first two albums [[ASIN:B00005J6T1 Madonna]] and [[ASIN:B00005J6SZ Like a Virgin]],Madonna somehow built on the reputation that unlike the other two major pop music stars of that era Prince and to a lesser extent Michael Jackson,she was something of a singles act. One gets the impression that a lot of young Madonna admirers of the time went after her 45's and 12\\" singles rather than her albums-either for the songs or the longer mixes for dancing. From a strictly musical perspective it was clear that Madonna was actually a very gifted artist-with her trademark bold and daring lyricism along with a very stylish and often elegant melodic sensibility. This would be the source of her commercial success. But how could she change her image from a singles artist to an artist capable of more than quality singles? The answer was the first image change she would have in her career: from a junk jewelry-clad Greenwich Village new waver to a polished up blond chanteuse. What she did musically with her third album was equally as compelling.<br /><br />  \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" starts out the album-her most brooding and potently orchestrated song to date musically. It was the song that generated the most controversy as it advocated and praised single motherhood at the height of Reaganomics.  \\"Open Your Heart\\" and the non hit \\"Where's The Party\\" are both equally strong and highly polished songs that epitomize mid 80's dance/pop: light funk backdrop,almost a drone of synth bass and high pitched synthesizer arrangements. \\"White Heat\\" is a very neglected song here-a pseudo-girlish type number with Madonna's first known use of sampling with snippets of dialog from James Cagney and a similar dance/pop sound. \\"Live To Tell\\" is the first song I heard from this and it's one of my favorites here. It has a very intense,spare cinematic dance/soul ballad arrangement and her most mature romantic lyric to date. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is my favorite song from this album-with a strong Mexican pop/Spanish guitar flavor and an entrancing melody to match its sensual lyric. The title updates ideas found on \\"I Know\\" from her debut into a much stronger variation of the modern girl group type song.<br /><br />  \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is what at this point a somewhat retro song: a rigid electro/new wave synth rocker with more of a flavor of 1982 than 86. \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" is an upbeat dance/pop number with a very 60's/70's era message: rather than us unifying being all the same, this says we might be better \\"walking a mile in someone elses shows\\" and champion difference instead-which of course is far more a challenge of human nature. What's interested about the bonus mixes are what's extended: the title songs shuffling beat is extended and reverbed while the percussion of \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is singled out and emphasized. Overall this album has a more adult outlook-both musically and lyrically. Most of the songs speak of growth processes in different ways-sometimes with a few growing pains,especially in the romantic department. One appealing aspect of it is how Madonna's singing has matured. On most of these songs,she dips down into the lowest bass end of her vocal range and scales more dramatically. Commercially this album was the expected payoff of course-garnering several huge singles and MTV videos. Artistically this album showcased Madonna's musical maturation into someone with the potential to be a critics darling one day.rom this album-with a strong Mexican pop/Spanish guitar flavor and an entrancing melody to match its sensual lyric.

B00992CF6W|3.0|This is the first minecraft edition that I ever owned. I have been playing minecraft for about 2 years now, and I tell you guys if you want to become a minecrafter I suggest you get this version because it is the simplest, but the worst one too. Minecraft pocket edition DOES NOT have minecarts, villages, caves, spider jockeys, more help and options, and no tutorial. Also I have this game on my kindle fire and for some reason other devices (including other kindles) can not connect on my worlds. Mojang, if you are reading this, fix this bug and I will give you another star. If you want another star from me, add more stuff to it and live up to your product description and &quot;update continuously.&quot; Other than that, I highly recommend this game to beginning minecrafters. It is a sandbox game where you can build anything (well... this is the worst edition) and your imagination is almost your only limit, but if I where you I would build some kind of shelter ASAP because monsters come out at night. Again, this game I would highly recommend for beginners.

B000FCKRDI|4.0|This book had the best hero of the 4 books in the series.  Sebastian was a perfectly flawed hero with all kinds of issues.  I actually read the whole series based on the reviews of this book alone.  You have to read the series if you want to read this book.  These books would not stand alone.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|\\"Elysium\\" is a classic story being told in a not entirely new fashion. It's the classic story of power overwhelming the powerless; those with money and opportunity monopolizing that opportunity and leaving those without to squander through their existences. Much of \\"Elysium\\" rings true today and since this film is set 140-years from now, its realism and possibility aren't beyond belief. Earth's natural resources have dried up and so the haves, or the hugely wealthy, built a space station called \\"Elysium\\" and left the rest behind. Max DeCosta (Damon) is a typical blue-collar worker whos circumstances send him through a fast and faster escalating series of life changing events.<br /><br />Everything about \\"Elysium\\" is well done, all the way down to the casting of two children who look exactly like Damon's character and Frey (Alice Braga), Max's childhood friend. The story is constantly changing and engrossing. It was quite simply the fastest 109 minutes I have spent at the movies in a long time. Your heart is invested in the characters and the ruthlessness and power of the bad guys gives you a constant feeling of danger and overwhelming odds; just as a movie like this should.<br /><br />It isn't a deal breaker, but like \\"Oblivion\\" and many other movies that have come out in recent years or months, \\"Elysium\\" is a collage of many movies that have come before; \\"Johnny Mneumonic\\", \\"Robo Cop\\", \\"In Time\\" and \\"Mad Max\\", with a heavy emphasis on \\"Johnny Mneumonic\\". Despite this though, the movie has legitimacy about it and all of its elements are well thought out. This adds to the beauty of the film and it is beautiful. From the personalities that it explores to the plite, \\"Elysium\\" is a power film.<br /><br />Other than some overzealous shaky camera moments that I continue to hate in every movie I see them, \\"Elysium\\" is more satisfying than all of the superhero movies that came out his summer put together. I understand the art form that is shaky camera, but to have the camera shaking to the extent that you actually think about what the cameraman is doing to make it shake so much, it is bad. \\"Elysium\\", despite this, is the kind of movies that we all should be going to see. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to be making more of because it sticks with you and doesn't leave you with the constant unsatisfied feeling you get from the superhero movies.a shaking to the extent that you actually think about what the cameraman is doing to make it shake so much, it is bad. \\"Elysium\\", despite this, is the kind of movies that we all should be going to see.

140053271X|1.0|Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.<br /><br />Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app was great before the upgrade. I hate the appearance and the navigation is frustrating. I will be deleting this app.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|This product is fantastic! This is my second Mobee device. The first one was for my Apple wireless keyboard. It did not work. After reading up on it, it only worked with the second generation keyboard. I happened to have the apple wireless track pad and it worked in that, so I am pleased. The Magic charger, installed easily and fit like a glove in the mouse. It is so handy and my mouse is always charged and ready to work!
B003ELKNH2|5.0|I enjoyed this move back in the day when it first came out, ordered it to reflect of the ole days of Vietnam era.<br />Lightening fast shipping, DVD in very good shape as promised, couldn't be happier.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What in the world kind of ending was that?? It wasn't even climatic....just a boring,hum drum ending. I just don't get it. The second book had a lot of story that kept you on the edge of your seat....this third book was alright, and practically down right boring. I kept thinking something crazy tragic was going to happen.,but it never did.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was an excellent game, kept me very entertained and made my brain feel worked.  I wish it had been longer though.  Really wanted to keep cracking the codes.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I love this movie because its not your typical movie and not everything you would expect happens. Great acting and not sugar sweet the whole way through but leaves you feeling good. One of my favorites.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Season 3 is still good but not nearly as good as the first 2 seasons.<br /><br />I need five more words.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet you are totally missing out! It's a heart-warming movie with a great message. We could all learn something about taking better care of our planet from Wall-E. I highly recommend to anyone.
1594484805|2.0|I have read other things by this author and enjoyed them, however this book was not a good fit for me.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|I quite enjoy digital jigsaws and like the way this functions. Many of the abstract and tile-inspired images are lovely, but there are far too many hearts and butterflies in other pictures for my taste. I hope a later iteration of this app is more sophisticated.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I loved this movie and purchased this film for a class. I know they will love it like I did.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Spell binding, action packed, very difficult to put the book down. Great, great, fantastic, very hard to find words to describe how good.
B00BHO70L0|3.0|1st off I won't warn anyone about the language thing as it is clearly states it. So regarding the film itself and the bonus stuff you get is pretty standard fare. The transfer is decent but the movie it's self seems like it was rushed, it's full of plot holes and to me very short and not as exciting as the previous 2 films. I'm a 3rd gen JA and I only buy Japanese releases for Japanese films etc as I collect them. So I can't compare them with western versions of the film but I assume their the same in clarity etc. I also don't buy imports off of Amazon US. I use Amazon JP or other direct from Jpn E-stores and or retail stores for my Japanese stuff. Too many fakes and stuff here in the US or they charge way too much.<br /><br />I also collect firearms and would never buy serious things like optics Eotech and Aimpoint in fact some reps actually said Amazon was one of the tops in counterfeit Red dot sights and you would get no warranty etc. So like those type items on Amazon this goes for movies and music or anything for that matter. Too many fakes or counterfeits. So be ware people there already are bootleg<br />DVD's of this film for sale on here. Why Amazon doesn't clam down on these bogus sellers? I don't know but they should.<br /><br />Anyway pardon the little detour but again this film is ok but I wish they would redo it and knowing these anime guys they love to do redo's as again it feels rushed, kinda short and I really hope the last film in the series is better than this one. Imho this one is the 1st bad apple in the series yet. This 3rd film feels like a rush job. So if your not a collector just get the standard version or wait for the US release as its kinda pricy here I got my copies (I always buy 2 if their collector sets) for $20 cheaper.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I was glad to find a game like this for the kindle. It is an addicting game and leaves me satisfied enough, though you may need money to buy better gear if hi does my want to grind on the same level for money.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|My understanding, from the very limited description I saw on my Kindle Fire, was that this app was supposed to allow me to download YouTube videos so I could watch them when offline.  I tried it with one video that was about 22 minutes long, and...nothing.  Maybe I misunderstood?  I wanted to store this video on my Fire HD and be able to watch all 22 minutes without endless buffering, but it hasn't happened yet.  Unless and until they make this a better app, or explain more fully what it's supposed to be doing, don't waste your money!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I started following Eureka during the 4th Season.  It was great but I often wondered about the time line differences that had occurred during the previous Seasons.  It was great when I got Amazon with free streaming.  I was able to go back to the beginning and see how everything came together.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies has been my favorite since the beginning. I love the stars and the action. I am into season three now. I have my son in law watching it and I would recommend it to anyone that loves to watch alien shows. You never know what could happen in the future. The only thing I did not like about this series is the children getting harnessed. They were supposed to have come in peace. Hah!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is maybe my favorite Bond movie. We all have our memories and are loyal to other Bond flicks. Skyfall is a grand slam. It pays homage to Bond history, has a great villian (Bardem could have been nominated for an Oscar), and Craig is one cool dude. See it in Blu-ray.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|This device has a very watered down app that you cannot configure OR change your goals. Support said it 'may' appear in a future update. Also, it only measures ACTIVE calories, not calories burned at rest. I sleep 8 hours the first night, with the Pulse in sleep mode, and awoke to see I had burned 23 calories. Support has said this is the way they intended it. It has a lot of trouble syncing. It takes numerous attempts to sync AND it doesn't sync on its own, you have to manually sync it to the app. Pretty horrid device that is half-baked and should remain in beta for another few months.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Built very solid, sharpens different types of blades, great value, convenient small size takes up little space in the bag.
0449011909|5.0|I highly recommend this book. The plot twist and mind blowing changes keep you guessing. Roy Doltrice does an amazing job creating his voice characters. It maybe the child in me, but I love having books read to me, especially on long drives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thank you for such a wonderful production. I am just loving it...although having trouble streaming to my Roku 3..<br />Have tried to work things out...still having trouble.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|the movie was too gory, and there was graphic violence throughout the whole movie.  The movie should not be watch if you are under 17 years old
B004FV1ESW|3.0|In spite of the totally not believable love story that's so out of place in this gritty crime drama, it's a pretty good film for those who enjoy a 'crime-gone-wrong' story. Don't expect a great ending, because there isn't one. I had hoped for more realism, considering the nature of the film. The robbery scenes are extremely chaotic and violent, as they should be. Most of the 'bad guys' get their just desserts. I would recommend this movie to those who like the genre, but don't expect perfection. It just isn't there. OT note: why does Hollywood cast five-foot-two actors to play the baddest guys on the streets?
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I really like the show and the acting is superb.  The show also reiterates many myths and legends that have been around for many centuries
B001C46P2K|5.0|I have seen many a love story in my day, but this is the most beautiful of them all. I love that there was some comic relief, as so may period pieces are dark and dismal. One of my favorite scenes was the one where the Prince was making a decision for the Queen, publicly, as she stood by quietly, and horrified. Her anger was displayed later, only in the privacy of their bedroom, where she reminded him that she was the Queen, and in no uncertain terms, she was HIS Queen. His reaction to her outburst was perfect, just as one would expect from a husband in love with his wife. The entire film was so well crafted, and so believable, that I didn't care if it was historically correct or not. Some of the scenes evoke such emotion, that anyone watching should have a tissue or two nearby.
B00821PCJS|3.0|entertaining but jumps around a lot - tough to follow the story at times. solid acting from most of the group.
B0095R64AO|3.0|I was thinking it would be better based on the cast.  It was not funny and dragged on forever.  Nice background movie if you are doing something else.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At first, I had some trepidation about buying a mouse from a brand I knew nothing of. But since I did not want to spend a lot on a Razer mouse and wanted more functionality than what a standard 3 button mouse offers, I decided to try the Anker. And after owning it for almost a month, I can say that this is a quality product for the money (around forty dollars at the time of writing).<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Easy to use drivers<br />* Quality materials: gold-plated USB connector and braided cable<br />* Adjustable DPI settings and two switchable profiles (can use buttons on the mouse to switch both on the fly)<br />* The two switchable profiles with programmed keys remains in the mouse's flash memory so you can switch to other computers and keep your settings<br />* Weight cartridges make the mouse feel solid in hand<br />* The lights on it are a nice touch<br />* Ergonomic feel for right handed individuals<br />* Customer service seems good (see below)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Does not go below 1000 dpi with current drivers<br />* You can only change the color of the logo; scroll wheel and DPI lights stay blue<br />* I believe UtechSmart offers an almost identical mouse at a lower price, but that might not be Anker's fault<br /><br />Also, I got an email from Sunnie from their Customer Satisfaction Team, and I was informed that Anker offers an 18 month warranty on their products, and to contact them with whatever concerns or thoughts I had on the product. That was a nice touch by the company.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept you interest from first page to last.  I highly recommend to anyone interested in mind bending mystery and adventure.
140006922X|5.0|This is a terrific book, so packed with information that it’s hard to know where to begin in writing a review. I have worn out two highlighters marking passages I want to go back and reread again and again. Reza Aslan writes beautifully!!<br /><br />Aslan started out in his introduction by stating, “If we expose the claims of the gospels to the heat of historical analysis, we can purge the scriptures of their literary and theological flourishes and forge a far more accurate picture of the Jesus of history…. The Jesus that is uncovered in the process may not be the Jesus we expect; he certainly will not be the Jesus that most modern Christians would recognize. But in the end, he is the only Jesus that we can access by historical means…. Everything else is a matter of faith.”<br /><br />The earliest biblical stories about Jesus were written around 50 A.D.by Paul. The first gospel – Mark – wasn’t written until about 70 A.D., while Matthew and Luke came even later, around the turn of the second century. So much of Christian theology comes from Paul. Aslan writes on page 215:  ”Even the gospels were deeply influenced by Paul’s letters. One can trace the shadow of Pauline theology in Mark and Matthew. But it is in the gospel of Luke, written by one of Paul’s devoted disciples, that one can see the dominance of Paul’s views, while the gospel of John is little more than Pauline theology in narrative form…. Two thousand years later, the Christ of Paul’s creation has utterly subsumed the Jesus of history….”<br /><br />The author covers the full gamut of Christian doctrines. He touches on the stories that circulated early on about the virgin birth, Jesus’ place of birth (despite the biblical story, it was NOT Bethlehem), what his lifestyle as a Jewish man would have been like prior to his baptism by John, his ministry, death and  resurrection. I don't recommend this book If you are a biblical fundamentalist Christian; it would only make you angry. But if you’re looking for the historical Jesus behind the magic and made-up stories, this is a worthwhile read! I heartily recommend this book to those with an open mind. It is chalk full of information and  is very readable!<br /><br />I love the last few lines of the book (page 216): “…. Jesus the man – is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.” May I say AMEN to that!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was worried it was going to be a porno but it turned into a love story that I had very sexy sex scenes.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Not my favorite McEwan novel. Many of the characters who populate his novels have a scientific background. I think of the doctor in SATURDAY. Being a doctor served a real purpose in terms of the action of that novel. Here, our heroine being semi-good at math seems just one more way she is not quite good enough. Maybe it was placing the action in the 1970s when women were just breaking through the glass ceiling. Serena seems to me to be used throughout, fully taken advantage of both by her mentor, fellow spies, spy masters, etc. The whole issue of literature vs. propaganda seems to be there but what are we to make of it?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Sexy with a great story line! Not &#34;just a porno&#34; but a great romantic story with humor as well! X
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|there needs to be a warning label..or minus any star..for a movie thiS bad!the cast was A+,story was not great but the movie was extremely terrible...I kept watching it only to see if it got better due to the cast!but sadly,it was just torture...really bad!so,for anyone who is so bored and figures..'ah,good cast,story seems interesting.lets try it'...do not waste your money time and mind trying to process this garbage!

1439170916|5.0|\\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" (EM)is an excellent book but a difficult one to read.  Difficult for several reasons.  It deals with cancer and death, it involves a lot of complex science issues, it is rife with small victories and major setbacks, and it is 470 pages long.  But despite all the challenges of the subject matter, the author, Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, provides just the right balance of anecdotes, personal experience, scientific theory, and milestone events to keep the reader engaged, looking for the next tidbit of good news that is sprinkled throughout the book.  Dr. Mukherjee writes very well, very precisely, and wisely labeled his story a biography rather than a history.  Though the book maintains a chronological storyline, it never gets caught up in an abundance of names and dates.  Rather it moves seemlessly through the major transitions in the battle against cancer from radical surgeries to magical elixirs to seeking the magic bullet that will cure all cancers.  To chemotherapy to radiation to adjuvant combination therapy, with a parallel emphasis on prevention to improved screening to research on the cancer genome.  Along the journey we learn of statistical measures for the determination of success and failure.  And the key questions - Are we making progress? and What does the future hold? are addressed in great detail.  I struggled with the last 80 pages or so with the emphasis on gene theory, but I understood what I read,perhaps not as deeply as I would have liked. Most importantly,  I came awy from the experience of this book with a great respect and deep gratitude for the people who have devoted their lives to improving our mortality.  Note that I did not say \\"to finding the cure\\".  You will have to read the book to understand why.  Five stars !
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I just got my iMac 27&#34; in April of this year and had never tried the thunderbolt experience. I purchased this adapter along with the WD My Book Studio 3 TB Firewire 800 External Hard Drive and after doing a speed test on the drive in comparison with my internal drive, I was really impressed with how quickly the Thunderbolt adapter transfers data! And comparing the speed to regular 2.0 usb is like the old Rabbit and the Turtle race! When your editing large amounts of data this is definitely a must have for Mac users.

0061729078|5.0|To read it, is to find not only a gateway into the rich history of psy-lit but to also hear the words of one of last century’s greatest writers.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|like it because it is fairly fast paced and quite enjoyable to play. The only thing I don't like is how fast it overheads my batterie
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Great book!!!!  Just not enough time to continue reading.  I am addicted!  I will be lost when it is over though, nothing can compare.
080701429X|3.0|Based on the reviews, I expected more from this book.  I wouldn't say I didn't like it, but I definitely didn't love it.  The writer seemed to jump around quite a bit from topic to topic and at times it was a little harder to follow.  I expected much more, but to be honest, I couldn't even finish it as it didn't keep my attention.
1400069807|5.0|From the minute I began reading this book I was hooked. Michael Moss did an excellent job of revealing the ugly truth behind how the big food manufacturers have manipulated the general public in the name of profits.<br /><br />I found Michael Moss' writing style engaging, entertaining and easy to follow.<br /><br />Anyone who reads Salt, Sugar, Fat... will never view processed food the same; ever!<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who wants to get an inside view of the ugliness of corporate greed.
1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller is known for his unorthodox style and skills.  He is widely regarded as a great mind. Others may not care for him, but I like his work in this piece.  The story is exactly as the title reads.  It's year one with Bruce Wayne as Batman.  Read about the ups, the downs, the struggles, and the triumphs.  It brings home the aspect that Batman is a man.  It shows how much determination and drive he has to overcome his mistakes and do what he swore to do to avenge his parents' death.  Great story with great art.  I would recommend it to anyone who would like an inside look at Batman's first few times donning the cape and really becoming the Dark Knight.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Following in the footsteps of &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34;, this is an absorbing series of life above- and below-stairs in an English country estate.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Little to Porney and poor view of women.  Says the same thing over and over.  I would not read anymore from this author
B00COHAUD4|4.0|In comparision to the short this story is based on, I think this full length feature compliments and adds to the plot.  For once, an ending that isn't \\"stock\\".  Jessica Chastain's character was interesting and after mulling it over, I am glad the character is tough and forward.
0061978078|5.0|My friend told me to read these books and made it very clear how much she loved them, I was gonno read them anyways but with a little push from her made me read them quicker. I'm almost 16 years old and a junior in high school, and I love reading young adult, and science fiction books. I have read Harry Potter, the hunger games, the mortal instrunents, beautiful creatures, twilight, percy jackson, Vampire academy, matched and many more awesome books that changed my world and made my imagination bigger...And this book was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! The story was brilliant and so unique. The love story and the love triangle was also another thing to melt over and love about this series. I have never imagined a world with no love, but it truly terrifies me. Right from the beginning, I got hooked in easily with Lauren Oliver's rich details and beautiful writing style. I loved Lena's character. Lauren Oliver and Lena added a qhole another world into mine. I say read it, and you won't regret it ;)

I WASN'T ONE OF THE EARLIEST FANS BUT I READ THE BOOK IN 2011 AND TO BE HONEST I WASN'T A BOOKS PERSON BACK THEN.

SO I ASKED MY FRIENDS ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS, I WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECKED THE INTERNET AND PRETTY SOON THERE WERENT MANY BOOKS LEFT THAT I HAVENT READ REALLY. HUNGER GAMES REALY GAVE ME THE LOVE OF READING. I REALLY LEARNED THE MEANING OF READING ONCE I READ THESE BOOKS. BEFORE THAT, I USED TO JUST SKIP OVER THE PAGES, FALL ASLEEP WHILE I READ BECAUSE I JUST COULD NOT FOCUS WHEN I KEPT THINKING OF OTHER THINGS, LIKE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF READING WHEN I COULD JUST WATCH THE MOVIE OR GO OUT AND CHILL. WELL HUNGER GAMES PRETTY MUCH CHANGED THAT FOR ME. I REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT A NARRATOR DOES TO A READER BECAUSE I CAN PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES AND EMPATHIZE WITH THEM AND EXPERIENCE THEIR WOLRD AS IF IT WAS MY OWN LIFE. I THOUGHT ABOUT KATNISS IN MY HEAD AND IMAGINED MY SELF AS HER, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY SIMILARITIES. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT MYSELF AS HER AND THOUGHT WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF I HAD THIS LIFE? I GOT HOOKED IN SUPER EASILY AND FOCUSED QUICKLY TOO AND I JUST COULD NOT STOP READING. SO I READ THEM ALL IN THREE DAYS AND I READ THEM ALL AGAIN BECAUSE FIRST TIME I READ THEM I READ THEM SO FAST THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FINISHED IT. I HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING FASTER. SO I READ THEM ALL AGAIN. AND I TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THEM AND THEY WERE LIKE \\"YOU'RE SO OBSESSED!!\\" AND THEN I MADE SOME PEOPLE READ THEM AND SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE READING SO THEY WERE LIKE \\"NO THANKS, I'M JUST GONNO WATCH THE MOVIE\\" AND I DON'T KLNOW WHAT TO TELL THOSE PEOPLE OTHER THAN THAT READING IS SOMETHING THAT GROWS IN YOU, IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU TELL YOUR SELF ABOUT AND IT HAPPENS. AND BECAUSE I AM AN OBSESSED FAN I HAVE QUITE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF THINGS RELATED TO THE HUNGER GAMES. I HAVE ALL THE BOOKS AND I ALSO HAVE A COPY OF THE FIRST BOOK IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE WHICH IS TURKISH. I HAVE FOUR BOOKMARKS. I HAVE THIS MAGAZINE FROM THE EDITORS OF US AND I BOUGHT IT BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT AND SAW LOTS OF SNEAK PEEKS WHICH WAS PRETTY DARN COOL. I AM OBSESSED WITH JOSH HUTCHERSON. HE IS JUST SO CUTE, I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH HE FITS FOR THE ROLE AND HOW GLAD I WAS WHEN THEY CHOSE HIM AS PEETA. I WASN'T REALLY SURE ABOUT JENNIFER LAWRENCE FIRST BUT NOW I LIKE HER AND THE REST OF THE CAST IS ALSO AMAZING. I WAS ONLY SURPRIZED BY CINNA'S ACTOR BUT WHEN I READ THE BOOK AGAIN, I SAW THAT I MISSED IT, AND I IMAGINED HIM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN MY HEAD BUT IT'S OKAY, HE WAS STILL AWESOME, AND I FOLLOWED THE WHOLE CAST ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER AND I LOVED IT WHEN THEY POSTED PICTURES AND SNEAK PEEKS FROM BEHIND THE SCENES, I WAS SO THANKFUL. AND I POSTED SO MANY THINGS ON FACEBOOK ALL THE TIME, MY FRIENDS STARTED CALLING ME \\"HUNGER GAMES\\". I HAVE FOLDERS, AND PENS, I HAVE THE PIN, I HAVE A CARD NECKLASE, I HAVE A T-SHIRT, I HAVE TWO POSTERS, I HAVE A PIN NECKLASE, I HAVE A MOVIE TRIBUTE GUIDE. I AM ALSO TEAM PEETA BECAUSE HE IS SUPER SWEET AND HE HAS DONE A LOT MORE FOR KATNISS THAN GALE HAS DONE FOR HER. AND LASTLY I WANT TO THANK SUZANNE COLLINS, YOU CHANGED MY WORLD. YOU GAVE ME THE LOVE OF READING, AND AFTER READING THE HUNGER GAMES I READ HUSH HUSH, THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS, FALLEN, GALLAGHER GIRLS, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, SHIVER, WINGS, DELIRIUM, DIVERGENT, PERCY JACKSON AND MANY MORE BOOKS. AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE POPULAR BUT THEY WERE USUALY BEST SELLERS. I USUALLY GET OBSESSED WITH ALL THE BOOKS I READ, ITS THE LEVEL OF OBSESSION THAT MAKES ME LOVE THEM, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU READ THESE BOOKS, I HOPE THAT YOU DON'T JUST WATCH THE MOVIE, ITS NOT THE SAME EXPERIENCE.

0062014536|5.0|My friend told me to read these books and made it very clear how much she loved them, I was gonno read them anyways but with a little push from her made me read them quicker. I'm almost 16 years old and a junior in high school, and I love reading young adult, and science fiction books. I have read Harry Potter, the hunger games, the mortal instrunents, beautiful creatures, twilight, percy jackson, Vampire academy, matched and many more awesome books that changed my world and made my imagination bigger...And this book was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! The story was brilliant and so unique. The love story and the love triangle was also another thing to melt over and love about this series. I have never imagined a world with no love, but it truly terrifies me. Right from the beginning, I got hooked in easily with Lauren Oliver's rich details and beautiful writing style. I loved Lena's character. Lauren Oliver and Lena added a whole another world into mine. The ending of this book wasnt that satisfying for me. really, it's like the book stopped in the middle of all the chaos, i would have appreciated more details and it wasn't the ending I imagined but I guess it's going ti have to do. I say read it, and you won't regret it ;)

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's organized, accessible, and easy to use.  It's a must have for writers on the go. There is nothing I don't use this app for
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have read all of Jeffrey Archer's books. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Clifton Chronicles but I am disappointed that I have to wait another year to learn more about the Cliftons and the Barringtons. Also I had thought that there were would be only 3 books. After the 4th. will there be a 5th?
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The characters and their surroundings place me in the time of the knights in shining armour.  Although the commoners are not forgotten  and are depicted in accurate detail. This series is not for the feint of heart.  The war scenes are graphically detailed.  I feel as if I am watching and feeling as the characters do.  Trust that this one is truly a superior set of books that will stand as classics in years to come.  ..........Arlene H.,  Westminster VT
B008133MDK|5.0|I missed these when they were new but caught them on Netflix (sorry Amazon Prime).<br /><br />I was completely blown away. Each episode is easily the equivalent, in terms of directing, acting, & plot, to nearly any mainstream movie release. They're that good. Actually, they're brilliant.<br /><br />Enjoy them while they keep making them as the actors are both on the brink of super stardom. I fully expect Cumberbatch to be a major character in the new Star Wars movies. How can't he be?
0765317389|5.0|Loved the story. It reminded me of a Disney movie I watched one time about a boy playing a video game and recruit for a space war.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I really liked this movie! It was action packed and it had a good story line, and a ending that I didn't see coming. T C was excellent in his role as usual. I really wish people would stop judging him for his personal life and beliefs because they are really missing out on some good movies that he stars in. I for one am so tired of these fly by night, one hit movie wonder actors who Holly Wood is trying to make them out to be an A list movie star when they are clearly not! I like real actors who can carry a whole movie and Tom certainly fits the bill! Don't sleep on T C's movies, I highly recommend this one and all the one's he's recently starred in!
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Two Towers continues the quest of the Fellowship of the Ring.  By this time in the story, the Fellowship has taken serious losses and Frodo has gone off with Sam to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  Along the way they meet Sm&eacute;agol who is drawn to the power of the ring and whose alter ego Gollum is a crafty, hard-edged creature.<br /><br />In this movie Sm&eacute;agol (voiced by Andy Serkis) is truly the most interesting of the characters.  The animators that dreamed up this unfortunate creature very excellently show his contrasting emotions.<br /><br />Excellent, epic battle scenes.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I found it a great story mainly because it focuses on human interaction. You almost consider living deads as part of the scenery. Best part of the plot is its focus on how we respond to extreme situations were we face struggle for survival on a daily basis. I am looking forward to reading next book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it! it was easy download and easier to use.  can use it almost everywhere! I can't believe that I  didn't use this technology  before this.
1613832796|5.0|I originally read the first book in 1996 and loved it, so I am re reading this series and am completely enjoying them again and of course can't wait to get to the latest book released
B006GM8NXM|1.0|I thought I would order the current season on The Rabbit, which goes through Amazon, and as soon as I updated my data at Amazon, Amazon charged me for the first season, episode 1, which I could easily find on Netflix or even at the local library for free for that matter.  I don't know why this happened.  I can now order any episode I want now that I have the first one, but that is not what I wanted.  I hope someone gets to the bottom of this.  Otherwise, I won't be buying anything else from them.  I must reconsider buying anything from Amazon in the future.  I, of course, can't return a digital order as is the going rate for digital business practices.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the story has true love and true meaning . I likes the whole book . I recommend the book to all my friends and family
B00AH69AX0|5.0|We all know what Metallica has done for thrash metal, even though they might be more \\"pop\\" now than they used to be when \\"...And Justice For All\\" came out. I'll agree with others that this album and Master of Puppets before it, were the definitive Metallica albums, at least for what thrash metal used to stand for...<br /><br />Hadn't listened to this beasty collection of tunes since I was a \\"tween.\\" Hard to believe that was '88. Still, these songs emit the same energy and raw beauty they used to back when I was a kid. With Metallica, even if they're not the best musicians on the face of earth you get pure trash metal, energetic, rhythmic, head-banging metal.<br /><br />I like newer metal too, but c'mon, these were THE best thrash metal years.  Will always listen to this stuff...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This work is genuinely unique. This world has depth to it. I could not put down this book. I recommend it highly. This book would appeal to all readers. It has feeling, suspense, mystery and originality. I will keep reading if more stories follow. Well done, Mr. Howey.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I'm partial to Gaga so I was expecting to be let down when this single came out. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I not only enjoyed the single, I couldn't stop listening to it. This makes me very excited to see what the whole album is going to sound like.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It was an intriguing idea and written well like all Stephen King books but ohh la la, did it go on and on!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I have recommended this book to several friends and family members already.  It is an important topic, especially for kids in the 12-15 year old age group, but also for those who are parents or older kids.<br /><br />The audio book was mostly well done.  One of the voice characters was hard to listen to for hours at a time.<br /><br />Overall, a great book for a family trip in the car.  Kids older than 8 will be interested.

0345529057|5.0|did I not know about this in 1996 when it first came out - great looking set and a great story to boot.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|In his first book of this trilogy, Fall of Giants, Follett introduced several British, European and American families caught up in the events leading up to WWI and the war itself.  In that book, Follett shows us so many opportunities to avoid war that were missed and how decisions made after that war simply set the stage for its continuation.<br /><br />This is the fourth Follet novel I've read recently and I always come away feeling I have learned so much more about history I thought I knew through Follett's abilities to create such believable, complex characters and imagery.  Nothing this author does is paper thin or one dimensional.  If you have read Fall of Giants and are thinking about reading Winter of the World, be prepared to be as unable to put this book down as you probably were the first because no matter which family or characters you happen to be reading about, at the same time, you'll find yourself wanting to get further in the book to find out what is happening with all the others.<br /><br />A note; when you first look at this list of characters that Follett presents at the front(s) of Winter and Fall, like me, your reaction might be the same as mine, 'I'll never keep all these straight.'  But, in addition to his amazing writing ability, Follett writes so clearly and has the knack for making each character and their situation completely memorable.  And if, like I did a few times, you find your memory needs refreshing on a character, you can refer to Follett's helpful list at the front,
B0001Z37HM|4.0|Red Sonja comes from the same source material (the stories of Robert Howard) as the Conan the Barbarian films, not to mention the same production staff, many of the same locations, and even the same era. It even has Arnold in it, but in spite of his top billing, Bridgett Neilson is the lead performer, and she acquits herself quite well.<br /><br />The plot is pretty rote: Chesty warrior maiden Sonja has her peaceful life ruined by a sorceress-queen and sets out for revenge with a team of motley heroes. It's more or less a gender-swapped Conan the Barbarian, but like the move in leads, this film trades brute force and carnage for thoughtfulness and visual interest. The sets are a huge step up from Conan, the script has about 300% more words in it, and the fight scenes, though less brutal and operatic than Conan's, show more deft choreography. Even Schwarzenegger has been softened a bit, playing a character more akin to Howard Hero King Kull than the more famous barbarian he is known for.<br /><br />That is not to say Red Sonja is somehow a weaker film. Instead it is more accessible and watchable; while it may not be the endless sea of screaming, death, and bare breasts that Conan is, it feels more fun and adventurous. Detractors will call this dumbing down, but the truth is most viewers will have more fun with Sonja than Conan. Insofar as it is more of a crazy swashbuckler tale, it also feels closer to Howard's work than Conan did, although it loses some of his naturalistic edge.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Like Conan only more professionally made<br /><br />CONS<br />-Like Conan only less of a brutal 90-minute opera to swordfights
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I am not a fan of fluffy writing, which Dr McGonigal frequently employs in this book.<br /><br />But she more than makes up for the fluffy writing with strong examples to back up her points, very good use of the classic 'argument-counter-conclusion' literary device, which thoroughly clarifies the point being made, and very practical suggestions in how to work on improving willpower.<br /><br />Observe internal thoughts and emotions as an objective outsider would, instead of judging these thoughts - positively or negatively - is one of her tips.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Conan the Barbarian is not a good movie. It is not as good as the Schwarzenegger film, it is not as good as the short stories, and it may not even be as good as the Saturday morning cartoons. It is a poorly paced stinker with cheap sets, poor location work, awful continuity, and lingering shots of matte paintings that fail to convince us the generic caves and ruins it takes place in are in fact far-off fantasy cities.<br /><br />All this is more the shame because Jason Momoa is probably the best Conan ever. He seems to have read Howard's description of the character - \\"Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet\\" - daily as a primer on the role. He looks the part and acts the part, showing neither Schwarzenegger's endearing but inappropriate humor nor the streaks of predictable heroism one might expect. His Conan is a true barbarian, vicious and lawless, but with a calculating intellect his enemies overlook to their own detriment. This part probably went a long way toward his casting in Game of Thrones, and it's a shame an actor who so thoroughly gets his role is shoehorned into such a tedious film about it.<br /><br />It should also go without saying but this film's soundtrack is in all ways inferior to Basil Polidorous' rousing, brass-heavy war-anthems of the original.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I would give this unusual book 5 stars with a qualification. It needs to be read in large sections  I found the pace was so slow. I almost gave up my &#34;pilgrimage&#34; about a third of the way through. Like Harold Fry perseverance paid off. Harold walks 400 miles to Berwick, ill prepared both physically and mentally. The power of this book was to identify with the thoughts and emotions of those involved. The conclusion brought up the fifth star. A must read.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love everything this woman writes.  Her extensive research into the history of the Tudors and surrounding families is wonderful.  Makes you feel like you are in that period.
B0093Q90TO|5.0|I am impressed with the quality and the speed it was delivered. I am also impressed with the way it appeared on my screen. I love this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the book in a day and I must  say that E L James likes to dwell on the different.  I don't mind reading diverse books but in this case I would not recommend this to anyone that I know simply because it not my life style and someone could or may think I like this style of living.

B000002KB8|5.0|Look at this, you wouldn't have metal if it wasn't for these geniuses! No Metallica, A7X (Avenged Sevenfold), Iron Maiden, Megadeth and the list goes on. This is the real metal at its first stand! For those people who say Slayer, Slipknot or some of the bands I already listed created metal (which don't get me wrong, some of those bands are good) you are wrong. This cd was absolutely \\"The Birth of Metal\\"

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Never heard of this author before, but what a skillful storyteller. I was emotionally involved with the characters and guessing until the last page. Several times I felt that I had been kicked in the stomach, many times I had goosebumps. An emotional roller coaster.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|This is a story for the current climate of secrets and lies, the only thing that does not ring true is the extent to which anyone now cares. We should care about the covering up and concealing of the truth but I am not convinced that we do. A gripping read that parallels true events of 2013.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Actually watched Season 1 first, then read the book.  (which I normally do the opposite way).  The series is following the book quite closely.  On to number 2!
B00358ESI4|5.0|Great story about the Vietnam War. Closer to reality than many of more commerical Vietnam films. Tells it like it was, at least better than previous films although it is still a film.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I only really bought the book because I saw that there was a movie based on it. Not having seen the movie, I wasn't sure where the author was going with it, but I still had a strong desire to keep reading. I enjoyed it, and will probably even watch the movie soon.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this box set for my friend's kid for his 1st birthday. Although he cannot read, he loved the pictures. His mom reads the books to him and he's fascinated by the whacky words. Also some of my favorites. I know almost all the words to these by heart almost 30 years later.
0525478817|5.0|\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is by far one of the best novels I have ever read.  Hazel and Augustus' struggle with cancer and love is deeply moving.  Throughout the novel, the reader will laugh, cry, ponder life and death, laugh, and cry some more.  Hazel and Augustus are deep and give a new unseen outlook on life.  The characters just draw the reader into the story, and feel like they are there personally experiencing the pain, heartache, love, and confusion.  One thing I really appreciated about this novel is that the characters are so human.  They experience pain and illness (cancer).  They experience so much that makes them feel realistic because usually, the author tries to shelter the characters.  Green took reading and writing to a new and better level with this novel.  Life is not perfect.  People get hurt, get sick, and people all eventually die (some sooner than others).  However, life does offer many experiences and things that make it worth while like love.  No one portrays this better than Green in this novel.  It really made me start thinking about life in a more deep and emotional way.  I definitely recommend this book for everyone.
0060245867|5.0|Buried deep inside this short novel about a seemingly greedy mouse lies an ominous tone of escalation, desire, love lost, and - of course - redemption. Our hero begins his journey with a single, simple action, and in the end, learns that this menial task has created worlds of chaos. It is up to him to save both himself AND the antagonist, making decisions that may very well destroy all he loves. Never have I read a novel where the protagonist was myself, which impacted me greatly. But what I really enjoyed most about this was the pictures. Very cute.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|The guide book is a joke because you only see picture of the level not any information that would help you with level that you are on.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|His personality, charisma and eye for detail has made this movie an awesome must watch. Morgan Freeman another amazing actor leads this movie to another level. Overall an awesome movie a must watch before the Sequel....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is my favorite!  It holds my interest and the characters are realistic.  I wish there were more like this on TV as I watch very little because of the poor excuse for writers today.  Thank you for Downton!!!!!<br /><br />Linda King
B008Y73940|3.0|The movie is ok. Plot starts well but then turns to be a downer. They could have done a better job of relaying the storyline. Good to watch when you have nothing better to do and you do want to watch a movie!
1781162646|5.0|I loved the book. I expected it to be a horror story, but it was much better than that. I loved it!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is really awesome easy to kill all the Nazis and its easy to pass the levels and that's all I have to say
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book.  Pulled me in from the beginning and kept me glued to it throughout.  Read it in one sitting on a Saturday it was so good.  Only other book to pull me into a reading in one sitting was Enders game.<br />Characters are very well written.  You are right there with them as the story unfolds. The world that is created is very vast for such small total area actually covered.  I am downloading every book I can find by him after this review.  Please keep this world going. I can not wait to find out what happens in the future and with the other..... well I don't want to put any spoilers I n here so....<br />Worth the read and worth triple the price easily.<br />Todd
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really like this app. I like the rescuing animals idea. My son and I play this a lot. Im teaching him about animals.
0307271080|5.0|I'm not big on novels and tend to read non-fictional books, however Chimamanda's book is an amazing, highly captivating piece. She is such a good writer and takes you through all her experiences so intimately. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. I can't wait to read her other books.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I think there was potential for this film to go even deeper into its themes, but it doesn't fulfill that potential. It's a cute little film to watch but it didn't leave me feeling satisfied or eager to watch it again. So, I rate it as a 3-star average. The minions are funny but that's not enough to make the film 'great'.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend. Worth every second reading... Easy to relate to the characters. Falling in love with them is like breathing. Every chapter is deeply rewarding. Emotional in the kindest ways, without being sentimental. Highly recommended.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I have watched this movie many, many times. It remains one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. And instant pick-me-up! I grin and laugh the entire way through. So many great, quotable moments.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|Charming novel. Menacing at times, but beautiful in the elements of old powers that it leaves unexplained. A Saturday afternoon very well spent.
1449437524|5.0|I love it. My husband and I are big fans of the Oatmeal.. That and we have two dogs so appreciate the comic even more!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I bought this video for my son and I have not watched the video but he said he liked it.  It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Boring, not particularly well acted, obviously made for 3D effects, so without it, you end up thinking &#34;why is she pointing that at me?&#34;, etc.<br /><br />Was looking forward to a fun adventure - I fell asleep.  Predictable - not original - blah.
B004SUDPWI|4.0|David Lean's (Director) hands are all over this war Picture coming from &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; 7 Oscar win. Really thought out dialogue, builds this feature and you are there every step of the way through Alec Guinness unwavering personality; and the frustration he causes Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the Bridge. Recommended.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is my first time purchasing a game on a tablet and this very well may be the best one ever

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved every minute of this book and cannot wait to read Shift and Dust. If you like post-apocalyptic works of brilliance - this is just that!
B004GK2B6Q|5.0|This was an amazing movie. Not only was the plot decent, but the animation and the detail were some of the best I've ever seen in a CGI film. You should definitely watch this movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked The Kite Runner you will enjoy this book.  It is well written with a wonderful story.  I found The Kite Runner to be a wonderful surprise when I read it so I wasn't surprised to find this effort by Khaled Hosseini to be so enjoyable.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the variety of pictures and the different challenges. An enjoyable and interesting game! A must for jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great read on the complex lives that intersected in Melborne, Australia.  I was so hooked on their story I stayed up until 3:30 am reading it.  I was very happy with the ending too.  The characters in the book were very well described and realistic.  Love, love, loved it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This was a poor attempt at Fantasy. A complete waste of money. I wonder how many of the reviews I read had actually read the book.
159463176X|3.0|After reading the author's two previous highly acclaimed books (The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns) I found And the Mountains Echoed both disjointed and disappointing. It was confusing trying to figure out who was the voice of the story. The plot jumped all over the place with new introduced characters that had nothing much to do with each other or the overall story, especially the girl with the disfigured face. I spent more time rereading sections trying to figure out the puzzle. I did not particularly enjoy this book, but to give myself credit, I did finish it although it took an inordinately long time. I rate this one a mere 3 stars and that's being generous because Hussein's excellence in his previous work sticks in my mind. Give this one a miss and try something else that resonates with your inner reader. There are plenty out there worthy of better reviews.
0783229526|4.0|From the very beginning, Terry Gilliam is able to make you want to squirm in your seat from a mix of feeling uncomfortable, laughter, and fear. This might sound like a criticism, but it's actually not. It is the mark of a very well-made movie that succeeds in its goal. The movie chronicles two 'businessmen' who get wasted out of their minds and destroy their lives in Las Vegas, comically and disgustingly. As a commentary of drug culture gone wrong, it might make you never want to ever go near drugs entirely. The slow decay of their sanity is depicted through an interesting blend of cinematography and content, and Terry Gilliam really pulls out the big guns with his absurdist style and knack for the bizarre (circus performing wolverines and martini-drinking lizard people, anyone?) It's not Depp's best performance, but Del Toro is extremely scary in this film, showcasing a powerful performance. Interesting watch if you're looking for something strange and intellectually stimulating.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome graphics. Challenging enough to keep you intrigued. Kind enough with hints to keep you playing with minimal frustration. I can't wait to hit the next level!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Another great book from Dan Brown.  Loved the main character, Robert Langdon.  The action was good and just enough without over doing it.  If you loved the other books in this series than you sure need to do this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very enjoyable. more of a brain game than a hidden object.  some levels were difficult and there is no help or hint buttons.
B000FA675C|4.0|I thought the book was great.  I read it twice and would read it a third time.  Symbolism was good and the bit of romance between the characters was just right.  Loved the action and the history.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Love this movie, you can never go wrong with a John Grisham novel made into a movie, he is such a fantastic writer, really knows how to spin a yarn.<br />Matthew M. isn't hard on the eyes either.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fast game when you get in the 90,000 range. It is super fun but don't let the kids get above 200,000 bananas because for some strange reason the father figure looks like he masturbates in front of the dog.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|It is entertaining but not Judy Dench's best, it gets a bit long and tedious after awhile. Language is hard to understand too.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Need I say more???? The story line was good and I enjoyed watching a movie I had used to read comic books about. All of the characters were believable to me.
B008LVCKH6|2.0|This book is way overrated. I read it because a relative told me another relative was reading it and it was funny, so I thought I would like it.<br />What a waste of my time and when the relatives finished it they were of the same mind as I and couldn't believe we all wasted so much time on his stupid book.<br />There are so many good reads out there that deserve better ratings and this one should be garbaged.  The only thing funny was the 100 yr old man getting out the window on his 100th birthday.<br />What a waste of the writters skills...this one is too far fetched...don't spend the money.  The sample is probably the only good section.<br />DB
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am amazed at this game it is a lot better then I expected this is a must have game!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app should be 1000000000+ stars review but heres my advice:<br />Mojang&trade; is working on realms and u must sign up to use it.<br />There r barely any empty slots
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|I hate hate hate this app it's the same as the original and why should they put another star girl that is the same as the other one it makes no sense don't get it if you have the original star girl but if you don't have the original you can get this app and there's this girl who keeps trying to be my friend her name is Star stop being my friend my sister keeps putting you off my friend list because she thinks you ugly but I think your pretty it's just your eyes that creep me out
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The lower levels are easy, but as you go it become more challenging.  It its very addictive, mind bending and fun!  I love it!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Oh my gosh I love this game if you get rainbow dash and you get her a star you get to play a flying game and she makes a sonic rain boom so so so so awesome!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Not sure what the problem was but could not get the game to download. tried several times but it just would not work. I have had no trouble with downloads from Amazon.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I Play it all the time.  I really like having the ability to play with another person, it will come in handy when traveling with my husband.
030758836X|5.0|The writing is thick and rich with detail.<br />The storyline is twisted, unique, and surprising.<br />This book invaded my dreams and therefore deserves five stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its fun but mojang should add mods and skins and lots of other stuff like new ores and enchantment tables and flint and steel in creative
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|This was for granddaughter. 11 yrs old. She thought it was great. So if you have grandchildren I am sure they will like it plus will keep them occupied for awhile.
0307476073|5.0|If you've never read anything by Cheryl Strayed, this is a great place to start!  Her writing is just wonderful.  This is enlightening and empowering.  Everyone should read it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|the book was too long and too confusing. the characters while interesting, were tough to follow. It was a tough read.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|One of my faves. If you like bad ass fight scenes and funny lines and comic book dialogue, you'll love this movie too!
B0007LGCB8|4.0|...the sole makes my feet hot.  Not a particularly big deal since these are sandals with full ventilation, but it is noticeable to me that my feet sweat when wearing these.  Workmanship is great and the soles should last quite a while.  Good arch support and comfort overall.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could only get through about 3/4 of this book before tossing it in the trash (if there were a trashcan for e-books). The writing is less than elementary, the characters are obnoxious. The only people I know who like this book are people who I didn't respect that much to begin with.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Phillipa Gregory has a way with weaving history into the most interesting stories.  The entire Cousin's War series is very interesting.  She brings history to life.  LOVE her books!
B0051ANPZQ|1.0|It was really bad and stupid and I do not recommend this book to anyone. I hope the never ever make this a movie
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book for it's creativeness and the perspective of the bright children in a possible future.  Many of the kids I know are extremely intelligent and 'old souls' - they just don't have the earthly life experience.  The characters of Ender, his siblings and friends depict that extremely well.  I may have guessed the 'surprise', but that didn't impact my enjoyment of the book. I have recommended the book to friends and teen children of friends as a must read.  I thought 'Why isn't this a movie?' and of course, it soon will be.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Must have CD.  I had never heard it before but bought on recommendation from friend.  Listen to it in the car all the time now.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love this series. Has great drama, and the portrayal of Will Graham is great. Love the cases also, very intriguing.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I was aprehinsive with Daniel Crieg as a oo7 at first. However after seeing a few movies with him as james Bond, he has fallen into the scheme of things, perfectly
B00CVCG87O|4.0|I like the contrast of melodic clean vocals and the technical progressive metal undertones. Definitely something different for the genre.
1936891026|5.0|This book by Steven Pressfield may have been the single most influential book I've read in the past few years. His fun to read prose and no BS writing style was refreshing for a non-fiction read. It was definitely the kick in the pants I needed. Read it and do what he says, which is essentially--stop talking and get to work. If you're a writer, artists, entrepreneur or just stuck in a rut, this is a game-changer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  I sat for 6 hours watching.  I have turned so many people onto this delightful family.  I wish I were English and would even work in the kitchen if I could.  Thank you for taking me away from reality.
B004478GNI|5.0|The Imperial V-wing starfighter was awesome! this set was sturdy, and it had cool features. It was my favorite color and it's worth getting. It stayed together and was easy to build. It's fun to play with and has a cool design.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|It's a good implementation of checkers for a phone or a tablet. not much else I can say about it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the book was discriptive and intertaining. It keeps the reader hooked! I think the book was awesome !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is very short but worth it!  Makes you think and really pay attention! Awaiting the next part....Very interesting puzzle.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had to but this as a replacement cable for my kindle fire (1st Gen.) because I can't seem to find my original charger. But this work great

B0089LOG02|5.0|Quickly caught and stayed interesting.  Would highly recommend and already have done so to friends and family.  Would love a sequel.
B0071WQ9AA|5.0|I received this as a gift, and it took me totally by surprise considering I didn't realize modern bands were even still publishing in Vinyl. I have always been depressed that I couldn't play my modern music on my turn table. Great album, love the art, and because it is stretched across four sides, it's built like a truck. This will last forever and a half.
1594481717|5.0|Excellent. Smart. Insightful. This book caught my attention right from the start and I couldn't put it down. Its inspiring and positive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is worth watching more than once.  If you have made it through seasons 1 and 2 you already know this.
1600595871|5.0|I have other books on teaching book making and this tops them all. Its an excellent resource. Clear information and diagrams. Nice images of actual books too. Well done.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, but the cliffhanger only makes me want more! I wonder what number two will be about??
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great Album. Mixes nice instrumentals with hip hop sounding music. I can listen to the entire album without having to skip tracks. It's nice not having to hear someone singing or rapping sometimes.
1400062756|5.0|As an educator this book has changed my life!!  Honestly I can't believe I hadn't read it before now.  But hey, it's never too late to alter your MINDSET!  Read this book, study the work of Carol Dweck.  You won't regret it!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This card works perfectly with my middle-aged Olympus camera.  XD cards are becoming rare now.  Sure enough, the one place I could find the card I needed was Amazon!
B00DP3IESY|5.0|It is hard to believe this movie is Joseph Kosinski's second movie. I was a big fan of Tron Legacy, and I'm quickly finding myself a fan of JK's work and team.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I thought that lighting charcoal this way would take longer than using lighter fluid, but it does not. Two sheets of newspaper in the bottom gets charcoal ready to grill in about 10--12 minutes. Lighter fluid is expensive, so this device is a real money saver.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Poorly developed plot, focused on too many background stories and never really came together at the end of the movie
0425263924|1.0|This book was awful, I can't explain how disappointed I am. I waited forever to read the book, then once i got it, i decided to re-read the first 2, which were enjoyable even the 2nd time I read them. The first at least 5 chapters of this 3rd book went nowhere, it didn't touch on any of the \\"issues\\" you were wondering about from the 2nd book. This book was plain out boring, filler material. I don't mind there being more than 3 books, but why write an entire book of nothing. It felt like the book had no material in it, no story line, It was just boring blah reading. Eva kinda irked me in this book as well, her character got to be somewhat annoying. Doing stupid things, and continuing to put herself in other men's faces. I don't know. In all honesty the book just pissed me off. Now who knows how long it will be until she writes a book with actual substance for the series. Its really a shame, because the first 2 books were really good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I lov  this app I.think its a little over piece but its challenge fun advnter game good for all ages. its very.easy but tricky.I think. I. would pay for it even if it was 10.99
B008M721MS|3.0|I had no idea I have this on my kindle Fire. I do not know how to use it, how to set it up and what to do with it, or what it for and where it cmae from. Evidently it must have came free with my purchase of a Kindle Fire, I guess. I have no idea how it got on my Kindle list. It is on my list of Kindle purchases and things I have for my kindle, but I have no idea how it got there. I did not buy it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game, I'm addicted love the hidden object games and this is one of the best. Even my daughter plays

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found the book well researched, presented and a great read. Mr. Aslan offers a fact based story of Jesus that is easily believable and he does give credence to all those nagging questions many folks  ask themselves when reading about Jesus the Savior.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I have seen this movie over 10 times and i still love it and still enjoy it as much i i first did in the movie theatre!
0679805273|5.0|It's an amazing book that helps children understand the ups and downs of life and that they need to keep on fighting to achieve there goals
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Out of all the angry birds this is definitely my favorite it has so many levels and it is not as hard I think that anyone who downloads will not be disappointed.
0061537969|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, and I actually really enjoyed that the narrator was a dog.  Unfortunately this wasn't enough to hide the fact that one, the author isn't a very good writer, and two, the story is boring and depressing.  I made it about half way through before finally giving up, and I think there are two reasons why:<br /><br />1.  Nostalgia - I lived in Seattle up until a year ago, and Denny et al live in my old neighborhood, go on hikes and walks that I love, and frequent one of my favorite coffee shops.<br />2.  Enzo - I'm a huge animal lover, and Enzo's actually a pretty lovable character.<br /><br />However, the rest of the book is just so uninteresting that these two things weren't enough motivation for me to finish.  There's very little character development (at least for the first half that I got through) or subtle plot details. You're basically just smacked in the face with each new depressing event, without any sort of backstory, motivation, etc.  While Enzo is somewhat human-esque, the depth of the plot is very doggy.<br /><br />Even worse, I just could not get into the racing metaphors.  Yes, I understand that they're supposed to be a commentary on life, but I don't give a rat's a$$ about cars and think racing is a ridiculous sport. If it had been tennis, lacrosse, curling, anything else, I might have gotten through, but this just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Finally, the whole situation with Eve was ridiculous and contrived.  I understand denial, but if you have a young child would you really put off taking care of your own health? Why didn't Denny notice anything?  And why didn't they figure out the custody situation before she died?  Both Eve and Denny seem pretty irresponsible, and it was hard for me to have sympathy for either of them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was worried this wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire (2nd edition) after reading the negative reviews (as I was waiting for it to download), but I had no issues whatsoever. Not a very long game, but I don't have too much free time, so it was sufficient for me. I was looking for a game that was more than shooting shapes, etc and this was it. I'll be looking for more like it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Season Four, well I get them for a friend of mine he enjoys it so much I have gotten all seasons for him wow what a gift for a motorcycle nut
B004W1GCNC|3.0|It appears to be competing with Dowton Abbey, and doesn't come close to keeping my attention. I am not a fan.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just need more coins. This game is a lot of fun. Connect and play against friends. Could play all day.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A wonderful way to give an insight of how law world is. Interesting personalities...wonder to think there are people like that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you want a good game play. play this .I'm addicted to this game because it's so good! Plus free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it and you should to!!!!!  :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a simple, elegant, and perfectly executed piece of technology. I have been using it everyday since I got it for a variety of things. This includes Netflix, Google Play Music, YouTube, and mirroring my browser to watch unsupported video sites.<br /><br />I am a heavy YouTube user, so being able to watch all my content on the big screen for 35 dollars is good enough for me. And because it pulls directly from YouTube's servers, it has little-to-no buffering or lag. I also am very pleased with the interface to stream fro YouTube. It is pretty useful, though I'd like to see it revamped and more unified across platforms(desktop and mobile).<br /><br />Another good use I have found for the Chromecast is the browser mirroring function. I use this to watch TV shows on unsupported video sites. It works great. Plain and simple. The only problem is that if you have very slow internet or have multiple users using your home network, you may run into buffering issues. That said, I still use it to watch practically everything on my tv now.<br /><br />The Chromecast is essentially an ingenious take on the media streaming device. Coming in at 35 dollars makes this throw away money cheap. Anything under 50 dollars is worth the risk. And Chromecast delivers. As opposed to the Apple TV or Roku Box, Chromecast attempts to leave it's functions as open as possible and the only major gripe I have is that it only streams in 720p, for now
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I don't really like reading, but this book had my attention for hours!!! What a great piece of work it is.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Very addictive and fun! Has many levels and gives new powers as you advance. Would suggest this game for all!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. The twists and turns are so unexpected. Just when you think you've got it figured out- you're wrong.
0062255657|5.0|Adult fairy tales are difficult to sort. Was the author intending to tell a true story all warped through the eyeglass of time or something completely and ghastly new from his/her imagination? But is it imagination,or something deeply buried?<br />I am going to admit I have read only one other Neil Gaiman book;which one it is I'm keeping as my secret. Instead,I am going to further admit that I put on my\\"adult\\" britches and dove into the book. Silly metaphors and cliches of mine aside,I was in love with the story from the title. After viewing this title from several angles like,say \\"the ocean was pond sized to the little seven year old- we here in the States call it \\"crossing the pond\\" when we travel to the UK. But Lettie,all of 11 years old, (supposedly, maybe) called it an ocean and to the fact-crushed child,taught him that not all things are solid and act properly no matter how many times or how nicely you ask.<br />To read Neil Gaiman's book is to read a masterpiece. And,I think, a very personal book,something that has been written on the stars inside him all of his life and will remain so until the end.<br />Mr.Gaiman has chosen to share his very own fairytale with us. And there is nothing better than that,ever,that one could read.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|A lot of people enjoyed this movie. I am NOT 1 of them. I truly believe Splice may have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot was full of potential but the execution was horrendous. Many scenes went from absolutely absurd to simply \\"are you (bleeping) kidding me. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the art of film, my worst enemies included.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This book is a very fast read and breaks the financial crisis into human stories. This is less about the mechanics of the crisis and more about how people made it happen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the game is not long enough. There should be more levels. I was happily surprised I thought it would be a 100 floors knock off but it is not. More levels please

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Trying to limit spoilers.<br />I'm not a film Critic. I have no credentials. I'm a fan of most things geek. I loved it.<br /><br />I went to this movie with two mindsets. One mind set was callous one which was saying; \\"I can't believe they changed his outfit, they better not screw anything else up.\\" The other mindset was the open realizing; \\"No movie can live up to your imagination. Not Game of Thrones, Not the Hobbit; Nothing can live up to the power of my imagination, so take it as it is and trust that it was done earnestly.\\"<br /><br />Superhero movies have been getting better and better with each Generation of them since the death of them in 1997 at the hands of Batman & Robin. In my opinion it started with X-Men in the year 2000, then Spiderman 2002. Not that they were very good but they proved that Comic book are packed with stories primed for the big screen. I think X-Men and Spiderman were the stepping stones for the other comic book movies.<br /><br />Batman Begins (2005), I believe, set a new standard for origin stories and comic book movies. But the DC universe didn't capitalize on it. They dropped the ball with \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006); not that it was a bad movie, it just wasn't new, it was still standing on Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Instead, someone at Marvel saw the big picture of the universe they created and worked towards presenting the best of that world starting in 2008, Creating Iron-Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America and bringing them together as the Avengers with Nick Fury and Shield under genius of Joss Whedon. Not only did they succeed but I believe they pulled through with out sacrificing their characters, costume or story.<br /><br />Now in a post Avengers, post Hulk Smash world DC is getting their act together, but, also, keeping the \\"realism\\" torch lit by Nolan's Batman Begins. Batman's suit was built with utility in mind. They Couldn't come up with a story to Sell the classic Superman suit to the audience so they threw that away.Not sure if they tried or if that was the first thing to go. However; they did present a Krypton that gave back story enough for a big symbol on the chest and a cape, which was enough for me to acquiesce to the new suit.<br /><br />Some how as I watched the film, the callous side of me was stripped away. Perhaps I was tired of being mad, bitter, and shaking my fist at people scribbling on things solidified in my imagination. Or perhaps this film captivated me as I watched something new come from the longest lived, most popular, most known superhero of my time.<br /><br />The amazing action was almost an apology for \\"Superman Returns\\" and at the same time an answer to the post Avengers' Hulk; \\"Can 'Man of Steel' smash?\\" Answer: Yes. To me, the action was a big nod to the Superman Fans as to say, you knew all along this is how Superman can fight, and now we can finally make it happen, live action.<br /><br />The origin, the whole movie was basically Superman's origin story. Honestly, it wasn't until the very end of the movie, nearly the last scene, that I felt like Clark, Kal, actually became Superman. As I watched it and saw him do all the things he did, never in my mind past the notion, \\"This is Superman\\".<br /><br />After leaving the Theater and thinking, meditating, I still didn't feel like it was a Superman movie. I still hold Christopher Reeves as THE Superman And Brandon Routh as the next best thing. But the following week I went back and watched it again. I liked it just as much the second time. I still didn't feel \\"Superman\\" but now this is a new feeling. This is not Superman, but The Man of Steel.<br /><br />Maybe I will see Superman in the next movie, until then, I am happy with the Man of Steel.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I really enjoy reading Mr. Altucher's blog; it's very thought provoking.  This book is mainly a compilation of previously posted material.  There's lots of great stuff in this book and it's a much easier format in book form than the blog, which is difficult to access.
B004TBWFAO|5.0|This novel written in the nineteen twenties truly is a post modern marvel. It digs deep into the mind, not just of the characters but also of the reader. You can't not think about relationships, the passage of time, about the darker side of humans and about time, and yet the context is a family vacationing on the coast. I found this book to be brilliantly written, in a complex but flowing style. Anyone who likes literature has to read this novel.
1419827154|5.0|As a church organist I especially love the scene where August Rush discovered the pipe organ and explored the stops/pedal board and then the light came in through the stained glass windows -- this is exactly how I felt when I was young and discovering the instrument for myself.  As a member of a local orchestra I appreciate the classical aspects with the cellist/mother and as a woman who cannot do housecleaning with some rock n roll going in the background I like how the father/rocker finds a niche in everything around him.  Robin Williams acted his self-centered part well and it was fun to watch all the musical talent culminate.  If you listen there is music all around you -- that is no lie, and this film helps wake that feeling.  Yes, it is clichéd, but what can you do with 2 hours to weave a story?  This film does it about as best as it can be done.

Several songs contain throwbacks to old FOB albums, delighting dedicated fans who recognize the references (i.e. &#34;Save Rock and Roll&#34; has short remixes from &#34;Chicago was so 2 years ago&#34;).  Definitely a great album!  &#34;Now press repeat!&#34;
B00BEIYL6G|4.0|\\"Jobs\\" (2013 release; 122 min.) is a biopic about the rise and fall (and rise again) of Steve Jobs. As the movie opens, Jobs is introducing a new product called iPod to the Apple employees in 2001. After that the movie kicks back to 1974 as we see Jobs at Reed College (even though apparently he isn't officially enrolled). It's not long before Jobs and Wozniak are working on a new product out of Jobs parents' garage, the humble beginning of what would become the iconic company that is Apple.<br /><br />Several comments: first, the movie is in a sense a very traditional bio-pic, and I am okay with that as the story that is being told is so compelling that we don't need a lot of extra drama or glitz thrown in for good measure. Highlights of the movie for me were the scenes leading up to Jobs' removal from the very company that he started (with Wozniak), and the scene in which Wozniak comes to tell Jobs that he is leaving Apple. Second, heving read about Jobs' reputation as someone of a tyrant to work for/with, the movie does bring some of that to the screen, but overall I think Jobs get quite a favorable treatment here. Third, the bulk of the movie centers around the year 1876 to 1985, with some attention to his return in 1996. Other than the opening scene (set in 2001), there is nothing in there from 1997 on, and thus nothing about Jobs' battle with cancer, and also very little (snippets really) about his personal life. Fourth, Ashton Kutcher plays the role of his life as Steve Jobs. Indeed, Kutcher is entirely believable, right down to the way he walks. Can Kutcher gather some Best Actor Oscar buzz for this? He should! There is a slew of other great performances, including J.K. Simmons as Chairman of the Board who is trying to oust Jobs, and also a cameo from James Woods as a Reed College administrator, and Leslie Ann Warren in the blink and you'll miss it role of Jobs' mom. Last but not least, there is a really great soundtrack, including Bob Dylan of course (Jobs adored him) with \\"Boot of Spanish Leather\\", Cat Steven (opening the movie with \\"Peace Train\\"), Joe Walsh's \\"Life's Been Good\\", and even Toad the Wet Sprocket towards the very end (with \\"Walk on the Ocean\\").<br /><br />Bottom line: I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. Even though it was first shown at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, there has hardly been any buzz about this. Why this is, I have no idea. No surprise then that the screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon, was not particularly well attended, which is a shame. If you are in the mood for a quality movie that doesn't feature a comic book action here and where the world doesn't get blown to smithereens, by all means do yourself a favor and go see this movie. \\"Jobs\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!dored him) with \\"Boot of Spanish Leather\\", Cat Steven (opening the movie with \\"Peace Train\\"), Joe Walsh's \\"Life's Been Good\\", and even Toad the Wet Sprocket towards the very end (with \\"Walk on the Ocean\\").<br /><br />Bottom line: I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|During the 4 months I've had this it had to be reset numerous times, with loss of data.  This last time it cost me 4 days of data on the Withings Helpmate.  All categories not just sleep.<br /><br />The sleep data I get varies greatly from the ZEO I use at the same time.  It is less inclusive and in the area of deep sleep it varies by several orders of magnitude.<br /><br />After one particular reset, the time on the Pulse was wrong.  I got little help from Withings.  They offered me no contact ability, only a \\"knowledge database.\\"<br /><br />Update 6/13/2014:<br /><br />My Pulse died.  It had a decent run. Withings offered to replace it with a new one.  There were numerous email exchanges before I finally was told what to do to get the new one.  It finally arrived, dead.  I was told to charge it overnight, which I had done.  I tried several more times, once leaving it on the charger for 24 hours.  Nada, nothing.<br /><br />I think I've had it with Withings.  Their blood pressure cuff varies wildly from the ones in my doctors office that I checked it against.  When questioned Withings response was, \\"we've tested it extensively before we went to market.\\"  The pulse itself has never come close in either steps or mileage when compared to several other tracking devices; including mechanical and electronic pedometers and two different GPS trackers.  As far as sleep monitoring goes, several published, peer reviewed studies on sleep monitoring have found that motion sensor sleep monitors, like most on the market, just don't work in a real world usage.  Only EEG monitors can accurately determine time and level of sleep.  For the consumer that meant Zeo.  But they went out of business.

B00BYISQTO|2.0|Mopey hipsters will probably eat this up whilst claiming it's not as good as previous releases.  Critics will heap praise upon Trouble Will Find Me to reassure themselves that their previous adulation of The National proves that the band hasn't peaked and that they are indeed maturing.  Both groups are wrong.  The songs on this release are terminally dull and the recording is awful.  Whatever is going on in the layers of sound is inaudible due to all of the compression on the CD.  Of course, this is nothing new for The National.  Every album before has also been sonically compromised to the point that it doesn't matter if you listen to the album on your crappy earbuds on your iPod, your car stereo with blown tweeters, or your esoteric audiophile home-system.  It will all sound the same, flat and boring.  It's a sonic landscape that mirrors the lack of musical invention that was recorded here.

0435123432|5.0|I read Flowers for Algernon in ninth grade and then revisited the novel in law school. Therefore, I will review the book from two perspectives:<br /><br />Why I loved this book as a teenager: Flowers for Algernon is a lesson in compassion--reading from the format of a diary how the protagonist (Charlie) is mentally challenged yet ridiculed is incredibly moving.  Furthermore, the author does an excellent job developing Charlie's character and the issues Charlie faces as he undergoes an experimental treatment such that you're on the edge of your seat as you read.  I used to update my high school sports team every practice of my progress on the book, and each practice they couldn't wait for updates :)<br /><br />Why I loved this book as a grad student: Flowers for Algernon illustrates that  \\"getting smarter brings cruel shocks.\\" In grad school I found that in the pursuit of knowledge/intelligence one thinks that knowledge is an inherent good and therefore that the pursuit can necessarily bring only good things.  However, one learns that greater awareness can be painful and that intelligence can be alienating and lonely. This life lesson is captured in Flowers for Algernon. In particular, the trade-off between naivety and intellectual brilliance is illustrated by Charlie who experiences the epitome of (and crisis in) each.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|As a die-hard Neil Gaiman fan, I've often felt that his The Sandman comic book series published by Vertigo was a tough act to follow. I admit that, for me, most of his subsequent works have paled in comparison to that epic.<br /><br />That hasn't made me love his writing any less, for Gaiman has a way of approaching storytelling that sets him apart from most. If I'm put on the spot I struggle to say what it is exactly that draws me to Gaiman's writing except that it resonates deeply with me.<br /><br />I'm happy to report, however, that The Ocean at the End of the Lane hits the mark for me the same way The Sandman does, and the author has recaptured that mythical essence that had me enthralled the same way the Lord of Dreams had me bewitched.<br /><br />Whether it was that Gaiman was writing from the heart, or he simply tapped into the right creative current at the right time, it hardly matters. What you'll hold in your hands is the work of a master craftsman.<br /><br />The story and the writing seems simple: we follow our narrator along a journey into his childhood. All we are told is that there has been a death in the family, though it's implied it might have been the father.<br /><br />Fuelled by nostalgia, the narrator explores past haunts and returns to the Hempstock farm where he recalls incidents that occurred when he was seven. What we are reminded of is the fluidity of memory and how these remembrances evolve depending on our perspective.<br /><br />Thought the majority of this story is told by a seven-year-old, and could be read by children as well, this is not strictly speaking a children's story. The Maurice Sendak quote at the start of the book is on the mark: \\"I remember my own childhood vividly... I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn't let adults know I knew. It would scare them.\\"<br /><br />The Ocean at the end of the Lane is a tale filled with powerful archetypes, be it images of the Triple Goddess or the eternal ocean that links all things. This is more than just a story about childhood, and coming to terms with the fact that the world is a dangerous, unpredictable place.<br /><br />Gaiman tells us that even as grownups we don't have all the answers, yet we're poorer for having lost that childlike sense of wonder. This is a story for those who still dare to dream or for those who might have forgotten how.This is more than just a story about childhood, and coming to terms with the fact that the world is a dangerous, unpredictable place.<br /><br />Gaiman tells us that even as grownups we don't have all the answers, yet we're poorer for having lost that childlike sense of wonder.

Ms. Clare has a great flair for dramatics, and imagery and I love how everything gets woven together. This book was such a roller coaster rider with all of the different emotions going on. I don't even know how there are 3 more books after this, but I'm definitely excited to continue reading!!!!

B0036T31YY|5.0|I watched this about six months ago and still can't stop thinking about it. That's my idea of a good movie.  The longer I think about it the better it is.  Maybe I just happen to be in the right stage of mind when I watched it but whatever I now count it as one of the top movies I've ever watched and I watch about 10 a week. Without giving any spoilers if you like time travel, mind benders,  cerebral, or parallel universe movies, I would recommend this movie.  If you just want a time killer relaxing comedy, forget it.  This one is not for you.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|The universe is bigger than our wish list. Affirming things into existence is an extension of ego and denies a higher power that may want something different for ourselves or others.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|A very interesting book, well written I think. There was a lot of historically accurate background and I liked that. At times the plot became predictable but the story continued to hold my interest. The characters were fairly well drawn but the end of the story left me a little let down--what happened to the main female character? All in all I would recommend this book, especially if you have an interest in american history before the Civil War.

I loved it all.<br /><br />The reason I loved it is due to the fact that this is NOT a perfect woman.  She takes on role's - The Daughter.<br />The Wife.  The Friend etc but she is none of these.  She is a selfish self absorbed twit.  One I really hoped would bite the dust.<br />The ending was both brilliant as well as deeply disturbing.<br /><br />A brilliant book indeed and one I am very glad a friend pushed me to read.<br /><br />WaAr

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars takes you into the life two teens who have had to face more in their 16 years than most grown adults. While reading this book I grew strongly attached to the characters and felt like the loss of one was the loss of my own friend/family member. I found myself laughing, and sobbing, as I read the book, and when I was finished reading left with the worst book hangover ever. I'm still not sure if I will read a book as good as this one. I have read Alaska and paper towns but The Fault in our Stars is by far the best of John Green.<br /><br />P.s I am emotionally stable

B00742GBDM|1.0|Others have commented on just how greatly this deviates from Austen's 'Mansfield'. 'Mansfield Park' may be the most difficult of Austen's novels to adapt, but Rozema did not adapt it so much as hijack it as a pro-feminist, anti-slavery rant in Regency costume. Rozema indeed deviates by making deviates of several characters: Sir Thomas is a sadistic bully who verbally abuses Fanny and rapes his slaves, Lady Bertram is an opium addict,  and Mary Crawford borders on being a sexual predator who has no moral compass. Rozema's 'Fanny Price' is exactly the opposite of Austen's 'Fanny', and not in any way that improves upon JA's. Rozema's 'Fanny' is arrogant, smug,condescending, judgmental and more than a little conniving. Many have said JA's 'Fanny' is her most difficult character to like; I found Rozema's impossible to like. Hardest to stomach after the politicization is Fanny's contempt for her birth family during her enforced 'visit' to Portmouth. She looks down her nose at their struggle and poverty, and exudes an air of \\"I'm just soooo above all this.\\"<br /><br />Why watch it at all? The cinematography is lush and the costuming lovely. I watch this Henry Crawford and could believe he might just really love Fanny, not this Fanny but JA's Fanny.  Jonny Lee Miller's 'Edmund' is my favorite among 'Mansfield' adaptations, and in Frances Price (Fanny's mother) you see the beautiful woman who married for love and now regrets that childish decision. Unfortunately none of that helps 'Mansfield' rise above it's shortcomings as an adaptation.<br /><br />As a period piece 'Mansfield Park' has a certain attraction, and can stand on its own rather well. It simply has little merit as an Austen adaptation.

159463176X|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed- Khaled Hosseni<br />The author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns  writes another spell bounding novel about family.<br /><br />Beginning in the late 1940's in Afghanistan, a brother and sister, Abdullah and Pari, are torn apart by a decision made by their father and their step uncle.  The novel turns into the stories of each person who was affected by the decision.  Along with their stories is the recent history of Afghanistan.<br />This book is about what happens when one decision changes lives. The lyrical words, the descriptions of the cities and countries, how people live, are written superbly and will certainly be thought about for a long time.

1402217722|4.0|The Earl of Rule, at the age of thirty-five, has finally decided that it is time for him to marry.  Surprising his family, friends, and the ton, Rule selects the youngest and plainest Winwood sister to be his bride.  Horatia, at the tender age of seventeen, nobly sacrifices herself in marriage to Rule to save her family from financial ruin and give her sister, Lizzie, the opportunity to marry her true love.  She enters her marriage to Rule full aware that they aren't in love and promising \\"not to interfere\\" in his lordship's affairs.<br /><br />What begins as a marriage of convenience quickly turns into a delicious romp of madcap adventures!  Marriage with Horatia keeps Rule quite busy with paying her extravagant shopping bills, saving Horry (as she is affectionately called) from gambling her jewels, and protecting his young wife from damaging her reputation.  Horatia is ball of fire and is in desperate need of a firm hand, but her husband does his best to not \\"interfere.\\"  Out to thwart the newlyweds marital \\"bliss\\" is a jealous mistress, a greedy heir-apparent, and a dastardly rake set on exacting revenge!  Yet, through it all, the chances of happiness in this marriage seem to grow as both parties begin to secretly and unexpectedly develop tender regards for each other. :)<br /><br />Oh my!  How I loved the men in this novel!  They stole the show!  Our hero, Lord Rule, won my heart by becoming adorably enchanted with his troublesome and extravagant young wife.  His loyalty, trust, and gentle attempts to woo her were so sweet and endearing to witness!  Furthermore, Lord Rule's comments and conversation kept making me bust out with laughter - he delivers countless rejoinders, dripping with sarcasm, and with the driest of wit!  I loved his calm retorts, verbal sparring, and brilliant word-play!<br /><br />In addition, I adored Horatia's hapless, wastrel brother, Pelham and his simple-minded, but dependable, friend Pommeroy.  They get completely wrapped in Horry's scrapes and are extremely kind and supportive by offering her their services and assistance.  I loved the comical succession of escapades and screwball schemes they took us through!  Moreover, their verbal exchanges are highly amusing and quite farcical (especially since at least one of them is usually inebriated!)<br /><br />I must admit though, that Horry is not high on my list of favorite characters.  I found her admirable and endearing at first, but when she started behaving a little too much like Lydia Bennet, my approbation started to wane.  I didn't mind that she was an immature and flawed heroine, but I wish she displayed some more sense as she had at the beginning of the novel.  But she does redeem herself in the end...<br /><br />What a vastly entertaining Georgian Romance!  As always, I delight in Heyer's entertaining characters, uproariously funny plots, and clever repartee!  I highly recommend!<br /><br />Austenesque Reviewsapes and are extremely kind and supportive by offering her their services and assistance.

0143121316|5.0|I learned more about China form this book than from years of independent research. No foreigner knows more about this country first-hand than Henry Kissinger. It was very useful information before my trip to China. It's a must-read for anyone who wants a greater understanding of Chinese history, culture, and politics.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really loved each episode. Can not wait to watch season four! I hope it will be as good as the previous ones.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A great documentary on the history of recording and the music industry. Or should I say, the way the music industry used to be a long time ago.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Level ten was it. Fun while it lasted, but they were solved too quick. Maybe two days entertainment at most. Boring to repeat levels

0399159347|4.0|One letter changes Cecilia's life as she knows it.  Her ordinary life is interrupted by a letter written by her husband years ago, revealing his darkest secret.<br /><br />Life is full of choices, and this story shows us just how a small choice can lead to very different paths. The coolest parts of the novel to me were the glimpses of the alternate lives the characters could have had.  Every life is full of what ifs, and it made the crime at the center of the novel even more poignant by seeing exactly how one death changed so many people's lives.<br /><br />Overall an interesting read that keeps you engrossed throughout the story.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is very cool lots of action and interesting gameplay. I suggest you get this game it doesn't cost anything to truly it out!! I enjoy it!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I can listen to this cd over and over and over.  Beautiful background music.  Don't let the fact that these are covers stop you from buying, he makes them all his own.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This is an amazing story of two friends willing to do anything for each other. In a horrible time like this nether of them understood what was happening do acted as casual as ever
B008X8P8A8|5.0|A great game to kill time with.  Colorful graphics and music makes it fun to listen and watch.  Simple mechanics and little strategic headaches to worry about.  Highly enjoyable but do not expect it to be at the level of complexity of other TOTAL WAR games.
B009C7JS14|5.0|It helps you when your on the go or at home, either way it's perfect for weather. The Weather Live is awesome!
B0006J28BO|5.0|In keeping with Ghibli tradition this video is a fun and entertaining video to watch.  High quality in the visual, sound and storytelling.
B00DQT1EOI|1.0|It was not available on Kindle for Windows 8. Can't understand why Amazon bothered to make this free but not for Windows viewing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Another lovable game and highly addictive Angry Birds game.  You will not be disappointed.  Expect a high level of challenge and frustration.  Not reccommended for the non-patient player.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|That is what my 8 (nearly 9)-year old said about this movie.  She LOVES it.  She's watched it numerous times and continues to enjoy it and find something new i it each time.  She saved up for quite some time to buy this movie and it was well worth all the chores:)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A quick excellent fantasy. Sadly, I wanted more. I haven't read a lot of Gaiman though, so I'm happy to start another.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had it about a week now and love using it!  I can start it from one device and pause, play or stop from another.  The controls even conveniently display automatically on my Galaxy S4 lock screen.  I keep it plugged into my A/V receiver instead of the TV.  Looking forward to additional support from other content providers and to more useful information such as news feeds on the home screen as has been speculated about online.<br /><br />I got in just under the wire for the 3 months free Netflix which was a great bonus, but I would have happily paid the full $35 for the simple and convenient wireless functionality it provides.

B00B3N4CWK|5.0|The Cider House Rules is most definitely a 5 Star Block Buster.  The characters, as well as the actors brings the story to life of the times during the second world war, World War II.  Homer Wells  played by Toby Maguire, Candy Kendall played by Chalize Theron where great in the Leading roles with Dr. Wilbur Larch being played magnificently by Michael Caine, who truly steals the movie and makes it what it is Absolutely Great.  I want to especially give credit to the acting of  Delroy Lindo as Arthur Rose, mainly called Mr. Rose throughout the movie.  He was absolutely magnificent, as the character Mr. Rose and the father of Rose Rose played by Erykah Badu, who plays the daughter of Mr. Rose.  The story still happens in todays world with great nurses like Nurse Angela played by Kathy Baker and Nurse Edna played by Jane Alexandr two wonderful actresses to have for these roles.<br /><br />Here is the link below for an adult movie below for a Friday or Saturday night:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00B3N4CWK B00B3N4CWK]]

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Replaced a dying liquid cooling system and believe it works just as good for half the price. Cooler is a bit oversized though.
0071624058|4.0|The book is brand new with CD Rom. The price is really good. And they shipped it really fast. I got this book withing 5 days. The book is very useful.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app. But every time I look at pictures then look at another picture it takes me back. So I have to find my way back. But otherwise a great app buy it!!!!! :)
B005MHI0QM|5.0|My name isn't Lynne... it's holly. Lynne is my mom. Love this book so much. When I was a little girl my papa told me about the second world war. Obviously I had no clue what the heck he meant that millions of Jews died because I was only five. Then I got older and found out what death meant...I got awful curious about it so I started to ask questions about it. Then I forgot about it unroll fifth grade. Miss Carravetta my teacher started to tell us about it because she loved learning about th h that time period. I got interested and started reading. I read number of the stars and books about Warsaw. Then came 6th grade. I read many books on Hitler and the Nazis. After that I tried to get Anne's diary but it wasn't available... but now I have it. And I will never forget it. This is the best book I've ever read and it will continue to inspire me for generations to come. Thanks to anne we can reach our generation up close and personal. And I can relate  to Anne because I am thirteen. Tank you Anne Frank for writing out all your dreams into your diary.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. I enjoy finding recipes on it and I have made some purchases from it as well. Many of my friends us it
B005UG53NS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie n the quality. It uploaded very quickly and had easy access, I would recommend this to any of my friends who also enjoy the Harry Potter movies.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is an imposter of another game!I do love this game it's so RADACILL! (It's the worst game in the game but the best game in the world too) look at my name!!0.o
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|All my friends said get it get it so I did and now I love it!!! it is very FUN it is great. So download it
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Omg best book in the world I loved that there was clues that lead up to the real boys that did it!!!
B005TKD512|4.0|Thourough while simplyfying the conclusions.  I have recognised a lot of what i believe in. They bring it with a simple image ( the elephant and the driver ) .
B005LAII12|3.0|It is what it is.  Probably not what you want to hear in a movie review if you are looking for something good, but there it is.  To say that this movie was juvenile is a gross understatement, but it had some entertaining moments.  Cute enough and with enough little moments to be a decent popcorn movie, but that's about it.  LOTS of drug use by two characters who are VERY immature and just barely a step above real losers.  The \\"maturation\\" angle doesn't really materialize.  The Flash Gordon thing, however, kept things weird toward the end, just as it was getting very predictable and a little boring.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love it, couldn't stop watching both seasons, and also<br />appreciated the extras on the DVDs.<br />I would recommend this, shipped quickly and exactly as described.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Fun and engaging. No shaking or turning my device- just thinking.  Just started so I am looking forward to continuing and discovering.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I couldn't wait to watch season 3, and am now waiting<br />impatiently for season 4.<br />Shipped quickly and exactly as described.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game on my Kindle Fire. Easy to use and entertaining. I like the fact that I only need to use my brain and do not need to shake, turn or put down my device to play it. Just the right amount of challenge as I neared level 10 but I enjoyed the lower, easier levels too.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|For those who have seen the originals, this is an amazing retelling of the story. If you have not see the originals though, you will quickly get lost in the personal relationships between the pilots and other characters. Visuals have been greatly enhanced since I have watched the originals, and the angels look better than ever!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am interested in how changes in attitude of the medical community towards the paranormal might start a spark that unites science and religion in the future. As Thor told the Natalie Portman charatcter in the 2011 movie &#34;in my world science and magic are the same thing.&#34; Dr. Alexander's profound experience was caused by an extremely rare infection of his brain that resulted in a week coma. I would classify his experience as a genuine samadhi in the Buddhist sense of the word.<br /><br />If science someday could safely and artificially shut down a person's brain temporarily and allow that person easier access to their own higher consciousness and profound spiritual experience, perhaps that would result in a geometric increase in the number of enlightened people on the planet and exponetial increase in the peace and happiness for the whole population of the planet.<br /><br />I think Dr. Alexander stated his experiences plainly and elegantly. I felt like I could visuallize exactly what he was talking about. Some of the analysis felt very filtered through the lens of Western Christianity but that is understandable because of his background.
B00D7NRHX0|3.0|The movie felt like it was trying to be too many things at once. Was it a love story,  syfy, or political. I would have prefer the director to have focused and delivered on one of the subjects and kept the others more subtle. As for the visuals, probably one of the best I have seen in an independent movie. Had the director play around with the story to focus on these unique planets and inverse gravity, the movie could have been amazing.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book is really good. Thank u to Jeff for righting this book. It shows a lot of things to do as an adult!! You are the best author ever!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|For those who have seen the originals, this is an amazing retelling of the story.

1569242739|5.0|As a breastfeeding mom to a baby with dairy and soy allergies, I was desperate for some sweets.  This book is amazing and always satisfies my sweet tooth!  You won't be disappointed with the recipes.<br /><br />I use almond milk in place of the soy milk because of allergies and still cannot say enough great things about the cupcakes.  This hasn't seemed to affect the quality or flavor of the cupcakes at all.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I thought it was clever the way it was written. It's a really sad subject, but it makes you remember how we all react differently and how most of the times we don't have the whole picture of what someone is going through.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I couldn't put it down. It is so addicting. It keeps you thinking and going. I can't wait for more levels
B00B5AP7NY|3.0|I didn't realize this movie was identical to the video game. My boys have put probably 50 hours into Lego Batman DC Heroes over the past year +. They've unlocked every character and probably consider this their favorite game of all time. So when the movie came out it seemed like it might be a fun experience. I should have guessed it was just a straight rehash of the game - right down to using in-game cut scenes as the movie. I don't know why I expected it to be different, but thought maybe they'd add SOME freshness to it. At any rate, if you've never played the game then you will like this movie. Lego movies are a lot of fun. However, if you HAVE played and won the game there really isn't a point.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|The reason I rated it just ok, is that it is not nearly as interesting as her other works, and the sentence constructions were much too convoluted to make it a good, flowing read.  I don't think it one of her better works.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|While this is a great farming and town building time management game, I'm missing the whole TRAIL part. There are loads of farming games out there, though, and I was nostalgic for &quot;Jimmy has been snakebit!&quot;.
B0063M22QO|5.0|this is a really intertaining game. good for hours of play. Challenging too, trying to find matches, because so many look alike.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I love this app so much it's the best I have  like a billion pictures that I saved again best at ever!!!!  :)
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Looks great and takes care of business. Buttons respond amazingly well and will definitely protect the sides. The headphone jack cut out is big enough for most regular aux cables but oversized ones will not work.
B00DJWV11I|3.0|Ok, I got the feeling probably from the first page that this was a reincarnation of Beautiful Bastard but decided to just go with it. After all I ADORE that book so I thought maybe I could make it through a similar story & I'm glad I did. I didn't just fall head over heals in love with Drew & Kate like I did Bennett & Chloe, but I did really enjoy the book. Of course MacKenzie & Drew's relationship and hysterical banter is the saving grace. It is priceless!<br /><br />I feel it is worth your time and money. Light hearted and several parts were literally laugh out loud funny.  I put it (almost) up there in humor with Seduction & Snacks, Wallbanger & Crazy Little Thing as far as light hearted and humorous love stories.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never wanted  the book to end! Such a meaningful, deeply felt book that captures your mind an  heart and leaves you feeling an appreciation for you  life an  the log  of others past,present an  future.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit to being very impatient with writers.  Mostly I put up with the book's I read.  I easily tire of the same voice, the same tricks and sentiments over and over, so much so that I often struggle to finish a book or don't at all.  The writing is so distracting.  This book was so much better.  I was held captive, surprised and completely so lost in the story that I really couldn't tell you anything about Howey's writing style.  I didn't even notice his voice.  That's how good a story teller he is.  At one point, completely out of the blue, he made my blood run cold and I sat, slack jawed, starring at my Kindle.  That only ever happened to me before once.  What a fun read!!!!!!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book kept me interested all the way through. I now am ready to see the movie. good book :)
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This book is the literary equivalent of comfort food, to be dipped into whenever you're bored with fancier fare, to be relished and read slowly, because you've probably read it before and know hat the ending is.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Love love love this movie. Perfect for both chick flick lovers and action lovers. A movie that both my husband and I were able to watch and he actually wanted to see it again.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game for the price... a little challenging at times but not too much. so far at least.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was taken aback by the season finale and can not wait until the 4th season begins!  Excellent writing and acting!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this was the first game my daughter got on her kindle and she plays it all the time, she has even let me wash the pets!
B0026IUXME|5.0|This is a great movie based on real life events in a muscian's life and how he became a survivor. We, as a family, loved it since we are musicians and know how music within can pull a person through life's challenges. The historical value is so important as well.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|got this for my 10 year old who loves all animals and she loves it - im glad it was free
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was well written but Gillian Flynn must have got sick of writing and just wanted to end the book. Overall, I'd say the ending ruined the book for me and wouldn't recommend it to others.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Even though this book got mixed reviews, I really liked it. I found it very interesting reading and could hardly put it down. I think J.K.

1476733953|5.0|There are thousands of eloquent reviews of Wool that try to explain the experience a reader can look forward to in the pages of Hugh Howey's remarkable first book in the Silo Trilogy. No matter how eloquent or passionate, they simply can't capture how truly, deeply, and immediately engrossed you'll become in the lives and adventures of these characters. Howey has crafted a world that is familiar, disorienting, claustrophobic, and expansive simultaneously. Wool will snare you in a trap that you keep hoping you'll never escape. It's the literary equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome. Like any of the handful of truly seminal post-apocalyptic worlds, visiting this horrific dystopia is so much d@*m fun that the end of the world seems a reasonable entry fee. Blah, blah, blah. Really, at this point just stop scrolling through reviews and calculating the ridiculous odds that you'll actually regret buying this book. Get [[ASIN:1476733953 Wool]], [[ASIN:1481983555 Shift - Omnibus Edition (Silo Saga) (Volume 2)]], and [[ASIN:1490904387 Dust (Silo Saga) (Volume 3)]] and start reading.
