1481879103|5.0|The premise of Dead Medium by Peter John, grabbed me right away - a reluctant \\"ghost\\" who can communicate with the living. The prologue begins like a classic ghost story but starting with chapter one, we learn the author is more than a very good storyteller, as we are taken by May Elizabeth, one of the great characters I've recently encountered. After that, he keeps us turning pages with an exciting plot and a sharp and clever wit. Avoiding spoilers, I must say the ending was the icing on the cake. Well done! Highly recommended.

0062209493|5.0|Great story!  The book was great.  I didn't want it to end.  Chris Kyle is an American hero who gave so much.  His family has given so much.  The book covered everything from the challenges of home, stresses of the war, the effects of war, and the dedication to America.  Chris's efforts continued even after he returned from the war helping out other military members struggling to return to normal life dealing with the residual effects of the war.<br /><br />The book led me to learn more about Chris.  I was saddened by the news of his death.  A hero taken too soon.  Chris and his family had overcome so much.<br /><br />I admire Chris for his dedication to family, friends, and America

B0053B347M|5.0|Doesn't matter if you use the sticky they come with or use your own glue/tape/whatever,  these things will ultimately fall off the hot slick vertical surface that is the back of your monitor.  I've got four of them mounted on four monitors.  I've just resigned myself to redoing the tape job every few months to whichever monitor decides it is time to shed the lights.  I don't mind this because they work so great at what they do.  In a dark environment they do wonders to lessen eye strain.<br /><br />Each string does have an in-line on-off switch but I hooked them all to a single USB hub so I can power them all up and down with a single switch (and only tie up a single USB port in the process).<br /><br />They emit a kind of blueish white light.  I'd prefer a little whiter light but these are more than satisfactory as is.<br /><br />The string of LEDs is about 15&#34;, the connecting wire is another 42&#34;.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, especially at the eight bucks a pop I paid for them here.

B003CH9PTU|5.0|With the end of the series at hand I wanted to revisit the first season for any insight. It's amazing how well the series was staged in the first season. This wild journey with Walt and Jesse and Skyler et al unfolds with piercing drama and errie foreshadowing. The surprising humor leaves you questioning your moral compass, something I miss in the later seasons.
140006922X|1.0|On the &#34;Cobear Report&#34; TV program), Mr. Aslan claimed this book contained a lot of insight into the personal life of Jesus as a man (as the title says &#34;the life & times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34;).  I don't know why I was so stupid to believe someone actually had more intimate information about Jesus never before revealed,  but I did.  I bit hook line and sinker, and bought the book. I was so disappointed!  What I got instead was a well written history book about a lot of gory kings & emperors in some very bloody wars - from about 500 BC to 500 AD (plus or minus several hundred years here and there - he skipped around from one century to another quite frequently - so it's hard to remember).<br /><br />Also, Aslan clearly does not believe Jesus was more than just a mortal man.  Although I believe differently, I was still okay with that. I was anxious to  read more about Jesus's life from any point of view.  Unfortunately the book says very little about Jesus.  If you want to read about some very sadistic societies who had nothing better to do than slaughter each other, then this is the book for you.  I just felt like the victim of a ruse.<br /><br />Additionally, readers need to watch for Mr Aslan's own unverified yarns.  One example:  He ASSUMES (as he admits) that accounts of Jesus's birth by TWO separate prophets in the New Testament who were UNAWARE of the other's account (which he also freely admits) was FABRICATED by BOTH biblical authors.  Yep, Aslan claims that BOTH Matthew & Luke - independently made up the same story - supposedly to match some Old Testament prophecy.  Since Matthew and Luke were completely UNAWARE of the other one's birth account when they each made their record, it seems to me that it is MORE LOGICAL to conclude they are similar because THAT WAS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.<br /><br />Just wanted other folks to know what they were buying here.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is one of very few movies that deals with the hugely important subject of invasion of privacy `gone wild' and the resultant destruction of individual rights that inevitably follows from it.  Cameras are everywhere and citizens willingly acquiesce to the total lack of freedom and privacy of their surveillance state, apparently sacrificing their freedom for supposed safety.  Little robots (drones anyone?) inspect the premises of citizens anytime and any place, should any of the other ubiquitous monitoring devices be insufficient.  Beginning to sound familiar?  Warrants become a thing of the past as the ability of law enforcement to predict crime and criminals becomes unquestionable.  The fiction and fantasy of Minority Report are nearly 100% accurate metaphors for the near total loss of freedom and privacy in modern Amerika, where the \\"Precrime Unit\\" is not a unit, per se, but is instead an intended result.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays one of the perpetrators of the New World Order who gets incriminated by a fatal flaw in the system.  He then must reacquire some of his lost privacy and freedom if he is to survive and catch the criminal who has \\"gamed\\" the system and arranged for Cruise's demise.<br /><br />While Minority Report is action-packed and reliant on science fiction and the great special effects that bring it to life, it is the underlying foundational theme/plot that those action-scenes and special effects build upon that makes this movie the outstanding success that it is.  Minority Report is metaphorical science fiction derived from tragic fact.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a great novel that balances international intrigue, quirky romance, & vigilante crime fighting.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a candidate for the overused imaginary award category of \\"the greatest movie ever made\\" simply because it is the greatest movie of its prescient time.  It was made at a time when most other media channels had been successfully censored and controlled by Corporate Big Brother (as they still are to a large degree), while a united cabal of Corporate and billionaire power dragged the United States to the precipice of fascism.  Movies were one of the few ways to get a democratic message across.  The success of the Wachowski brothers gave them a freedom of expression that few others in the media had, a freedom protected by their uncanny ability to make scads of money when left to their own creative devices.  The fear of killing the goose that laid the Golden Egg trumped the fear of freedom of expression.<br /><br />\\"V\\" builds on the concept created in \\"The Matrix\\", by far the greatest movie of the Matrix Trilogy: the notion of a totalitarian regime that exerts its control over the masses in part by carefully crafted and controlled reality creation, and then goes much further.  Unlike the Matrix, V clearly establishes connections to real life events and persons, both actual and projected, such as when it portrays the United States as having descended into anarchy as blowback for its initiation of illegal wars of aggression (deemed illegal by the \\"quaint\\" Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg trials), complete with demonstrations with protest signs expressly identifying then-president Bush.  Right wing corporate propagandists are accurately symbolized by a composite character (Dominic) that is an irritating amalgam of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and similar right wing corporate mouthpieces from England.  Second-in-Command \\"Creepy\\" Creedy is an inspired interpretation/extrapolation of America's then Second (?)-in-Command vice president Dick Cheney.  John Hurt comes full-circle from victim of totalitarianism in the movie \\"1984\\" to totalitarian victimizer in \\"V\\" as the inspired choice as a prophetic tie-in to George Orwell's \\"1984\\", complete with numerous spot-on allusionary warnings left to be identified by the viewer.  Hurt's character unites, leads, coerces, and bullies the futuristic right wing regime into a cohesive controlling unit of Fascist England with England being symbolic of the West in general, while simultaneously dealing with the opposition as brutally as possible to thwart the will to resist.<br /><br />Although one could surmise from the movie's title that the hero, \\"V\\", utilizes his more-likely-than-comic-book-usual superpowers to become yet another avenger of the many wrongs perpetrated by Evil, a usually accurate conclusion that can nevertheless be quite entertaining, but quite wrong in this case.  For while V has some very impressive abilities attributed to nerve damage caused by his being the subject of biotoxic experimentation, he is merely the (barely) human vessel containing the means by which those held captive by fascism are freed.  V is the repository and transmitter of ideas, and it is ultimately those ideas which are the Hero of the movie, a very unusual cinematic proposition indeed.  And isn't that often a key component of great movies: unusual cinematic propositions?<br /><br />PS  For more enlightenment as to how this whole scenario will play out, read the Pulitzer Prize Winning \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", by William Shirer, from which a startling number of similarities to modern events can readily been seen, and watch the great movie \\"Judgment at Nuremberg\\" to see what generally lay in store for the surviving perpetrators.

B000QGEB12|5.0|At first glance `Kung Fu Hustle' seems to be just another very well done Kung Fu movie from China on the order of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon & Co... and the plethora of first class Jet Li action martial art movies.  The fight scenes in Hustle are every bit as good as any of those movies, but it has a plot unlike any of those movies.  A plot, in my opinion that is BETTER than any of those movies.<br /><br />Yes, `Hustle' is funny, an amazing accomplishment across the usually insurmountable language and cultural barriers between China and the West (which made Bruce Lee's movies unintentionally funny at the wrong times and for the wrong reasons, and made intended funny scenes fall flat with Western audiences), but also a movie with a great historical message.  The unwitting viewer is receiving a history lesson while being entertained by great plot and action sequences.  This is because the Axe Gang in the movie is a fictional (and often befuddled) derivation of a very real Chinese historical reality.  The movie is greatly entertaining without being even a tiny bit preachy...just your basic Good vs. Evil with a unique twist, plus a great romance to boot!<br /><br />During the first half of the 20th Century, China was run by corrupt regional business magnates, often romanticized as \\"warlords\\", who headed regional criminal business syndicates, often deceptively described as mere \\"gangs\\".  These various \\"gangs\\" relied on enforcers to enforce their monopolistic and criminal will, the most famous of which were the so-call Axe Men, from which we get our modern terms \\"Hatchet Men\\" and \\"Hatchet Job\\".  In fact, China's leader before Mao was Chiang Kai Shek, a former member of one these criminal gangs who was regrettably backed by the United States.  The evil that characterized the criminal gangs of pre-Mao China is symbolized in the movie by the perfectly named \\"The Beast\\", the world's most prolific and psychopathic killer, who symbolizes the gangster-for-hire killers/enforcers of China, a symbolization that is characteristic of criminal syndicates (what Mussolini admirably and accurately termed \\"corporations\\", or corporati).  Sing, the unlikely hero fantastically played by Stephen Chow, becomes transformed during the course of the movie as the embodiment of Good.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle was one of the few movies I've seen that was so damn good I had to watch it several times in a row.

1476712042|5.0|Awesome book. I felt exactly everything that Abby and Trav were feeling, so I was happy, crushed, on cloud nine, devastated, I cried and smiled, laughed and despaired, hoped and got mad. Till now \\"Twilight\\" was the book that more than any other book made me feel like I was Bella, but now I was Abby, and Abby's and Trav's pain were mine, so were happiness and despair. My heart raced like if I was the one in love. It hit me like a tsunam at 300 miles/hour, and while passing through me it left something inside me, changed my heart and my soul, I couldn't stop reading so I finished it in 2 days and then I missed it so much, but I couldn't bear to read it again, it was too much. I am going to, anyway, definitely. One of the best books I've ever read, if not the number 1. Now I can't see a motorcycle or a pigeon without feeling melancholic. And I can't listen Pink's \\"Just give me a reason\\" without connecting it to the book. LoveditLoveditLoveditLoveditLoveditLoveditLoveditLoveditLovedit.

B00DY951RQ|5.0|[NOTICE:  It has come to my attention there is an audible glitch on the 4th disk of the Deluxe version (which is the actual \\"Self Portrait\\" album remastered).  48 seconds into \\"Copper Kettle\\" (the best song on the original album, ironically enough) the track skips.  This glitch has been present on other releases as well, notably the 1980s reissues.  Apparently someone wrote in to Amazon to explain the glitch, and their answer was just mention it in their review so other people don't get stuck with the glitch! Mike London - 8-30-2013]<br /><br />\\"Self Portrait\\" has always been one of Dylan's most inscrutable albums, which is saying a lot, as Dylan is notorious difficult to pin-down to any one pre-defined image that his rapid fans (of which I happily count myself as one of them) or his famously troubled relationship with the rock press.  Released in 1970, \\"Self Portrait\\" follows the very brief 1969 LP \\"Nashville Skyline\\", itself something of a head-scratcher for Dylan followers in the late 1960s. And make no mistake, the famed opening salvo of Greil Marcus's famous \\"Rolling Stone\\" review \\"What is this s--?\\" was by far the general consensus of \\"Self Portrait\\", with some going so far as to suggest that the breakup of The Beatles was the end of the 1960s, and Self Portrait was the end of Bob Dylan, effectively ending the two most potent musical forces in the 1960s counterculture.<br /><br />The release itself is in two forms: a two disk set with 35 tracks, and a four disk set with the complete Isle of Wight on a third disk and a remastered version of the original album on the fourth disk.  The four disk set is, like \\"The Bootleg Series Vol 8\\", cost prohibitive to own.  The record comprises of \\"Nashville Skyline\\" outtakes, \\"New Morning\\" Outtakes, the long known but uncirculating \\"Only a Hobo\\" from the \\"Greatest Hits Vol III\\" sessions, and obviously \\"Self Portrait\\", with the lion share's going to SP.  Despite its title, there is a Basement Tapes recording of \\"Minstrel Boy\\"from 1967 included, which from a recording sessions perspective is the single biggest revelation yet unveiled in \\"The Bootleg Series\\" - NO ONE knew that \\"Minstrel Boy\\" originated during the Basement Tapes era, let alone that a BT recording even existed!  One disappointing fact is that some of the Isle of Wight performances appear on both Disk 2 and Disk 3 (if you get the deluxe version of this set) which creates unnecessary duplication of material.<br /><br />Hyperbole aside, So what does \\"Another Self Portrait\\" tell us about the original \\"Self Portrait\\"?  Simple.  \\"Self Portrait\\" should have been far richer than its detractors will allow for, that it has a sever identity crisis, and that, of all Dylan's albums, it is a key to understanding and \\"unlocking\\" the \\"enigma\\" of who Dylan actually is (the answer - a musical chamaeleon, a cultural transmitter of pre-rock American musical forms who inputs little to none of his own identity in his work, only excepting his vast encyclopedic love of pre-rock traditions).<br /><br />So, what is that identity crisis?  Answer: \\"Self Portrait\\" falls somewhere in between a legitimate follow-up to \\"Nashville Skyline\\", a slight country album, and a wilfully perverse screw-you to his fans.  This tension between a legitimate artistic statement and a \\"Leave me alone attitude!\\" makes the original release so fascinating.  Listening to \\"Another Self Portrait\\" is revelatory - it's obvious that, listening to these outtakes, had the album been sequenced properly, we could have had a fantastic, cohesive Dylan album that, while radically from his 1960s' work, would have shown just how masterfully he was at interperting other people's work.  \\"Another Self Portrait\\" also shows that, at least originally, the project began as a serious album, and not a red herring to throw off his followers.<br /><br />As is typical with so much of Dylan's output, the outtakes say as much (and in the case of Self Portrait, MORE) about a particular album as the songs that actually make the final product.  There is simply no reasonable explanation as to why songs like \\"Thirsty Boots\\", the stunning \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"Annie's Going to Sing Her Song\\", and \\"Railroad Bill\\" did not make the final cut.  Dylan's vocals are fantastic throughout; nuanced, compelling, hard-hitting.<br /><br />Compare these tracks to what DID make the album: two versions of \\"Alberta\\" (itself a good song, but the takes aren't really that different to merit the inclusion of both), two different versions of \\"In Search of Little Sadie\\" (though with quite different arrangements), a double tracked version of Dylan dueting with himself on Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\", which is so bad it almost sounds like Dylan's doing a sendup of Simon, and four badly mixed, badly sounding Isle of Wight performances.  Indeed, the live rendition of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" sounds like a parady of the masterful original, a gross reminder of just how far removed Dylan wanted to be from his adoring fan base.  Songs like \\"Copper Kettle\\" and \\"Days of `49\\" show encouraging signs of what Dylan was up too.<br /><br />\\"Another Self Portrait\\" also reveals that \\"Nashville Skyline\\", \\"Self Portrait\\", and \\"New Morning\\" (released a mere FOUR months after \\"Self Portrait\\") is much more homogenous artistically than the critics would lead you to believe.  The commonly accepted narrative in rock criticism is that Dylan quickly recorded \\"New Morning\\" after the disastrous reception to \\"Self Portrait\\".  \\"Another Self Portrait\\" reveals a different narrative however; there is little to differentiate the \\"New Morning\\" sessions from the \\"Self Portrait\\" sessions in either style or content, with the only main difference being Dylan began writing more original material during the latter sessions (much like he did with \\"The Basement Tapes\\").  However, it's notable that seven of the nine covers from the 1973 \\"Dylan\\" album (which Dylan has disowned, and was released without his input as revenge by Columbia when he left for David Geffen's newly formed Asylum Records) hail from the \\"New Morning\\" sessions, proving Dylan was just as interested as interpreting and playing other people's music as he was performing his own.<br /><br />So what makes \\"Self Portrait\\" so inscurtable?  Well, first off, it's discerning Dylan's intent.  What was he trying to do, or accomplish, with this double LP?<br /><br />If you read Dylan's various statements throughout the years, you will get conflicting reports.  The most commonly accepted explanation (and one advocated by Greil Marcus in the liner notes) is Dylan was trying to \\"shed\\" his audience.  Dylan himself said as much in a Rolling Stone interview from 1984.<br /><br />\\" I wish these people would just forget about me. I wanna do something they can't possibly like, they can't relate to. They'll see it, and they'll listen, and they'll say, 'Well, let's get on to the next person. He ain't sayin' it no more. He ain't given' us what we want,' you know? They'll go on to somebody else. But the whole idea backfired. Because the album went out there, and the people said, 'This ain't what we want,' and they got more resentful. And then I did this portrait for the cover. I mean, there was no title for that album. I knew somebody who had some paints and a square canvas, and I did the cover up in about five minutes. And I said, 'Well, I'm gonna call this album Self Portrait.'\\"<br /><br />While it is impossible to speak to another person's motivations fully and with equal authority to that person himself, I personally believe that this explanation is reducing the truth about \\"Self Portrait\\" to a much more limited capacity than it really was, at least in 1970.  Looking back throughout the years, Dylan may have analyzed himself more and more and come up with the explanation he was trying to deal with his frustrations with his vampire fanbase (who he described in the same interview as \\"sucking the blood\\" from him), and that may very well be part of his motivation for recording of \\"Self Portrait\\".<br /><br />However, there was always some evidence (on both the album itself and contemporary interviews circa 1970) against that being the only reason why Dylan put out \\"Self Portrait\\", and with \\"The Bootleg Series 10: Another Self Portrait\\", that evidence has only grown exponentially.  Despite what Dylan would later say, interviews given around 1970 carries far more weight, as Dylan himself was closer to the actual event.  Like everyone else, as the years go back memories fade and we often forget what we were really thinking, or come up with alternate explanations.  In a 1971 interview with notorious A. J. Weberman, who knew more about Dylan's (literal) trash than Dylan' probably did, Dylan defended the album, angrily blasting Greil Marcus.  Robert Shelton asked Dylan in 1986 about Self Portrait, and, notably, he differed from his official reason of audience shedding: he said that songs like \\"Blue Moon\\" were an expression, and had someone like Elvis Presley or the Isley Brothers had released that album, then the response would have been much different.<br /><br />Allen Ginsberg, who had known Dylan since the early 1960s, went on tour with him in 1975.  A relevant quote from Bill Morgan's biography of Ginsberg is one of the keys to unlocking the mystery of \\"Self Portrait\\".  \\"The more Allen thought about Dylan, the more he realised that he didn't really know him at all, and he commented that he thought it was possible there was no \\"him\\" to know.  He was beginning to think Dylan didn't have a \\"self\\" at all\\".<br /><br />This concept of Dylan not having a \\"self\\", albeit rather abstract and perhaps hard to define in a practical sense, to me brings intense illumination on not only this era of Dylan's recording career (1969-1971), but to the entirety of his career in general.  If you accept Ginsberg's assertation that Dylan has no self, the title of \\"Self Portrait\\", a double album of then contemporary covers and reimaginings of old folk songs, no longer has the smug ironical tone that some reviewers have mistakenly assigned to the project, but rather a deep truth about Dylan himself that has only been born out in subsequent years.  And what is that truth?<br /><br />Ginsberg was famous for recording his life in great detail, and reading through his works you get a real sense of his life, his personality, and who he was as a person and what he stood for and was concerned with.  In contrast, Ezra Pound's first major book of poetry was entitled \\"Personae\\", where you never hear Pound's own true voice, but rather a kaleidoscope of different voices and different masks.  Even in \\"The Cantos\\", other than Pound's economic theories, you will learn far more about Pound's sense of history than about his character and soul.<br /><br />Likewise, Dylan has always been more a conglomeration of differing traditions than an original force, unique unto himself.  The title \\"Self Portrait\\" was not meant to be ironic; Dylan finds his identity through his own synthesis of traditional, Americana music.  While that may be a very broad claim to make, I am able to provide a good deal of evidence for such an assertation.  While not one solitary piece of evidence can conclusively prove one way or the other that Dylan's identity is not his own, the growing amount of evidence can be used in conjunction with each other that, quite convincingly, Dylan's real identity is traditional music, and, with one notable exception, we have never been very close to who Dylan \\"really is\\", because he really isn't anyone.<br /><br />Now, any hypothesis worth its salt should be able to accurately account for various, otherwise inscrutable facts and phenomena.  The idea that Dylan doesn't have a \\"self\\", or, at least, use his music to express himself (far removed from \\"confessional\\" poets like Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, and Anne Sexton, and much more in tune with Pound and T. S. Eliot's historical mode of thought) is quite a suitable framework to explain several otherwise odd facets of Dylan.  It also explains his disdain for politics; Dylan was never political, despite what his followers wanted.<br /><br />Before we examine the evidence, let's first examine the one sore spot in the theory, and the closest Dylan has ever came to his own personal life: \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", his 1975 album.  Triggered by the disolution of his marriage to Sara Lowndes, the record is a heart-breaking divorce album.  Yet even here, Dylan throws some curve balls.  \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" is far from a straight cry of pain, and is a jarring narrative that moves all over both time and space.  Secondly, \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a complex, lyrically demanding story straight out of the American west.  However, excepting those two songs, the rest is an unusually straight reading of the pain that Dylan was going through.  Jakob Dylan has said that album documented the dissolution of his parent's divorce and failing marriage.  The album was wrought in pain, and when an interviewer once asked Dylan about the album's popularity, he said he did not understand why people enjoyed that much pain in their life.<br /><br />What is more revealing, however, is what happened AFTER \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".  He recorded \\"Desire\\", a deeply detached album emotionally (with the only exception being the last song, \\"Sara\\") that delves into strong, lyrical story telling, especially coming off the heels of such an emotionally naked album like \\"BOTT\\".  Equally interesting, after \\"BOTT\\", Dylan wrote several songs that were as emotionally intense as its predecessor but would not record them, electing instead to go with \\"Desire\\".  \\"BOTT\\" is far more an anomaly in Dylan's career than anything else he has put out, with the closest equivilant being \\"Time Out of Mind\\", another emotionally charged, deeply painful album.  (I always felt TOOM was BOTT aged twenty two years).<br /><br />First off is examining Dylan's career in its entirety.  The early 1960shas Dylan going through his troubadour, Woody Guthrie phase and political protesting; the mid 1960s' moving through surreal lyrical work which is heavily indebted to Beat literature and French symbolists; the late 1960s tapping into that \\"Old Weird America\\" as evidenced on \\"The Basement Tapes\\" (which, notably, the majority of which is still commercially unavailable), and then turning out a brief country album with the opening track being a rather off-kilter duet with Johnny Cash.  Even \\"John Wesley Harding\\" sounds much more an aural history of the United States post Civil-War, taping into the vast mythos of the American West, than ever revealing a single thing about who Dylan is as a person.<br /><br />Post \\"Self Portrait\\" (which for reasons of space I won't elaborate too greatly), we have the travelogue album of \\"Desire\\" and  the incredibly strange, wilfuly obtuse \\"Street-Legal\\".  In the 1980s, he went through a career crisis, with several listless albums, often blocking release of superior songs on these admittedly drab albums (with the most famous example being \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" from \\"Infidels\\", itself one of the stronger albums released during this period).  According to \\"Chronicles\\", in 1988, after a disastrous tour with the Grateful Dead, he realised he was not connecting with his music anymore, and had a personal revelation on how he needed to play and commenced with the Never Ending Tour, which proved to be a true turning point.<br /><br />In the 1990s, after two folk albums, he released \\"Time Out of Mind\\", which Dylan described as a deliberate attempt to make an old-time folky record, like the songs he would listen too back in the 1950s.  Every subsequent album (2001's \\"Love and Theft\\", 2006's \\"Modern Times\\", 2009's \\"Together Through Life\\", and 2012's \\"Tempest\\"), Dylan plays with pre-rock, old timey musical forms, each deeply rooted in the American musical body of work from the late 19th/early 20th century.  Listening to his work, never once do you feel like you're are truly getting to know Dylan intimately as a person (except fro TOOM, the emotional successor to BOTT); however, you do come away with a much deeper understanding of the cultural heritage of Americana music.<br /><br />We also have the Christian trilogy, which may very well be the closest we get to Dylan as an actual person; religious themes have always ran deeply through his work, far more deeply and important to him than being a mere superficial synthesis of his traditional interpretations of pre-rock music.<br /><br />In 1997, Dylan even said the following: \\"Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \\"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\\" or \\"I Saw the Light\\"--that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.\\"  In promotion for the 2009 \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" LP, he told interviewer Bill Flannagan he was a true believer when talking about \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\\"<br /><br />I think that, stepping out further from just religious concerns, this quote, in context with everything else, shows us just how important the music of \\"The Bootleg Series 10\\" truly is to Dylan.  In an outtake version of \\"Political World\\" from 1989's \\"Oh Mercy\\", Dylan sings the lines (deleted in the final released version) that there are woman, wine, and songs, but without the songs you won't get far in this world, which is one of the most revealing lines he ever wrote.  Likewise, the title of his panned movie \\"Masked and Anonymous\\", accurately describes Dylan himself, moving through life, inscurtable, unknowable.<br /><br />Marcus said \\"I once said I'd buy an album of Dylan breathing heavily. I still would. But not an album of Dylan breathing softly.  Ginsberg said in Scorcess's documentary \\"No Direction Home\\": \\"He had become at one with, or became identical with, his breath.  Dylan had become a column of air so to speak, where his total physical and mental focus was this single breath coming out of his body.  He had found a way in public to be almost like a shaman with all of his intelligence and consciousness focused on his breath.\\"  If anything, \\"Self Portrait\\" shows Dylan mastering the art of the Buddhist breath.<br /><br />I always thought, upon hearing Dylan was releasing a bootleg installment on \\"Self Portrait\\", that it was an incredibly strange choice, given how much everyone always hated the record (especiallt with the rumoured super-fan dream choice of a \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" installment).  Listening now, though, I understand.<br /><br />So, what does this all admittedly long discussion of Dylan's career and music (hard to succinctly compress for an Amazon review) mean for \\"Another Self Portrait\\"?  Simply this: \\"Another Self Portrait\\", appropriately enough, is probably the single most revealing release Dylan has issued, which is quite appropriate given its title.<br /><br />Decades ago, Dylan gave us the key to who he was as an artist, and we resented him.  Now, so many years later, we find Dylan was right after all - he is a mirror of Americana Music.  As a critic once said, Dylan has \\"vanished into a folk tradition by his own making\\".  Vanish, though, is not the right word.  The correct term would be \\"Homecoming\\".
1594630844|5.0|What a great book I go back to it time and time again some truly great life lessons here. Thank you!
B006TTC54A|5.0|First off, the sound track is awesome.  I love it.  The dry humor and acting on the part of John Belushi and Dan Aykoyd take this movie over the top.  The list of singers appearing and their various jam sessions bring me back again and again to watch this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey. Can't wait for Season 4 to find out what happens next. The end was very unexpected.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|I grew up during this time and to me it is a true American classic of that time period.  The sound track, scenes of drive-in burger joints, and crusing the main drag looking at girls and cars bring back so many fond memories.  Just like the some of the actors, I headed to Vietnam after high school and grew up to the real world.  What a great movie to bring back fond moments.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|A litle dissapointing after his other two surperb books which I enjpyed very much.  The story jumped around too much.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|When I came back from Vietnam I headed to college.  Although I never joined any frats I knew many who did and they centered their college experience around this movie.  I've watched this movie many times enjoying the antics of these fellows.  Amazing the stunts you could get away with back then.  When I was in graduate school I attended a toga party.  What a ball!  Play the sound &#34;Shout&#34; and acting like a idiot was awesome.  Animal House helps re-live some of those moments.
1594204217|4.0|Lot of valuable information. The first section on fire was a little boring(my opinion) as I am not a big meat eater. Overall the book ha a a good message as well as a lot of tips on cooking. I like the fact that this book explains how we deviated from the act of cooking in the last few decades and went for the easy 'fast food ' option. This book definitely made me rethink on how I cook and how often and I am definitely going to cook healthier and more often.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|A tale of how life can change and the ties of family. Also the powerful influence culture has on a persons life. I really liked reading more about Afghanistan. Enjoyed the Kite Runner more but this is also a great story..
B008602KQI|4.0|One of the better book to movie adaptations recently. Saying that, it is a movie worth watching if you are a fan of dystopian worlds.
B005NAD6Q2|5.0|Stephanie Plum is the best female odd ball bounty hunter around, in what seems to be a totally dysfunctional town, which creates some moments of totally hilarious fun. Love your work Janet!!
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|More complex than you usually get today, with top notch performances. And it certainly showed the different honor systems between the American soldiers, the British, and the Japanese. Like three societies on different planets.<br />Most effectively it, it clearly demonstrated how war and honor like that lead to utter destruction and madness when pitted against each other. And themselves.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great story with a surprise ending.  I never saw the twist coming. Can't wait for her next book to come out.  Loved it...
B00271B752|4.0|What I like about these older movies I've seen lately because of Prime, is that they were primarily character studies. You don't see that much in movies anymore. The musical scores though. The score for this one was so bad and way too loud that it distracted from the story. But I think Pacino turned in an especially fine performance. And this is totally beside the point, but I like this look on him.
B008M34INW|5.0|Fun action movie from start to end. Classic Mel Gibson movie. Gritty, a little brutal (cool). good gun play. great camera work. Picture quality was awesome on my tv.
B008Y0IKEQ|4.0|The story is about the death of the Takemundo Clan. (Spelling?) Again, those stories of the fifteenth century samurai are staged like plays, and the actors overact like stage actors who haven't made the adjustment to screen. I don't know if that is typical of Japanese films, I haven't watched enough of them. It could just be this famous director. Again...the name escapes me. I just got off work! Sorry.But he's the most famous one! Did the Seven Samurai.<br />But the final battle scene is beautifully heart wrenching. And the Shadow Warrior's conflicting feelings and relationships did touch me.<br />The art direction was stunning.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I didn't want to put it down! I am a gardener & really appreciated the meanings & how the flowers were used in the story. It also told a journey of how life can be so challenging & yet so meaningful to a young woman like Victoria who was so alone & could still find the love that made her feel complete.
1416550550|5.0|This is a very interesting book, I'm loving it. It was recommended by my Book Club and I believe it is going to a great discussion.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have read some about the search for the historical Jesus, while in seminary and beyond.  This is the best I have read.  I came away with a clear understanding of not just the Jesus the person, but as importantly the cultural-political-social context.  Thanks for a great and informative read.
B0019IB0II|4.0|I found this account of brain injury fascinating. The scientist-author's conveyed her experience in an understandable and touching manner. . . also uplifting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am going to tell you that when the 0.7.3 update came out,I was so exited!I got interested first when my brother was playing it and it looked so fun!I recommend it to the people because it is awesomer than how the description expressed it.get the app.it's your seven bucks worth!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|movie with a good plot and characters who have made mistakes  and have faults,.  nice for a change , yet they still retain some caring for people
B009AY04A8|4.0|for this genre its a good game. nice graphics and basic puzzles. I am enjoying the somewhat dark plot line and the fact that they did not animate only the characters mouths like a bad cartoon.  I have two complaints. the ho game to find stuff in the dark using a flashlight is to easy to be interpreted as a click by the game engine causing a penalty.  not much of a problem as you get a generous ten minutes to finish each section.  the other small annoyance is that by separating the dialogue into a bubble for each sentence makes it seem longer than it is as you have to click thru them to read.  it would be better to break it up by paragraphs instead.<br /><br />some of the music can be repetitive but I do enjoy the spooky music when in ghost mode.<br /><br />all in all a good game by a hands on company.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and its like I have my own horse to take care of. Don't hesitate. Get the game. It's free!!!!!
1741798450|3.0|I had for editions given Lonely Planet's Indonesia guide 4 stars despite all its errors and shortcomings just because it remained the only practical guide covering the whole country, but this new edition is so much poorer than [[ASIN:1741048303 the previous one]] that it no longer deserves the same rating.<br /><br />For a start, it suffers from the same shortcomings plaguing all new LP editions: far fewer accommodation options which are no longer listed ordered by price, maps less detailed, color pages on poorer quality paper, etc.<br />But the major step back is that content has been cut back seriously. This edition is 100 pages shorter than the previous one, and it shows. Entire islands and even archipelagos have vanished from the book, especially in the Maluku region, but also in Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi and Sumatra. Very little in the way of new destinations has been added to compensate for those losses. Editing has also changed in a curious way: The regions themselves, once listed in a logical largely west-to-east order are now listed in a completely random order, with the furthest and least visited region of Papua now in the middle of the book, before the much more visited and accessible western and central regions of Sumatra and Sulawesi. Oh, and it's full of badly misspellt Indonesian place names, too.<br /><br />After all these complaints, do I have anything good to say?<br />Well, if this will be your first trip to the country, and you are happy to visit only the more touristy areas, you will probably find that this book still gives enough information for you - and definitely more than any other guide to the country. It does still cover all the popular places first-timers are likely to want to go to, and it does still give actual (though changing!) prices for accommodation and transport.<br /><br />But if you are a regular visitor to Indonesia and already have the previous edition(s), no need to get this new one.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I haven't actually played this, but my grandkids love it and it keeps them entertained when I have other things to do!
B004B32532|4.0|Jodorowskys best film, this is were his visual and poetic flare go by the hand of a great narrative and story to create a one of a kind horror film, i cannot recommend it enough, but the transfer has a lot of things that could have been fixed, like washes and some grainess, looks like it was done by way of digital noise reduction, the upconverted dvd looks like the bluray in most scenes and has the same extras, so if you are not that picky, get the dvd if you can find it cheaper.. Its not a bad transfer, but a lot has yet to be done, the extras are great, very informative and interesting, worthy of criterion standards. Great edition!
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|I bought this for my ipod. It was the first &#34;motion&#34; game I ever bought. It has a sweet story line and my grandson loves to play it when we're driving. Helps with coordination skills, too.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|loved the movie in 3d and the acting is great.<br />My son(whom I purchased the movie for) enjoyed the 3d experience,also.
B00CBT048Q|5.0|Now whenever I see a picture of Matt Damon I see Jason Bourne - what a terrific actor who is able to bring this character to life and keep us on the edge of our seats.  Terrific writing and film editing - gold stars to everyone - this is another keeper for sure.
0979019710|5.0|I have always been a morning person but was never sure what to do when I was up early. Hal has helped me get my day more structured and positive. I find when I do the work in the morning it changes the way my day goes. If I do not do the work my day is in a constant state of reacting to situations. Get the book and reduce the stress in your life. And isn't that what we all want? To reduces the stress and enjoy more of our life.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fantastic graphics, great sound fx and great gameplay. Definitely recommended for all kindle fire hd users. Encountered no problems so far :D
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautifully written by an author who knows how to weave a story from many different threads, and successfully tie them - and the characters, together.  You'll weep for the separated brother and sister, and marvel at the dynamics that exist between others
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game has good graphics, it's free and has good content. I recommend it to anyone who likes shooter games.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|First off, I thought \\"Nightmare\\" was a weak album that had four or five amazing songs. The rest of the album seemed very meek and slow. So, I was worried that AX7's next album would be similar. I was wrong! This album is great! The strongest album since \\"City of Evil\\", with multiple 6-minute songs, pounding drums, and spiraling guitar solos. It has the feel of Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\", if you need something to compare it to. Highly recommended!
B0041D843M|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. It is an eye opening, informative book. I wasn't even finished the book when I decided to become vegan forever. It is full of evidence for the switch from normal American diet full of meats, dairy and processed foods to a whole food plant based diet. It was easy to read and enjoyable.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Love this alarm clock. I use it more than any other alarm. It does so much more than your average alarm clock and it's endlessly customizable. I only wish there were away to skip the next alarm ina reoccuring alarm without turning the alarm on and off.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This was an was an extremely well done and clever prequel to the Wizard of Oz.  Casting and acting was wonderful. The special effects are amazing and the 3-D version is brilliant. I really don't understand how anyone could not love this movie.  It is campy, in an Oz type of way, which exactly what it should be! The film transitions are thoughtful and Oz in 3-D is beyond beautiful. I want to watch it again already and be transported back to Oz!
0810993139|5.0|The first book was the best in the series even though the others were good, too.  Great book - funny!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a book I missed in high school and college. What a shame! I love it! If you haven't read it, you must.
B00DY951RQ|4.0|The 2-CD Another Self Portrait \\"album\\" is a deliberate hodge-podge like its parent from back in the day. But I don't know why the producers felt the need to include an unreleased Basement Tapes song and inferior out-takes from Nashville Skyline. Neither of these ideas fit the mold here, for opposite reasons. One is too low-fi (and old) and the others are too clean sounding (and unimportant). Detracting further value, they are placed right next to each other in the running order. I'll end up making my own playlist with the songs that would be appropriate for \\"Another Self Portrait\\". There are a lot of goodies -- maybe one CD worth, plus a few too many throwaway versions that probably should have remained in the vault.<br /><br />One more complaint before I get to the good stuff. This would have been the perfect time to finally get that vinyl-only \\"Dylan\\" record on CD. It is cut from the same cloth as many of the SP recordings, and it needs to see the light of the new millennium. Dylan himself once said he didn't think it was so bad. I think it's great, and it would have made the ideal addition to this box.<br /><br />I sprang for the deluxe version mainly because I wanted to hear the Isle of Wight concert in full (and re-mixed). I was not disappointed. These performances are what we have been waiting for. They fill the gap between familiar live Dylan incarnations. The Band is on fire, and the arrangements are sometimes startlingly different from any you have heard before. When I heard those couple of live songs on the original SP album, I thought they were taken from a sub-par concert. I could not have been more wrong.
159463176X|4.0|Beautifully written stories of interwoven lives and a little Afghan history, but I felt that it went on too long.  I was eagerly waiting to read about the reunion of brother and sister, but was sidetracked by the story of the life of the Greek doctor--interesting in itself, but not all that relevant.  I was also a little disappointed by the end, as I was in The Kite Runner.  A happier ending to both books would have been more satisfying to me.
0399128964|5.0|The book is in great condition for being from 1984. The book tells a great tale, paralleled by few others. Highly recommended.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a movie about one of our greatest presidents AND vampires. What I got was 105 minutes of fun.<br /><br />I put my disbelief on hold, sat back, ate some popcorn, and enjoyed the show.<br /><br />Great costumes, quite a bit of actual history thrown in, good if not super acting, tongue-in-cheek humor, disgusting vampires, and I am glad I watched this little gem.

Ritchie puts his energy into playing the guitar,and is right on throughout, the band is solid as well, a document of the end of Ritchies rock era, just a great showcase.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The download was a little balky at first on my Kindle Fire, but once I restarted it, it finally finished up and was ready to go. It is very much like \\"Temple Run\\" but way better. Why? One word.<br /><br />MINIONS!<br /><br />Do you need any reason other than that?<br /><br />I didn't think so.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It's still a good movie, but I felt some parts were still forced into the plot just for it to make sense.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so cool they just got update 0.7.3 which hives Sun moon and stars and it adds double chests but there are at least two glitches that I've found they are that the chests tend to disappear and all you see is a dark lighting glitch and the second glitch is that the inventory is glitching if you have one diamond it shows in your inventory that you have 16, it kinda really ticks me off cuz it will say you have 16 diamonds and you can craft a chestplate which you can even if you have just one but I think it is cheating. The new 7.4 update is coming out soon and it will have the clouds darker you can light creeper with flint and steel causing them to detonate them but you have to tap and hold to do it, and also tools will have the sound of them breaking.
B000002GYW|5.0|Just saw the Eagles in concert and several numbers from Desperado were included in the show.  Love the CD - it's great.

B00B81B0HC|5.0|I got this because I liked 1 or 2 songs, but now I can't get enough! I love the whole album, best music I've purchased in a long time!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Especially enjoyed the duet with Reese Witherspoon.  He does standards really well with his rich voice.  It would make a great gift.
1451678193|5.0|This is a good read, even today, though I have a few issues that come with TMC. The first is that the book is really starting to show its age.  By this I mean some parts of the book show a mid 1900 landscape with mid 1900 race relations. This just means that younger readers will not read book with the same context as an older person- they will get some other message. My other issue is that you can tell that this book is a collection of short stories stitched into a novel, that is not bad thing- in fact if you did not know that and read the book you might have never known. However, this does makes each chapter different in tone and for the most part many of the people do not show up in the book again a side from a line here and there.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|was a great movie, better than the original i would say. would love to see a part 2 with these actors
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Loading movies are very fast. Everything looks clear. If movies are in Hd, you will get that version. Much better than regular youtube. However,it doesn't give you a long list of the link of a same type of movie. Unless, I haven't figure out it yet. I'll give it 4.5 stars instead of 5. You should download it. Pictures are very clear & pretty.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Just received Stephen Stills collection \\"Carry On\\". What can I say other than I'm blown away. So much music that I love intermixed with many new to me at least songs. I can't wait for a long road trip to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride!<br />I sang along to most of the tunes and wish I knew the rest of the lyrics that I didn't. What a skillful and talented songwriter Stephen Stills is! I will be enjoying this collection of wonderful songs for the rest of my life!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining and actually makes you think.  Fun when you need more than mindless entertainment.  Not too difficult but still makes you think.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|My family loves playing this game. It is easy to pick up and runs through pretty fast, so it makes for a great game that does not require hours to finish it.<br />I actually bought some brain shaped erasers separately to use as counters for the game. The kids love it, and it adds a little extra to the game. These were the ones I used and they worked great: [[ASIN:B008BVAV18 B008BVAV18]]
B009CN2RIY|3.0|This story was entertaining until the inane and nonsensical ending . Another example of mediocre popular fiction. Don't waste your time.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Sometimes the extra balls are not counted after being dropped. Otherwise, it occupies time when there is nothing to do.
B00EFNXPFK|2.0|Not the Mayer I know & heard years ago...last two albums of folk & country just does not cut it.  The Inflection in his voice is gone..<br />or changed. His guitar is unispiring... the cameo appearances from KP just weakens the album.  Sad.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|A well made movie with a touch of past events. Action packed and exciting  thoroughout. Though it was odd when the Enterprise lost stabilty that people were being tossed around but Captain and Checkov were able to run steadily towards teh warp drive. overall 2 thumbs up
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This app only gives you limited help on certain levels and doesn't explain the purpose for all the special items.

B00D6SBOWG|3.0|Love the game. However, like others who reviewed it, I had to buy this app for a second time. And like another review, I will NOT buy it for a third time!  Fix the problem Amazon.
B0016J81CI|3.0|Now I know why there are so many Crocs on ebay.  I always wear a 6, but these are too tight<br />I wish it said that they run small.  Had to go to a store in a mall to buy one that's comfortable.  shucks!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was looking for a book to read while on vacation.  The description and reviews caught my attention.  It was a wonderful story, full of twists and turns to the end. I plan to read more of Kate Morton's novels.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Nevosoft needs to hire an editor. The dialog is rambling and too often pointless. Maybe it gets better in the final few chapters, but by then I was clicking Menu and skipping the dialog altogether.<br /><br />The icon of the beautiful lady pirate is misleading. She's not your character, \\"Jack,\\" but rather the fortune teller in the story, who does not wear that hat. And you're not much of a seafaring pirate. You spend the whole time on land in a pub, dungeon, or other dark location.<br /><br />The puzzles are basically reassembling drawings by rearranging tiles and unscrambling text. Many of the tasks aren't well integrated into the story and seem random.<br /><br />On the plus side, there are lots of hidden items to find. The inability to zoom is unfortunate, however, as is the locations being reused so often.
B002P79KAC|5.0|It is very funny and the acting is great. I hope they plan to continue for many more years to come.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Although the game is listed as free, the free download only gives you a fairly short demo of the game. Even that is worth downloading if you're not willing to pay for the full version, but if you do, you'll receive a large amount of content that's well worth the price.<br /><br />The game also allows you to pay to unlock decks and other features that you get for playing the game, but I don't consider that worth paying for. Unlocking those is part of the fun of playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know It has no nether or end or any pc or xbox but its the best app in the world
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|Very good movie about two men whom war has damaged. If you are looking for a action hero, no plot, special effects movie you will not like it of course. It's a slow and thoughtful movie about life and war.  Good music, good scenery, great actors.  Watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun and is so addictive. Get it now and have tons of fun playing subway surfer! Don't wait everyone.
B0013LPS8E|1.0|I purchased War on CD and it will not play in either of two separate CD players (Onkyo, Emotiva), or a computer CD/DVD player. There is no visible deformity or scratching on the surface. When it spins, it makes a slight scraping noise. A replacement CD from Amazon has exactly the same problem - it fails to play in any of my CD players. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to try the replacement before the return window was up, so I'm stuck with a defective CD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It actually a fun puzzle game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys doing puzzles. Early puzzles are easier but gets progressively harder.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|If I could share this book with everyone I know, I would. Loved it from the start to the finish. When is there going to be more?? I have added this author to my favorites list and would recomend it to all. Will not go into the story, that's for you to discover on your own.
B0063M22QO|3.0|large easy to see tiles. nice sound.levels are very easy.<br />perhaps to easy. but a fun way to pass the time in a waiting room or airport
B009LDD590|5.0|Boardwalk Empire: The Complete Third Season is a real powerhouse of entertainment. Of the first 3 seasons, this season is definitely in high gear and arguably the best so far. Steve Buscemi is absolutely one of the best actors around. The operatic quality of this production is simply enthralling and captivating. Once you watch this show it has a very curious way of hooking the viewer to beg for more!
B008PUF3VS|5.0|Amazing book, so simple to understand the friendship between two children, I was so very moved by this book and so shocked, it is still so hard to accept that this could happen. When my 10 year old daughter read it and l along with her we cried, I told her this is why if some thing is wrong we must say &#34;This is wrong, stop it &#34; never be silent, stand up for what you believe in.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a very good and emotionally charged movie. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are excellent! The story is also excellent. The action and political twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat. We really enjoyed this movie and were thinking of seeing it again.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a great gift, the gift of laughter, my husband and l had such fun, first l read it and then l waited for him to. Then we laughed together.
B00BEIYL6G|4.0|I was intrigued by this curious film. I believe it is good film making. It does not really engage you as you watch. Rather, the images and dialogue sink in after you have seen it. It sort of lingers with you. Ultimately, I liked it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game. Stable graphics and fun to play. Galaxy s4. Didn't show up as malware on my phone with my virus software.
B00EKSLK1Q|5.0|I would think most fans would purchase anything Belle and Sebastian put out there, so that will be a given with this release as with any other.<br /><br />I think that this album is a really nice collection with a lot of variety, so it would be good for newcomers as well; especially with some of the remixes and reinterpretations of songs- they seem that they may be more appealing to a wider, pop kind of audience. But all of the old favorite sounds are there as well, so I can't be disappointed! It was a good listen (I've only been through the whole album once so far) and I'm sure I'll listen myself sick of it very soon because there's a lot of really interesting stuff here.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My daughter loves this jumper! We bought it for her when she was 5months old and the first time we put her in it she started jumping immediately. All the toys keep her attention especially the lizard, sun and she loves to chew/suck on the fly. This has been a big help to me, I just move it to the kitchen and put her in it when I need to clean dishes or cook dinner.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|When I downloaded this book I was not expecting to like it so much. It keeps your attention through it all and I can't wait to read the others. Kinda sad Jace is her brother though.
B0043UEEX2|5.0|Watching the beginning of the first episode of the season I thought I may be wasting time, with 300-ish CGI and the sex scenes candy. But the rest of the episode and the season I often watched with intense anticipation, shock, clenched fists and jaws, sometimes a yell and even shedding a tear on two occasions. Any artwork that brings out such response gets nothing less than full five stars from me.<br /><br />At times I thought the violence was over the top, like when the body collectors in the arena speared the dead gladiators just so the viewers can see some extra gore. But later I read it was the actual practice, to make sure no one would get away by pretending to be dead. The series seems to accurately show what a bloodthirsty, restless bunch the Romans were -- I also read that on one occasion when convicts were to be released in the arena to be eaten alive by lions, and there happened to be a shortage of the convicts, Caligula (I think) ordered part of the crowd to be seized and thrown to the lions while the rest of the them cheered!<br /><br />And ultimately the knowledge of Andy Whitfield's untimely passing makes everything his character says about life and fate as real as real can be.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Easy read and very interesting. I am going to watch the movie after reading this. I would recommend this to many people.
B000001E18|5.0|Released seemingly on the heels of the huge Achtung Baby, Zooropa came out of nowhere in the summer of 1993. Songs like Numb (that video..) and Lemon sounded like nothing U2 had done up to that point. It is my humble opinion that the 3 1990's U2 albums are the band at the height of their creativity; with Zooropa and POP being the pinnacle. I sincerely hope Zooropa gets it's own remaster and deluxe rerelease, as I would love to hear the demos and unreleased songs from this particular era. (If You Wear That Velvet Dress from POP, and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me were both originally from the Zooropa sessions.)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book consumed me. I've been hearing about it for months and I knew ever since I read the description that I must read this book. So I put it on my wish list and waited for the price to drop. The moment I did, I bought it and read it in one day.<br /><br />It's going on my favorite books ever list. Not kidding. I have recommended this book to everyone I meet since I finished it. The story is beautiful and moving. The characters wormed their way deep into my heart. I felt every moment with them.<br /><br />Some people have said the characters are pretentious and that teenagers do not act that way. As someone not so far removed from her teen years (I'm about 7 years older than Hazel), I would politely disagree. Teens are smart, witty, and some of them do have expansive vocabularies. But I would also like to point out that Hazel and Augustus are not normal teens.<br /><br />They both have cancer, which has a profound impact on not only their own lives, but many of the lives around them. Not only does our lead, Hazel, have cancer, but she is terminal. She is sixteen years old and is dying. At 16 most of us believe that we are invincible and that we will never die. It's a part of developmental psychology. However for Hazel, this is not true. She has completely skipped that developmental stage in her life (along with several others) and gone all the way to the last one. She is faced with death at an age where it isn't even thought about. Of course she seems older. Cognitively, she is.<br /><br />I love how this book contains cancer, but the story isn't about cancer. It's about two kids living with the time they have been given. They're doing what most of us aren't able to and making the most of things. They see things and treasure things that healthy people aren't even noticing. This book is not about death. It is about living.<br /><br />Yes, it is sad. Yes, I sobbed for the last quarter of it. It is a beautifully written book. The story is believable and poignant. It really hits home, because I can understand this. I have seen this. It's more than a tragic love story, because I think it would have been even more tragic if Hazel would have never loved at all.<br /><br />All I can say is read it. It's been almost a month since I did and it is still resonating deeply with me. It is a remarkable and beautiful book.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I personally thought that this was a great book. Luckily did a great job if getting into the minds of her characters. Also, I was not expecting that ending. I would refer this book to anyone of. My family or friends.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Nice little game. I really can't think of any way of improving it. The only thing I would change is nitrous or a turbo boost of some kind.

0891419063|5.0|Well written.  Unembellished.  Readable.  Believable.  Eye witness account of a Marine infantryman in the Pacific war.  Holds your attention like a good fiction novel, but this one is true!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I will first of say that I can see how this movie will split viewers opinions right down the middle.<br /><br />Personally I think its a great movie, good action sequences, very nice effects, and while never going deep into actual back story seems to be a fully fleshed out world probably reasonably loyal to the comics that spawned it.  (never read them so can't say for certain)<br /><br />I love Karl Urban's Dredd, he's a tough guy in a tough world.  He's a total badass and seems to not really care that he is, he's just doing his job its just what he does.  The fact he can convey so much with variety of frowns is a little mind blowing.  Oliva Thriby is an excellent counter point, took me a while to realize that the story isn't so much about Dredd but about her.<br /><br />The flip side is the story line might be a bit too understated for most causal audiences.  This film has all the hallmarks of a major big budget action flick, but it lacks the over the top in your face story line most come with these days.  Overall I agree with some of the other reviewers that this has a more dystopian District 9 feel, the story is there but its mostly just to promote the character development.  Movies today tend to either spoon feed plots or beat over the head with emotional development.  An action movie with a subtle story line is just not done these days, and frankly will likely leave a lot of people lost or dissatisfied they didn't get more answers.<br /><br />I will say that I've seen the original and have friends familiar with the comic so I was able to fill some of the back story as I watched, for all its strengths the story may rely too much on people being familiar with the franchise.  Though the rumor was that they had hoped to make this a trilogy (as is the fad these days) so maybe they had planned on fleshing out things in future installments.  Sadly due to its box office performance that is not likely to happen.<br /><br />Overall I think it has great potential to be one of those cult movies beloved by fans who then spend many afternoons introducing acquaintances to this film they did know about or see for years to come.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I am addicted to Feedly! All the latest news, information, and gossip is waiting for me when I'm ready. I get to choose the topics and publications of interest to me. Feedly saves me time looking for information so I can spend more time reading.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|The album GLOWS in the first four tracks. Then it sort of meanders a bit here and there, includes a useless duet with Katy Perry, his then-girlfriend, and finally finds redemption in the end The last track, \\"on the way home\\" is a good way to end things, on a happy note. So: six very good songs.  Want John in very, very, very fine form? \\"Born and Raised,\\" baby. Very fine album. He had me with that one :)
B002JI94J4|2.0|First of all the packaging is nothing like what is shown in the description.  It may be that the cardboard cover is missing or maybe never existed.  The back refers to Canada film ratings.<br /><br />Inside you get a Blu-ray disc that is not near as clear as the DVD.  There are spots on the film, sort of like going to the movies back in the sixties ... Then, there is no scene selection.  You have to watch the film beginning to end each time or fast forward.  I played a small part on through my TV speakers so I can't comment on sound quality.  No scene selection on the Blu-ray when included on the DVD, what gives there.<br /><br />The extras included are interviews with non-Beatles.  I don't even know if they had anything to do with making the original film.<br /><br />Buy the DVD or wait for the Beatles organization to put this out on Blu-ray.  This copy not worth the money.
B0000025H0|1.0|Why Santana made this shit (sorry, \\"album\\") in 1979?. Since then, Santana hadn't made another great album. The problem is not that before and after Marathon were \\"diferent\\". The problem is that \\"before\\" most of Santana albums are masterpieces and \\"after\\" all of them are... well.. let's say... \\"bad albums\\" .. with not even one exception.<br />I hate Santana for this...The cover of Maraton is profetic. I'll put fire with all of this \\"after Marathon albums\\".

B004XUMMFE|5.0|I never watched the series during it's first and only season, for one reason or another, but after watching the movie produced after the cancellation of the series I was hooked. The casting and chemistry they produced along with good story lines and direction made it enjoyable for each and every show. Enjoying sci-fi as I do, this is one series I wish there was more of.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Especially like that I can play this through Facebook or on my kindle fire. Great graphics, easy tasks, quickly able to build up.<br />Love it
B008JFUNTG|3.0|Great effects - the satyr and centaur look real (or pretty near), and other effects meet the best of the very high standards we've come to expect. Outside of that, the teen date-movie plot doesn't offer a lot. There's the friendly rivalry, set aside for the unfriendly rivalry. They also tucked in a nice message about accepting people who look a bit different, and a cyclops certainly looks differently. And don't forget the blatant bit of sequel-bait at the end, promising new conflicts in the inevitable follow-on project.<br /><br />Barely worth the popcorn, but watchable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00B9LNK5G|5.0|As on his 2010 debut solo album \\"Queen Of Denmark\\", American singer/songwriter John Grant takes the term \\"confessional singer/songwriter\\" to a whole new level on his second album \\"Pale Green Ghosts\\". Compared to the 1970s' introspective, confessional singer/songwriters such as Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell, John Grant's stark, brutally honest and transparent lyrics are in a whole other category.<br />On \\"Queen Of Denmark\\", the courageous John Grant dealt with subject matters like homosexuality, homophobic abuse, parental rejection, depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and the end of a long relationship with a guy who broke his heart (\\"Baby, you're where dreams go to die / I regret the day your lovely carcass caught my eye\\"), and on \\"Pale Green Ghosts\\" he's every bit as brave, if not more so.<br /><br />In an interview, referring to his previous alcohol and drug addiction, John Grant said \\"This addictive personality permeates my entire being\\", and judging by several songs on \\"Pale Green Ghosts\\", Grant's ex-boyfriend is one addiction he is yet to shake off. It does make for some fascinating songs, that's for sure. A very worthy successor to \\"Queen Of Denmark\\",\\"Pale Green Ghosts\\" is as addictive as Grant's own personality.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
0064471837|5.0|I first encountered Sabriel some 11 years ago aged 24 and re-read it recently. Ok, I know I'm not exactly the intended audience for this book, however, if I restricted my literary diet to adult fiction I would have missed out on countless fantastic stories. This is a fantastic story.<br />We follow Sabriel as she comes to terms with her heritage as the Abhorsen, a necromancer responsible for banishing the reluctant dead back into death, reacquainting herself with her homeland - the magical Old Kingdom (she was largely brought up in Ancelstierre - a land closest to our own and largely devoid of magic), a tentative foray into love, oh and saving the Old Kingdom and her adopted home from the greater dead intent on destroying the Charter Magic and taking over. This is quite a fast paced tale. It is beautifully descriptive without interfering with the story or being over the top. There is some well-placed and welcome humour. I often find the hero/heroine of a tale irritating, but in this instance I didn't. I found Sabriel a believable character that develops as she grows in confidence and gains knowledge. There is a love interest, but fortunately this doesn't get in the way! However, it is the enigmatic, caustic Mogget, the little white cat who is much more than he seems that I love the most. We also have a cast of minor characters, who, however briefly they appear, are well created. I love the idea of Charter Magic and Free Magic and the bells used to control the dead. I got easily caught up in the story and it is genuinely moving. I love the style of writing. This is the first part of a trilogy and the following books are even better. I love the work of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Brandon Sanderson and Alison Croggon to name a few, and this book is right up there with the best for me. Just wonderful.
0470876417|5.0|We used the book in our recent off-site retreat for work.  And I built out their canvas model on-line with Strategyzer.  It's a great way to come up with different business models and it takes in all your information and builds it out for you. Love it.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|For its price, I'm not going to complain about much.  When I first got it, even before putting this onto my phone, my friend pulled on the sides a bit and the black portion came off (thankfully, not completely).  I've had it on for a while and it seems perfectly fine.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is the portion under USB port, which the bumper covers.  It still allows my USB to connect properly, but it comes off pretty easily.  If anyone wants pictures, I will gladly post them.<br /><br />Overall, great for the price and no real complaints.<br /><br />Also, since this may depend on who the seller is, I purchased this from SMF Celluar.

B0000252YK|5.0|Good album.  The work of guitarist Jake E. Lee and drummer Tommy Auldridge make it worthwhile; plus there are some good tunes in there.
1904994679|5.0|My 9-year old has been reading these for 3 years.  He loves looking up extreme facts and announcing statistics during conversations.  Then proving his statement with the Guinness Book.  A new book can keep him interested for hours.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game it has so many details and lots of things to do and every other day there are more animals should try the game before you judge don't wait for me to stop talking just get the game
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Unique calculator, got it to help my 6 year old learn math.  He loves it too.  Would recommend it, especially since it is free.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love this game but at the best part it says the time trial has ended. It can do until  u get the real games.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Baz is a great director, add Leonardo and you have<br />one of the best team ups in Hollywood.  Baz always has<br />great music in his film, but I guess one of the producers<br />decided to make this movie his music video and tainted<br />the art. Great film!!!! 4 stars because of the amount of<br />Jay-Z music.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Typical chick flick. The chemistry is a little off between the main characters, but I still enjoyed watching the film.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a great mouse for the money. Like the fact I can change the colors and that the buttons are programmable. I don't do a lot of gaming, just needed a mouse that doesn't eat batteries and this little gem fit the bill.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|YES THE ONE STAR BUTTON FINALLY WORKS<br />THIS APP SOO SUCKS<br />AND NOT THE OFFICIAL YOUTUBE ITS JUST THERE TO HACK YOUR ACCOUNT
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very well done. Great graphics, cool moves and powers, fun missions, and the in-game rewards are very well balanced. My only complaint is that I have had trouble getting the multi-player function to work. Sure would like to play online with others.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Limited formats supported. Its pretty closed system , unfriendly to developers with Google unilaterally deciding what is allowed to be streamed.
B009X01ELC|1.0|As stated when I returned it, the Kindle did not fit.  A second<br /> Marware was sent, and it also did not fit.  It appears that my Kindle is slightly larger than your Marware, and it will not lock down.<br /><br />Kathleen Rivers
B00003CXCW|5.0|The greatest classic movie ever made. You can watch it over and over and it never pales. This should be at the top of the list of any collection.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I love this show, I have watched it a number of times and will probably watch it again..great show, sad its ending
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I hate that it requires you to rope in facebook friends in order to get more points, and they don't even make it easy for you to friend people you meet within the game...you have to exit the game, go onto facebook and send friend request - which give them access to your facebook account. I think most people create a &#34;dummy&#34; facebook account to use just for playing this game so that they don't have what are basically strangers looking at all their pictures and info.  Also, the more you play the more &#34;coins&#34; it requires as you move up.  They do have an option to purchase more coins, which I will never do. I play mostly for mindless diversion.  It freezes up all the time on my Kindle Fire which causes you to lose anything you had in the game.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List was difficult to get through because it was so emotional and so real. It is such an incredibly made movie and you feel that you are experiencing everything that the characters are experiencing. You so badly want to save them. Liam Neeson and Sir Ben Kingsley are amazing (as usual) and it is completely worth all 3 hours. This is Spielberg at his best.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Just amazing and so glad I am ready for the next season! Amazing show! Curious to see how it continues as the final episode was a let down
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book! If you love DOAWK, Get this book! I would give it a five star rating any time 8)
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We really like this show.  It has a good mix of science geek stuff, humor, and it is a great program. It is a shame that they canceled the program to make crappy movies for TV.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This story has many facets running through the entire book, suspense, some glorious sex, true love, and a new beginning for several others to peek my definite yes to move on to the next story in the Pride Series.  THIS WAS A GREAT READ.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was my fourth time reading “City of Bones,” and the storyline and characters still managed to blow me away! Cassandra Clare is truly an exceptionally talented and creative author who never ceases to blow me away, not only with her writing style, but with her detailed and imaginative storyline and characters. I will absolutely and positively never cease loving to read her novels over and over, time and time again. “City of Bones” was amazing and captivated me from the very beginning. I loved the storyline and characters, and couldn’t help but immediately fall in love with both. Clary, Jace, Simon, Alec, Isabelle, Luke, and almost all of the other characters in this book managed to capture my heart, and I immensely enjoyed getting to know them in the first installment of The Mortal Instruments series. I loved the relationship they all had with each other, especially Clary and Jace. If you’ve read The Infernal Devices, the prequel trilogy to TMI, Clary and Jace reminded me of Tessa and Will – which was an awesome bonus. The banter between Clary and Jace was always entertaining, and I loved their personalities and chemistry together. The ending was a bit shocking – of course, I already knew what was going to happen – but if you’re reading this book for the first time, don’t let what you discover towards the end keep you from reading the rest of the books. I promise they get better and more interesting! Anyway, “City of Bones” was an awesome start to the incredible Mortal Instruments series, and I truly cannot wait to rediscover all of my favorite parts and characters of the Shadow World in the books to come!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tins fey is amazeballs at being funny. She should definitely write another book. Must read. I laughed until I cried.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|This CD was a little over the top for me, and I think that War Is The Answer was a lot better. The songs are not bad, but are all fast and loud with bonus tracks on the end of the CD that make you think it started over again. The bonus tracks that you usually get excited about sounded like the original songs, not much of a bonus. The Music sounded like it was pushed out to get another CD on the market, the songs on War Is The Answer sounded more rounded and had a better overall sound.
B003ODL3V0|5.0|I have not heard the original pressing of SoE to compare to, but I must say that this one does sound particularly good. The LPs are obviously 180 gram. As soon as you pick them up, they feel very heavy-duty and sturdy. They are a cool looking transparent-yellow. The gatefold jacket is very well-done and also heavy-duty. Overall, Back on Black did a great job with this release. if you're a fan of this album and vinyl, don't hesitate to pick this one up before it's gone. You won't regret it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have totally enjoyed watching Sherlock Holmes!  The shows are entertaining and it's fun to see Sherlock Holmes in a current day environment.

B009VA1FN6|4.0|I am an avid reader and very much enjoyed this story. It is well written and quite clever in parts- nice to read something other than the cookie cutter type stories that abound today's novels.<br />Reading another book by the same author right now.
B006LSZECO|1.0|the only reason i can fathom that this book is on the best sellers list for so long is that the ending is sick.  the story is contrived shock value nonsense.  as a reader, please know there are better novels out there.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun, moderately challenging, and enjoyable. It was perfect for keeping me entertained while waiting for an appointment,  and for the middle of the night helping me to focus during an anxiety attack... It was over too soon, though, and I want more levels.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Well written and, at times, provocative.  Perhaps a bit too much focus on the process of rediscovery of the ancient manuscript, but that's the hook Greenblatt uses to tell his story.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|Lego is still as amazing as when I played as a child, my daughter loved. Lego quality is definitely unparalleled, unsurpassed.
B00DOQK2OG|1.0|I have to admit I was excited when I saw the announcement and I pre ordered.<br />After listening to it there are so many better rainbow live disks out there. Do yourself a favour and get the old Dio ones recored in Germany. This one won't be played a lot...<br />Somehow the speed is off. Ritchie has seen better days.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|My mom knows me so well, she recommended this book to me. Spot on. I loved it and recommend it to anyone who loves nature and had a childhood. You will all be able to relate
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome it isn't as cool as Pc but it has updates can someone add me to there realms my name is txlj gaming
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a good game. I absolutely love it. It's so much fun! I like it because it looks real. Its a good buy
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I have always been a fan of dinosaurs I enjoy killing time on this game. Great way to spend free time when at the laundry mat.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best book ever! Couldnt put the book down! I finished all three in a week!  A lot of people say they didn't like the ending, but I thought it gave a nice fairy tale finish.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the ability to mix sounds! I also like the timer option so you can set and not think about turning it off.
0446580848|5.0|How can you not love this character?  He is smart, he's a smartass, and he gets to say things that I only wish I could think to say in the moment.  Besides the character, the story is another page turner.  DeMille knows how to create great characters and situations and this latest is every bit as good as the others in the series.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Excellent movie! This is by far the best version of Phantom of the Opera that has ever been made.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it! And if you've already seen this movie, watch it again :)
B00127RAJY|4.0|Really love this DVD. Some exercises are tricky for beginners but I have been working out daily and look forward to working out. Jillian has done a great job with this DVD.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I like most of the songs on this album. I found some of the songs to be too long though. All in all, it's a great album.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Orphan black was a show I accidently stumbled upon one evening.  I truly enjoyed the story surrounding the aspect of the movie.  There are twists and turns you do not expect and makes you open up into other possibilities of what is possible when scientists play around with stem cells.  Really enjoyable and hope there is more to come.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am almost done with the first book and it is amazing! I cannot wait to start the rest of the books
1451626096|3.0|This book was not as well written as Ms. Gregory's other books.  The proof-reader was no good as you stumble with the mixtures of Henry and Harry in incorrect places.  I found this book to have more holes and incomplete thoughts.  It was a strange read leaving more questions.  Although there is a mini-series of this book being shown right now, leaves me more baffled than before.  There are sections of the book which flow to where you enjoy reading.  Would I purchase this book again ,, yes as it is a series and some contain stinkers.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|this box is just awesome!! everyone who likes Mad Season should buy this release without any doubt, it worth the money
B000LAZDQA|5.0|No entendi nada
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I started watching this show and I am now in love . I am so happy I started watching ...
B00APVIDFI|5.0|It's a very flashy and neat watch. It's pretty easy to set, but there are no instructions that come with it. Just something to note, if you're in direct sunlight you're going to have to cup a hand over it to see the watch face. I do think it would be a little better if it had a clasp of some kind. I'm 5'9 and it's a little snug. And the &#34;wings&#34; of it aren't so rigid that I feel confident that it won't slide off my arm with a good gesture of the hands, so to speak. But it's not enough to worry the average buyer. It's a great piece of time wear.
B000WOT41K|4.0|I only had a couple of the albums from which this collection pulls songs, so this is a great way to get the highlights from their albums that weren't full of mega-hits.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My hubby and I are totally addicted and just love the show.  The development of the characters is wonderful - not happy with the ending of season 3 and eagerly awaiting season 4.
B006LSZECO|4.0|From the beginning I knew I would be hooked and I was right. This is one of those that keeps you wondering about what is going to happen next. There were minor annoyances throughout along with stuff that was really unnecessary but still a very good book until just about the very last minute. I hated the way the book ended and apparently others did as well based on reviews.<br /><br />Very hard to say much without giving away too much. Let's just say the book starts on Nick and Amy's fifth year anniversary when he receives a phone call to only find out there has been a struggle at his home and his wife has gone missing. The story picks up from there with many twists throughout. Still, it's a very good read and I know many will enjoy it.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|I caught a glimpse of this movie on a cable station and it was so cute I decided to buy it for my niece and nephew.  A great movie for adults and children.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I can't wait to see the 3rd season.  I will definitely be watching when the 4th season starts.  I had heard from a friend of mine how good it is and after watching the 1st 2 seasons my friends and I are definitely hooked.  Maggie Smith and cast are really incredible.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|In 2007 a 16-track CD was released featuring highlight performances from the show's run.  This CD is a much better representation of the show than the 1970 LP [[ASIN:B000XQO1RY the Johnny Cash Show (Columbia KC 30100)]].  It's got Cash singing his hits (Ring of Fire, Flesh and Blood), and others' (I've Been Everywhere), plus doing some of the classics with the Statler Brothers and the Carter Family (Belshazzar, Daddy Sang Bass).  Then, it throws in some solo performances by the stars who graced his stage, and a wonderful duet with Joni Mitchell on Girl from the North Country.<br /><br />A two-disc DVD expanded this to a full 66-song set (and swapped Joni's duet on North Country for Bob Dylan's - they're both amazing).  As you explore the number of artists who performed on Johnny's show, you get a real sense of what he was trying to do.  All of the country greats were there: Tammy Wynette, George Jones, a hilarious Roy Clark, Bobby Bare, Conway Twitty, Marty Robbins, the Everly Brothers, Ray Price, Chet Atkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Loretta Lynn, Charley Pride, and Bill Monroe.  They're all in fine form, particular Glen Campbell's glorious Wichita Lineman.  Then there's the new breed of singer-songwriters Johnny loved so much: Tony Joe White, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Ronstadt, Hank Williams Jr., James Taylor, and Waylon Jennings.  He also moves beyond Nashville to those long-haired rock and roll freaks: Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and CCR.  I love in particular how he brings in African-American artists who only a short while ago would have been banned from Ryman's all-white stage: Stevie Wonder (who plays drums on Get Rhythm!) and the great Louis Armstrong (who, with Johnny, recreates a 1930 session he played on with Jimmie Rogers; the sight of Louis in a 10-gallon hat is unforgettable!).  Although Cash was a country artist, he saw no boundaries.<br /><br />This was no more apparent than in his stunning duet on Worried Man Blues with Pete Seeger.Godfather of modern folk music he may be, but I often find Pete's rigid stance on so many issues to be offputting.  Here though, he offers a masterclass in showmanship and musicianship.  Johnny and Pete together are wonderful.  And somehow, Cash manages to get his middle-American audience to gobble up the melodies of America's most famous lefty!<br /><br />The CD and DVD are great, but in the age of YouTube, somewhat irrelevant.  For every great performance on here, there's another omitted: The Monkees in full comedic form; a very psychedelic The Guess Who interspersed with Johnny's What is Truth; and a to-die-for guitar jam session between Jose Feliciano, Carl Perkins and Merle Travis. A complete remastered box set is needed!<br /><br />For this and more Johnny Cash reviews including discussion of outtakes and b-sides, visit my blog at raisemyglasstothebside at wordpress dot com.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|must see movie, won't disappointed, what else can I write to finish 10 more words according to Amazon, can they just rate it?
B002SLNK5G|2.0|I purchased this on a friends recommendation and it wasn't as good as I had hoped.  Okay but a little slow and a lot dated.
014241543X|3.0|I liked the direction this story took. It is a story line I haven't read before (and when you read a lot, sometimes books seem just like the same old thing rehashed). I really liked the way the author used flashbacks to develop the characters, although it was frustrating at times. Not only was I much more interested in the PRESENT, but the flashbacks could be slow/boring. It definitely stilted the pace of the book a bit, but I don't think there is a better way to do what she did. It was a unique way to build the characters, instead of putting the crisis at the end, etc. So overall, the writing style was unique and creative, but it also caused the book to drag a bit.<br /><br />Did I like it? Yes, I did. I wasn't glued to the book; I could put it down. I knew she would choose to live (the sequel chapter at the back of the book was a dead give away), but I was interested in the development of her decision. Did I love it? No. I decided a Google search on the outcome of the next book was sufficient for me and I won't spend the time reading it. I just didn't care quite that much.
1400052181|1.0|The information on the book cover says:<br />\\"Doctors took her cells without asking.\\"  - Um, no they did ask her.  Page 31 - \\"Henrietta went straight to the admissions desk and told the receptionist she was there for her treatment.  Then she signed a form with the words OPERATION PERMIT at the top of the page.  It said:  I hereby give consent to the staff of The Johns Hopkins Hospital to perform any operative procedures and under any anesthetic either local or general that they may deem necessary in the proper surgical care and treatment of ----------\\".  Not their fault she wasn't smart enough to understand what she consenting to.  I'm pretty sure removing the cancerous cells would fall under the term \\"perform ANY operative procedures ... they may deem necessary\\".<br /><br />\\"Those cells never died.\\"  - This is very misleading.  The cells that are still living are the CANCER cells they took from her cervix, her normal cells are long dead and gone.  So the book title that implies Henrietta Lacks is immortal is deceiving.<br /><br />\\"They launched a medical revolution and a multimillion-dollar industry.  More than twenty years later, her children found out.  Their lives would never be the same.\\"<br /><br />I'm black and I fail to see where the miscarriage of justice is.  So what her kids are in poverty?  I don't see how her children should receive any money for their mother's cancer cells.<br /><br />If a hairdresser cuts my hair, collects that hair and makes wigs out of it, and makes tons of money off those wigs, are my children supposed to receive money from the sale of those wigs?  Of course not!<br /><br />Henrietta's children were so ignorant, even if they did receive monetary compensation, I have no doubt a year from now they'd be back in the same financial situation they were in before receiving the money.  As the saying goes \\"A fool and his money are soon parted.\\"<br /><br />Henrietta's children should be proud of all the good things that have come from studying their mother's cells, instead of worrying why they weren't paid for their mother's cells.ng their mother's cells, instead of worrying why they weren't paid for their mother's cells.
B000FCK8ZK|1.0|I enjoy the TV series Dexter, even though at times it can be a bit ridiculous and dumb, but this book failed to rise to the level of being even somewhat entertaining.  The characterization is weak, shallow, and simplistic.  The dialogue is crudely crafted and sophomoric.  The plot is badly stitched together, totally improbable, and deteriorated even further towards the end of the book. The last few scenes are were completely nonsensical.<br /><br />Usually a TV show made from a book is the weaker sister, but in this case at least the show is enjoyable.  The book was not.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the demo version of this game. For a tablet, it's got good graphics and there's plenty of secrets to unlock! I think I'll buy the full version.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles is still fabulous and he picked some wonderful artists for his duets.  It one of my favorite CD's.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Beautifully written tale of another world for me.  I would recommend this book and am looking forward to the next novel
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I got this for my Macbook Pro, which wouldn't work without an amplifier, so I went with the Sabrent virtual 7.1 USB 2.0 External Sound Card Adapter for another $6 or so + shipping. It works perfectly well enough for what I need it for in spite of some bad reviews. I'm not sure Barbara Walters is going to be interviewing anybody with these. I mainly use it to record podcasts and YouTube videos, and the sound quality of my productions have improved greatly.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I love this story, and that it is based on a true event makes it even more appealing.  It is a heart-warming story and the acting is superb!<br />The only draw back is that it is subtitled in French, but even that was rather fun for me.  I shared it with my elderly neighbors (both 90) and they also loved it.<br /><br />Worth the money for sure!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally awesome. Easy to pick up and play.  Hard to put down.  Graphics are great and it is free. How cool is that  get it right now. You will love it. Guaranteed by. Shaggyross
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Plays about anything, but trends to freeze up a little on the kindle fire hd. Overall probably the best free video app.
0375842209|2.0|I'm a little confused about why this book receives such raving reviews. I found the writing choppy and hard to follow. The plot drug on and on without real direction and no hint of climax until the very end. The characters were extremely one-dimensional and very predictable. I was not excited to read this book and struggled to finish it. Usually when I read books I connect with the characters, think about them a lot, and can't wait to find out what they do next. This was not even remotely the case with the characters in this story. It was a chore to read at times. I would have given the book 1 star, but the ending made me sob, and although I hated the way it ended, it obviously affected me on some level.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This is a great app! Very easy to use right off the bat! It's simple to set up and has a very intuitive interface.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|I was looking for something new to get into. Loved reading so when I came across this series I went all in.  I brought all the Kindle editions I've honestly read each at least 2-3 Times already.  I personally like to get a feel for the characters it's like they become part of me.  I would recommend to anyone looking for something fresh and different.  The artwork  is  simply beautiful.  The use of colors, objects an things that you won't not ordinarily place together which made it SEXY an COOL:).
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Pretty GOOD game, just a little annoy ing cos energy runs out but apart from that a good game<br />Worth a try if YOU like hidden object games
B006UUK612|4.0|It was a pleasure to watch this again. CGI has come a long way but this movie still holds up after all these years. I think it can be enjoyed by all ages. It is a great family movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it it is the best game ever  it's really easy and really hard k can't stop playing wham I start playing it I can't stop playing I love it !!!!
0316228583|4.0|Aside from her usual fine, sophisticated writing style, JK Rowling has left Hogwarts behind. The good guys don't always win. The bad guys don't get their due. It's not a book for kids.<br />This must have been a shock to quite a few.<br /><br />So, what do we have here?<br />An incredibly unflattering portrait of English society, and its endemic snobbery in particular. A sort of English Peyton Place- shiny on the outside and rotten within; a small town dissected. Rowling pins down the population, painting each a vibrant (frightening, horrid, sad) portrait. Every one is stunningly human and complete- almost too much so. Rowling flirts dangerously with giving too much information. As readers we don't always need to know why. Sometimes we WANT to hate someone, not walk a mile in their shoes.<br /><br />Despite this, A Casual Vacancy is a good book, though not always an easy read. I highly suggest it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is SUPER FUN!!!!!!!  I love this game......  because I like the gas and brake pedal on the bottom of the screen, and I feel loo j like I'm driving.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I rushed to BB this morning to pick up this set, and I have to say I am very pleased with the picture quality and sound.<br />The special edition case has a nice touch to it, I feel the fish tank cover and the way the zombies have been screwed on to the springs are cheap and flimsy. I wont deny that for a 100 bucks one should expect a little better quality. Nevertheless, I am very happy with it as it sits right on the opposite side of my season 2 special edition zombie head. When it comes to functionality, you have to unscrew the bottom of the case with a tiny Philips screwdriver where 4 AAA batteries (not included as well) are placed in order for you to light up your case. The on/off button is hidden where it says Season 3. You must press the number 3 with some force, and there you have it folks, your zombies will glow in the dark!<br /><br />Season 3 has 16 episodes, so you will get 5 discs, out of which the 5th one has the bonus features/extras. There were 1 or 2 episodes that I didn't really care for as I felt they wasted a lot of time in just boring, dare I say unecessary conversation, instead of getting down to the nitty gritty. Other then that, this season is fantastic and keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />An update, 8-31-2103. One thing I don't really like is that when you stop the blu ray and restart, it goes back to the beginning of the disc and doesn't start at the point you left off! I have noticed this on disc 1 since I haven't checked out the rest. That is annoying to me! What's up with that? On Season 1 & 2, it would take you back to the point where you had stopped watching and ask whether you wished to continue or not!<br />Picture Quality 8/10<br />Sound Quality 10/10, gives your surround sound system a very good work out, extremely pleased!<br /><br />Update: 9-1-2013. The second disc also goes back to the beginning should you stop it for any reason while watching. You will have to find where you stopped via your remote. I'm not sure why on earth they decided to do that, but it is what it is! Now, if you have the regular dvd's, it should begin where you left off.hy on earth they decided to do that, but it is what it is!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its sooo addicting, funny , and awsome. from the mini games to the fun venues, its an all around cool game
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Kept me interested throughout, even when you think you know where it's going there is always something you weren't certain of coming

B00C5R8364|5.0|Believable plot. Good characters and well written. Again Forsyth keeps you interested<br />but a fast moving story. Would make a great series.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great voice effects, easy to adjust, good price compared to performance and many good things.<br />It is a little heavy, though.
B003GK21OE|5.0|His Characters are believable every day people, no super sensory nonsense.<br />The plot is well constructed,  and could be real.<br />He has an easy writing style which makes it a pleasurable read.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|... the first one I received stopped working after about a week. I just kept getting an &#34;Error 1&#34; message on the screen and the only instructions on the Withings web site was to recharge the battery and hit the reset button for 15 seconds. Sometimes this worked for a day or two, sometimes it would take 15-20 tries before the unit reset and started working again.<br /><br />I sent it back to Amazon for an exchange and will update after a few weeks with the replacement unit.
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|It is not the film that I don't like, it is the QUALITY.  In the first season of discs, the 2nd and 3rd disc had places where they stalled and fluttered.  They finally went on playing, but some of the show on each of those discs was lost.  I have not played season 2 or 3 yet so I do not know the quality of those discs.  But, I would like my purchase replaced because the quality is not up to the price I paid.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I got a Kindle for my birthday and it came with 500 Amazon coins. Saw this app Plague Inc in the app store and it seemed interesting, so I spent the 99 coins for it. Let's just say I've already played this game 50+ times...it is THAT fun and addicting! It's so fun to come up with your own diseases by tweaking genes, modifying symptoms and transport modes, etc. Even my touchscreen-hating husband loves this game and wants to play it all the time! You also learn about pathology and geography too.<br />So, yes, get this game NOW. Oh, and hubby desperately wants a PC (personal computer) version of this game...get on it, Ndemic and Mindset Games!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is the second book in the series The Mortal Instruments! These book just grab you in and take you on such a journey! So many main characters that is keeps your attention and wondering what is next! Awesome series of Books!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games is a trilogy written by Suzette Collins, in which I enjoyed reading all three books. The Hunger Games is a young adult/sci-fi genre fictional novel and because of this I found it to be a pretty easy read. Initially I bought the book because of the popularity of peers as well as the excitement about the movie adaptation of the series. The story is centered around Katniss Everdeen who lives in a futuristic version of North America called Panem. Panem is divided into 13 districts in which we quickly learn are based in a caste type system. The government of Panem is called the \\"Capitol\\" that oversees and flourishes from the districts hard labor. The \\"Capitol\\" is ruled by one dictator through a police state. Katniss, the main character within the trilogy finds this sort of leadership inhuman and oppressive. During the reaping, a ceremony that chooses 2 children from each district to fight to the death in the Hunger Games, Katniss takes the place of her sister Prim. The \\"reaping\\" was created to commemorate a failed uprising by District 13, by sacrificing the districts children every year. The concept is very disturbing but was put in place to show that they all live in peace now. The televised Hunger Games precedes the \\"reaping\\". Besides the horrible backdrop, Katniss character is very strong yet fragile in some ways. She is the person who takes care of her family after her father is killed in a coal mining explosion. Her mother is deeply depressed and her sister Prim is young and very fragile. Katniss is devastated when her sister is chosen in the \\"reaping\\", which seems impossible because she only has 1 tally. The second person that is chosen is Peeta. The son of a baker, who Katniss recognizes somehow. Gayle is Katniss illegal hunting partner and friend, at the \\"reaping\\" he can bravely take Prim away as she screams for her sister. During the Hunger Games Katniss wants to stay alive by any means necessary and if this means Peeta has to die, then so be it. Later Katniss and Peeta become allies in this game full of adversaries. They find a way to trick the game makers and stay alive. Between the two emotional feelings are formed, but actually what kind of feelings is truly left to your imagine. Peeta is in love, but Katniss is just Katniss. During book 2 and 3 Katniss finds her past and future crossing paths when she is forced to choose between Gayle and a forced love affair with Peeta. Overall, this trilogy took me through a plethora or emotions as it touched on so much. It made me think of certain issues within our society today. How our government handles things. Although these books are about a fictional country and the situation is very extreme, for those who have read the books I ask what are some similarities for you?<br /><br />~  Tammy<br />BBC Hospitality Coordinator.

B005LAIH2M|5.0|Good CGI graphics, SFX. The story is very good too! A movie I could watch over and over again. hansel and Gretel like you never imagined.
B008Y6WMEY|4.0|Peter Sellers is phenomenal, George C Scott is crazy, and the cheeky humor (especially with the names!) makes it a great flick to watch again & again!  Honestly, this is one black & white classic that would be even better in color, in my opinion.  but a great film nevertheless!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Saw a couple of clips from the movie which led me to finally watch the whole thing. I don't know what took me so long (given that it was released in the 80's); I would have gone bananas for this movie when I was a teen!
0486406482|5.0|I re read with my granddaughter (11 years old) who loves romance novels and this one is such a great classic.<br />Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful. I would  also rate it G  since manners , breading and modesty are great for young girls.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Though this app has some slight issues its a fantastic way to keep track of notes wirelessly and have access to them almost anywhere! I love it!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  This story deals with self identity, existentialism,  prejudice. and much more.<br />It was a riveting account of one persons search for her life's meaning. It is also a mystery with a great big<br />surprise.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Provided an expansion to my only-2-usb-3 ports on my laptop.  Works good.  Found a little issue when connected all four ports.  Three works consistently well.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was very well written. The story is about the  lives and politics of a small English village. It is a microcosm of<br />a broader fear, prejudiced, and profiling that people all around us can identify with. I loved the story and its in-depth character.<br />development.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|I received this dvd and it was already scratch, so i contacted the seller and within a couple hours they had responded saying they would refund me and send out a new one the next day. i was upset at first but now im very happy, great customer service, very understanding. thank you again.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I've used other note taking apps and this one is the best. I can use it offline, highlight, put text in bold, use different colors on text, and insert pics. For me, it's easy to use. I got the app for free but would have paid $3.99 for the app. I've downloaded the free extensions to use with the app and this gave me more page templates to choose from and I love them. I'm going to love using this for business and personal use. I recommend using this app!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is the bet legal show on TV, so happy I was able to catch up from Season 1 and get up to date in Season 3!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. Needless to say its pretty hard at the same time. The levels get harder and harder as you beat each escape. But once you get to the next level your ready to do it all over again.

B001EBYMB2|4.0|This movie is a classic. First half is the best basic training piece since Officer and a Gentleman IMO. Second half is well paced and gritty and Kubrick all the way.
0345528581|5.0|If I can describe this book in one word, I would say Revolutionary. Revolutionary in regards to YOU, your life and your body.<br /><br />4 years ago I had a 'spare tire' or two over my abdomen, which made me self aware, which was a drag on my self-confidence and hence I was never motivated to really leave the house nor my personal comfort zones and the women I like never paid attention to me due to my lack of confidence, lack of ambition and the fact that I never really took care of myself.<br /><br />Then I found THIS BOOK at Books-A-Million, bought it, took it home and looked it over thinking \\"wow, I can do this.\\"...I was wrong. When you want a body like a spartan warrior, then you better be ready for some really hard work. Some of these exercises can hurt you if you're not careful but believe me, the end result is worth it.<br /><br />Fast forward a year and a half later and I had mostly lost the gut, my charisma went up and I fell in love with and eventually starting dating an amazing woman who I seriously cherish and she would go to the ends of the earth for me as well. Life is good.<br /><br />Today, in my late 20s, I'm in much better shape than many of my peers and I never paid for a gym.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so much fun and I really enjoy playing it besides it is very addictive so beware you to will be a Dimond Dash junkie.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great escape. Not great lit but a fun read. You get lost in the fantasy and get out of the real world for a bit.
0802473156|5.0|This is the only book I read every single page, write notes, finish it in a week. Very helpful to understand relationship between husband and wife.

1416905014|1.0|The description said it's in good condition but it's not.<br />The cover was ripped and I don't even need to mention about inside .<br />I know that for the price of it, can't ask for much but still feel like I got cheated.<br />I wouldn't even want it, even if I got it for free.<br />It is a very big disappointment and sorry for an amazing book that got treated that way.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Hilarious, encouraging and heart wrenching. Loved every page. By the end, I knew that in my heart, soul and life there were more adventures ahead.

B0012GTZC0|4.0|It is slow in the beginning but gets super fast after halfway through. I may read one more time, time permitting.
B0088QQ0CU|5.0|I will start off with a disclaimer. I am a RK fan. His first book RDPD jolted me out of my 'secure job' stupor, and this one does the same. It shows how changing your thinking is the first and most essential step in becoming an entrepreneur.<br /><br />This book covers a very significant topic viz leveraging the resources to create true wealth. It shows how the businesses achieve exponential growth using the power of leverage.<br /><br />For the first few pages, one may feel that RK is advocating too much real estate trading and accumulating debt. But as one goes ahead, you will get many insights into the thinking behind these concepts. Since RK deals mainly in real estate, his examples are mostly from that industry. But if you understand the essence of what he is trying to teach, you will be miles ahead of your peers in ANY industry.<br /><br />Some people feel that RK's style is too repetitious. But it's the folly of human mind, that it does not understand anything until it's hammered in! And we don't read RK for literary genious, we read them for practical genius. Don't we?
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I used to play the game ‘Bust-a-move’ when I lived in Japan when it first came out.  Then on the Sony PlayStation first edition.  This one continues the tradition unlike others that are buggy.  This one plays with no issues on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|We bought it digitally, colors are truly HD and beyond, the streaming loaded the movies fairly fast. Great family movie with bright fulfilling colors.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|My 7 year old loves this toy. Wish it came with more dart, we are always looking for them. AWESOME
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another book that I could not put down. Was waiting to see if Katniss and Peeta made up. Loved the ending.
1401216676|3.0|After hearing so many nice things about Alan Moore's \\"The Killing Joke\\" and being a big fan of Moore's work myself, I thought it would be a great idea to finally get a copy. Unfortunately, in the end, I was left wanting when it came to plot and writing.<br /><br />[Please note that this review does contain spoilers, so, if you wish to avoid some minor plot points, just read the last paragraph.]<br /><br />One thing that I did enjoy, however, was the art design. The illustrations looked very nice and helped move the story along well, short as it was.<br /><br />Yet I thought the writing was lacking considering Moore's talent for excellent narration. After reading works like The Swamp Thing and Watchmen, I was really hoping to be floored again by Moore. In practice, it felt stale, predictable and uncompelling. I was never grabbed in by the writing or plot and felt the whole theme of the Joker having a cause to show everyone (especially Batman) that the world is actually cruel, random, and unjust undermined his anarchical and unpredictable nature. It would seem that something deeper or more unknowable should be at the heart of the Joker's insane antics, yet, in the end, the Joker comes off like a good guy turned bad, plain and simple. Maybe I was just expecting too much, but shouldn't someone with as much readership and text devoted to him like the Joker have a more-than-shallow backstory? Shouldn't he have a deep, rich, and complex backstory and descent to evil that would at least reconcile the fact that he was a good soul at one point? Moore wants us to just accept that the Joker's wife's death was all that he needed to make an about-face and become a villain with nothing to lose, but I feel there should be more to it. Why wage a decades-long crusade against rationality and sanity on such a small premise. A little shallow for my taste.<br /><br />Part of me thinks that maybe this was just too short of a work for what it hoped to achieve. The aforementioned Joker backstory started great, and set up the trauma that made his mindset fragile nicely. I was convinced that he lived in a crummy situation and really just wanted to support his family. Yet I feel it rushes his descent into insanity, opting to merely show him look in a puddle, think everything is messed up, and go bonkers. As a whole, it just seems too predictable to be considered the \\"random injustice\\" that Moore wants us to see it as. A man down on his luck, involves himself with the wrong people, and gets burned for it. I'm usually bad at picking up subtext, so if this felt predictable for me, then I know something is up.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend that someone buy this before reading. Find it at your local library, give it a shot, and see how it settles with you. I'm no stranger to Batman; I've read Miller's work on the subject with Dark Knight Returns and Year One as well as Jeph Loeb's long Halloween (currently reading Loeb's Hush too). But even my interest in the Batman could not redeem my misgivings with Moore's work. It's not horrible, but I won't be keeping this for long.<br /><br />However, if one is really interested in Moore's work, I cannot recommend more his Swamp Thing series and the Watchmen. In those pages will one truly find artful narration and uniquely pleasing plots.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great look into the lives of Katniss and Peeta, again you find yourself rooting for the two of them.
0345803485|1.0|Total trash....what a waste of time! So glad I didn't pay for this \\"book\\" must admit, the emails were very witty & entertaining.<br />PAB

B00881VLCE|5.0|great assortment of puzzles and very easy to use. would be worth paying for. Much easier than other puzzle apps<br />Very good at showing off the high def screen on the kindle fire HD
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|I don't like this product because as you advance in this game you are forced to purchase pieces to be able to get to the next stage.  Watching commercials is one thing but a game claiming to be &#34;free&#34; should at least allow you to play the game free.
B000QCSA54|4.0|I read this book in one sitting. But I'm sure I'll be reading it again in the future. Godin does a great job of integrating stories into asserting one main point: Quit!
0452273331|2.0|A poorly written book by a potentially good writer. Too driven by the need to express her 'philosophy', Rand sacrifices all character and plot credibility on the altar of the idea. This idea is not interesting enough to overcome the paucity of characterisation and situation and much of the book is extremely silly and objectionable. One-dimensional characters embracing Rand's philosophy spout pretentious drivel at each other while other types are introduced merely to sneer at them. The rape of the female hero leads to a passion for her rapist - appalling. Only some of the descriptions of cities or nature suggest a real writer mired in the dross. As philosophy, depends on your view point. As literature, unreadable.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|If you can not watch a movie for nearly two hours and not fall asleep due to lack of car chases, shootouts, and clever catch-phrases, just spare yourself the agony and don't even contemplate watching this. There's more action to be found in an episode of Pawn Stars.<br /><br />If you can endure a film that is shot almost entirely in one pile of steel and concrete as a setting, but need a climactic ending, then unless you've been comatose for the last half-dozen years, save yourself the letdown. There's also more intrigue in an episode of Pawn Stars.<br /><br />A seeming amalgamation of the bad apples that collectively facilitated, or, depending on your opinion, caused the so-called &#34;so-called great recession&#34;, the movie is part dramatization, documentary, and cautionary tale.<br /><br />I think that I could probably shred aspects of this film taken as components, but really, the sum of those components worked for me.<br /><br />Sure, there are lame Hollywood metaphors and a seemingly deliberate attempt to provide some false closure in the closing moments that even metaphorically didn't exactly translate well considering reality, but don't misinterpret that as a stereotypical &#34;happy ending.&#34;<br /><br />It was dull, predictable, and typical Hollywood recreation of reality, but was nonetheless engaging. And to it's credit, the film not only avoids a Hollywood ending in its truest understanding, but it also was careful not to engage in portraying anyone as innocent, a victim of bad guys. The reality that the outcome could be pinned on anyone and probably everyone isn't overtly pushed as a theme, but it's there for consumption if you so choose.<br /><br />All in all, it's well-done and about as much as anyone could expect from a real Hollywood production that avoids the trappings of any specific genre. If the subject interests you and visual stimulation isn't a pre-requisite for movie enjoyment, you can do a whole lot worse than this film in the year 2013.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I enjoy working out the best way to defeat those dastardly piggies. It makes me think and plan and agree an attack, and the effects are just perfect.
0143117009|5.0|Our library non-fiction book group read and discussed this book after reading and enjoying Jared Diamond's book GUNS, GERMS & STEEL.  This book provoked lively discussion.  It is a great survey of different societies around the globe and in different time periods which have collapsed due to one or several of five factors which Diamond outlines.  I found the Easter Island, Norse Greenland and Australian examples most memorable.  Seeing how diverse societies have collapsed in the past due to these five factors provides a lens to modern day dynamics and how these five factors might be in play for us.  This is an important book with information we need to understand to survive and thrive.  The author has an extensive understanding of physical sciences and synthesizes information to make it understandable to those not schooled in these sciences.  We enjoyed the book even with its sobering message.
0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnsn's books are excellenty written and well researched. It is an interesting read with excellent quaotale information. I would recommend it to all History students.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|While this wasn't a huge success it certainly is an integral piece of Mark Knopfler's genius.<br /><br />My personal favorite, Ticket to Heaven, talks about those multimillion dollar charlatan bible thumpers on television.  The quiet way Knopfler plays and sings this song belies the words within.  If you don't actually listen to the words you just might think it's a great song.  Yet once you've heard the words, Wow!  It's like getting a smack upside the kisser.<br /><br />Iron Hand is pure Knopfler.  He writes songs for his gravely sound.  I'm not sure another voice could pull it off.<br /><br />Bravo, Dire Straits.  Bravo, Mark Knopfler.

If you are  a honest human being and sincerely reflect on the teachings of this book the perception you have of religion and myth will change forever. Religion did not kill God as Nietzsche said , this book did!

1594136742|5.0|I LOVED this book! I am in awe of the author's accomplishments. To walk the Pacific Crest trail with no training and surviving is indeed noteworthy. Very well written.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|If you enjoy movies with both action and humor, you'll really enjoy &#34;Red.&#34;  It's got a great cast of characters that all have one fatal flaw: they can't separate work from free time.  They're all retired, and yet they can't keep out of trouble!
B000FCK9CW|5.0|It seems rather odd to me as I sift through dozens and dozens of reviews of each and every detection book Agatha Christie ever wrote that there is always a group of folks to right off the bat claim that \\"This is not one of Agatha Christie's best novels.\\"  There is not exception to this.  If you do not believe me...read them yourself.<br /><br />Be that as it may....I personally have never read a detection novel by Christie that I did not like and I would be hard pressed to name my favorite or least favorite.  On one level or another, I like them all.  This book is no exception.  The story line here is pretty simple.  You have a love triangle...two women and one man and you have a very large inheritance at stake.  One of the women is murdered along with the old women who has all the money and only one person has anything to gain.  ALL the evidence points to this one surviving woman.  It is almost an open and shut case...there is no doubt!  Or is there?<br /><br />Enter the wonderful little Hercule Poirot who is hired by a local physician to try to prove that the young accused lady did not really commit the horrible crimes by poison.  As Poirot investigates even he must admit that the accused lady must have done it but he pushes on.<br /><br />There is a mellow love story here folded in mystery after mystery.  Agatha Christie was a master of twisted and surprising endings and she does not let us down here.  Now it has been stated that the ending here was too twisted and surprising to be realistic; that Christie misled readers by not proving enough information.  For those that claim this, they need to set down and give this book a second or third reading.  Dame Christies has done everything buy beat us over the head with hints and clues but done it in such a subtle way that the reader must be on guard line after line, page after page.<br /><br />I will say that this is one of the most mellow of this author's works.  For those that enjoy the cozy mystery genera they need look no further than this book to see where these wonderful book sprung from.  Most of Christie's books can indeed by classified as \\"cozy\\" by modern day readers, but this is one of the more cozy of the cozies.<br /><br />This is unfortunately an often times overlooked novel and most certainly has not gotten the respect it deserves.  But I will admit...for the life of me I cannot figure out where she came up with the title for this one.  If anyone knows...let me know.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksd look no further than this book to see where these wonderful book sprung from.

B00BESM14U|5.0|Do you remember what life was like without a cell phone in your pocket?  This movie reminded me of being in high school in the 90's.  The music was great, and the characters reminded me of people I knew.
B0027MJU00|5.0|One thing that almost everyone will agree upon, weather or not they admire her plot lines and in particular her subject matter, is the fact that this author can write!  She is a very skilled writer and story teller that, again, like the story or not, can bring out lasting, haunting and indeed, disturbing memories long after her novels are finished.  Dark Places is not exception.<br /><br />The plot has been gone over and over and over in excruciating detail is the over 1,000 reviews here so I will not linger long on that.  Briefly stated this is the story of a young and very disturbed girl who is reliving through flashback the brutal murder of the members of most of her family when she was at a young age.<br /><br />Now readers do be warned; the author does not beat around the bush in her descriptive and detailed description of killings (torture really) of both humans and animals.  I personally would not like to spend time camping or alone with any individual who was not disturbed by portions of this book.  I found myself to be horribly upset time and time again as I read page after page yet due to the skill of the author I simply was not able to put the book down.  I have found this to be true of all the books this author has written.  I suppose the concepts she addresses are so far from my own values and feeling about life for both animals and human that is like I am stepping into a new and forbidden world.  While I most certainly could not thrive of a steady does of this sort of literature, delving into it from time to time is almost like taking a vacation on a fearful ride at a theme part...I am horrified when the roller coaster goes into a plunge but I find myself every so often trying yet another.<br /><br />There is another aspect of this work which is similar to her other work.  That is that there is an acute lack of \\"nice\\" or sympathetic characters.  You simply will not like most of them.  I sort of compare this author's characters to those found on the popular TV series, The Sopranos - not one, even one of the people inhabiting the entire series is even vaguely likable...a large group of really wretched people, yet folks like myself go back week after week and watch the thing.  Go figure.<br /><br />It is also notable and good that this is a rather fast read...if you find your self hating it, as many readers here apparently did and do, then your agony will be brief...except for the memories of course.<br /><br />Brutal - absolutely brutal, yet Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite contemporary authors.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksular TV series, The Sopranos - not one, even one of the people inhabiting the entire series is even vaguely likable...a large group of really wretched people, yet folks like myself go back week after week and watch the thing.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. great for the kids. One problem I see is it is too quick to buy land and take your acorns / money,  without a safety net or way to back out. it has done this to me three times, selling me property I didn't want for acorns I was saving for something else.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I only watched the pilot episode so far. I liked it for the most part. It's a little different from most series that are on now which is good. I'm curious to see where it goes from here.
159463176X|4.0|It's a good read, I'm not quite finished with it so I'm hoping the end will be outstanding. So far it's a good read. The beginning was totally engaging, the middle has been a little dull but he does a good job of catching that and moving on when needed. So now we'll see how the end goes.
B0007LGCA4|5.0|These are very comfortable and the leather makes them a bit more dressy than my standard seat belt material Keen sandals.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I laughed and did my share of highlighting. Good zingers too. Wish it was longer. Not the biggest fan of 30rock yet but maybe I'll give it another chance.
B00271B752|4.0|Mainly liked this movie for capturing the grittiness of NY in the 70's. Acting was pretty good overall & it highlighted some interesting dilemmas when it comes to plain-clothes police work.
B00328G4XY|5.0|I enjoy this album of his and the DVD classic albums of how they put together the album with the remaining band members
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you have ever wondered about the true Jesus, the one who starts off as a mere mortal man, then this book is for you. As a layman who has questioned for years just how Jesus the man became reconciled as Jesus the Christ this book has provided an excellent insight into the beginnings. I also especially liked the information pertaining to the after crucifixion

B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I still have not completed this book yet.  I guess I just prefer reading an actual book instead of an e-book.  I did discover that Dorothy's ruby slippers were not ruby in the book.  I was shocked!!

B00005RHGL|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and the actors that played in it. val kilmer is a good actor and kurt russell too.
1439127700|5.0|I've read a lot of books about the Presidents; I'm a history junkie.  This book had an interesting, new angle.  I never really thought much about the President and his relation with his predecessors.<br /><br />I found the book well organized and nicely written.<br /><br />I particularly found the Truman/Eisenhower relationship to be eye-opening.  I've always been a Truman admirer. And a fan of Ike. But, some of the stuff I've read recently makes me less of a fan. (Thinking now, good President, not so hot a person).<br />The rocky relationship with Truman did nothing to enhance Ike in my eyes.  I found their rapprochement after Kennedy's death very heart warming.  Even crusty old ex-Presidents can swallow their pride and get on with life.<br /><br />I got the book as n anniversary present and read it in just a couple sittings.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|I enjoyed there albums since 1987 and they are still good. this one is for any rush fan. this is a good album.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|Best part of the book is the smooth narrative. This book is recommended for all age groups because it is both spiritual and philosophical.
0439023521|5.0|I bought these books for my nine year old.  He loved this book so much that I decided to read it as well.  What happens in this book is unfathomable.  I think it helped give my son some perspective on how great a life he has.  I know it has made me more grateful.

B00CLT31D6|5.0|You know the guy that you see walking down the street casually without a care in the world in jeans and a t-shirt, messy hair and flip flops  and then you see him jump in a Porsche. Turns out he's a successful entrepreneur or business owner and has a vacation home in Costa Rica. This is the book that will get you there. Frugal is key! Its real because its proven by real life millionaires including generations of Millionaires. Its not about selling a trend that will make you millions or getting lucky like Donald Trump.<br /><br />This has been the the best and most instructional book I've read. It has really changed my perspective. This book has given me insight about what I need to do about handling my finances wisely for long term. No need to keep up with the Joneses or the Trumps. The Joneses are the ones with health problems, stressed and overwork in order to keep up an artificial lifestyle.  I don't want to be them! I wanna be the girl in skinny  jeans, flip flops, and t-shirt, ponytail, starbucks in my hand driving pre-owned land rover that I bought cash. Small apt in the city, house in the country, money in the bank, retirement and income producing investments. That sounds better than walking around with a $20k handbag full of maxed out credit cards on a my hand that I bought on credit! Hello!
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|Works as advertised, with occasional crashes.  Very handy for taking meeting notes or jotting down ideas at random times.  I'd like to have more choices for file output format, but otherwise very useful.
B00CATONCA|1.0|Currently I am in the process of trying to get a replacement. The stupid 1 cent screw they put in the bottom won't come out I have even tried an electric screw driver! FOr $100 I expect a little better of a screw I love the walking dead but this is ridiculous. How much does a good screw cost?  Apparently too much for them!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Wonderfully wry and hilarious.  Her self-deprication knows no bounds.  Such great turns of phrase and a great fast read.  Buying it for my father for his 71st birthday - he'll love it too.
B00BSO2U1Y|2.0|If this version of Norma is for you then you haven't been listening to Callas or Sutherland enough. It takes years and years to learn to sing this most difficult part..Callas did her hard work and then stamped her art on it for all time. Sutherland did the same. It takes years and years to get into these recordings of the above divas..not by listening to them in cars and on planes, like canned music..no, this is not the way.<br /><br />Bartoli is a mezzo and sings with great knowledge, but her voice here is small, thin, and her interpretation is only deep at the surface. She should stay with her repertoire and not venture into this most complex of bel canto operas. Bellini is for Caballe, Sills, Freni, Gruberova, Fleming, not for Mozartians like Bartoli.<br />The \\"Casta Diva\\" is the dead give away to a lite perfromance with 18th century vocalisms, and many hints of Rossini. Sumi Jo is not Ludwig or Verrett...she is past her prime.<br /><br />The conducting is very good, and the liner notes are interesting. A lurid cover to the box set.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great characters, and really makes you think about what you would do in the same situation.  Really liked this book.
0345803485|2.0|This book is a joke and I am not sure why there is so much publicity about it. It is written bad and does not make sense. She is just getting her rocks off by writing it and we are falling for it. It will no doubt open a large can of worms. I bought all three books and could not finish the second and did not even touch the third. It just was not realistic. But hey, whatever blows up your skirt is fine.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Light reading for holiday, and a page-turner, but not one where you particularly care about the characters or what happens to them.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Had a lot of fun playing this game.<br />very active fingers...lots of missiles, yay. Wish there were more chances to upgrade though.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun and tricky. makes me think! sometimes the levels are confusing but other than that it isxa great game for free. the only real problem I have is it hasn't been updated yet so there aren't many levels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing I understand the movie much better now. Can't wait to read the next book. Reminds me of HP how the movies were good but not half as good as the book but still good in there own way.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Saw the series first, but I found that the book version is much more complete and different- I really like how it drags you into the story and keeps you intrigued, even if you know what is going to happen
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|What a great and eye opening story. A rare look into the life of a born North Korean prisoner. Must read.
014241493X|5.0|this book was such and amazing book. the characters were so different and fun! i was laughing through the whole book and wondering also. amazing
B0071BGOJC|3.0|A bit disappointing  after The Fall of the Giants.<br />Still an enjoyable read but the plot seems to be too manufactured to enable the characters to interact.<br />The disparate characters miraculously always find each other<br />unbelievably at the same places in history.<br />Still a good story which never the less brings history alive.
159514188X|5.0|the reason why i put it as 5 stars is because im guessing its a good book but i wouldnt know because my mom read the first couple pages and it was totally something i couldnt read. just saying this book is not for kids.. and not for some teens. i would reccomend 16+
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Its a wonderful movie and there are many things to learn from it - least of all the pleasure to be found in your work and the excellence you could strive for. Its a movie to be savoured, shared and stored in the collection.

B007THA4FI|4.0|As an American I know little about your typical English village so was very interested in the details and background story.  The story itself is bleak and to me thought the ending was cut short.  I would recommend this book b/c I was quickly pulled into the story and characters.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|It is fun to play with, and I never though it would be comparable with nexus 10! Keep it up guys....!
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|This new Haswell chip is adequate for anyone wanting to build an intel based computer that can run games, word processors, cad programs, and anything else you throw at it. It has a base clock of 3.2 ghz but it will boost up to 3.6 ghz if it needs to.  Additionally, the price per performance ratio is actually better than the 4670, making it a better value overall (especially when the 4670 is only marginally faster on all benchmark tests than this thing).  If you don't overclock due to the reliability concerns, this is the processor to get.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awestruckly epic and so cool that this app is soooooo cooool the  awesomest app ever forever rock minecraft! woo cool
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was as good as the first. I cant wait to read the third. I am so glad to hear she has a couple of more coming and even possible rumor of a tv show. I am on edge cant wait. I don't want to read the third one too fast because then I will have to wait for the fourth. I don't have patience haha
0345286200|5.0|The last unicorn is one of my favorite books from when I was younger and I finally decided to buy this after I saw that the author was on tour. Great book to read to kids as a bed time story and even as an adult I still enjoy it.<br /><br />I read other reviews for great buy books and most were good but a few said that their books were in terrible condition. I was very pleased that it was in better condition than I anticipated. It was yellowed with age but that was in. It did take longer to get here than I thought it would but for a 1 cent book I can't see any reason to complain. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|All around good game. I like how I can decide the truck and bus routes. Invest points are a challenge to get though
0525478817|5.0|I really need it for school, and I thought of looking here first and I found it (: thank you

0307277887|5.0|I like the purpose of being able to get inside of the mind of a thinking killer...to see the play of feelings and emotions that creep and crawl below the physical surface of the human body...to know that I sometimes feel the same way....

B00CO52NLI|3.0|It is a good virtual reality game for younger children. I see where it would teach them time management.thanks for the free app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because it allows me to zone out a bit (almost meditatively) while still making my brain work and problem solve. There are plenty of &#34;packs&#34; and that helps because some of them are very easy to get through. I usually play a little of this before I go to bed and it just helps me to calm down my brain.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I originally heard about this book from my friends, so after reading a sample I just HAD to buy it. I finished it in 6 hours. Pretty short read (I am a slow reader) but I absolutely couldn't stop reading page after page it was so exciting. Perfect combination of adventure, mystery, and romance.
B000FCK65W|4.0|Having a mom brought up in Depression-era Brooklyn definitely added to my sense of connection here. The tenement where you must walk through bedrooms to get from front to back describes my grandparents' home, the apartment where mom spent her childhood. I don't think this connection is essential to enjoy the book (and my book group confirms that), but it added depth for me.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|What you would expect.  Good guys kill all the bad guys.  Lots of bang bang and kick kick and special effects
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game works fine on the kindle fire HD. It's fun to solve the puzzles and searching the pictures is not too hard - maybe even too easy sometimes. I usually can play about 5-10 minutes before I have to either wait for the energy to be restored or buy energy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now that I understand how it works, it was seamlessly with Netflix and YouTube.  Looking forward to further updates... its an awesome product!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun. I love the way the graphics are. the horses actually move correctly too. honestly one of the best games.
B007NUP6GS|5.0|This is a terrific recording of Bach's six motets.  There have been many fine performances in the past, but this matches the best, I'd say.<br /><br />John Eliot Gardiner and his Monteverdi Choir have made Bach's music the centre of their repertoire for may years now and they have an exceptional insight into and understanding of these works as a result.  It shows here in the great variety between motets and the widely differing but always appropriate approach Gardiner takes to each movement.  The opening of Komm, Jesu, Komm, for example, is tenderly yearning, while the opening of Singet dem Herrn is performed with a restrained but intense, complex and incredibly precise rhythmic pulse.  It is exemplary Bach singing to my ears.<br /><br />The recording (of a live performance but with no audience audible anywhere on the disc) is excellent and the notes very good.  I don't think you can do better than this for a performance of the motets; however much I love my old Hilliard Ensemble and Ton Koopman recordings, this is the one I think I would keep above all others.  Very warmly recommended.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game lots of zfun makes me laugh every time I crash. you should play this game. could play this game all day
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I just went out and picked up a pair of Beats MIxr headphones.  They were the loudest ones I could find to work with my iPhone, which is just a tad underpowered for even the Mixr headphones.  So I looked up the various portable amps and read the updates for the small E6 at $25 all the way up to the E12 at $130.  $25 seemed like a pretty small risk and I didn't really expect much.  Whoa, was I surprised.  There's plenty of extra power here and it's clear and clean.  It even has two EQ settings that punch up the performance in the bass if you want more.  It really pushes the power over the hump to the point that I can't max out the iPhone anymore without it being painfully loud (and I like it loud).  By the way, Beats Mixr's go really well with an iPhone and Super well with an E6 and an iPhone.
B00969PR18|1.0|This apps couldn't find my address of 20+ years.<br /><br />I thought it was the free version that caused the problem so I upgraded to the US Country map and download my state. Still couldn't find my home address. What good is a map app if it can't find the starting point?<br /><br />Returned it and got my 299 Amazon Coins back.<br /><br />Now I'm looking for another map apps.
1781162646|5.0|I am not a die hard Stephen King fan in fact I think this is only the second of his books that I have read (I read Cell and hated it) because it was handed to me and I was told I \\"have to read this!\\" So I did, because you don't question it when your partner tells you to read something and you want a happy home life.<br /><br />I was really pleasantly surprised.  This is not a horror book, more of a coming of age story with a little mystery and romance thrown in. You get to relive the thrill of being at a carnival for the first time, being a kid and seeing your favorite character come to life and see how life isn't always peaches and cream. Joyland is a roller coaster ride.  King brings you up and then brings you down only to wind you back up again.  I really enjoyed this book and I loved the evolution of Devin, how he went from an innocent boy to a man.  Finally I can understand what all the fuss over Stephen King is really about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put it down......already bought the next one!<br /><br />Kind of similar to the hunger games which I also loved.
1935597760|5.0|I seldom leave book reviews (although I do read quite a few) and I don't understand the ones who disliked this book. Yes, the ending was not the conventional one that you would think it was leading up to. But I found it to be the only and the best way it could have ended.<br /><br />This book made me laugh out loud, as well as broke my heart. It was simply a story about a man who endured a horrific childhood, which would of course have shaped the rest of his life. The novel was rejected by many publishers, but I'm so glad the author persevered. It is poignant, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. Give it a try.
B00005QGAT|2.0|I just wanted a regular CD, instead i received a CD with interviews and other stuff on it, your description of what i was purchasing should have been better.  if i had known i was getting a CD with as much interviews as the amount of music on the CD, i would not have purchased it.

B003TTMFCK|5.0|awesome ending. I can't believe what happened. And I am so mad about what happened to Meredith. but overall awesome.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|It's nice to know that they still make movies where you actually have to pay attention to follow the story line and where real human characters populate the screen. Nice acting all around and like last year's Beasts Of The Southern Wild, young kids have predominant roles. Simple story really but with nice touches and with characters you care about. If your attention span is measured by minutes between big blow up scenes, Don't bother seeing this movie. But for one's that want to see a movie that makes a real attempt at character building and story than this is a nice attempt worth watching.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|Some of the bad reviews here are from the usual people who are used to the modern film process of hurrying everything along in a fast-paced movie. This movie, well directed by Soderberg, takes time to develop the story and suspense, ala Hitchcock. It's an interesting story if you don't need to have your films move along like comic books.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|The author, James Altucher, seemed interesting in his Reddit AMA, but his book ended up being pretty dull and with some bad ideas.<br /><br />For example, he's adamant young people should NOT go to college.  He has some reasons why, but they're rather poorly thought out.<br /><br />Yes some students would be better off learning a trade than spending 4 years studying Art History.<br /><br />But there's countless engineers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, chemists and people like me who don't really fit into those categories that learned how to think critically at a university.  I owe my success to playing games with chess masters and going to debates and lectures on a variety of topics.<br /><br />And I don't even work in the field that I studied.<br /><br />In any case, this is a how to guide by somebody that's almost/somewhat successful, in that he has success in the past but may or may not be deep in debt at the moment.<br /><br />Not a terrible book, but not worth the read.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I shouldn't have read so quickly, it was over too fast..I really enjoyed every word and I am looking forward to more of the story.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Very slow. Freezes all the time! I have to turn off my kindle to play. Needs to be fixed. Did not have a problem with YouTube infill they.made me download something. This had the highest rates (they weren't great) but better then the rest and that's pretty sad.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|This is a funny, wonderful memoir of growing up poor in Ireland. Frank relays the feeling of being so poor that they did not even seem to realize you could live any other way.
193700788X|1.0|I really want to give Charlene Harris a do-over.  Seriously, was there an editor that looked at her writing before it was published?  Nothing happens in this story except for a re-introduction of characters from the past. And a quick kidnapping of Sookie that she gets out of easily.  It's soooo predictable.  I can think of several amazing endings this series could have had. You would think she would have been planning the finale for years.  Instead it seems she ran out of ideas and just threw something together.  This is a perfect example of how trying to write a book a year fails.  Write a great story and if it takes 2-3 years, that's what it takes!  What a let-down.  UGH!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|HATED Sucker Punch when I first saw it.<br /><br />It wasn't until I watched it again, however that I was able to have somewhat more of an appreciation for what director Zack Snyder was trying to do here. Even though the story is a complete mess, it's not until you come to understand what the movie is about that the movie's magic becomes apparent. This is a movie that actually gets better with every viewing and in order to appreciate the film even more, you should really check out the bonus features on the disc to get a deeper understanding of how complicated the story actually is and how much work went into creating this film. The Maximum Movie mode especially is a great feature that gives a lot of insight into the film itself and should be watched if you have any interest in the behind the scenes of the film.<br /><br />The movie itself is presented in pristine quality with fantastic picture and thunderous surround sound. For the price this Blu Ray is going for, it's really not a bad addition to anyone's library. There's plenty of action and the music used in the film is pretty awesome. It's not the most amazing movie ever but I'm convinced it deserves a little better of a reception than it initially received. Like I said, you've gotta give this movie at least two viewings to begin to appreciate it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I saw clips of this movie on Youtube and decided that I wanted to see it. I am so glad that I did. The movie is about a young man (I believe a teenager), Zach who falls in love with his best friend's older brother, Shaun. I really love the progression of the story and the genuine sincerity of the love between them. There were no typical gay stereotyping like hot hunks with chiseled bodies, heavy partying and clubbing, being promiscuous or anything like that. Instead it is a wholesome feel-good love story between two average-everyday men with average-everyday bodies. There's very little swearing/cussing and the love scenes are tasteful demonstrating love and not just sex. I have watched it at least 10 times and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good love story to watch.
0738737909|5.0|As a professional psychic for over 40 years (I have publicly and with 100% accuracy predicted correctly the outcome of every presidential election since Kennedy) I have utilized the Tarot ever since I was around 12 years old.  Contrary to what some claim the Tarot does have an inherent power, not only for accurate insights when properly used, but also for prognostication and spellwork (as well as many other uses...meditation, etc.).<br /><br />I am also an artist and photographer, and I have loved the Tarot not only for its metaphysical capabilities but its wonderful artwork.<br /><br />Over the years I have purchased scores of Tarot decks; I not only collected them for their beauty, but I've also used several in the readings I provide to my worldwide clientele.<br /><br />With the Tarot Illuminati Tarot deck I have found the one deck that I wish I had had available to me 40 years ago, and the one and only deck I will use, probably, for the rest of my life now, not only for my clients' readings but for personal readings, spell work, etc.<br /><br />The deck is BEAUTIFUL almost beyond description; the artistic interpretations of basic and traditional Tarot meanings is accurate; the complexity of the visual scenes on the cards means that you can never \\"wear this deck out\\" as far as continuing to learn from it, derive insights about the meanings of Life, grow as a reader, metaphysician, and student of Life and the Occult.<br /><br />The deck is a large deck; the cards, as all cards are when new, are stiff and difficult to handle at first, requiring a \\"break-in\\" period.  Shuffle and use frequently and the stiffness quickly goes away.<br /><br />The artwork is not odd; powerful perspective views are utilized, and anyone who is a student of art (I'm both an artist and a photographer and studied to teach art at the university level) will recognize that the apparent size discrepancies inherent in some of the cards' visuals are normal:  view old masters' paintings of people in their puffy costumes and things look odd-sized or out of proportion...they are not, and neither are the paintings in this excellent Tarot deck.<br /><br />Mine arrived in \\"perfect\\" condition.  As I've said, I've bought literally scores of decks over the years, and it's not uncommon for a deck to have some minor flaws such as small nicks, a little missing gilding on some edges, etc.  If you're not looking for a foolish and overworked idea of \\"perfection\\" that has never existed and never will, then you should be happy with your deck when it arrives.<br /><br />All in all a magnificent, thorough, complete, and inspired vision of the Tarot that will serve the casual student and professional alike.<br /><br />[...]in their puffy costumes and things look odd-sized or out of proportion...they are not, and neither are the paintings in this excellent Tarot deck.<br /><br />Mine arrived in \\"perfect\\" condition.

B000KE1PDC|5.0|I've seen this series many times and have read the book many times. There's a little bit of mushing of characters and/or events for the sake of getting it all in with a minimum of time and actors but it's dandy the way it is! You can't help but love Daniel Radcliffe and of course, Maggie Smith is a wonder! It's beautifully filmed and I just love it!

While there are some good songs on this album, it's far from album of the year or even metal album of the year. I like Volbeats album better. :\
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Second season is as good as the first. Can't wait to get the third! I particularly enjoy the way ALL of the characters get woven into the various segments; there are a lot of &#34;stars&#34; in Gilmore Girls.
1451626088|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found in intriguing. Gregory provides some very interesting perspectives, as she has in her other books in The Cousins' War series. A story of love, hate, war, betrayal ,jealousy , political machinations and not a little witchcraft<br />She tells the story through the eyes of Anne Neville, the younger daughter of Warwick the kingmaker, Richard Neville. From when Anne was nine until her death at 28. Having read [[ASIN:1476735484 The White Queen (The Cousins' War)]] it takes some adjustment to read of Elizabeth Woodville was the primary arch-villainess of the narrative, but as Gregory tells each story from the first person perspective narration what she seems to want to provide is a different angle in each book. Still the shift in the way we see some of the protagonists from book to book in The Cousins War series is quite dramatic.<br /><br />The interaction between Anne and her sister Isabel forms a strong thread through the book, as does her relationship with and marriage Richard, Duke of Gloucester , later Richard III.<br />And the machinations for power between the variety of players. In her childhood it was Henry VI's (referred to by her as 'the sleeping king' Queen, Margaret of Anjou, who was the arch she-devil, and we see Anne's own growth from pawn to a far stronger character that is the backbone of this narrative. I found the scenes and dialogue most compelling.<br />At the end of the novel we get a slighlty different perspective to what has been built up about Elizabeth Woodville, and the secne is set for our journey into the life her daughter of Elizabeth of York in [[ASIN:1451626096 The White Princess (Cousins' War)]]<br />I found the scene was set well and richly and dramatically played out.<br />Richard III is portrayed as mostly a loyal and decent man, far from the portrayals by Thomas More and Shakespeare in [[ASIN:B004D2K9T8 Richard III]] but not above ruthless machinations and plots for his loyalty to his brother and what he sees as the good of the country.<br />But she does not absolve him of all blame for the plight of the boys in the tower as if he had not had them incarcerated they would not likely have been murdered. So her portrayal of Richard may not be quite as admiring and heroic as say [[ASIN:031237593X The Sunne In Splendour: A Novel of Richard III]], [[ASIN:0965005429 We Speak No Treason]] or  [[ASIN:0743415671 The Court of the Midnight King]]<br />Also recommended historical novels about Anne Neville are  [[ASIN:0385115822 Fortune's wheel]] and [[ASIN:0307346153 The Reluctant Queen: The Story of Anne of York (A Queens of England Novel)]]d what he sees as the good of the country.<br />But she does not absolve him of all blame for the plight of the boys in the tower as if he had not had them incarcerated they would not likely have been murdered.

B0002TJGQS|5.0|Always good to have a few of these on hand as spares.  You can't beat the price and so far they seem to work as expected.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Again, this is from a period I love to read. The story is interesting and I hadn't figured it out right up until it's fairly explained. There's only a little bit of rambling on about things that don't directly relate and from time to time the way the story is written from multiple perspectives did not move the story forward very much which I found a little irritating but move forward it did and was well written for the most part and very enjoyable.
B00479SVBU|3.0|Bought this because of the good reviews. I have the the next step down from this one for myself that I was very happy with until the pivot point broke, it still works but made of cheap plastic. I got this one for my wife that she likes but gets confused with the navigation of files so she hardly ever used it. About the 6th use 2 years after purchase it turned off and that was all she wrote it would not turn back on. They do an excellent job at taking over channels with no static but I would not buy another one due to longevity issues.
B000H6FE1M|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and her fianc&eacute; who met due to a picture of a hedgehog. It is really adorable! The details are really good considering the small size and the cost of the hedgehog.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|After listening to this CD it is horrible. I would like to say Lou Reed has a great voice for an old guy but his delivery on the vocals sucks. I don't really think his vocal style is really good. The first song is the worst and sounds like inexperienced musicians doing a rehearsal. The rest of the album gets a little better but not near good enough to make me want to listen to this crap over and over again. This appears to be a concept album and I have heard alot of them and many are good. This would have been a good album if it was done right. Lou Reed should have studied heavy metal and how it is done and some of the vocal styles and develop his own. His vocal style doesn't go over well with heavy metal fans. There one part where they are playing pretty fast and James Hetfield picks up on vocals. I do believe Lou Reed was supposed to be singing but isn't because he can't keep up with that part. I am sure he could have sung that part pretty good but he is not use to really fast music. In other parts of the album instead of singing he seems to be talking too much. Sounds like some of the lyrics could have been changed to something that can be sung. Metallica aren't on their way back to the top. I think with this album they just hit rock bottom. It's amazing how bands that been around much longer than Metallica who have come out with albums in the past few years and they still sound great if not better.

0062255657|4.0|See \\"Slightly let down\\" by Rachel R on June 25, 2013 below. A good review and I feel much the same.<br /><br />Part of making it seem like a YA book was the language, I think. It seemed less complex in both structure and in plot breadth. The plot itself was not as complex as in his other books: it was more of a single thread...almost claustrophobic. I did think, however, that there was deep character development in the boy. This upped it to 4 stars for me.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I still really like Gaimen's twists of fancy and the stroll he takes between what is real and the fantasy we really want to be there. He has a talent for making the fantastic seem very close at hand. If one could just stretch the emotions enough...

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read several of Khaled Hosseini's books. This is another good read. Maybe not as good as some of his earlier works (The Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns), but close. His attention to detail draws you in and you feel as though you are there watching the events. Not always pleasant reading, since there are terrible events described (as in his other books), but his not shying away from such things is part of his appeal.

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|So I'm finishing up the album, and I have to say that Avenged Sevenfold has rocked another stellar album. I was smiling throughout and getting goosebumps while listening to the whole CD. Been a big A7X fan for a long time, and although Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan is no longer with us, rocking those drums, A7X has managed to come through, and The Rev would be proud of these guys. Out of all 10 songs, I would have to say \\"Hail to the King\\", \\"This Means War\\", \\"Heretic\\", and \\"Coming Home\\" were my top favorites, even though all of their songs were amazing. I look forward to their next album.

B00DP3IESY|4.0|Saw the movie in theater. Pre-order the movie very early. Saw it again after received it. I will recommend it to everyone.
B001HN69AY|1.0|Basically it's a simple children's movie with no soul or a far less delicious version of Charlie and the chocolate factory: either way this movie will not allow you to enjoy any of its potential as it continuously makes you feel so uncomfortable in its lack of structure, ideas, and meaning. A wretched waste of all of the talents surrounding it.
B00DU74U74|3.0|What happened?  Did they really have to change the story line so much or the characters from what the author wrote?  Stephanie Meyer had a good book,  Hollywood version was not so good.  Kind of boring and predictable

0920236251|3.0|When I was looking up this book I saw the $1.99 price and the fact that it was Prime shipping and totally missed that it was a 3&#34;x3&#34; book.  Still a cute story, but I think it misses something in the abbreviated version.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The way the film shifted from empty scenes of lonely searchers to tight scenes filled with a profusion of different players. The way the scenes shifted from night to brilliant sunlight; from sweltering dry heat to high drifting snow in frigid weather was masterful.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the John Wayne character shifted from hero to anti-hero personas. Wayne's love hate relationship with the Natalie Wood character would have been a wonderful study for Sigmund Freud.

With that said when I found out she was writing two more books I never really found the time to read them.

So I am doing just that and I love it this time around so I would tell my friends and family to read this books and I did just that and my best friend start today!!

B00DBSZJRM|3.0|So, so movie.  Better than the original and that is saying something as a lot of movie 'make overs' are  not always better.  Needed to have the story tighter, this version was just kind of boring.  A lot of killing, yuck, yuck, yuck.  Slow.  Not much dialogue.  Jeremy Renner though does not need much dialogue, his bod says it all.

B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Born sinner is hands down one of the best rap albums I've purchased in a long time.  I can see why J.Cole wanted to drop his cd on the same day as Kanye and mind you has out sold Yeezus. Cole is a brilliant lyricist.  I can see why Nas says he's the one. This cd has been in my player in my car since I bought it and that says a lot. Guess it's true like when Cole was featured on JayZ's \\"Everyday a Star is Born\\".  Yep Cole did that!

0345522478|3.0|I wanted to love this book because of the agent who recommended it, and it wasn't bad, but I have to admit I didn't finish it. It just isn't for me. It feels like a great read for YA boys, in spite of the sex scenes. At least the ones I got to were innocent enough. And the writing was fine. But the character didn't feel deeply enough for me. That seems to be my beef with most books that don't grab me. But if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, give it a try.

0802473156|5.0|No lie, this book created a fundamental change in our relationship.<br /><br />When I first read the 5 Love Languages, my wife and I were wearing ourselves out trying to make each other happy.  My wife would keep doing things for me, and when I didn't do things for her in return she kept getting mad at me... \\"Don't you love me?\\"  She kept asking.<br /><br />I, by contrast, was trying to get her to sit and watch movies with me.  I just wanted her to sit with me.  \\"Why don't you spend time with me anymore?\\" I complained.  And she'd say, \\"I don't like this show, it's stupid\\".<br /><br />So there I was, trying to show her my love for her by spending time with her, and she was trying to show her love for me by doing things for me, and neither of us were getting what we wanted -- to feel loved!  It was so exasperating!<br /><br />The 5 Love Languages explained what was going on (i.e. that our love languages were different), and gave clear steps to change.  The result?  We both feel far more loved and way less exhausted than ever before!<br /><br />Great read!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]]

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I laughed.  I cried.  I fell in love.  I got my heart broken.  Hoover is an excellent writer with a superb imagination.  Every time I thought I had the story figured out, she threw me for a loop.  Even though the characters in this story are teenagers, the book is not just for teens.  It's one everyone (or at least the women) will enjoy.  The first 80% of the book is just a teen love story and I almost got bogged down in it, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The last 20% or so is FANTASTIC!  And it makes the parts that seemed dumb in the beginning make sense.<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, the best book I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie.  Rented based on recommendation from a friend. Great cast of characters. We feel like birders now!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Don't think that this is a story about a well off white woman in prison with a bunch of sterotypes.  After a couple of episodes, you will get hooked on each woman's story and find that these characters are fully realized and you will care about them all (maybe in spite of yourself).<br /><br />This is not a show for prudes, but if you are open-minded to the diversity of this world, you will find yourself completely hooked.  Not to mention impatiently waiting for 2014 to get here!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you are or were a comic book collector, you will appreciate this movie.  Of course some creative license was taken however, despite that, it really holds true to the characters including their own unique traits and faults.  CGI in the film is without a doubt superb.  Two thumbs up!
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Never read or heard much about the earlier years of Salvador Dali.  This movie gives you insight in to the tortured mind of Dali.  Pattinson gives a good performance.  Sometimes I had to laugh especially in the opening when he shows up at the school dressed in a frilly shirt, velvet jacket and the boots.

B004ADF7RO|5.0|One of the best kid-friendly movies from my past.  I JUST had to share it with mine!  The innocent adventure experienced by the crew is refreshing compared to today's sexually-charged \\"teen\\" movies.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|As with his last album, Born and Raised, John Mayer continues to add a folky spin to his music that separates his album from his past work. Catchy songs and a great listen the whole way through!
B00CPTUN5G|2.0|I've been a brony since sometime early 2011 and one of the biggest 'concepts' that I recall seeing in the fandom around that time and then on was the idea of a mishmash of both ponies and humans.  A novel idea and what can be assumed as the bane of this movie.  Does it live up to it?  Yes and no.  If one is wanting to look at how well it ties into canon it does so exceptionally well (having Scootaloo doing a chicken dance, Celestia being all ruling but not all knowing, etc.) but the other area I focused on was how well it fared if one didn't watch the series but expected it to make sense.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Very close if not perfect to the characters back in Equestria.<br />-Gives a good alternative universe to parallel Equestria that has no major flaws.<br />-The plot itself makes sense if one is well versed in Equestrian lore (i.e. seen all three seasons).<br />-Tons of background characters placed in their respective roles.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-The designs are too bland and too similar.  All the female characters wearing skirts for example (Rainbow Dash's tomboyish nature would differ here)<br />-The plot itself has a few gaping holes in it.<br />-Characters introduced are not necessarily going to be canon in the show such as Flash Sentry.  I would interpret this being the movie being so 'bad' or my less cynical approach that with different production schedules that it was never a consideration to add Flash into Season 4 of the TV series.<br />-Is a rehash of the pilot episode (meet new friends, the villain attempts to break them, harmony powers and immediate reversion of the villain to neutral).<br />-It's said that the main six characters are of the age and/or mentality of young adults whereas here they are teenagers.<br />-For those that are more or less aware of the show will understand the references better than those who don't watch the series.<br />-A big screen release in Macromedia/Adobe Flash does kinda come across as something rare, I think?<br /><br />The Plot (I've only seen it once so I might be out of order):<br /><br />From what I recall the movie starts out with Twilight and her friends residing in the Crystal Empire right after the season 3 finale featured in [[ASIN:B00AZP0BN6 My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic: Princess Twilight Sparkle]] and some point before Twilight ascertains her duties as a princess.  This part is well done and captures the beauty and glamor of the Crystal Empire (I never saw this on the big screen but nonetheless).  Along the way at night Sunset Shimmer, a former student of Celestia, emerges into Equestria and successfully steals Twilight's magical crown.<br /><br />Now to break off from the movie plot there are two things that I can see that makes it seem odd.  For the most part while this show is written for little girls things like the space-time continuum and how long a pony lives aren't going to be explained...OR if Celestia at some point or another has multiple students under her wing.  Throwing in characters mid-end season is a bit risky however it did work exceptionally well with Shining Armor and Mi Amore Cadenza.  As for Sunset Shimmer it mildly works but feels different since it breaks some of what the show established.  However I'm just gonna stick with the Gameloft game's implication that any student enrolled in Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns is that of being Celestia's student.<br /><br />Twilight is instructed by Celestia to go into the portal and recover her crown.  She does so and her dragon assistant Spike follows her into the portal and into the humanoid world.  I've seen enough fan written work that portals tend to be cliche and overused.  I also understand that finding an interdimensional way from point A to point A minus 1 that it is not as easy as it seems.  The exit point of the portal goes right in front of Canterlot High School.  Quick and easy access but I'm surprised a texting student hasn't successfully walked into it yet.<br /><br />Along the way Fluttershy turns in the crown and Celestia puts it in place for the upcoming dance.  I've honestly never watched too much TV so I can't say I've seen a lot of high school TV shows.  All I can state is that it does seem a little too common but I can give it the benefit of the doubt.  Along the way Twilight meets her friends similarly to the original episode (Spike's affection to Rarity is also present) and is cyberbullied by Snips and Snails using modern day technology such as smartphones and 'YouTube' (while written language is obscured because of regions the design is reminiscent of it).  If someone was a horse in a human's body (i.e. American Dad when Stan switches bodies with a horse) we'd all expect them to act like horses and the plot works well with that.  Even though I've had my share of bad bronies and bullying within the fandom I didn't think twice of what is shown here.  I understand though that the issue of cyberbullying is in fact a rather grave one and that makes me wonder how iffy for some that can be as a learning tool vs. 'having it happen to them' I guess.<br /><br />So far up to this point the plot is good but it is then on that it begins to just roll down hill.<br /><br />In order for Twilight to win the crown she has to participate in dance and be elected princess.  As a suspense the dance occurs within hours before the portal closes for 30 moons.  The time of measure isn't really specified but Sunset Shimmer has won the last three times this event has occurred.  Where things get a a bit more iffy is that Twilight asks who can participate and Celestia says 'anyone'.  To me implies that Twilight is not even a student at Canterlot High which could explain why she does not go to any classes.  Personally while classroom scenes are overdone it's not complicated to at least put in a scene that she goes into a classroom and then after a while leaves it, etc.<br /><br />Where the non-canon (in terms of the actual TV show) love interest comes into play is that of Flash Sentry.  A former ex of Sunset Shimmer and one who helps Twilight clear her name of sabotaging the gymnasium where the dance is being held.  It was just kinda thrown in there because Hollywood and all and his role really wasn't that big.  So with a song, something not really memorable (whereas I remember four of the seven songs in Magical Mystery Cure), the student body rebuilds the decorations and they proceed to have the dance.  Pretty much Twilight wins and Sunset Shimmer steals the crown.  I can honestly understand Twilight's necessity of doing things 'properly' but to me it also felt like the whole school plot is meaningless if Sunset Shimmer was just gonna steal it.<br /><br />Sunset Shimmer turns into a demon, mind controls the student body and goes on a rampage just to be defeated by the crown itself with Twilight absorbing its power.  Twilight's magic also gives her friends pony ears, tails and wings (if applicable).  Kinda awkward I suppose if one has been on the Internet long enough.  Twilight returns home and the movie ends with Sunset Shimmer remaining in the other world instantly reformed and apologetic (which happened the only time the Elements of Harmony were used and the target of that was still conscious) and in good hands.<br /><br />Conclusion: 2/5<br /><br />The reason why I'm rating it 2/5 is as follows:<br />-There could of been something else done besides a high school.  Heck there could be no school and merely a neighborhood and a similar plot (except the dance) could of worked.<br />-The character designs are not really that good and don't match some of the characters such as Rainbow Dash.<br />-Just felt like too much too close to the pilot episodes.  Which were great episodes but as I've come to expect the pilot episodes are always stepping in the waters unsure of what to expect.  In other words it shouldn't be remade into a movie.<br />-The movie really didn't catch the spirit of the television show at all.While it matches the characters very well the feel just wasn't there.<br />-The plot just wasn't that good.  Rebooting the series into it, forcing Twilight to meet all her friends again felt like a waste of time.<br />-I mostly don't understand the hype behind it or why so many bronies loved it.  Call me weird (can you do that...can you be weird to the second degree?) but it does make me wonder 'if it's Generation 4 do we all love it and if it's not will we all hate it?'<br />-Focused too much on shoutouts.<br />-I'll admit I went in with an open mind and like the above didn't catch the appeal.<br /><br />I might watch it again for a second opinion but I don't know.  If I do I might update this review.  I might also update it because I'm pretty sure I've left some gaping holes in my logic as well.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I honestly think that the premise is great. I love the way Pam Grout conveys her beliefs. As for the experiments, some didn't work at all for me. Others I've been kinda doing for so long that I can't be objective. Overall it was a very positive book and really fun to read.

B00DHHWY9I|5.0|\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Would-be writer Nick Carraway leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.<br /><br />The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (great as Jay Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (as Nick Carraway), Carey Mulligan (as Daisy Buchanan), Joel Edgerton (as Tom Buchanan), Isla Fisher (as Myrtle Wilson) & Jason Clarke (as George Wilson) is great. The directing by Baz Luhrmann (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald) by Luhrmann & Craig Pearce is great.<br /><br />The music by Craig Armstrong is great. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is great. The film editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond & Matt Villa is great. The casting by Ronna Kress & Nikki Barrett is great. The production & costume design by Catherine Martin (who also produced) is great. The art direction by Damien Drew, Ian Gracie & Michael Turner is great. The set decoration by Beverley Dunn, set dressings by Ciaran Jordan & Sam Lukins is great. The special effects supervised by Dan Oliver & coordinated by Jasmin Lyford is great. The visual effects supervised by Mark Breakspear, Andy Brown, Tony Cole, Jon Cowley, Lindy DeQuattro, Julian Dimsey, Chris Godfrey & Lesley Robson-Foster, coordinated by Ann-Marie Blommaert, Michelle Cornwall, Zachary Mallett, Barry St. John,Katrina Taylor & Pip Wright is great. The stunts coordinated by Glenn Ruehland & Ashley Fairfield is great.<br /><br />This is a great, well-crafted, well-made and great-looking film that is entertaining and well-done. This is a great film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another great performance as Jay Gatsby, a character that is well-suited for him. Baz Luhrmann directs another great film that is an interesting pick of a movie to do. This was a long awaited and anticipated reunion of DiCaprio and Luhrmann, working together after nearly 17 years since \\"Romeo & Juliet\\". This is also an interesting and long-awaited / anticipated pairing of close childhood friends DiCaprio & Maguire. This is one of the best-looking films of the year and of the summer season, thus far. It is also one of the best films of the summer season, as well, thus far.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I was really hoping this would be as good as the 2009 and it surpassed my expectations! I love the movie and it is also different too. There are some changes in certain events, such as who is the one to repair the core reactor on Enterprise - yet it works with the script too. Without giving any more away for those who haven't seen it yet, I will move on to say this.<br /><br />I foresee that there will be more in this series and I hope the actors will stay with it to keep it running well. The actors can age in this quite nicely, as they will in real life, so there will be continuation. I just can't wait to see what comes next!!<br /><br />I was a fan of the original Star Trek on TV and of all the movies. So it is great to now see new versions which capture the spirit of the old originals. Love Chris Pine as Kirk because he carries all of William Shatner's  old mannerisms, but also interjects new ones that make him special. The other actors have also made their own marks to compile a great new crew for Enterprise which can last for a long time. It's fun - and we all need some fun and escapism right now in our lives.<br /><br />Just one question - when will they give 'cupcake' his own action moment? Just don't kill him off!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me of the interviews of survivors from WW2. The individual stories drew me in and I looked forward to the next one. The technical side of things wasn't over done anymore than the human side of things. It was a really nice balance.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|This series is just boring.  it took forever to read it and then when I finally did I had no desire to read the other too.  its boring dull and poorly written
B003G4W49C|4.0|I started reading expecting it to be a normal children's book. But it is so much more! So engaging and inspiring that I can't wait to read all the other book in the series.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Unlike Hollywood, which seems brain-dead and producing mostly movies for severelly intellectually challenged audiences, TV producers recently offer quality that is lacked elsewhere. Homeland is very good, quite honest and - thank God! - disturbing. Watch it, it is fresh air after Hollywood's stale political correctness. You may even see some faces that had not undergone cosmetic surgery, what a relief!

B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like this game but it`s very hard to get weapons and it`s very confusing at times but it`s still fun. To make it better would be that you can create your own character.
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|The songs dont really bother me, in fact I might be inclined to give it 4 or 5 stars for the music which I enjoyed, probably not as much as previous albums but bands are rarely the same when members who have previously contributed to the writing of music die. The reason for my 3 star review is that this deluxe CD is only made deluxe by some artwork, which is cool I suppose, and a little code to redeem the extra track online (where they collect your information). the reason I buy cd's is for higher than digital download quality audio files, so tricking me into some info collection scheme under the guise of a \\"deluxe\\" version and delivering an mp3 file bothers me immensely. Not only is the deluxe bonus track an mp3 but it can only be downloaded 3 times, as opposed to one you purchase from say apple. If this was obvious from the get-go I would have just bought an AAC version and skipped the hard copy.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Overkill in the gore but it was alright, I like the Stallone version much better though. It was a nice twist that the girl had a supernatural ability, wasn't expecting that one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|For a free game the hidden objects are hard to find and a challenge. However, would be better without the timer an  less pop ups
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Im going to start off by saying yes, I am a huge A7X fan. They are in my top 5 bands and with this record they will remain there! I am very excited to say that! With that being said I want to give my opinion on my first impression of only listening to this album one time. Thats probably a bad idea but, oh well if anything my opinion will probably get only more positive. I absolutely love this album from the first listen, that can be good and bad. The good about that is it just instantely kicks you in the face with killer riffs, awesome singing, and clear quality, just excellent. The bad to me is it may get old quicker than the more complex songs of the past.These songs are 5-6 minutes long which is great for a structured type song. The new album is kind of like nightmare in that sense, the songs are structured. So this follows more of a main stream type metal I feel.I personally like complex songs that go all over the place like \\"Save Me\\". I am not complaining though because the music delivers a punch, it really does. People are always gonna complain about something, I see some suposed die hard fans on here upset, saying its a big let down. Well people I am hear to say I am a die hard fan and critic of all metal music. I am not all afraid to say a ban flopped or if they nailed it. Hell, Metallica had a bad streak for years, I still liked Load and Reload and still listen to alot of those songs and love them. ST. Anger was a big flop, how would you like for A7X to put something like that out! Bullet 4 my Valentine just decided to start singing to 15 year olds (FLOP). If you dont like this album, you didnt like Nighmare and you definitely dont love metal music! This band has evolved into who they are, Hail to the King!<br /><br />My top 10 bands are as follows, top 5 first.<br />Trivium,A7X,5FDP,10 Years,Metallica<br /><br />Sevendust,Chevelle,Killswitch Engage,Deftones,Shadows fall

B0098460O4|5.0|Bought this new.  Could not wait for it to get in stock.  I watched these young people on 'Brittains got Talent&#34;  and both are extremely talented.  He is 17 and she is 16.  The young lady, Charlotte is very good but Jonathan is unbelievable to be as young as he is...or any age for that matter.  His voice is perfect.  Anyone that likes Opera should love this.  Price was right and delivery was fast.  No problems.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a hard read in some sections but well worth moving through them to find out what happens to the characters.  The voices and feelings of everyone range true and I felt while reading this that I was actually in the small town where the story takes place.  It is really a page turner.
B00E6D4HHO|1.0|Seriously? Why would you buy this when you know there is going to be more movies with Wolverine in them coming out. Be smart and wait till all the X-men movies are finished then by the FINISHED collectors set.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|While I enjoyed the movie more than my wife, it's not compelling.  Matt Damon is the protagonist in this film and we learn right away he's loyal with a wild streak and that he's been this way since childhood.   The movie starts with his character experiencing a mishap that makes him desperate while in the process of rebooting his life.  It would have  been nice to know where his skills came from beyond a cppl of side comments.  More importantly we never get a clear grasp on how the situation between Earth and Elysium degraded to the current level.  Jody Fosters character starts out terrible and gets worse from their in a way that requires character building so the viewer isn't left questioning scenes and actions during the movie..  &#34;add some layers&#34; if you like, to both Damon and Foster's characters, not a lot, just a wee bit more would have been nice.  Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame is also a significant part of this movie and while his character rises well above both Matt Damon's & Foster's in being the most memorable it's not because of what he was given but in what he does with it, his role requires the least amount of depth yet I got the impression I knew him better than the rest by the end.  this movie had 2 hours to tell a story... a really strong story that could have built a strong emotional tie to the audience and while it doesn't waste it (too harsh a word), Elysium does squander several opportunities that would/could have made it epic.  If I was to condense Elysium down to one impression, it'd be &#34;rushed.&#34;  It wasn't for lack of time that it came across as rushed but much more in the choices made regarding characters relationship & interaction that ate up valuable time that could have been used differently.  I liked the movie, it's a solid 3 of 5 stars and I'd be really interested in seeing an extended version if only to see if Elysium had heart that was lost during editing.istrict 9 had but lost it in editing.
B00BN1QV1M|5.0|I went out of my way to collect these recordings in their original LP issues. The young, technically assured, stylistically savvy conductor quickly became one of my favorites. He had already mastered styles as disparate as those of Tartini, Bellini, Nono and Mahler and was equally at home in concert hall and opera house by the time Decca signed him when in his early thirties.<br />It is wonderful to have these performances gathered together in a mid-priced box set.<br />I was unaware until I read the liner notes that the performance of the Beethoven 7th didn't get good reviews when it came out. It very quickly became my favorite performance of the work. It seems to me to exemplify what a \\"Dance\\" symphony should sound like. Virtually every other performance got raves upon release, and the raves were well deserved.<br />I tend to divide conductors into two groups...\\"structure\\" masters and \\"details\\" masters. It is the rare conductor who combines both that achieves greatness. Such is Abbado !<br />The Brahms, Bruckner, Prokofiev, Hindemith and Janacek recordings may just be the best available.<br />As regards the Deutsche Grammaphon and Sony performances with the same orchestras under Abbado mentioned by the other reviewers, they are NOT the same performances included here.<br />Sound recordings are generally excellent.<br />In this personality driven re-issue, there is much information about Abbado and recording sessions etc.in the liner notes, but nothing about the works themselves.
B0041KY0TW|4.0|It is a very good movie. Erotic cinema at its best! I laughed, cried, and got horny all in same breath!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I  really enjoyed playing these games ...<br /><br />I am 80years young and they are enough to challenge me and and yet not overwhelm me.....great job guys
B00271B752|5.0|I loved his idealistic idea of how the police should be.I am a fan of police and don't believe the corruption is as nearly institutional as the movie suggests. That being said, it was classic gritty 70's drama. I loved it!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|funn to play exept that the land becomes way too expensive as you level up but its funn i love it all the animals its just grate
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the action in the book<br />It is a awesome book I love it so much it is the best
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|The book grabbed me right from the start and hard to put down.  It was very well written, obviously, and was disturbing, thought provoking, suspensful, sad and hopeful all rolled into one.
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|The device works perfectly with Windows 8 (I was initially concerned that it might not work with Windows 8-when I contacted Anker, they were extremely helpful and responsive).  The device is a great product and Anker is  a great organization.
1416955070|4.0|The book started out very exciting from the very beginning. It peaked my attention from the start. Unfortunately, it didn't sustain the excitement and the love tale was just so-so. Its all about falling in-love with the characters and this book didn't do that for me. I probably won't finish the series.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I love the characters in this book ... their actions and personalities generate true curiosity about who they are and what they do. Mr. Gaiman does a masterful job of weaving the individuals through their strange and beguiled lives. Such oddness that melds into commonplace life, the story appears to be straightforward, but it is anything but. Mr. Gaiman, who is an Englishman, did a masterful job of presenting this story on US soil. Well worth a read!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the different characters in this book.  The women were not perfect and that is what made them people you could identify with.  A woman who seemingly has her act together but not in reality.  A man who is the perfect husband and father but had a terrible secret.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 yr old son loves this game. he quickly figured out all the puzzles but still enjoys playing. definitely worth the money for us.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|.....this would be the one to take to a desert island.  All of the great songs are there, plus, maybe the hardest one to find: To Make You Feel My Love.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|How could you not like this if you liked the first? It's impossible. I reccomend the books as well. Go for it!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is fun, linear and has a lot to offer, you are encouraged to level up, so that you can unlock more content.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use this mostly for alarms. It reminds me to take my meds. It reminds me of tasks I need to complete during the day. Love the sleep feature. I have tried several apps and like this one best.
B005DZMN2U|5.0|This is Thelonious Monk at his best I have a copy of this lp but I wore it out. Great to have a good copy again.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Probably one of the best movies ever! This edition seems clearer and all the extra features are a nice bonus.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Great movie that definitely makes you laugh. Stanley Tucci was awesome as the Father in this flick. Emma Stone turned in a great performance. My girlfriend loves the movie so I'm glad I found something we both like and want to watch. Better than the average chick flick that just puts sappy romance and drama on for two hours. This had a good comedic element that made it worth the price tag.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I have read the books & the series is so good I had to own a copy! I encourage anyone who loves this series to do the same.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The my alarm clock is sleake and is useful. It is also a great alarm clock and a great watch
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this everyday on my computer, so I downloaded it on my phone. The app is great, so is the game. If you love bingo games, you need to get this app.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I bought this for my son who insists we hear it every morning in the car.  It keeps us both in a happy mood.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Loved it. Thought it was very funny. Usually not a big fan of remaking classic movies but they did a good job with 21 Jump Street. I know its not a strict remake but more of a sequel in that the characters are fresh and new but it will always be compared to the original. I do think the original is the better of the two but watching both provides good entertainment. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill do a great job. The two actors worked well together and really fed off each other to make a very funny movie. The supporting case was great. Rob Riggle was hilarious as usual. Dave Franco was great as well. Ice Cube was probably my favorite character, aside from &#34;Korean Jesus&#34; (you will get it once you watch it). The one lacking part of the movie I thought was the love story. Obviously you have to tone it down considering the main characters pretend to go back to high school but it felt a little forced. Ellie Kemper as the teacher swooning over Tatum's character was pretty funny. But Jonah Hill and Brie Larson did not click for me on screen.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend that you go and check it out. It was worth the price tag for me at least to buy but you should at least rent it and watch it if you are not into buying.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|The Dark Side Of The Moon contains some of Pink Floyd's best tracks ever recorded.  Even if you're not a Pink Floyd fan, the music on here is so spectacular that it will leave you feeling blown away.
B00004XQ83|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't already been said by the justifiably glowing and highly positive reviews just previous to mine-- I completely agree that, unlike other music cds where you're lucky if you get just a couple of really good cuts amongst a lot of mediocre songs, with this soundtrack there isn't a single weak link on the whole album-- they're all beautifully done in their own style, and highly evocative of the emotion, spirit, nostalgic place & time of the film, which of course is what any great soundtrack is supposed to do!  If you loved this movie too, and haven't inexplicably bought this soundtrack already, I'd highly recommend that you do it right now-- this is a great cd to listen to anytime your spirits need a lift, especially when your driving and having to deal with stress-inducing traffic-- believe me, this kind of upbeat music helps decompress the stress because you're so busy enjoying it that it helps distract from all that road-rage craziness! :0
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is wonderful. It pretty much works the same as on my computer. Pretty much everyone has the facebook app downloaded on their phone, but if you don't, I recommend this.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is amazing!  I couldn't put it down!  I definitely would recommend this book if you like a good read!
B00846REIS|5.0|Good book keeps you wanting more!! Gideon is an intense character<br />On to the next one! Sylvia day is a good author
B000068FWC|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of Supertramp, but the songs on this C.D. are seriously good.  &#34;Breakfast in America&#34; (the song not the album as a whole) is incredibly catchy and fun to listen to.  It's also not found anywhere on the likes of Youtube (at least not that I could find) so if you want to listen, you'll have to buy the C.D.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show. If you like law this will be great! Great plots and drama. Harvey is great! Mike is the best partner
B008HK3XKO|4.0|It pretty much works.  It is simple to install and does stand up as promised.  I would recomment it.  Chuck
1442339527|3.0|This couldn't have been written in a more long-winded and complicated manner. The narrator could have simply stated the principles, used a real life interaction, maybe an anecdote then moved on to the next. 6 CDs could have easily been 3 without stating, then re-stating, then stating backwards, then etc. his points.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love hungry shark, but in the other one you only had one shark. In this one you can get a lot of sharks including a Meggaladon. There are also way ore types of fish. Giant cranes, glow fish, rays. This is definitely the best one. It only froze once and I am sure that they have fixed it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's good but make it like the computer version please! It is better on there. Fix the infinite diamond, gold, and iron trick... add findable lava, make animals spawn so if you kill all of the sheep, you still have hope. A new feature or two like being able to have infinite buckets made out of diamond blocks or a new dimension like something mythical maybe... Asgard, Odenheim or Heaven. And add mods I am very disappointed with this more than anything else... to me that was scraping the edge when I bought it. It is fun nonetheless. If you can't get the PC version this is your second best choice I would recommend this for children in the car, just anytime fun or when they are bored at an event, absolutely fun but you better limit screen time ;).
B0064X7FVE|5.0|They tell you what time it is going to start raining even. I am very impressed. I like forecast, they are very accurate.

B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Really not one of Disney's best, story line could have been way cooler.  The spastic candy girl was annoying and sometimes hard to understand.  Did not hold my 3 year old son's interest much at all.

B007PYEY9M|1.0|Neither my husband or I, nor our 3 year old son liked this movie.  There might be 4 good jokes to hold out for, but it's really so painful to watch the rest of it.  There's cheesy funny and cheesy awful, and this movie is cheesy awful :(

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I got this because I kept dropping my kindle. it fits the kindle well and I like the way it stands up to read while I am lying on my side in bed. If you dont want something bulky, this works well.

B004DM0UII|4.0|Just putting something here to get rid of the rate this app window...decent app for some ambient music. I like to use it when I am studying.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game iron man 3 is a fun, challenging game. The visuals are not bad and the gameplay is quite smooth. As with every tablet game the only way to process quickly is to spend real money rather than the money in game. However this does not take anything away from the experience of the game. All in all on of the best tablet games I have played. 5 out of 5 stars.
B00COCY67A|4.0|when you hear artists work with others or try  different things  nowadays it feels staged and rehearshed and dime a dozen. however this truly  brings  Elvis  Back home and  ELvis  was a  versatile artist who truly  had as much Pop as he did  R&B,Gospel and COuntry  running in his  musical veins.  now he was  past his commerical peak and prime when he  cut these sides, however he still had the goods and the material here  truly  works very well with his vocals and tone.  Elvis and  Stax records fit like a  glove.

B00BUADSMQ|4.0|All around action movie, good special effects, some humor and good acting all add up to a good &#34;popcorn&#34; movie.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|with John Mayer you have an artist who is musically versatile and has  shown in the past he can cover alot of bases and he also has shown he wears some of his influence on his sleeve. the thing is here while his playing and  vocals are good, the songs just don't really go anywhere and he is just going through the motions.  i keep waiting for that cross between James Taylor and  Stevie Ray Vaughan  to fully come out on his albums and  to  make that kind of album statement and he doesn't always bring the goods, however he still is a talented cat, he just has to re sharpen the pen and he don't need happening flavor of the moment acts on his  stuff.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Now You See Me is about as close to a magic trick as a film can become - it's glitzy, slick, fast, fantastical and ultimately nonsense. Unlike the vast majority of 2013's theater offerings, it's undoubtedly exciting and entertaining and keeps a pace going that stops the audience asking really obvious questions. But unlike other recent magic-themed films such as The Illusionist and Prestige, both of which have tricks of their own and get better with each viewing, Now You See Me gets flimsier and less substantial the more you think about the plot, and feels more like a pick-pocketing scam than a grand heist.<br /><br />The opening quickly establishes four supposedly world-class magicians, none of which seems to have any really great acts, and they are assembled by a mysterious hooded character who gives them all coded tarot cards to meet. Naturally, they all do and are led to an apartment where a grand scheme is unveiled in 3D holographic schematics that a NASA engineer wouldn't be able to understand. Somehow they figure it out and united as the Four Horsemen, the crew now put on Robin Hood-style shows where the wealthy are robbed and the poor are literally showered with cash. Sounds like fun, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the logic gets so bad so quickly it becomes ridiculous. After a French bank is robbed by magic, an Interpol agent is sent to Vegas to work with the FBI (good luck getting the paperwork to approve that partnership). The FBI proves to be staggeringly incompetent as our magicians show a near-psychic capability to outwit them at every turn. At one point, our heroes even hijack a bus rigged with a flipping and exploding squad car to fake a disappearance, all set up within minutes at exactly the right point on a bridge. They even install a massive, smear-free, 5-ton mirror to hide a safe instead of simply stealing it, hoping that the police stand only at exactly the right angle to see it's gone (and praying they don't dust for prints and bang their heads on the mirror).<br /><br />This is all part of the fun but by the time act three rolls around, the film doesn't even pretend to be about illusion and mind-games anymore - it quickly descends into impossible CG shots and absurd set pieces that are fun but betray the original premise completely. The big reveal for one of the major characters is completely unbelievable, worsened by a really weak romance plot that's wedged into the storyline. The actual finale is such an insult to the audience that I couldn't believe it made the final cut.<br /><br />Still, the remarkable thing is that it's an enjoyable film that, just like a well-executed illusion, keeps you watching and guessing if ultimately it's a bit disappointing. None of the characters really develops, nothing of any substance really happens, and none of the heist twist stand up to any scrutiny, but in a year full of truly atrocious movies, it's relatively decent.ds on the mirror).<br /><br />This is all part of the fun but by the time act three rolls around, the film doesn't even pretend to be about illusion and mind-games anymore - it quickly descends into impossible CG shots and absurd set pieces that are fun but betray the original premise completely.

B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|EVERVILLE: THE FIRST PILLAR is an entertaining science fiction fantasy epic about a young college freshman, Owen, whose life is changed forever after an unexpected experience, which begins his journey into the titular Everville, and, his encounter with the first pillar. This is a book which, while events occur at rapid speed, the plot is never out of control, and sustains its momentum to the very end.<br /><br />It contains many fantastical elements, and is a book where spectacle is the main attraction, but, events are always seen through the eyes of the protagonist. While the ending ties up the loose ends of the story very well, there are sufficient plot possibilities open for further instalments in the series. Well done.
B00CFA227C|4.0|Lots of action, good special effects, interesting play on a classic children's story.  Teens, adults and seniors will enjoy seeing ths movie.
B001DCQJ4A|5.0|Gardiner's readings are not for everyone, but I just love his Brahms symphony cycle more than any I've ever heard, live or recorded.  The outstanding ORR plays with extraordinary fire and polish as usual, and make this repertoire sound so fresh and vital.<br /><br />What is specifically excellent about Gardiner's work here, for me, are two things: his ability to always clearly highlight Brahms' development of material without pedantically overbalancing such elements in the overall texture, and his extremely deft and organic management of transitions.  Those two things make the music make real sense while maintaining a stellar sense of pacing and affect.<br /><br />Definitely a must-own for any fan of Brahms' symphonies.
0525478817|1.0|Over all this was a great book. Unfortunately I stopped reading it when the language was enough,at least 3 on a page, and it talked about very strong relationships,if you know what I mean. 5 stars if this ridiculousness was gone. :(
B00A285OOW|5.0|As with all of MS. Gregory's books, you will be entertained with drama and wonderful story telling while learning a piece of history. This story is well written, and it scoops you in from the beginning. I'm a fan, and this book lives up to her standards.

B000XUBC5E|4.0|This book was awesome, page turner, really enjoyed it and read it very quickly, would recommend it to everyone to read.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I chose to ignore the reviews of hatred and listen to the album for myself. Of course, since Jimmy's death in 2009 there's no more crazy drum fills, also being they're no longer touring with Mikey Portney. I've been a fan since \\"Sound of the Seventh Trumpet.\\" Sure, it's a big turn around from their other albums, especially the recent \\"Nightmare,\\" but as a fan of the band it's our job to keep an open mind to love and support these guys.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I liked this product but it didn't help my kindle fire problem. Luckily, I can use the cord for other things and customer service paid for it, so it wasn't a waste of money.
1439153663|1.0|Another book club book! Awful book, poorly written, ridiculous characters, stupid plot, could not bring myself to finish. The writing is one thing - but who was the editor? Why was this book excepted by the publisher in the first place?

B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This was an entertaining and beautiful movie to watch. We get to see Kal-El's home world unlike any other movie has shown with some tweaks on characters that added more depths to the characters then this is a bad guy and this one is a good guy. I mean the villain has a good reason for being bad, but he just gets twisted at the end. It does a decent job of presenting a story about Kal-El trying to find his way on our planet and how having all these powers can prove to be hard to hide since he seems to find people to save or walk away from to avoid hurting others. The only thing I found a little lacking were the scenes with Lois, her boss Perry, Jimmy Olsen wasn't present in this movie but is mentioned I believe, there wasn't enough story with them it's like there were just there to help the story a bit. When the fighting starts its pretty much the rest of the movie but its nice to see that he's given a challenge, unlike other movies the issue is how to fight a being with godlike powers and is near invincible. The ending wasn't a totally shocker but you see it coming once its set up. And no matter what you say Superman has done it on a very small never of times with no other options available. Christopher Reeves character did it while smiling lol. It'll be interesting to see the sequel with Affleck as the new Batman and how these two confront each other and conform to be a team. It's a great movie I wasn't goin to reveal much if anything if you are one of the few you hasn't seen it yet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like puzzle games this is for you.  The game is called The Room, but it's not about the room it's about a puzzle box. It is extremely clever and challenging but not impossible by any means.  The length of the game is a bone of contention among some of the lower rated reviews. However do not let that deter you. This is an awesome game and was the right length for me!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book! Quick reading for someone who does not read a lot. To me it was a playful love story.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|it was fun &amp; addictive when I first played it but I finished within 2 days of playing off &amp; on.  played again &amp; while it was fun just repetitive no new quest!  i liked it but don't think I would pay 1.99 again!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit picking this up on a whim.  I'm glad I did. The story was extraordinarily entertaining and I found the characters came alive as I read on.  In fact the entire silo did.  I look forward to reading more of the author's books and hopefully that will include more of the Silo Saga.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game with beautiful graphics and compelling sound effects. My only complaint is that it's too short!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It's cute. It's addictive. I'm actually a little tired of the music, though, despite it's supposedly soothing quality. But what bugs the heck out of me is that the farther you go, the more nothing much happens without pearls. And there is virtually no way to \\"earn\\" pearls, you have to spend real $$$ to buy them. And that is so not okay for me in a game supposedly designed for kids. Shame on you Disney.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! Quick reading. You won't want to put it down. Very enjoyable and light to read. Recommend.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|So much happens in this book. When it came to Clary and Jace there was a rollercoaster of emotions. Their final conversation broke my heart. As a reader I always put myself into the book, and in this one I kept looking away, shaking my head, and yelling NO in my head.<br /><br />The secondary characters have a life of their own too. Everyone has their own interesting quirks and you tend to easily follow along with the jumps in the storyline between characters. Though Clary and Jace are definitely my favorite couple, but the ending kind of left me hating him.<br /><br />Onto book three!
B0034DGPEU|1.0|Ridiculous &#34;book&#34;. Just ridiculous. Such an ad nauseum, minute-by-minute account of the poorly developed characters' minutes/hours/days that I am still shocked by all of the positive reviews.<br /><br />The book's telling of how a family dealt with the mental illness of one of the characters alone was enough to make the reader throw this in the garbage. Here is a synopsis of the mentally ill woman's entire life; she got worse. She got better. She got somewhat worse. She got a little better. She got a lot better. She got a lot worse. Oops, I think that was a plot spoiler.
141694737X|5.0|Our baby (11 months) loves this book. She loves to flip up the page to reveal the animal within. The flaps are designed so that they all don't open in the same way, some open up, others open down, sideways etc. My daughter is at an age where she likes anything interactive and this book always puts a smile on her face.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I was a bit hesitant to buy this app since it was a little bit more expensive than most of the other calendar apps I considered, but I'm really glad I went with this one! I really hated the calendar app that came on my Kindle--it never synced. I really like how CalenGoo looks--weekly view and daily view are my favorites views. It's easy to add and edit events, and it's easy to distinguish my different calendars. My Google calendar on my PC syncs wonderfully to this Kindle app. However, I do have one little problem--CalenGood (on my Kindle) doesn't always sync to my PC in a timely manner (so, when I add an event on my Kindle, it will sometimes take several days before it shows up on my Google calendar I access on my PC, even through I've synced it on my Kindle)--but, this is only sometimes. Even though it has this little issue, I still really like this app, and in reading other reviews, it looks like not everyone has these same occasional syncing issues.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great graphics, easy to play and great past time.  Recommend this game for everyone who likes a challenge.<br />Easy for younger children and lots better to than those blood and Gore games.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I've wanted to read this series for a while now, but never got around to it. When the movie came out I HAD to read the book first. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but thirty minutes after I finished it I went to the theater and saw it...and the movie was better. It showed things you only assumed in the book, and it altered some things to the point that when I started book 2 I couldn't remember if I read it or saw it, when it came to previous details. For that reason I suggest to everyone not to go see the movie after only reading one book.<br /><br />Besides that, I loved Clary and Jace. Their interactions were amusing at times and frustrating at others. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Liked it. Immediately applicable advice. Good for anyone, anywhere, anytime. Where else can you find that? Get outside yourself and do something for someone or something else.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have used this every night since I purchased it. I love the many options and the sleep timer. I have also had some amazing dreams since using this. Highly recommend.
1401937519|5.0|There are many books out these days on the dying and heaven experience as well as proof of past lives.  This book is one of the best for it describes in detail Anita's experience of dying when her condition was as terminal as you can get.  Yet, she was sent back to tell her story and completely healed within weeks.  I recommend this book to anyone searching for answers or just more info on the subject.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook app. its a perfect way to interact with friends family and buisness:). I recemend this app. I would rate it 900000000000000 stars
B001NLL93W|5.0|I honestly think that if this had been the final book I would have been content.<br /><br />The connection between all the characters in this book was amazing. Everyone was included: the Nephilim, the Vampires, the Werewolves, the Fairies, and the Warlocks.<br /><br />I moped through book two, just to get to the greatness book three held. There was never a dull moment. The pages alternated between the perfect mix of action and emotional.<br /><br />Favorite couple besides the obvious Clary and Jace would have to be Magnus and Alec. Even though he is completely ostentatious, I love Magnus!
B00933JF74|5.0|Love this game.  Generally I'm not very good at games, but this one was fairly easy to learn and since I've had hours and hours of enjoyment.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I have always liked Timbuk2 products and was pleased with the quality and practicality of this Kindle sleeve. It is well constructed and a snug fit for my kindle device. It doesn't take up much room and slips easily into the backpack I use to commute. I would recommend this product.

B00DOPEGAS|4.0|I have done bracelets and guidanced for my 8 years old daughter after making 1,2 times as failures.<br />Actually, it is simple and easy, but the toy designer was lacking a few essential guidelines, or even misspelled in a guide, however, If you look the picture you can find the way to do. It is important at the finish, the designers did not have the right guidance and I have to deduce myself. if done as directed, the bracelet will come apart at the end of the last section.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fun toy and my daughter loves it, I do so ..
0316223239|5.0|I didn't like the book in the first few pages but I soon was involved in this heart-wrenching story. Read it. It is a story of the power of love.
B00005JKDR|5.0|One of the best movies for kids and adults. Very entertaining and it played well. I would buy through here again.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is wonderful and awe inspiring. What an incredible true story. It is well written and the ending is very emotional
0765325950|4.0|The last battle. Fourteen adventure-fantasy books the length of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" with the complexity of the finest chess match, and it is finally time.<br /><br />Thanks to the imagination of Robert Jordan, we've befriended life-like characters, whitnessed majestic world-building, chosen our ajah, trained as warders, and fought the shadow. Brandon Sanderson did a credible job finishing this series with such big shoes to fill.<br /><br />Without grounding in the Wheel of Time mythos, a reader will be beyond frustrated with this long narrative. Even the WOT fan of many years should \\"study\\" for this final installment, reviewing Min's omens, the Prophecies of the Dragon, and where each major/minor character was left at the end of the previous book (and his/her skill level).<br /><br />Tarmon Gai'don will be fought on four battlefronts for most of the book, so prepare for drawn-out military planning sessions and fight sequences. There are many pieces that must fall into place for our Two River's ta'veren to succeed; some are easily predictable, while others fall under \\"didn't see that coming.\\" Unlike prior books, the focus here is less on the magic of the Aes Sedai and more on relationships, allegiances, and the battles.<br /><br />I am well-pleased with how many loose ends were wrapped up by this finale. I'm sure I will think of questions left to answer, but the big ones have been dealt with much better than most series ever manage to accomplish.<br /><br />There were events in the novel that I did not find well-written or that depended on foreshadowing from text in prior WOT works. Rand's personal battle with the Dark One is fragmented and inconsistently-paced. Too much of the scenes lacked emotion; Sanderson wrote specific scenes seemingly for characters to reflect on how difficult the last battle was, instead of working in emotions into all the pages. Without giving anything away, the ending was surprising and annoying. If you aren't up on all of your WOT -- if it isn't fresh in your mind -- you'll be wondering what happened and how for quite a while. Along the way, Mat is visited by old enemies, so make sure you aren't having a \\"duh\\" moment towards the end from his trials.<br /><br />Yes, we lose some good friends. That's war. The Wheel turns.<br /><br />I look forward to the chance to reread all fourteen WOT books back-to-back without having to wait on new releases for the finale!<br /><br />Friendly suggestion: buy a boatload of caffeine before reading. This mammoth is exhausting! 912 intense pages is 43 hours on audio!<br /><br />The first book in this series was:<br />[[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]]<br /><br />Prequel to the WOT series:<br />[[ASIN:0765345455 New Spring: The Novel (Wheel of Time)]]<br /><br />You might also enjoy reading:<br /><br />[[ASIN:044101268X Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)]]<br />By Jim Butcher<br /><br />[[ASIN:0886775507 The Ghattis Tale, Book 1: Finders-Seekers]]<br />By Gayle Greenot isn't fresh in your mind -- you'll be wondering what happened and how for quite a while.

055358202X|3.0|A lot of loose ends for the final book of the series. Developing new characters in the last book? Really?
B004H8GLXQ|2.0|Sorry to say I really disliked this book.  I believe there is a difference between a truly gothic novel and a novel that poses as gothic by describing everything as darkly as possible.  This tale is just a depressing tribute to bad weather, irrational thinking, and dysfunction.  Although there's hardly any humor in the story, at one point our heroine, if we can call her that, runs out in the freezing rain, onto the moors, where she literally, physically stumbles into her friend from another town a train ride away, who just happens to be standing out there, and he takes her to his car and feeds her chicken sandwiches and warm tea, which he just happens to have with him because he likes to cook.  Seriously?  I don't think it was supposed to be funny, but the doctor who sees to her after this incident sort of makes fun of her and cracks wise.  I just wanted to slap the self indulgence right out of her.  No, just no.  It didn't work for me at all.

B002UBRFDC|5.0|Excellent book giving the reader insight into the Japanese ways of life. Taking you through the transformation of a westerner and his struggles in a foreign land and culture. Don't be put off by the length of the book, once you start you will find it. Hard to put down.

B000KJT8IG|5.0|What can be said about this film that has not already been written. We watch this movie every Christmas just like &#34;Plane Trains and Autos&#34; during Thanksgiving. My 13 year old son absolutely loves this film.
0380807343|4.0|If you are a fan of Neil Gaiman you will like this story.  It is very short and quickly read.  It is written in his manner with several sketches included with the story.  Makae sure as you read this that you don't open that secret door, and if you do run as fast as you can back to your parents!  Good scary story.

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I like the style of this book, the characters are rich and interesting.  I think he is clever the way he connects people over generations.  A good story.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Amazon streaming was great. Picture quality was excellent despite the age of the movie. &#34;Here is looking at you, Kid&#34;
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game.  Just wish that you could move ahead a little bit faster. It gets kind of boring when it takes so long to win the next level.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|I can't believe I bought this piece of crap! It has no practical application! I wouldn't buy software that requires this unless you have money to waste! The damn thing doesn't work, uses up power and memory and won't even let me use the software I bought it for!
B007HO392S|4.0|Getting used to all the songs is new, but the ones I love - I love. It arrived very quickly and in good condition.
1433524708|5.0|Excellent!!!! Fast delivery. I love the ESV translation it gives me the closest to the original. Maps and the blue prints are great.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I was having an itch to put this movie into my collection. I almost always buy my movies on here used and this movie came to me in great condition all the way around I LOVE IT!
0142001104|3.0|The &#34;practices&#34; in this book are great and can be applied to so many aspects of your life.  I read this book as part of a course on Leadership and really enjoyed the discussions we had as a class on the different ways we interpreted and have applied the practices to our own lives.<br /><br />However, actually reading the book was difficult.  I think it was just a personal preference, but I had a very hard time relating to either author.  The husband is a music conductor (I'm not musical, and everything he wrote about related to that) and the wife seemed to have lived a very privileged life.  If you are a musical person (especially classical) you will love the examples and stories that the husband has to tell.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This has to be the best headphones made by Sony. I bought them for composing my music, and they are superb! I used to use iPhone head phones, which are nothing in comparison to the quality and clarity of these headphones! I could hear things I was unable to with these and it also blocked outside noise. The only downfall is the warranty that came with doesn't cover theft and they aren't that well insulated. I wish I could get these again!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I can't get the game on my Kindle so I have no use for this product. I'll have to be removing it.

B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|A great little rhyming story that uses mystery to encourage children to use their imagination. Filed with lovely illustrations, Over The fence is a delightful story for bedtime.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Good movie.  A lot of action.  A lot of testosterone.  Better than the first.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Fun to be able to use this on my Kindle. Didn't know that was part of the package but am very happy.

B000SEJHRA|5.0|This is the second Sedaris book I've read and I will definitely read more. He is so funny I find myself laughing aloud often while reading. He may not be for everyone but he sure tickles my funny bone.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good Tom Cruise movie.  Nice plot twist at the end.  I stayed with it all the way through.  Worth watching twice.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have been unable to view this DVD though it arrived quickly and in good condition. I look forward to watching it when I get the time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan's &#34;Zealot&#34; reminds me of John Dominic Crossan's &#34;Who Killed Jesus.&#34; Aslan goes further than the Historical Jesus scholars presenting us with an historical look at 1st Century Palestine and what Jesus the man was likely all about. He separates the Jesus of history from the Christ of Christian theology. Even for a liberal, scholarly Christian like me, it stretches me but I find meaning in the stretching of my faith and belief system.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book would only be tittilating to very young and/or very inexperienced people. I found the heroine insipid and the &#34;hero&#34; totally unbelievable. I didn't realize it was nothing more than a modern day romance novel. Ordered the second book in the hopes that I would find something that was worthy of all the buzz but to no avail. Don't waste your money. If you want erotica, there's a lot better selection out there.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Joe Nesbo has done it again.  His classic writing style continues in the intriguing novel that has a twist at the end that you would never expect.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is a GREAT CD and it arrived quickly and in GREAT condition. Love the memories it brings up! Thank You.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|The book was really confusing but the movie sort  of explained the whole plot<br />much clearer. Did not expect to enjoy the movie as much as I did
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the bomb. I love it. I checked out several before I downloaded this one. Screen and numbers are big. It does all the basics. Easy to use. What more does one need?
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is awesome. But you only have so much time in each world to do stuff and then your done. Buy the full version right away, don't wast your time with this.
B00846REIS|4.0|Haven't had a chance to read as I have so many books on my Kindle. They should be a &#34;delay&#34; process when it comes to books, so you can review them when you've read them. Then it doesn't look like you don't care.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a story of a villain who dreams of being a good guy, but he is only a program in a video game arcade.  One day he decides to leave his game to win a medal in a different game and winds up in a third game.  In the third game, Sugar Rush, he winds up encountering a whole new set of challenges to re-win his medal and perhaps his good/bad guy status.<br /><br />Throughout the bulk of the film, lighthearted humor is present.  While there are a number of conflicts the characters must work through, it is interesting and entertaining to see how they work out and through in video game land.<br /><br />Definitely a fun film.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|the Wife rented this and I made my departure 10 minutes in.<br />She later said, &#34;I don't know why everyone at the office thought that was a good movie.  It wasn't.&#34;  So there ya go....
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|Pretty much fun for a while but then you figure it out and the fun ends at level 30. Either needs more levels or some other mode. Also requiring a connection gets two stars taken away
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Looking forward to watching this. I love these kinds of movies and all I need to do now is find the time to watch it.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|This film is about the zombie outbreak.  It primarily follows one man as he fights his way back to what is left of civilization while trying to find his family after trying to do a rescue mission for the government.<br /><br />For those looking for something anywhere close to the book, stop and re-read the book.  Do not watch this.<br /><br />For those looking for an enjoyable zombie movie with high quality special effects, this film is quite effective.<br /><br />As mentioned the special effects are quality which, as those familiar with the zombie genre know, isn't always the case.  The scenery is varied and relatively appropriate to named location.<br /><br />The plot line for the film is fairly effective and action packed, though somewhat formulaic.<br /><br />Overall, a fun ride.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This was a gift for my son who requested it.  I had seen it myself and loved the action.  Great movie.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I really enjoy these puzzle games but I get pretty frustrated when you do what you are supposed to over and over nothing works. I looked up the solution on line to find I was right finally worked a few times later.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love that you can play for a long time without having to pay<br />need more games like this great game
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I would like to honestly evaluate this product but it did not download.  Therefore, I can only guess that it is ok.  Too bad, I was looking forward to using it.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|The Snowman was my first Harry Hole experience and my review said I was hooked. So, naturally, I had to go back and read the first one. One can certainly see how Jo Nesbo's writing style changed between The Bat and The Snowman. The Snowman is much tighter: keeps the reader's attention because it is focused on the plot. The Bat tends to wander into areas whose relevance is not easy to see. I wonder why Nesbo chose to put Harry Hole into Australia for his first investigation: especially in a book written for Norwegian speakers (who are mostly in Norway!)? Perhaps this is why he found it necessary to explain so much about aboriginal culture (one of the 'wanders' mentioned above). Also it seems a bit odd that the villain chooses to hide out in the place he does (I don't want to give the plot away). Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan, because I've read The Snowman and know plot and narrative will get better.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love this CD. Don't need any of the others but I couldn't resist this one. It is beautiful. Thank You.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Almost all of these movies are quality movies. Star Trek: The Motion Picture and The Final Frontier are both horrible. But the other Four are really fun to watch.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book made me very upset, l was angry with the protagonist for making excuses for herself.  I was upset because she glorified the prison population and system.  At the end I was upset because the book was honest and this is a hard journey to take.  By the end I was emotionally exhausted and happy to be free with her.  I felt that I had taken her journey with her.  Amazing book.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I am not very happy that the case had a hold drilled in it, but it did not effect the condition of the CD and the entire CD was worth the purchase.

0062255657|5.0|Don't read this for the story but for the writing.  Gaiman puts an invigorating view into everything in this book.  After quitting the last three books I started, a quarter through, \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" grabbed me on the first page, and through to the end.  There are a few weak spots, and the ending is a bit flat, but the story builds so well and is filled with so many surprises that you never get bored.  The story starts calmly with a man's visit to his childhood home.  This could have become a study of his growing up (but it's not). Gaiman's writing instantly sucks you in.  I would have been happy to read his chronicle of childhood and the ordinary things that might have occurred.  But this story quickly becomes a fanciful, almost childlike, adventure into many supernatural events.  At times I compared it with \\"Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe\\" but it goes much deeper than that.  There is good and evil, but also a deep look in the time continuum and parallel universes.  The lines between life and death become indistinct and even the ones with the power are helpless at times.  This is the first Gaiman book I have read, and just ordered two more.  You can't read just one.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Not a charming, memorable musical like Tangled or Little Memaid, but hey -- this was for the boys.  They like it.

B0018OFN4U|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie in the history of horror movies and way over-hyped by those that want this movie to continue making money. This movie is so 1989.  I give it the worst movie ever award for NOT being funny at all.  A movie for true die hard MO-RONS! Save your money folks until it's free on PBS.
B007WOFXAO|4.0|America was a prominent folk-rock band in the early 1970s and this compilation contains the band's first five albums, which collectively comprise America's best work.<br /><br />The remastering on this compilation is pretty good; the sound is decent. I put on one of my old 1970s vinyl LPs of one of the albums in this compilation to compare the sound quality with the CD. The vinyl LP sounded better.<br /><br />But despite that, this is a cost effective and worthwhile way to buy the best five America albums from the early 1970s on CD.
B000007T2Z|5.0|This is one of those albums that are landmarks in the indie scene. It's a heavily depressing album with many meandering tracks and little singing, but the tunes are as powerful as a brick to the face.<br />Try this while driving on dark, unfamiliar roads.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|good lenth, price ok,wish you good get a discount when you buy 2 or more, something like that.i only like to use products that go with the Item i bought ,Igot these to go with my Kindle Fire,Grandkids lost theirs.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My nefew told my son to download the game and its his favorite game now. Everyone should get this game people who said that it is a bad game they are crazy. Everyone should get this game I repeat everyone should get this game.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|After much delayed and inaccurate info, as well as forced closes, I decided to uninstall the app and find an older version.  I found version 3.8.0 at androiddrawer.com.  It is a much better version than the one offered by Amazon.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|It worked for me; don't see why it can't work for you. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|It was fun but I lost interest I'm going to get it again I never got to surf on a piece of debris on the pictures that is the only reason why I'm getting it again.I really hated his corny voice that's not the voice of the Spider-Man I know
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Best 3d effect experience so far.  Dolphins come straight at you making you want to duck.<br />Ocean Wonderland is a good demo show for a viewing party.
1490313370|5.0|If you're trapped working for people who don't appreciate you, if you're stuck in some corporate sweatshop, if you want to just say &#34;To hell with it; I'll be my own boss&#34;....well what are you waiting for?  Get this book.<br /><br />I'm probably halfway along the path of enlightenment that Altucher wants to lead you down, but I've got a few years to catch up.  I wish I'd discovered his stuff a long time ago.  It is secular, it is sensible, and it is honest.<br /><br />If you're broke, go read his blog instead...and then buy the book for your friends down the road.  That's what I did.<br /><br />My only real knock on the book is its celebration of Tucker Max, who, in this reviewer's opinion, doesn't merit the mention.<br /><br />Otherwise, spot on.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|It worked for me; don't see why it can't work for you. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book especially how they put all the characters from the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, I think the book was amazing!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book . . . it was the kind of book that I stayed up reading until my eyes were too tired to read any more.  I couldn't wait to find out the ending, but at the same time didn't want it to end because it was that good.  I love the way that the author interweaves the stories of the three main characters.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially now that I see it's down to $6.50 (I paid $9.99 just a couple of days ago, but oh well, it was worth it!)
B002SHD9E2|3.0|For the time it was done, it was pretty good.  Better then the black and white ver.  Also better then the one done in the 70s.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|It worked for me; don't see why it can't work for you. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I downloaded this as a free app of the day on Amazon. I've been very impressed with its many features, some only available in desktop software. My only wish is that a better diary option was available I also think that many of the page designs are a little childish.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I started playing this one night at 8:00, It was after midnight and I couldn't stop playing! It's a lot of fun and gives you different things to do so it keeps you interested. I guess my only complaint was on 1screen I couldn't really see and figure out what a couple of the objects in the picture were ans so I couldn't get past that part. There's no help or explanation provided so I spent a lot of time just trying everything I could think of.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|I injoyed the adventure, but the begining idea was about lost.  The stories got seperated too much, Love the ending.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I can't say anything about the movie that anybody else hasn't already said. As for the amazon release, eh, it was pretty good. Some fuzzy scenes here and there, but it was unedited and full length and that's what counts.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|i like the movie itself but it did not come packaged as show in the picture. under the title 10,000 bc there is 10,000 be written in another language in french i believe. this also occurs on the side of the blu ray overall making the copy look cheap. it would be nice to receive what is seen in the actual photo.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I feel like I'm really in a Bingo hall, except no leaving your house, no fighting crowds for a table spot and no taping cards down!  Would be great for the entire family if it weren't for the occasional idiot with their Facebook rants (which I admit can be quite entertaining for adults).  I don't know if there is an option to turn Facebook off, but there really should be.  I for one don't use it to get free gifts...just try to get them by playing the good old fashion way called EARNING THEM!  If there is an option, but I'm just not aware of it...my apologies to Bingo Blitz...then my rating would be FIVE STARS.<br /><br />Even after all that said...I would truly recommend this.
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|My 10 year old loves this cd. I had trouble finding it in stores and was delighted to discover it here.

B007V65R54|2.0|The subject is interesting and that is why I bought the book. I also read a positive review.<br />If you know nothing about predictions and are interested  in US politics, US sport, US economics and Poker it is probably ok,<br />I found the book somewhat boring ...
B009KCUX3S|5.0|I found this book very interesting. I new way to learn programming, it really made me laugh. The good this is that it is helping me learn Java faster than I thought.
B002IJQ3EI|1.0|Shipped me a regular black vinyl instead of a picture disc. Pretty much just a waste of time. Always double check with shipper beforehand.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|It was just too, too, long. Do SOMETHING else than be useless and run around, already! Gosh, it gets so boring!
B00B9366VO|5.0|I want to watch it again and again and again. The magic is in the music! Dave Grohl is absolutely amazing!
0385737955|4.0|This book was a good read.  I would recommend it to others.  It kept your attention and was interesting.  Some of the slang was a little weird.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A compelling story that has some surprising twists.  We may be on a parallel path to save our own society.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am so glad I found this app. I have insomnia it is hard getting to sleep. Now that I listen to the ocean I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep.
B0015442YU|2.0|Does not compare with the original story &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;<br />Nothing left to the imagination. when it comes to gross scenes.
0385738781|4.0|This was a good book and I thought it was worth the read.  I would recommend to others to read it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I liked the very dry humor ! Fantastic imaginative low key book.Recommended for older people who like traveling and life
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun to play, my 5 year old really likes to play this game. She said it is fun. Great to pass time with
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|It works great on my old nexus 7.  it was nice to waste a bit of time.  a lot of repetition press the button so probably not for long term playing.  but it was fun nonetheless.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My daughter made me watch the first few episodes and I fell in love with this show.  Have a hard time waiting for next season.  This is one I can watch over and over.  Love it!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love  how you get to play with people all over but it sucks you can only play so much until. You either pay real money or wait.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I found this game both relaxing and exciting at the same time.  It seems to be a mindless game especially when I don't want to think to hard about anything and at the same time exciting when the coins and prizes drops.
B000J2DAYM|3.0|I watched this film to prepare for a Meetup group discussion.  The film seemed to me to be a spoof of film noire of the 1940's with teenagers in the roles of suspicious characters and detectives.  I had trouble hearing the dialogue from my computer, but much of the dialogue is slang from the film noire era, so I had trouble understanding it anyway.  I would recommend &#34;Brick&#34; to film buffs who enjoy exploring independent art house films and unusual genres.  It is not for everyone,
B0072OFM28|5.0|I have to say I loved this season.  I wasn't so sure of the first season, what with the cheesy CGI and ultra-bloody, slo-mo violence, but the style of this show grows on you and after a while it seems normal and really does seem to take you away to ancient Rome.  I was leery of this season because of the new actor hired to replace Andy Whitfield - I didn't want to have to get to know a new Spartacus as the heart of the show.  While Liam McIntyre doesn't have the same quiet menace of Andy Whitfield as Spartacus, he does resemble him, and just gets better and better in every episode.  I really enjoyed seeing old villains pop up and the return of old characters in new situations.  Vengeance has a good mix of old and new characters and seems to have more coherent writing than previous seasons.  The character development is much better in this season and by the end, I didn't want to say goodbye until the next year.  I haven't watched the special features of the DVD yet.  I'm keeping them for a rainy Friday night in case the new Starz programming that replaces Spartacus' time slot isn't up to snuff.
B00006JU7T|5.0|I remember seeing this movie for the first time on TV when it was new. I liked it because it reminded me of when my uncle first became a cop in New York City. I really liked the story as I'm sure Al Pacino made the story more lively than it originally was. A great movie to see to remind you of how it was to be a cop back when times were really tough.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|The only thing is finding your pics for your own art gallery. It takes a while. Great game and for art fans
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love to entertain the theory your screw ups actually saved you from something much worse.  I felt like a little bit of me was in every single character.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I'm not a Twilight fan so I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie at all. I don't mind the Twilight movies, but can't stand the books. I do have to say I enjoyed this movie and the book isn't bad either. Funny, because this was written before Twilight and you would think books after would be better and not the other way around.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit slow and it does take a bit to get into the characters and what is happening. However, you don't have a self absorbed teen in this storyline, which was a welcome change.
B00447L4KA|1.0|Severely disappointed not because I hate the movie, I love this movie. I ordered three DVDS from amazon and this one out of three had no audio. I've played numerous dvd's on my player and all work except for this one. Im so sad to say I'll be sending this back. I don't understand why the quality had to be sacrificed? Honestly, no audio? Thats a joke. Next time, quality check the dvd's, it would honestly save time for everyone.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|It turns out that this is one of the few directors I absolutely hate. The same guy that made the monsterously awful &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34;. When I started watching I thought to myself &#34;what's with all the needless semi dissolves, quick cuts, wipes and fades all dumped into the first few minutes?&#34; So I had this creepy feeling it was the same style as Moulin Rouge, and looked it up.<br /><br />None other than the same hack. Just a mish mash of shots thrown in for no real reason. It was like he handed the reins to some person that likes gimmicky shots and said &#34;have at it&#34;. Cheesy shots with cheesy animation and effects ruin the chance to suspend reality.<br /><br />It calms down after the open, but the endless blue screens are obvious and stand out from the location shots. DiCaprio is turned into a cross between Jack Black in King Kong and  Rudee Vallee. If I have to hear &#34;old sport&#34; one more time I'll gag. Toby McGuire is replaying Spider Man without the suit as he narrates everything. Dressed like PeeWee Herman McGuire has that stupid wide eyed look as if he just saw a naked woman for the first time.<br /><br />No. As you can guess, it was millions of miles from he Robert Redford version, which I always loved. This is a comic book version, with comic book colors and all the artistic beauty of a crayon colored poster with magic marker highlights. It was shot or processed in 3D because they knew it needed something to make people see it.<br /><br />Pass on renting this, it should be on Netflix soon where it will be less painful to your pocket. Friends don't let friends watch bad remakes of great classics. Just say &#34;no&#34; to this director and his massacre of something he won't understand, a movie that does not need gimmicks or a load of fakey doo blue screens.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Beware, this game is addicting.  I allowed my sister in law to play this game on the Ipad and she wouldn't quit so I installed it on my Kindle and now I can play.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It isn't my favorite, but I can watch it a few times again as my girls love this movie. There are somethings that are cheesy, but I think those are the things my girls love. Kids! Anyway, it is an interesting looking into how the Wizard of OZ come to be and why he isn't all Dorthory or anyone later thought him to be.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love this game, I am almost 80 yrs. old and ONLY enjoyment I have to play besides other Hidden Object Games I love to play. Is it possible to obtain a help guide to get me pass some levels of Candy Crush. Please let me no as I will be interested. ty
B004EF4J40|5.0|Loved this 4-part series.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is simply spectacular in the role of Margaret as is Arbitrage as Thornton.  I'm surprised I haven't seen more of Denby-Ashe and certainly hope I do in future English TV or movies.  There's a quality in English video, TV and theater that I think is missing here in U.S. productions.  I wish there were 4 or more parts to this series.  I'm going to miss the characters although I enjoyed the happy ending very much.  Kudos too to Brendon Coyle -- he did a great job in his role as did Sinead Cusack as Thornton's bristly mother.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had lost my previous cable for my kindle and I was very pleased to see that this one is in great condition. On top of that, they were willing to ship it to South Korea, which help me a lot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Incredible. Except I'll b laying on my death bed saying, &quot;Why?! Why did I spend all those prime years playing that infernal room?&quot;
B00920HMNM|5.0|This is a gift so I have left the plastic seal, but it looks perfect. It also arrived waaaay earlier than estimated (nearly a month earlier), which is fantastic because it's for father's day this Sunday!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love it. I play it before bed to clear my mind. I also like that it's very challenging the higher up in tiles you go.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Her voice is so seductive. The songs are very well arranged. You will not be disappointed. I downloaded it & listened to it right away & did not skip any songs. A glass of wine & this cd get you thru some house chores or can be a precursor to mellow evening. Enjoy!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is an incredible story about accepting people for who they are on the inside and not the outside
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This novel is truly a tour de force. The story, the writing, the structure, all pull the reader in to this spinning world.  I found it hard to put down and images from the book keep popping into my head.  I came to this book from seeing Colum McCallum on the Charlie Rose show.  I'm so glad I saw that show!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I had no problem viewing these.  Streamed just fine, would purchase again and actually I did and no problem there either.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works exactly as described.  Good for determining the best location for your router.  Also good in a multiple network environment to accurately identify frequencies and best choices.  Easy download and free.  Recommended.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|District 9 is a semi-expansion of Blomkamp’s short “Alive in Joburg.” Like that short, “District 9” is very clearly a meditation of sorts on South Africa’s apartheid. Based somewhat on the real life District 6 in Cape Town, District 9 is the seemingly unending ghetto of aliens that have been forced into appalling conditions with no end of misery in sight.<br /><br />It's something George Orwell, or H.G. Wells, might have written in their heyday. Certainly the screenwriters lose a little focus towards the very end of the picture, where this quasi-pseudo- documentary cam political allegory morphs into a Michael Bay type clone, but mostly this is smart, evocative filmmaking that manages to put real human emotion up on the screen alongside humor, imagination, action/adventure, social commentary, attention to detail, and amazing special effects, all in deftly managed amounts.<br /><br />A note on special effects, the prawns are so well integrated into the piece that it's hard to tell--or even notice--that they're computer generated, not a man in a shrimp suit. And speaking of a man in a suit, Copley is no less than amazing in his formative feature-length role, a bumbling Borat, Dutch- style by way of John Connor.<br /><br />District 9 does have its flaws, it can be a bit obvious and heavy handed, but it’s also a visually spectacular science fiction film that cares about its characters, and that’s something that can be overlooked in these type of films today.
B009AMAJVO|2.0|I watched this movie thinking it was going to be a smart action thriller.  This was not the case, but even still, I was hoping it was at least interesting to watch.<br /><br />The set up was good.  Terrance Howard is a leader of an Albanian gang whose gang is losing its member one by one.  He gets puzzles and riddles from the assassin.  Dominic Cooper and Colin Farrell are part of the gang members and they are helping to try to find the culprit.  Unfortunately that just the beginning, but then the movie has a subplot which puts the movie in a dead stop.  Colin Farrell meets a car accident victim (Naomi Rapice)and she has a proposition for him.  Twist and Turns do occur and then some romance as well.  Towards the middle, nothing interesting happens at all.  It's not the romance that I didn't like, it just was a snoozefest.  I actually was beginning to fall asleep, which would be a first for me.<br /><br />The movie had too many deposition and not enough fast-paced scenes.  The trailer shows a lot of action scenes, but most of it is towards the end.  There's a major action sequence in the end, but to be honest, it actually felt out of place.  I just didn't care by that point.<br /><br />This movie was not for me.  Too slow, needed editing, and fall flat even with the last action scenes.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|As the title says, I really like the chromecast.<br /><br />I have heard some people have had troubles with setup,<br /> I didn't have any problems using my  S4 phone, and it works with  my nexus 7 tablet also.<br /><br /> It did take me a little googling to find out how it works with a wired computer.<br /><br />I've heard about people having the screen go black while playing, so far it has been fine for me.  .<br /><br />The only thing that it really needs are more apps.<br /> I have a roku ( a really old one) and got this as a backup as the roku box is<br />getting, shall we say past it's prime.  As I mainly watch netflix I put the roku away.<br /> I do hope apps come quickly as for me that is the biggest disadvantage to the chromecast.<br />With more apps this would be a 5 star for me.
B000PMG16U|5.0|You have to hate babies, Jesus and America to not like Star Wars... even if you don't like it, just keep it to yourself.  It's Star Wars.  It's what makes America great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the intensity and connection between the characters. Will definitely be finishing the series in record time for me. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|No surprises here.  It has daily workouts, that you can even customize.  There is also an option to purchase updates if you need them, but I'm happy with the version I got as FAOTD so I'll leave it alone for now.
B008MM9630|4.0|A fun game that is not dependent on neighbors to get things done. It is a fun way to pass the time.

B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Great blending  of a big group to make excellent music.  Would have like the band to have added some  really uptempo songs on the cd.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Good if it's free, but I don't know if I'd recommend paying for it.  It was fun but I lost interest and removed it fairly quickly.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is the book they would write. It was so simple, yet profound. One of the best books I've read in awhile.

0810996596|3.0|Kirk Hammett is the lead guitarist for Metallica who has put together a remarkable collection of monster-movie memorabilia (much of it has not been seen by a wide audience). Too Much Horror Business is over 250 pages of rare posters, props, costumes, and toys from the early silent classics to 1979 (with some artwork from the 1980s and beyond). It's also partly autobiographical as interviews with Hammett focus on his upbringing and love of horror films. Lots of full-color, original photographs in this enjoyable book. An interview with Hammett introduces each part. The first part is about movie posters and props. The second part looks at toys and collectibles from the 1960's and 1970's. The third section is about music and horror. Hammett seems like a very cool guy who knows what he is talking about. He is passionate and he points out some fun trivia for many of the items showcased (he admits to writing all the captions himself). My favorite part was the interview with Hammett and the chapter on movie posters from the 1970s (some films from the 1980s were also included). Hammett seems like a monster, sci-fi and zombie freak but there isn't much on slashers (as could be expected).<br /><br />This is one of the better horror movie poster books but the real value is in seeing the rare collectibles Hammett owns. Lots of love, little touches, and care were obviously put into Too Much Horror Business. The pictures look amazing! It could be a coffee table book but it isn't quite durable enough. I must admit the book binding does not seem like it could take a lot of damage so I'm very careful with my copy. I would love to see a Volume II with 80's posters, props and collectibles and a few modern horror films tossed in. Even a 300-page \\"interview only\\" with Kirk Hammett on Horror would be awesome. Horror fans who prefer films from 1980 to the modern era might appreciate [[ASIN:1440208247 Horror Movie Freak]] although the text itself isn't quite as good the pictures are wonderful.ul.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it could be played on my Kindle Fire HD.  I use it on my phone, but prefer to play birds on my Kindle.  Why is it free on my phone, but they want me to pay for it on my Kindle?  Cuts 1 star from the rating but otherwise awesome.
B0068287TK|5.0|great movie showing how 2 cultures try to get along and somehow it always fails. Would recommend this to the generation of today.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Kindle only has a lens that face the front so to take a picture like  a reg. camera you can't .  other than that is fine.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|The Godfather Collection: Coppola Restoration comes in a 4-disc set for Blu-ray. The films have never looked or sounded better. The improvement in picture quality is especially noticeable. Conveniently old extras are available on Disc Four under the \\"2001 DVD Archive\\" plus additional content added since then. The new bonus features come from the DVD re-release of 'The Godfather Collection\\" so there is over 5 hours of total bonus content plus audio commentaries included. Godfather fans get special treatment in this set. Not many film franchises get this kind of treatment. You can't beat the price so pick this one up.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Featurette: \\"The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't\\"<br />Featurette: \\"Godfather World\\"<br />Featurette: \\"Emulsional Rescue: Revealing `The Godfather'\\"<br />Featurette: \\"....And When the Shooting Stopped\\"<br />The Family Tree/The Crime Organization<br />Montage: \\"'The Godfather' on the Red Carpet\\"<br />Four Short Films on `The Godfather'<br />Audio Commentaries<br />Documentary: \\"The Godfather Family\\"<br />\\"Behind the Scenes\\" Featurettes<br />Storyboards<br />Additional Scenes/Historical Timeline
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|Not bad.  It gets to be a bit of the same ol' thing after a few levels.  Great graphics though, and kids will probably love it for the characters alone.
B002N57KG2|5.0|This is a funny movie, a good time laugh and to think of the funny stars we have lost since.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Really fun game . you need to read the how to in the beging  first . I really enjoy playing the game.
B0085Z3AMW|3.0|Halloween 5: Revenge isn't a deluxe Blu-ray like Halloween 1, 2 and 3 received. There are 22 minutes of bonus supplements and an audio commentary. This is the light version so hopefully we will get something new for a deluxe 2-disc Blu-ray release with 3 hours of documentaries and extras. To be fair this release is a better video and audio presentation than previous releases of Revenge (and better than Halloween 4 BD for that matter).<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Featurettes, Trailer
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Makes using ebay much easier on your mobile device.  I don't know if I'd list using this app, but certainly a good way to buy and sell once it's already listed.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I read the whole series of books ...I am far from being a teen or YA but liked the books alot. Please don't waste one second of time or one penny of your money watching this movie. Nothing like the book and just plan bad acting. After 15-20 minutes I decided I didn't care if I had paid to see the movie I wasn't subjecting myself to this any longer.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show is addicting! I love it! Gets better every season. I recommend everyone watch this show. The one-liners are the best
B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game brought back less-than-fond memories of the old original text based adventure games.  Yes, the graphics are nice but it has the little descriptors like &quot;the water is muddy&quot; written across the top of the screen.  I kept waiting for it to say &quot;you are in a room with two exits, to your left and ahead.  You are attacked by three ogres. What do you want to do? &quot;<br /><br />I just couldn't shake the impression of old and dated.  New games have a much snazzier interface.  I'm afraid I didn't get very far in this game before abandoning it.  If I'm ever broke and in need of entertainment I'll try again.

B007WFTFG6|3.0|Got this for my cousin and it was okay but he got very bored and it wasn't very creative, but I guess since it's free you get what you get.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found this book to be intensely interesting. The first part was a succinct historical review of events, lifestyles and politics in the region that would have shaped the perspective and probable life style of the historical young Jesus. He then moves into the adult life, activities, teachings and death as documented comparing historical texts aptly to make cogent points ending with an analysis of the developing early Christian community and schism that developed related to the differences in the message as delivered by James, the brother of the Jesus, other disciples and and Paul. It is not that the information contained in the book is inaccessible in other sources or is new information. However the whole is put together concisely in a way that presents a very probable reality. I found the reading enlightening in the sense that the author's history and perspective helps solidify a more three dimensional Jesus whose strength, passion, wisdom and intelligence did indeed change history and set into motion a Christ event with a new message about the nature of God.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Not bad, but not my thing.  Controls are intuitive, graphics are okay.  Music is bad, I recommend mute.  Could be better with an altimeter or some other means to judge distance to ground.
0375869026|5.0|A must read for boys and girls 9 years and up to adult!  A very fascinating story, makes you laugh and cry.  I feel teaches should have children read this as a class and talk about it.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|To start off you can tell by not just playing the game but I also what I see people saying in the chat room that they notice that when a nombers called you might get 1 on 1 Hinton card out of 4bingo cards or none and that they never get any bingos hardly at all any more and I am also saying the same goes with me. Also God forbidwhen you are trying to go into 1 of the States or country's that 1 gets hit by mistake you go to cancel and instead when you hit the cancel buttonall of the sudden your playing 4 cards in that country which happened to me this morning I only play new York and I lost 28credits out of 30 credits today I like to play throughout the day so I was very mad still mad and I of course I didn't get a Hinton in Dublin the game I didn't want so when that happens you really ought to come up with something so you can cancel when something like that happens without losing 28 credits instead get them back and play in the country you want to play. There's more but my ha lends tired so next time it comes up to rate your Hinton again I will tell you what else is wrong.
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|There are some films that are quite simply critic-proof: GREASE is one of these.  Forget the flat filming style (by Randal Kleiser) and the fact that the Rydale High students seem way too mature - we should just sit back and enjoy the songs, color, movement and sheer energy of the film.  John Travolta's Danny is both arrogant yet touching; someone willing to show bravado in front of his male buddies, yet extremely weak when it comes to showing off his emotions.  His body movements are a joy to watch - especially during the sequence where he presents Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) with a cheap ring and asks her to marry him.  Newton-John is especially good as a Doris Day/ Sandra Dee-type figure who cannot quite understand why Danny should behave so differently in front of his buddies. Stockard Channing's Rizzo quite simply steals the show; she cultivates a hard-boiled exterior (her real name in the film is Betty), yet cannot cover up an essential vulnerability, especially when she thinks that she is pregnant.  GREASE also contains a clutch of memorable cameos from television and film old-timers, from Sid Caesar's Coach Calhoun to Eve Arden's Principal McGee, to Joan Blondell's Vi.  In short, there is something in this film for absolutely everyone, regardless of their age and/or cinematic tastes.
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|Fun, and pretty much what it claims to be.  A little difficult due to character and scene size but not bad.  It could also use a &#34;nuke all&#34; button like lemmings does when you get stuck.  It was okay but I lost interest pretty quick on this one.

0062255657|4.0|At a high level, the plot is not an original one; but the strength of the story is in its telling, and here Gaiman shows a very deft hand. The bulk of the story it told from the point of view of an older man recalling his seven-year-old self. I liked for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Gaiman opens the book with a quote from an interview with Maurice Sendak which I didn't read until I'd finished the book:<br /><br />&#34;I remember my own childhood vividly...I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn't let adults know I knew. it would scare them.&#34;<br /><br />The book manages to unwind its story without losing the spirit of that quote. There's a Sendak-esque quality to The Ocean at the End of the Lane that I felt, but couldn't put a name to until I went back to the beginning and discovered the quote.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|Mud is a story about two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone, who find a man named Mud hiding out on the Mississippi.

DON'T BOTHER.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This is a good story about a couple of kids helping a lost soul played by Matthew McConaghey.  The kids' roles are very well done.  The acting keeps the movie entertaining, especially following the actions of the two young boys playing their roles.  The movie keeps interest level from the beginning through the exciting climax.  I would recommend it to adults and older teens.

The experiences of this young man in Camp 14 were so horrific that it was almost unbelieveable.  The format of the book made it easy to read.  The fact that a Camp 14 and other camps like it exists was enlightening.

140006922X|5.0|Hello all!<br /><br />First, I want to let you all know I'm currently 98 pages into this book after having received it today, I can't put it down. It's not meant to be a book that favours any particular religiously dogmatic philosophy. I know a lot of people are really upset and getting bent out of shape because it doesn't paint the Jesus of historical antiquity in the light that the Biblical writers or evangelicals do, however, that is not supposed to be the intention of this book. It is a collection of various ideas that have been supported by primary historical documents of the time (i.e. Josephus's Antiquities ) and tries to separate the truth from these historical accounts from the fiction (such as Celsus's claims that Jesus was born out of wedlock and had a Roman father). I think a lot of the heat coming down on this book is because the author is Muslim. I think it is extremely important to consider the fact that although he was born in Iran, Dr. Aslan grew up in Northern California and was a born again Christian in his teen years who walked that path until he found reasons in his own personal convictions that did not measure up with his interpretation of Christianity. It is also important to note that he himself presents what he believes to be the truth of the matter but also states just as much information from other scholars who disagree with him. This is a scholarly work. He has two decades in the field of religious history and has not set out to disparage anyone, merely to illuminate a character that he is quoted as saying &#34;...I am absolutely fascinated by...&#34;.<br />  If you are looking for an unbiased, scholarly representation of not only the history of Jesus from the viewpoint of his contemporaries who lived during his time in the 1st century and a picture of what the world Jesus of Nazareth lived in was like, buy this book. You will not be disappointed and it doesn't have to ruin your faith; merely give you insights to the history of the Jews and their world during the times of the messiah. All the best and happy reading!nd their world during the times of the messiah. All the best and happy reading!
B000000W5F|3.0|I paid more for this copy of &#34;Tattoo You&#34; for the specific reason that it was advertised as &#34;used-like new&#34; it is FAR from new condition.....I would say just straight &#34;used&#34; or even &#34;heavily used&#34; The case has normal wear...but the disc has some major scratches.  It does appear to be playing ok (the only reason I gave it 3 stars) ....but with this amount of scratching I am AMAZED it is playing at all.
159463176X|3.0|I waited in much anticipation for this book to come out and was disappointed with Mr. Hosseini's newest attempt.  The author has  a wonderful ability to make you see and feel the emotions in each of his characters and writings.  However, this book ebbs and flows back and forth between characters and time periods.  The author attempts to weave all of the characters together and show how each character's life will eventually intersect with one another in the story, but it made the story more difficult to follow at times.  The author still gets your attention with the personal struggles of these characters living in Afghanistan.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Awesome interaction between the players and the characters. Hopefully we will see more games like this one out in the near future.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really enjoying the gameplay.  It is fun and challenging.  HOGs are my favorite and this one is affordable.  There are in app purchases but I have yet to need to spend actual money.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book. I know some of the criticism: that its short vignettes don't let you relate to the characters, or pull you away from them just as you begin to, but this is a book about the totality of the zombie war, and not just one person's account, unless it is that of the narrator himself as he seeks to understand an event that has nearly destroyed human hegemony on the planet.<br /><br />The stories in this volume take the reader through each stage of the zombie war - the initial outbreaks, it's spread, the retreat of humanity to fortified strongholds,and then finally, the war to reclaim the planet, so they are arranged chronologically. Some characters to recur and do not entirely disappear. It is brilliantly done and if the story lacks some of the terrible impact of a more immediate style of storytelling, it is none the less suspenseful.<br /><br />Max Brooks has created such a complex event that it almost begs supporting volumes, though this volume actually follows the book we would expect to follow from it: the zombie survival guide. I would not mind seeing additional stories written, even collections of short stories, but welcome as they would be they are not necessary. I did not feel the story was incomplete when I had turned the last page.<br /><br />Because I had not read the book I did not see the film when it was in the theaters, and I look forward to seeing it now. I do know that the fast-moving zombies forming human bridges do not exist in the book. The zombies of the book are much more traditional, shambling man-eaters of popular imagination and earlier films.<br /><br />Brooks' powers of description are such that you almost feel as though you are there, hearing the monsters approach, facing the zombie hordes yourself and I think that seeing the event from so many perspectives actually improved the telling. You get a sense that way of what we faced as a species because it is a collective tale, and one story supports the other.<br /><br />I was amused when I thought back about the trailers for the film, talking about Brad Pitt's character searching for a cure. Anyone knows, as Max Brooks knows, the only cure for a zombie is destruction. If you like zombie apocalypses then this is the book for you, for it is an apocalypse on a grand scale. Do not hesitate to pick it up and read it. I wish I had much sooner than I did.sed when I thought back about the trailers for the film, talking about Brad Pitt's character searching for a cure.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|As a straight male, I was embarrassed to tell my friends that I watched Brokeback Mountain about a week ago (due to a coworker telling me it was &#34;an awesome western adventure flick&#34;) . Next thing you know, one of my buddies comes up to me and asks me if I had ever seen it. Without hesitation, I replied: &#34;Yes, and it is one of the greatest romantic movies I have ever seen.&#34; His response to that was basically saying the same thing.<br /><br />I'm sure by this point, 8 years after the film's release, the vast majority of you know the story so I'll just cut to the review.<br /><br />During the course of watching this movie, I sat completely still. The only movement was the blinking of my eyes. At some points, I grew so intrigued that I forgot how to breathe. Sitting through the forbidden romance was heartbreaking and painful. After the movie was over, I couldn't even reach 2 feet over to grab the remote. I just sat on the couch hypnotically watching the credits scroll with a blank stare. After managing to turn off the TV, I went up to my bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall. A moment later, a wave of sadness swept over me like a blanket. I was stunned. The acting is terrific (R.I.P. Heath Ledger), the atmosphere is almost as depressing as the movie itself, and the soundtrack definitely has a few perks to it. However, the ending was somewhat expected (all great romances end in tragedy) and in some ways, a little dull. Brokeback Mountain is one of the movies you can watch once, but always remember. A key element that I feel is excessively upsetting is that neither Ennis (Heath Ledger) or Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) ever admit their true orientation to anyone else in the story and deny the fact that they are gay or possibly bi. I am a huge fan of the movies that bring out the emotions which are buried deep within, and this movie gets an A+ in that perspective. Hollywood has done the LGBT community a great favor with this one. Ever since I first watched it last week, I have shown it to quite a few people who also ended up loving it! Overall, Brokeback Mountain is a classic that should not be missed by anyone!!!eback Mountain is a classic that should not be missed by anyone!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found that most of the negative reviews came from people who did not even read past the first 100 or so pages. I recommend disregarding any negative review from people who haven't read the whole saga, because each book has a different focus and they get better and better.<br /><br />The book starts with a short story, which is really intriguing and definitely hooked me. The second book, Proper Gauge, seems to be where a few readers got lost, as it has a steady pace (that I didn't find slow but I guess some did). This pace is purposeful, and serves to set up the rest of the omnibus, and by the end of Proper Gauge, you are hooked again. From there, it's mystery, conspiracy, and trouble, and I loved the whole this.<br /><br />I was especially excited that the story overall seemed to actually be written for adults who love the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre. So many of them today are geared towards teens and are full of teeny love triangle drama and angst. This book definitely focuses on the actually problems of the society, and it so good!

0446572985|5.0|David Baldacci introduces a new character, Will Robie, in his book, The Innocent.  Robie is a \\"good-guy\\" hit man, and works for the US; he primarily eliminates bad-guys for the CIA, FBI, and other government agencies to benefit national security.  In this book, which is written in Baldacci's easy-to-read-and-understand style, Robie is working on a new hit; everything goes as planned until he has second thoughts about killing an intended victim, because his gut tells him something about the hit just isn't right.  He flees the scene without completing the job, something he has never done during his long (and what his superiors consider \\"almost perfect\\" career).  Convinced he will now be killed because he disobeyed orders, Robie feels he must disappear to preserve his life, but he encounters a 14-year old runaway, Julie Getty, whom, against his better judgment, he feels obligated to protect.  When Julie's parents are killed for unknown reasons, he also promises to find the perpetrators; while doing so, he encounters numerous additional murders as well as dozens of attempts on his and Julie's life.<br />Parts of the story are fairly predictable, such as the fact that Robie becomes interested in and has a brief affair with an attractive neighbor he meets at a party.  He also suspects a mole in one of the government agencies, and never quite trusts Agent Vance, an attractive local policewoman who is working on the case with him.<br /><br />One of the reliable things about Baldacci's books is the fact that they are fast-moving thrillers without an over-abundance of violence or sex; they are easy, quick reading, and while they are probably not destined to become enduring classics, are a good choice for anyone who likes the thriller genre.  The Innocent is no exception and will not disappoint.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was requested by the author or publisher.

0062068415|3.0|Dennis Lehane's thriller noir, Shutter Island is set in the early 50's, as Teddy Daniels, a US Marshall, is sent to Shutter Island to help locate a patient, Rachel Solando, who has disappeared.  Shutter Island is the site of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, and Teddy is teamed up with a new partner, Chuck Aule.  Security is very tight, and Teddy is astonished that a patient could be missing.  Unfortunately, a hurricane hits the island, causing extra problems with the search.<br /><br />Teddy has an alternative reason for being on the island and asking to be assigned to the case; he is searching for Andrew Laeddis, a firebug who burned his apartment down two years ago, resulting in the death of his adored wife, Dolores.  Although her death occurred over two years prior, Teddy has not gotten over it and misses her terribly; he also has feelings of guilt.  Teddy believes that Laeddis is also on the island and while attempting to solve the disappearance of Rachael, he sneaks into the various sections and outbuildings of the hospital to look for him.<br /><br />In addition to the search, Teddy also learns that unsavory things are going on, and that doctors are doing brain surgeries and other experimental procedures that are illegal, such as lobotomies.  Things are not as they appear on this island, and Teddy is determined to find out the facts.<br /><br />As the novel proceeds, the reader is swept into a surreal setting; the characters are not as they seem, and it's difficult to determine who the bad guys really are.  Unfortunately, Teddy, the main character and supposed hero, is not particularly likeable, and unlike many thriller novels where the reader is anxious for the main character to save the day, the reader most likely doesn't really care what happens to Teddy.  In fact, if readers are like me, they will just want the book to end because they will grow tired of the odd story and the weird characters.  This is not to say that the book is poorly written; Lehane is very clever in the way he presents the story, and shows a certain expertise in his writing.  Fans of the bizarre will love this novel; however, it may not be suited to the mainstream thriller reader.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.ritten; Lehane is very clever in the way he presents the story, and shows a certain expertise in his writing.

B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Ellie Goulding is one of my favorite artists right now. She doesn't go over the top to try to be different, she's just naturally different and very talented. Lights and Halcyon were very good albums. Halcyon days would have been perfect if it were A: just the new tracks from the second disc. and B: titled something else. In my opinion there wasn't any need to make this an addition to Halcyon. There are enough solid tracks out of the new songs to make this a completely new album, unless she thought there wasn't enough time in between the two. Aside from this minor issue, there are some awesome new songs on the second disc. My favorite is Under Control by far, the chorus is absolutely amazing. Other great songs are Goodness Gracious, How Long will I Love You, Stay Awake with Madeon, Midas Touch, and Hearts Without Chains. Burn may be some people's favorite but I don't care for it too much. You My Everything has the same feel as Stay Awake but you can't come close to Madeon. Flashlight is just okay, same with Tessellate (Although I do like the Saxophone parts in Tessellate) Overall I'm very happy with these new additions to Halcyon!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love the book...have never read anything like it. Just when you think you've figure it out..bam...out was of nowhere a whole new twist.
0307950689|4.0|Robert Langdon is back in Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. The novel begins as a mysterious man takes the final and most solemn Masonic oath in the Temple Room; however, his thoughts are exposed to the reader and as he goes through the ritual, it is evident he is lying.<br />Langdon receives a message from his wealthy friend, mentor, and surrogate father, Peter Solomon, asking him to come to Washington, D.C. to fill in at a gala dinner where the keynote speaker has cancelled due to illness at the last minute.  Langdon, a well-known symbologist and college professor, flies in and makes it to the National Statutory Hall just in time to find there is no gala.  He calls Solomon's office and learns he has been duped.  The man on the phone says, \\"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today...You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here.\\"  The voice belongs to Mal'akh, a huge sinister man, tattooed with symbols \\"which were used in the rituals of dark ceremonial magic.\\"<br /><br />After the phone call, Langdon hears a scream in the rotunda and finds that a small boy with a group of tourists has discovered a severed human hand.  He recognizes a ring on the hand and knows that the hand belongs to Peter Solomon.  Mal'akh has kidnapped Peter and brought Langdon to Washington to solve the ancient secret of The Masonic Pyramid.<br /><br />In a sub-plot, Peter Solomon's sister, Katherine, who is a Noetic Scientist, is waiting for Peter to arrive at her laboratory in which she has been conducting research and experiments for years; her laboratory is located in one of the Smithsonian buildings and the location has been kept secret.  Katherine's research has uncovered several things that could change the world, and Mal'akh plans to murder Katherine and destroy her laboratory.<br /><br />As is Dan Brown's style, the book is well-researched.  He weaves his fictional story through factual settings, i.e., the buildings in Washington, D.C., where they are searching for clues to uncover the secret, as well as facts relating to religion, rituals, and symbols.  The book is absolutely fascinating, and although it is not a fast-read, it is intriguing enough to keep the interest of anyone who loves a good thriller with plenty of cutting-edge suspense.  After finishing this book, most readers will have gained as much new knowledge as if he attended a semester-long course in college.  Once Again, Dan Brown has proven himself to be a leader in his genre, and entertains as well as educates.<br /><br /> This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.or clues to uncover the secret, as well as facts relating to religion, rituals, and symbols.

0679446230|5.0|An overwhelming story with the greatness of cultures and strength of conflicts! In African-American literature, Achebe's Things Fall Apart is an Afrocentric work, it is written from an African-centered perspective. It focuses on the clash between traditional Ibo society, unknown African cultural etiquette to most Americans and the religion of white European colonists. The reader is transported to a tribal village by sound, pronunciation, characterization, and believability.<br /> Achebe (Nov. 16, 1930-March 21, 2013) writes the novel in a rhythm that conveys a sense of African oral storytelling infused with the wisdom of a griot.  Achebe is a master storyteller as he gently weaves in colonization in a time of great transition in Umuofia and focuses on his major character Okonkwo's rigidity in the face of these changes. This is Achebe's magnum opus!<br /><br />Vandella Brown, Librarian/Author of What Is a Zawadi to We? (Lumenus 2007) http://www.amazon.com/Vandella-Brown/e/B001KCN9T6
0451209338|5.0|Daniel Silva's first novel in the popular Gabriel Allon series begins as Gabriel is brought out of retirement by Ari Shamron, who is called back to head \\"the Office (headquarters on King Saul Boulevard in Tel Aviv)\\" due to a series of botched missions that have threatened the credibility of the Israeli spy network.  Gabriel, one of the most sought after art restorers in the world, has been living in England in a small out-of-the-way cottage, restoring a famous painting for Julian Isherwood (not-so-ethical gallery owner and aide to Shamron), and has kept himself as far away as possible from his previous dealings as an Israeli spy.  While in Vienna on his last mission almost 10 years prior, a Palestinian terrorist group, led by Tariq al-Hourani, bombed Gabriel's car, killing his son and leaving his wife, Leah, shell-shocked and unable to cope - she now lives in a home and rarely recognizes Gabriel during his weekly visits.<br /><br />A deadly terrorist incident has just happened in Paris, and Shamron is sure Tariq is behind it.  Tariq is dying and is planning to make an impact before he goes; The Office believes that he is going to upset a long-negotiated peace agreement which is to be signed shortly.<br /><br />Against his better judgment, Gabriel puts his painting aside and joins Shamron in an attempt to thwart Tariq's mission.  It is decided that a woman is needed to penetrate Tariq's network, so Jacqueline Delacroix, a French model and former spy who worked closely with Allon on previous missions, is brought in to assist.<br /><br />Daniel Silva is a master at weaving his fictional characters into a backdrop of historical and modern-day incidents that have had an impact on the Jews in the Arab world.  This novel has been well-researched, and is even quite believable.  Silva's style of writing is \\"a cut above\\" that of many thriller writers who grind out several books a year, and the high-quality of his writing is evident as he tells his story.  Readers will be on the edge of their seats while reading this novel; the suspense doesn't quit, and the book is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Fans of spy, espionage, and international intrigue novels will be fascinated by The Kill Artist and the interesting and unique characters.  Since it is the first of the Gabriel Allon series, and it introduces Gabriel, et. al, it is a good idea (but not absolutely necessary - each book gives enough background to be stand-alone) to read The Kill Artist first, and then the subsequent novels in the order of publication.  Definitely recommended as a must read thriller, The Kill Artist will inspire readers to read the entire series.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.he edge of their seats while reading this novel; the suspense doesn't quit, and the book is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Fans of spy, espionage, and international intrigue novels will be fascinated by The Kill Artist and the interesting and unique characters.

B0089LOKHG|2.0|I read the entire series in 1 week and loved it until the last book. I really feel cheated by the ending. What happened to Hana? Who did Lena end up with? Why was Julian in the book so little? Did they win the war? I think the author did not know how to end the story. I did not need everything wrapped up in a bow, but I really did expect more than what we were given.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I read the reviews and picked one up! Love it for streaming music as you can change songs as well as adjust volume from your device. It's more fun watching YouTube videos when you can just push them directly to your TV so easily. At the $35 price point you cannot go wrong!
B00BH413IG|5.0|Taborn has touch with a broad musicality that can astonish at times. I would love to hear this excellent trio live. No matter how great the recording is, and it is, these guys must be experienced live. But, in the meantime, I'll listen to this.
