B007HZBOFG|4|I like that all of the re-play items are recycled items.  I love the bright colors and the fact that they are gender neutral.  However, I noticed that it requires a lot of soap to remove any greasy residue from ordinary foods (cheese, chicken, etc.)  Not that much of an issue, but a good swipe of dish soap doesn't cut it.  It really requires a good scrubbing.  Just a little heads up.    ****UPDATED 8/26/14 ****  So after almost a year, these plates are still great.  These are virtually indestructible and I'd say for the price of stainless steel plates, this is the much better deal.  They have a few scratches on them where my kid has tried to jam her fork into the plates or where I used a knife to cut up her food, but it's only noticeable to me because I'm looking.  The colors have not faded one iota.  There are no cracks in them with all the banging, throwing, and pretend play these get in addition to daily meal use.  When compared to melamine plates, these are far superior.  Melamine plates cannot be microwaved (neither can these replay dishes), and crack if you drop them hard enough (my toddler would accomplish this in no time) and is prone to discoloration.  I would know, because I have a bunch of them that I no longer use. I take these out to picnics, restaurants, friends houses ..... they're light enough to shove into my diaper bag.    My only hang up has not changed since my first review.  It requires multiple passes to get it squeaky clean.  If I wash it with soap once, I can still feel a greasy residue.  So now I wash it with soap and rinse it, leave it in the sink while I soap up other dishes, soap it up again and then rinse them out.  Yes, it's double the work, but really, one more go at it doesn't really bother me considering it's other good points.
B002CQTUC4|5|I bought this for my niece and she loves it. She's 14-months old and it a perfect size for her to sit with the rest of the family (although she is slightly tall for her age).
B00HGA8S2O|1|This item is very poorly made, don't be fooled by the brand. The ear fell off within 5 mins of my 5 month old holding it! Could have been a choking hazard-so disappointed!
B000056HKG|3|I definitely agree with another reviewer that this product is not meant for anyone that is height challenged. I'm 5'4&quot; and the hip belt rides low on my hip so I have to really tighten it to get the weight off my shoulders and back. Even then, my shoulders and back still feel the strain after about 20 minutes of carrying my 23-lb son. <br />In addition, the 5-point harness is very difficult to fasten. The buckle is deep down inside the seat so if you have a baby with a belly, like mine, you'll need to almost push the belly in to fasten the harness. My husband has more trouble with this than I do because of his bigger hands. There's not much room to begin with.<br />And for some reason, no matter how straight my son is when I place him in the seat, he is always lobsided to one side or another when I'm carrying him on my back.
B0018QTNKI|1|Although I have used and bought these bags for exactly 18 months in the UK and been very happy with them, the box I ordered from Amazon USA is of appalling quality! Every single one is split or damaged or rips. I know I should return them but I threw away the packaging and paperwork and as we are only visiting the US I really can't be bothered. But I wanted to make my grievance known. Poo-ey nappies falling out of a split nappy bag is not a pleasant experience for anyone. A shame as they have always been excellent in the UK.
B007S1T42O|4|we bought this for our daughter to bathe our grand daughter in. She is a newborn and uses it already, even in the bathtub it keeps her secure.
B00BLT1IZU|2|SHRIINK SO THEY DON'T FIT ON MATTRESS
B004J9JYKK|5|I run a daycare so I have gone though a number of potty chairs, This one is Amazing Best ever. easy and clean-up is a breeze. Thank You for finally making a Potty chair that is so darn easy and the kids love it.
B004KT82AM|4|I love love that this is made from recycled milk containers, made in USA, no bad plastic stuff, etc.  I am very happy with everything we have from Green Toys, both quality and design wise.  The scale of all the parts of this toy are great for baby - easy to grasp, pieces good to chomp on.  My only concern with this one is that when baby shakes it close to their head (and given how short their arms are, everything is close to their head!) it is quite loud and I hope there is no danger to their hearing.  Probably just a paranoid new parent talking.  The noise is probably why baby likes it so much!  Not a complaint, per se, just a concern.
B0038OLMXE|5|We bought this to put at the bottom of our stairs to keep the baby from playing on the stairs and it has worked great. We didn't want to screw it into the banister so we just used the pressure mounted discs. They have worked great. I also really liked that you could push it open either way and it will stay. This was great for my six year old to come downstairs at night without having to try and open the gate first.
B004S11PG0|5|Our kids love their booster seats and we love them because of the safety ratings. We have bought four of these for our two cars. Highley recommend them! Shipping was fast and free.
B00NWCHIXK|5|Excelent
B00UM2JD3Q|5|love them
B00ASZHG5Y|4|Hilarious.  Who needs 3 of them though.  See website below for single purchase options. They have a lot of other great ideas for gag/entertainment gifts. Great Customer service.    [...]
B000YZAZMO|3|I bought this particular exersaucer for my 6 month old because my daughter had previously become bored with a model that had fewer, less complex toys on it.  Sure enough, the pull toys, spinning wheels, have been very engaging for him, most likely because the colors, shapes, and such are not run-of-the-mill.  However, the electronics (sounds and lights) are strangely mismatched to the activities that activate them.  For instance, the shapes on the bar with hanging toys don't light up individually when the toy beneath the shape is pulled and the voice said, \\"green triangle,\\" for example.  Only after pulling a toy several times do all the lights blink together while music plays.  My son gets bored of pulling after one or two pulls because nothing much happens, though my 3 year old entertains him by pulling it the full four times to get the lights to go on.  I actually called Evenflo thinking that the lights were broken, but according to customer support, it's not designed for the lights to blink individually with one pull.  They also said I wasn't the first person to complain about this.  Some of the sounds that accompany the pressing of certain buttons also seem like odd choices, arbitrary, or not quite age appropriate.  In general, I don't consider this a bad purchase necessarily, but it falls short of its potential.  It's as if the people doing the physical design were top notch, but the people doing the sounds and the lights were newbies and none of these groups were talking to each other during the design phase of this product.
B00078EL5K|2|Very cheap and flimsy. Will not last. Light gauge plastic construction. Am returning. Do not recommend this item for long term usage
B00278WA4W|5|My kids love these perfect for my two year old
B000056JAK|5|Daughter started using this cup at 7 months old. Easy to get the beverage out of spout. Wish I could find a shorter one so she can try to hold it up herself. Otherwise Playtex is the BEST!
B00KFP6NHO|5|My wife uses these to make breastmilk pops for the baby. He loves them.
B00AZWDM0I|4|I received this as a baby shower gift.  It is very handy as a waterproof, easy to clean changing pad.  I use cloth diapers and cloth wipes so I really don't get to use the compartments much.  I didn't realize how handy a changing pad would be even for just a grocery store trip.  I would recommend but taking off a star on the small size of the storage compartments.
B0049O7O20|5|I am really happy with this cover- I feel like some of the boppy covers can be cheesy but this one really is sweet with the birds and animals on one side and pink on the other.  Would happily recommend and/or buy again.
B002ED3YE0|5|I am an exhaustive researcher and buying all the plethora of baby items before our baby daughter was born was no different for me.  Of course when it came to bottle recommendations, every friend, family member and health practitioner had their own personal brand that they swore by.  We liked the look at feel of the AVENT bottles but the reviews were horrible.  They all said these bottles leaked horribly.  We took the plunge and bought a couple two (2) packs of the 4oz bottles anyway.  We never had the bottle leak, once - ever.  The bottles do not have a bunch of loose parts.  Just the bottle, the nipple, collar and a small sleeve that goes into the bottle opening.  Very easy and fast to clean.  The wide and short shape and size of the 4oz bottles make them a joy to use and again, a joy to clean.  We usually wash the bottles by hand and run them in the dishwasher from time to time and they have held up great.  After three months, no leaks, cracks or discoloration and the logo is still printed on the bottle perfectly.    Recently our bottle started going on a mini-bottle strike, refusing to drink from the bottle.  Thinking it was the AVENT bottle we went out and bought a born free, playtex and dr. browns.  She hated all of then equally and only drank from the AVENT (after lots of struggling).  So we discovered that after trying all the different bottles, she liked AVENT the best anyway.    Keep in mind our daughter never had issued which colic or gas. She's quite good at burping and passing gas on her own so we've been lucky that way :)  For babies with colic issues we have been told anecdotally that Dr. Browns are great.  But for us, the AVENT bottles have been fantastic and we are glad we took the initiative (and risk) and bought these as our main bottles when my wife first gave birth.  We recently bought four 9oz bottles and some 3m+ nipples as she seems to prefer the increased flow.    As others have stated, we have only carefully sought out and used the bottles in the BLUE packaging (not the yellow).  The bottles are made of an opaque plastic.  Apparently the yellow boxed ones are honey colored and have an additional vent in the nipples that cause leaking.
B00LV9J3SE|5|My nephew loved it
B008RS8NRO|5|This car seat is great! It fits comfortably In my Malibu and would allow other seats back there as well. My daughter started using this when she was 6 months old and loves it. She has no problem falling asleep comfortably in the seat. Not to mention, the purple design is adorable.
B00H3X7MIK|5|Great product. Easy install. Lightweight.
B005W8WWNI|5|**Quincy with Jailbreak sent me an email that said he would sent a tracking number so I could be sure my brother got his new bear. When the tracking number email never came, I assumed the worst. BUT, it turns out, the replacement was sent so quickly that when I was finally able to talk to my dad, he said the replacement bear had already arrived a few days earlier and never bothered to tell me. (Where is the customer service department for parents?!) When I finally got to see the working bear in person, it was great! My little brother loves to carry it everywhere and with the timer, he takes it to bed with him. Very durable! Nice light--much brighter than I thought it would be, but I guess that has something to do with it being the yellow.  Great product, great company, ADORABLE Gummibear! Think I'll order another! They did such a great job with making a quick fix, I would certainly buy more from them! updated on: 1/10/12  **this review was written before I received a nice email from someone at the company who offered to replace my defective Gummi Bear. Once replaced, my review will be ammended. Customer Service isn't overrated--and Jailbreak Collective went out of their way to right a wrong. That was truly an unexpected surprise and much appreciated by this customer!!!12/29/11***  I ordered this a month or so ago so I could get it well in advance of Christmas for my 5 year old brother who loves Gummi Bears.  Ordering was easy, I got it in a timely fashion, I opened the box and all seemed to be okay. I kept it in the plastic, but took off the cardboard that surrounded it. It came with no instructions, so I assumed it was as simple as: batteries in and go.  The night before Christmas, I took it out of the plastic and added fresh batteries. I turned the switch to \\"on\\" and nothing happened. I took the batteries out and noticed that the drawing that usually tell you which direction to put the batteries in--the diagram was wrong. It showed the batteries pointing in the opposite direction--the nub end was supposed to go against the spring?! I tried it the wrong way, which was shown, and the right way, the way I have been putting in batteries my whole life----and still nothing!!   Finally my dad noticed there was a button you could push in between the bears legs. Although we could press and unpress the button which seemed like on/off, the LED lights never worked.   We tried it all: changed batteries, changed direction of batteries, pushed button, turned on/off the switch on the bottom. We even tried it in the dark in case it had a light sensor. Nothing!  Christmas morning it was one of the first toys my brother was drawn to because it is a giant yellow Gummi Bear that is adorable and almost looks like you could eat it. But we never got it to work and since I ordered it a while back, I don't want to go through the hassle of trying to return it only to get another one that doesn't work. So instead of light, it's a cute display item only. Wish it worked.
B0043SE83A|5|I love the ewonderballs so much I also purchased a ball pit & tunnel set along with more balls for my 1 yr old son and his first birthday party!
B000AQEBUY|5|Very warm and soft. We used it for our uppababy vista with infant insert and it worked great!
B0007CS4HC|5|my baby likes it so much, that we take it each time to home, so he could play with it.<br />good mirror for a car, it is large and fun
B00F2MQ0GO|5|Very nice potty! Cute song! Wish pee guard were higher but not expert in baby pottys. Seems to work ok although we need to encourage use more. Little one likes this potty.
B00JWG0K1W|4|it looks cute to my baby's feet.
B00BH0P7ZA|5|A happy infant this activity saucer makes.  My little munchkin enjoys the beach scene in all seasons beginning as early as 3.5 months around the holiday season, and she still thoroughly seeks it out now as she is approaching her seventh month.  It is fun to watch her twist around and play with all of the different stimulants.  Looking forward to this as a standing play station in the months to come.  A great investment.
B006P05SHY|4|Cushion is great
B008TACLZK|1|The Tru-Clean brush is worthless.  It doesn't fit Born free bottles and the nipple cleaner doesn't fit Born free Nipples making this product a total waste of money.  One would think Born free would have at least tested this brush on one of its own bottles.  Born free needs to bring back the Twister Brush.  I have found that any store or site on the web that says they have twisters just ships worthless Tru-Cleans.
B001ABH1QY|5|Bought this for my 4 month old daughter. She's now over 5 months old, and it's been working out great. She's about 15 lbs, and the fit has been perfect. She could have even been using it earlier. Her legs are a pretty average size, and they fit well. She is able to sit up in it, and not slouch over too much. I can see the tray being useful, but we didn't get it. She either just holds a toy to chew, or I sit her at her play mat where she can play with the hanging toys. I have tried her in a Bumbo seat, and she slouched over a lot more, and the fit wasn't as great. Glad I chose the Bebe Pod!
B000F1O8T8|5|Perfect for traveling with my toddler.
B006UYHX9G|2|There is no Access to hardware buttons and charging port is absent.<br />The software is just ok, but once you buy the hardware you shouldn't have in app purchases.
B001TUYH6I|3|It was ok. the pul is kind of thin. i haven't used it yet but I'm sure it will work fine.
B002ZNKSNY|5|Pros:  Narrow  Lightweight  Compact  Easy to push  Fits my Baby Trend car seat    Cons:  Small basket    I REALLY like this stroller.  I'm 5'3\\" and love that the bar isn't too high for me to push comfortably.  I highly recommend this stroller.
B002JH7NXO|5|I bought it for my cousin who just had a baby.  I will give it to her and im sure she will love it.
B000JVXZES|3|I like this product, but the suction cups don't hold up at all. I finally purchased 3M's Command Adhesive Product/clips and that seems to be working.
B0000BUSJV|4|This pack n' play was a lifesaver when I lived in a 3-story condo. The changing table came in extremely handy and I loved the storage unit on the side. However, I wouldn't plan on taking this pack n' play with you on your travels - it's extremely heavy!! Even my husband gripes when he has to lift it. My son (and I) never really cared for the vibrations/music/light options that I thought I HAD TO HAVE. He does like the little bears that dangle down, although I would like something a little more stimulating. I'm glad I have this pack n' play (it's definitely pretty), but I probably wouldn't buy it again. It's awfully expensive. I'd go for one with a bassinet, changing table, and storage unit - but pick one a little less heavy.
B002OOJ97A|3|These are quality knee pads, very cute too. They worked for the most part, but fall down after crawling around awhile.  My daughter dragged her knees when she crawled. I would recommend these to a friend.
B00RFTVN4Q|5|Bought this for my daughter's new baby girl. She loved the idea of it covering the whole baby and not having to go through so many bibs. IT does not stain and it will not hold odors. I may get this in other colors too.
B00GJVLTB8|5|Good quality
B004OR1DTC|5|Extremely helpful
B0000A1O7P|2|I bought this for an upcoming trip because I wanted something that could pack in my luggage.  Once I got it, I tried putting it on my kitchen table, but wasn't able.  I think our table might have been too thick for this chair to be compatible.  So we ended up returning it and instead got the My Little Seat Infant Seat.
B00081L2NU|1|The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months, the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams (thus patch would not work).  Kel-Gar does not warranty the product, and the store that the tub came from (via amazon) only offered a 90 day warranty.   <br /> <br />Also, the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub, the rest flows behind it.  Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill.
B000ZJS6MA|5|I researched so much before buying the Combi Zeus.  The low rear-facing restriction did alarm me, but I contacted Combi before I made the purchase and a rep told me that it is 22lb AND 1 year.  She even said that we could keep my daughter rear-facing until the 40lb limit...she said the 22lbs is just a recommendation for comfort.  We plan to keep her rear-facing until she is too uncomfortable, but at least for one year.  My daughter loves this seat.  It sits up so high.  My only complaint would be the straps are a little hard to adjust...however, once adjusted to the correct length, it's fine.  The turn feature is WONDERFUL (especially if you drive a large SUV) and made this purchase worth every penny!
B0013VHH9C|4|I like the bed rail but it arrived in the most damaged fashion.  I am just appreciative that the actual prduct wasn't damaged just loose in the box.  Other then that everything about the actual product is as was expected.
B004AQNMK0|5|These hard-to-find square sheets fit my old play yard perfectly! While our granddaughter naps here only once or twice a week,  I was happy to buy 2 for alternating.
B000IDSLOG|1|After opening the box this giraffe had a strong smell of  plastic. After washing it and giving it to my child I noticed that there were pieces of plastic missing. I returned this right away and ordered one from Toys &#34;R&#34; Us. It is absolutely wonderful. There are many reviews on here saying that this is a fake.  I'm not sure if these accusations are true however, I would not order from here. I would order from Toys &#34;R&#34; Us. There was a big difference in quality
B0083V927U|5|As expected...Inexpensive, but does the job of holding goodie bag junk until torn into by party goers after the party.
B0051POJQA|5|LOVE this activity mat! I didn't even realize when I ordered it that it has a light that changes colors and my son was completely in love with the light and the toys and spent alot of time on it! I would highly recommend this item!!
B00PM360XG|4|I requested 2 thermometers and just one of them had pile.
B000NPL0V0|5|I love these bibs and burp towels. They are super absorbant and really soft. No complaints here!
B002AVU30E|5|The table is adorable and sturdy.<br />The chairs are great; our 3 year old just loves this set.  This set is, by far, much better than the princess tables we have seen at local retailer stores.
B00006C29H|5|I purchased the piano when my sons were 6-months old because they seemed bored with their bouncer and boppy.  I was so suprised at how quickly they got used to their new toy and at how quickly they seemed to be able to do more with their bodies.  I truly think that because of the piano's ability to allow the babies to turn around and move back and forth, it really moved them ahead developmentally.  They LOVE this item and never seem to get enough of it.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the product because in my mind it is wonderful.
B00QTLEPH8|5|This diaper is made out of very good material. seller was great and shipped quickly. received a gift from her as well, thank you so much! :) will recommend to my friends.
B006PASJAC|5|My grandnephew is very, very squirmy, especially when he's taken out of the bath. We would kid my niece and nephew about the fact that they get more water on themselves than on my grandnephew. The beauty of this towel is that the bather stays dry while the baby gets his bath, and the towel is so designed that one can keep a firm grip on the child as he's lifted out of the bath. Ny niece fell so much in love with this towel that she went out and bought about seven more. She calls it the perfect towel when dealing with my grandnephew.
B003NQTQRQ|3|The washcloths are soft as I had expected they are simply small, even compared to infant and toddler washcloths.  Would like them to be bigger for my use.
B003LW4J6A|4|My baby likes this pacifier, but then again he is not picky and likes mostly any pacifier. I wish this pacifier came with a lid, something to protect the nipple when the baby is not using it. I've noticed that fabfic partials tend to stick more on this item, maybe because its sticky rubbber? Not sure, but I wish it had a cap like some of the NUK pacifiers have. Other than that , I like it.<br />Don't forget to put the pacifier in boiling water before use..
B00005QYYB|5|My twins love these toys.  The monkey is the hands-down favorite; then the elephant, and lastly the butterflies (I think once the babies are a little older, they'll like these more). I think on the Babies R Us site some reviewers were concerned about the eyes on the monkey being choking hazards, but they seem quite solidly attached so I'm not overly worried.     That little monkey goes with us everywhere. The girls never get tired of him!  Though personally I think he's a little creepy-looking.  But, he has legs the girls just love to grab.
B00APIN8H4|5|good.
B00CU6BGQ4|1|The warming wraps did not work in 3 out of 4 that came. Only one was working appropriately
B000BZ6BAM|5|Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it.
B00KSGM8MO|5|My husband bought this for me for Christmas for my son and I LOVE it!! It's beautiful and very well made!
B002B55AC0|1|Total waste of money! I bought it hoping to protect our wood table. But it wont stick to the table, and is all bulky! Total waste of money, went straight to the trash :(
B00GY8J9BS|4|Really like this stroller a lot. It fits well in my trunk, unlike my larger stroller that took up the whole thing. I can carry it with one hand easily and it opens and closes really quickly. The only thing I don't like so far is that the basket underneath is not that easy to get to. I'm not sure I could expect more given its size. Oh, also, i put the front wheels on upside down and it was a real pain to get them off. The picture in the manual is not clear. Pay attention when you're doing it!
B004CL9YHS|4|We have a 8 month old Lhasa Apso puppy who at the time was still going through the difficult house training process.  So we figured we would get this product to make sure he couldn't sneak off into the hallway (his favorite place to sneak a special surprise for us!).<br />First off I noticed about the gate was the instruction book is a little hard to follow.  I personally am the kind of person who reads and reads the instructions and even I found it a little puzzling.  But I was able to get it perfectly in the hallway and am very pleased with the results.<br />I appreciate the fact that it swings shut and latches with such ease.  And aesthetically it looks great too.  So overall I am pleased.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Looks good.  Well made.  High quality.<br />CONS:<br />A little confusing when it comes to putting it together.  A little pricey.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />It is a little pricey, but you are getting good quality so it's worth it.
B002MN3JY2|3|I'm 5 weeks postpartum and so I think I'm a moderate/heavy leaker. I have used the pack of 2 Motherhood brand reusable pads and also the Medela disposable pads to compare this to. I'm disappointed in this purchase. They are super soft, but I notice they leak through to the other side and I've also experienced some sticking. The ones from Motherhood don't stick or leak.<br /><br />The pros to this set is that they're real soft and cheap. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it. I like the pair from Motherhood better.<br /><br />Update 2/2014: I take back my previous comments...  I think I'm a heavier leaker now because I find the ones from Motherhood are also leaking through and stick as well.  I usually wear the same pads for the whole day, and a pair for night. In reading reviews for reusable pads, I notice that sticking is common.
B00PTL0S3Y|5|This playard is amazing: It has it all for the newborn through toddler. Not sure about a crib? Get this! Do you work from home and you want the baby in your home office with everything in place so you are not running all over the house to get what the baby needs? THIS IS THE PLAYARD FOR YOU! I am amazed at how easily it folds up and opens. This product makes baby care portable and easy. The multiple features addresses all needs for both mom and baby. Simple directions makes assembly/startup so easy and quick. For me, this playard makes my home office highly functional as a mom who works from home.
B0056S889Q|5|Nice size, very quiet, holds quite a bit of water, fairly easy to fill.<br />Good price and value.<br />Would definitely recommend to a friend.<br />Prompt shipping.<br />Very satisfied with the purchasing experience.
B002SW3CAS|4|My baby has bad reflux and spits up constantly. I have about 8 of these burpy bibs and love how LARGE they are-they cover my entire shoulder! when used as a bib, it looks kind of ridiculous on my 4 month old baby because it looks like a cape, but it also provides great protection from drool and spit up BECAUSE it is so large!<br /><br />I also have a ton of the snap bibs by Aden + Anais, and love those as well, but I have no clue why everyone keeps saying that these muslin bibs get &#34;softer with every wash.&#34; Mine aren't exactly soft (not rough, but not super soft either), and I don't know if it's because I don't dry them with dryer sheets.
B007U8P12M|5|These are my favorite pacifiers because unlike the advent ones they don't seem to fall out of the baby's mouth as easily. Plus now that he is teething he chews on them! I order a new set every 6 weeks (that's the recommended time for replacement by the doctor) so that I can have one in the crib, one in the car seat, one in the play pen, one in the pack n play, a couple in the diaper bag... well you get the idea ;)
B00FXR5RY4|5|This is a prefect little diaper bag, and everyone thinks it's just a cute purse. It holds 2-3 diapers in 1 interior pocket and a Huggies travel wipes container in the other pocket. I am able to for my wallet in the front zippered section for easy access. The body strap unbuckles on both sides which is convenient if you put your cost on over your purse. It makes an easier hands free outing that carrying a large diaper bag that constantly falls off your shoulder.
B00DPFJ5SK|5|Nice item
B00L2FPBXS|5|baby is like
B00A7DATQ0|5|Lets you use the car seat with the stroller. Stroller is nice, so by extension so are the clips, I suppose.
B002USCI64|4|I really like ladybugs and have purchased other ladybug accessories for my new car - this keychain is very cute - lightweight so I don't have to worry about it weighing down the ignition - something that once happened to me with a very heavy keychain. The only thing is, if you are getting it for the light, it's not worth it - the light is miniscule and doesn't provide any real help in the dark. But it's cute so I'm keeping it!
B000066CMV|1|I tried to use this pump when my daughter was ~4 weeks old and it HURT so much that I wanted to cry.  Also, it took me 30 minutes to pump ALMOST 2 ounces.  At that point, I thought that pumping was just not for me.  A few weeks later we bought the Medela Pump in Style and it worked GREAT (I got 6 ounces in 5 minutes) and did not hurt at all!  Yes - it is much more expensive, but totally worth it.  After using the Medela for a few weeks, I tried this pump again and it still hurt and barely pumped anything.  I agree that the suction is just not right.  While I do love all of the other products I have from Avent - I really feel that this pump was a waste of money.
B00PJDQ71Y|5|Exactly as described and exactly what I was looking for. Highly Recommend A+++++
B000YDGVMY|4|I've been using this for a couple of years now for bed-sharing with my youngest. Its held up to daily use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. My only complaint is there is no way to remove the fabric to properly wash it. The fabric is looking kind of grungy, but I hate to have to replace the whole unit over some surface dirt.
B00CCSH3XK|5|I breastfeed my daughter and we tried these at 5 1/2 weeks, she latched on pretty quickly. She eats very well from a bottle, and still has no issue latching on to me.
B00006IJRU|1|We bought these bottles because we thought they would keep air bubbles out with their shape, but found out that they actually made our daughter more fussy because she was always gassy after she ate from them.  Plus, the bottles leaked everywhere all of the time, no matter how tightly the bottom was screwed on.  We switched to an Evenflow system and have much happier feedings now!  I'd give these bottles a 0 out of 5 stars
B003TJAGBM|4|These bags go well with the Ameda breast pump. As well as the adapters.  The only thing I would suggest is the part where you cut the bag should also be resealable. My newborn was onay drinking about two ounces per feeding and once you cut the bag there is no way to close it up. Needless to say he grew out of that stage quickly but that would have been a good feature.
B005537IFW|5|My 1 year old absolutely loves this doll. I had to order another just in case she ever loses this her.  It's her #1 doll she needs to fall asleep with.  The tragedy of losing this doll would to horrendous.  Best 10$ insurance policy I spent so far.
B00MYRXD2E|5|I like it well worth money
B00OW6652K|5|This is a terrific and useful product.  Made extremely well, easy to clean and easy to install.<br />Highly recommended...a great value.  Enjoy.
B009P0ANUS|4|I just thought they would come in a box was a little shocked when they came in a big bag filled with small plastic bags with individual inserts. They look clean but it makes me wary.
B00KL8GW80|4|These work really good. Just make sure they are moist when putting on.
B00004WJSJ|1|stupid toy.  my son just throws it all over the place
B007F30DKM|5|I love the wubbanubs! This is the 4th or 5th one I've bought because someone bought one for my son and he loves it and so I've bought them for all my friends who have babies or are expecting a baby. I love this one because my sister in law is pregnant and they are very faithful christians and I just know she'll appreciate the thoughtful baby gift, plus I know her baby will love it because I haven't met a kid that doesn't!
B00M2UF0DS|5|We love this tray! It is the perfect size for baby food storing, easy to use and clean!
B000GEM3RI|5|We chose the Moonlight Slumber Supreme All-Foam mattress for our little boy when he was born June 2006.  Almost two years later, he still sleeps wonderfully (12 to 13 hours per night).  He loves being in his crib, and usually falls asleep almost instantly.  The mattress is still in perfect condition and is so easy to clean.  We are definitely going to get the same mattress for our little girl due in a couple of months.  Well worth the money!!
B007JIJOXU|5|Love this little bedroom set and so does my son!
B00IJNTI6M|5|Love these! Will be great in art projects and home decor.
B0039KHS2G|5|This is really similar to the NoseFrida, but from what I understand has a softer tip than that one. This one is like a firm silicone. Even so, my baby screams like a banshee and I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm sucking her brains out when I use it and has started to swat at it...I really hope I'm not sucking so hard that it feels like I'm sucking her brains out. Because that's gotta be freaky. But damn if the thing doesn't work crazy good. So I'll probably keep tormenting her when she's sick because I really like my babies being able to breathe. Oh, and it comes with a ton of filters. Like maybe way more than I'll ever use, but that's nice I guess.
B0054KHC5C|3|Not great.  These night lights promise to adjust to the light such that they go out during the day.  They didn't, and instead flickered on and off during daylight.  Worse, they're bright as the sun at night.  At this point, I much prefer the old school night lights I grew up with that have a simple switch.  If you're looking for a really bright light, this is fine.  But if you need something a little more subtle (as would, I suspect, any normal person), I might look elsewhere.
B000HIP38Y|2|As others have said, the beeping and delays between updates can become annoying, but that aside, the thermometer worked great...for about 7 months (daily use). About a week ago it just stopped working. I've tried shaking it out, new batteries...nothing is working. :( I guess it is time to break out the munchkin ducky tub that has the color changing 'hot' sensor in the bottom! My son likes that better than his hard plastic tub anyway and he's still too small for the big tub.
B004HKK5TK|4|I like this mattress and so does my baby. It is firm but not so firm that it feels like she's sleeping on a brick. I did have to air it out for a couple months after we ordered it because it STANK of chemicals when it arrived. That is probably true of any mattress though so just leave time to air it out if you can. It's great now though.
B000GE6S6A|5|Just bought Diaper Genie II 2 months ago and it's already clearly better than the one we were given 2 1/2 years ago when our daughter was born.  She's not interested in being potty trained yet and the other one smelled so bad we had to do something.  We had the Genie that twisted on the top with the lid closed (not the original that you twisted with the lid open).  When the lid on that one was open, sometimes it flipped the whole thing over, it was so heavy.  Version II is easy to open, easy to operate, easy to clean out, and doesn't smell anywhere near as bad as the one we had.  You get a little whiff if you don't get the diaper in fast, but getting it in fast is pretty easy to do.  The cutter works great on the II - I had to use scissors on the old system because the button cutter just didn't cut it (literally).  I wish there was an easier way to carry the unit and that it didn't open in the middle, but I'll take that over the old unit anyday.  Oh, and Borax really does help cut the smell in the container if there is some when the pooey diapers are taken out.  I wish I'd discovered that 2 1/2 years ago!
B007A6YDZU|5|My mom ordered this through me for her great granddaughter and she and my great neice were very happy with the purchase.
B008ESTNSA|5|works good
B004184QAW|5|Works great on my girls britax car seats!
B00JGF1EZK|5|Love all of the kiinde products and how easy they are to use. These are perfect so you can make your own baby food pouches and know exactly what's going in them.
B000MRK5OC|1|So...awfully...worthless! I loved the idea of the safe plastic but it leaks worse than those cheap valveless cups! Save your money for organic food instead!
B000SEPO8G|5|After three years of use, the handle on the caddy detached, but we still use it. This wasn't on my registry list, but a family member gave us one. I had no interest in a changing table or pad. The bed and floor seemed to me to be as fine a surface for changing my baby as a table or pad dedicated to that purpose would be. I was right, but would not have been so without this caddy. I had neglected to consider that a changing table also offered the convenience of having all the necessaries together in one place so that you can just get down to business. This caddy serves that purpose perfectly. The little changing pad is covered in plastic so that it can be wiped clean easily. We did find that the plastic began to separate at the seams after a while, so I simply used clear packing tape, and it was as good as new.<br /><br />The other benefit of this caddy over a table is that your baby won't outgrow it, provided he/she is potty-trained before kindergarten. Our son is a young three, but he's a pretty good size for his age. We're hoping to soon retire the caddy but will continue to appreciate it until that time comes.<br /><br />Just bought a caddy for my sister-in-law, and I bet she too will find it one of her most useful gifts.
B005ODV22S|5|I bought this one when my daughter was 1.5 years old. She is 3.5 now & still drinks formula! So I still have lots of bottles stores in this organizer. It makes the house looks much nicer & more organized! I highly recommend this item to everybody!  Update: My big daughter is now 5.5 years old & I've been using this bottle organizer for my younger one. She's 2 & still drinks formula as her 90% nutrition & she will cry if she doesn't have her bottle so i still can use this daily! It looks new just like many years ago!!
B000324Y7U|5|This product is a true life saver.  In the first few months I would take off the aquarium bar and just leave him in there vibrating away.  It completely soothed him.  Now...he loves both the aquarium bar and without it.  We started feeding him in the seet and often when I need to do things I just bring this where ever I need to be...put it on the floor and he is bouncing away.   <br /> <br />
B006ZOIT7Q|5|It is a Beautiful necklace. I had Great service! Not sure if it works however I will keep trying it though!
B0043C5XYY|5|Love these nursing pads. I haven't had much leakage but these seem to do the trick. They are super soft and can not be seen underneath your shirt bc they lay flat. Thinking about ordering the overnight pads next!
B0043SE83A|5|We are very happy with these.  The container is so cute and I could't imagine not having durable storage for the balls. We bought the one step ahead pop up pool and on rainy days I set that up in the house and throw in these balls. They do not crush.  Price isnt cheap but hard to find balls for cheap that arent totally cheap.
B0013F7GKI|5|Not sure if there was a change in the product since all the negative reviews back in 2008, but these work great for us.  They install into the Dekor easily, very little waste since you tie the knot in the bottom of the bag, and cut the top off when done.  If you use any kind of  biodegradable diapers, it makes sense to take the extra step and upgrade the bags too.
B006VJJPPK|3|These fit like the medela medium breast shield.  The silicone is thinner, which makes it stretchier and easier to get on.  Like the medela, the wings often flip up.  However, the notches are smaller than the medela, so whereas the medela shield avoids covering up my baby's nose, this flips right onto it.
B008O3OIXU|5|Very nice
B007C6EJQ6|3|Be careful when you are ordering that you notice if its switched from CRIB to PORTA. I didn't notice that when I chose plum, because that color was sold out in CRIB that it automatically switched to PORTA without me noticing. So it got delivered and it wasn't until then that I noticed it was the incorrect size. It should tell you that the size you want is sold out.  Anyways, the plum color is GORGEOUS and the quality seems very high, doesn't really have a smell, and I am going to wait until the plum is back in stock.
B0097GUCZ6|5|This hands free breastpump bra is essential for working moms, and the Simple Wishes bra is SO much better than the Medela Easy Easy Expressions Bustier.  The Simple Wishes bra is made of soft fabric but it's sturdy, and it is adjustable for size and more modest.  Finally, the zipper is high quality (unlike the zipper on the Medela Easy Expressions - which was constantly breaking and snagging after only intermittent use before I went back to work!) I highly recommend this product.
B00EHKCH78|3|We like the pockets and the price, however, this product is available at Walmart for a lower price. Additionally, it is a bit too small for my husband to feel comfortable using.
B004YGL65E|5|I bought for my daughter she love it.
B00AYZFFQU|5|Had a another version of the Carters loose leaf memory book for my older son, like it so much searched for another one for my youngest. Easy to use. Very cute and stylish
B001CAOYZ4|5|The small was just a little too small for our 14 lb baby. She is a squirmer and sometimes the liner would get a little bunched up inside and poo would leak to the outer edges of the diaper. I bought some in the large size and fold down a little edge and they are perfect. Better too big than too small!
B005DOS2EE|5|You can install this gate in 15 minutes or less. Plus it has a very classy look to it. Blends very well with leather and hardwood furniture. We love it. Very flexible. Great quality !!!!!!!!  Thanks for a super product !
B001KRM7ZI|5|perfect fit
B00BOHJRYI|5|Sondear fuel sticker for a baby room<br />Very nice use for decoration<br />Good quality<br />Richter on time<br />I recommend it
B0015H1D4E|4|This is such a neat idea - I have been carrying a thermos of milk and a container of cereal to school for years, and I finally stumbled upon this gem. I put the bottom portion in the fridge, and pour some milk in in the morning before I leave. I tried putting it in the freezer like the directions suggest, but then my milk was actually a little frozen by the time I got to school, so fridge it is. I haven't found the container to leak. It is a little annoying to have to put the top under the cereal container - otherwise you will get milk on the surface you are eating on, but I can deal with that. Sometimes I do get drops of milk on the table. My only complaint is that it is a little bit small - I like a big bowl of cereal, and also the ratio of milk to cereal is a bit off for my tastes, but other people may like less milk in their cereal.
B002ACOY2Q|4|Great, but wish it would have come with the hook like they do in the stores. Otherwise it is perfect for what we need. Training a 20 month old.
B000LL1624|4|I have an active 18 month old who usually sleeps in a pack and play with a playyard crib tent on top when we travel, mostly to visit relatives.   I bought the Peapod plus in the hopes of a quicker and easier set up, and less bulk when packed up in the trunk. I think I will like it,  though I may have to do a little tweaking.    What I like:    THE SHADES - looks like it will block a lot of light which helps them block out the world in new and exciting places, so they can get their rest.  As for the ventilation concern, you can roll up the shades,so I don't think it would be a problem unless you were in extreme heat, or had a newborn (can't regulate their temperature well yet.)    FOLDING- I love how small and light it is, but I was a little worried about getting it folded up again since I had a hard time with similar \\"pop up\\" baby products in the past.  After I looked carefully at how it was folded up and looked carefully at the pictures I was able to do it after only a few tries.  SIZE - My average size \\"almost 5 year old\\" daughter could sleep in it comfortably, so I hope to get a few years of use out of this.    My concerns, or things that could be improved:  ZIPPERS - They are \\"double zippers\\"  -you can open it from the inside, which means my girl WILL open it - guaranteed!  I will probably put a safety pin under the zipper from the outside. I need to know she is safe whether the place we are staying is toddler-proof or not.  MATTRESS - I wish they would make it with a self-inflating mattress but it doesn't look like the inflating will be difficult.  SLEEPING PAD/BAG-This is the biggest problem I have with this bed. The pad/sleeping bag doesn't attach to the bottom of the tent.  If you have no problem laying your baby down in a pack and play without a sheet, you may not care.  I just hate the noisy, cold, uncomfortable vinyl, and I don't think my kids sleep as well either.  I know the sleeping bag will get all bunched up, drool all over the vinyl, scratchy noiseswaking me up in the night, if not them, as they move around in their sleep.....  some reviewers have added velcro... maybe I will try that.  But it seems like the manufacturers should have done something (snaps, a zipper, velcro).  Others reviewers just put the mattress inside the tent (instead of in the zippered pocket).  If you do that, then you can put a crib sheet on it. But then the bed is less stable, more easily tipped by an active child...  i will have to do something but I am not sure what yet.    Overall, a good purchase, if I can figure out the sleeping bag issue.
B00B49IQPM|3|I got this playpen upon the assumption that it had panels with toys for my daughter. It really only has one panel with two spinning balls and a play phone.<br /><br />My 1yr old has started to peel the Teddy bear stickers off within a week.<br /><br />If I could go back I would buy the cheaper Safety 1st playpen.
B00AWLZFTS|5|They are cute and practical and thought my toddler would find them interesting. ... They are also dishwasher safe... Which is mandatory!
B001QC77W0|5|We have used this while traveling (it is compact and fits in our luggage) and while in town. We started using it with our 7 month old and it has fit many types of chairs. The only thing we have come across is with some table/chair combinations her head isn't quite above the table yet. But I know it will be soon!
B0051POJC4|5|My 9 month old daughter loves playing with this little phone.  It has music and all kinds of cute noises that grab her attention.  If she loves it, then I love it.  Would buy again.
B0016L5ALG|1|I placed the order and realized that I should try and get a lesser angle.  I was able to contact someone (the owner and inventor)pretty quickly to change the order to the 15' before it went out.  I ended up getting the 30' after all even though I was told the change would be made.  Now no one is returning my calls or emails.  It's so weird.  I can't even rate this because I haven't had a chance to try it.  I am close to reporting this company.  Frustrated.
B00TR6P8X2|5|This diaper bag is a great size and as a cloth diapering mom of a almost 2 year and a 4 year I pack alot of things in my bag when we are on the go. There are alot of pockets in this bag and I love that and I love to stay organized in my bag to make it easy to find things. Here are some of the pocket options. This is the front zipper pocket that is convenient love to keep my lipsticks and chapsticks in there as well as loose change. Lots of pockets and room on the inside for anything you can think of. If you couldn't already be organized with this bag it comes with a thin changing pad which i wish was a little bit more plush to match this bag. It also comes with a wet pouch and accessories pouch. You can also  carry this bag 2 ways either by the 2 handles or by the strap. It is a good value for this bag and would make a great shower gift.<br /><br />I received this for review purposes but my opinions are honest.
B000KL2FMK|4|I bought this to match our crib and baby changer, and although we didn't need this bookcase for a year or more, it really completes the room.
B00007B76C|1|My 3 month old slid down between the bumpers the first night I used it...I almost had a heart attack when I saw her in the morning. This could be very dangerous...babies can suffocate.
B004VL2VS8|4|After reading the reviews I was worried when I purchased it but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is fantastic, night vision works just fine and I love the fact that the camera tilts down very far so we can set it on the shelf on the wall pointing down and have a picture of the whole bed instead of just a small side view. I also like that the handheld parent unit is small so I can clip it on my belt and walk around the house. The range of the monitor is fantastic and NO interference or static sounds.<br /><br />There are a few things I dislike about the monitor. First of all, sound stage 1 is still fairly loud so I have to turn off the monitor when my older daughter wakes up in the morning because otherwise she wakes up the baby who sleeps in our room.<br />The other thing that bothers me is that I can barely  see anything in twilight since it's too bright for night vision and too dark to see.<br />The battery life of the parent unit isn't the greatest. It only lasts a few hours max.<br /><br />The two way communication is a great feature even tho it scares my two year old but I think she will get used to it eventually.<br /><br />All in all I think it's a very good monitor for the price
B009W8XW0G|4|Fits our SUV perfectly!  Comes as a two pack which was a nice surprise.  It is saving the back of our seat from our two year olds dirty shoes.  Well worth the money.
B003TY6620|5|Great for my grandchildren.  They can hold and eat very good with these utensils.
B00404E3VE|3|These are handy to have but they are not the best quality.  They are soft though and our grandson likes to rub them on his face when he is tired (very cute).
B00BQEGVMU|5|For my friends little buddy. Just good.
B004S28R92|3|I really like this set, except for the fact that they are not microwave safe.  I make oatmeal for my daughter using the microwave every morning and I intended to use the bowl for this purpose.<br />Besides that I really like these items, in fact I just ordered more of the cups.
B001P24VAM|4|We read tons of reviews about many different cribs and went with this one due to the great reviews here and the fact that it is a convertible crib. It's super sturdy and wasn't very difficult to assemble at all. The only drawback, and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that it's actually off-white, not a stark white (despite the picture making it look stark white). So, they need to take better pictures to represent this, as it is not the same color as the picture. It doesn't look bad at all, and really isn't that noticeable, but my wife was not pleased at first. Otherwise, great product at a great price.
B0011URFRE|3|My nephews head is constantly falling forward. It has the option to tilt the seat, but I think it barely tilts half inch. It's not noticeable. I wish I would have bought another seat, he doesn't sleep comfortably with me pushing his head back every 2 minutes.
B008KG5R6I|2|After a while the volume button stops working and the projection motor is LOUD!!!
B00FRA45E0|3|Only improvement I can suggest is that it zips up. I'm going to get a zipper put in my bag as the button doesn't prevent things falling out.
B00OLL6SU0|3|Too slim for my liking. Pretty much just rubber case around the phone. If you don't want any protection but want a case this is it for you.
B0031ES8Y2|5|This bunny has become my baby's woobie.  It was originally given to us as a gift, and I'm trying to order a replacement.  Unfortunately, it's out of stock on Amazon.com, so I'm going to have to go either to Bunnies by the Bay or somewhere else with no free shipping.  That sucks.  But this bunny is awesome.  My kid likes the \\"terry cloth\\" feet, hands and ears.  They call it shearing material, but it's basically terrycloth.   I'm ordering extras because this bunny is such a fixture in our house!
B00GD0YFWU|5|I don't usually write reviews but I love this cup so much I had to. After searching for a glass or stainless steel cup for my daughter for her milk (I use the Safe Sippy 2 for her water) and not being satisfied I finally got this one and it's awesome!  I love that it is glass but covered so I don't have to worry about it breaking (the glass is tempered so it shouldn't break anyway). The straw parts are silicone not hard plastic, which makes them safer and easier to clean. Also the straw has a valve so that means no spills. My daughter can turn and upside down and shake it and nothing comes out and it doesn't leak out on it's own. The glass part is big enough to fit a rag or bottle brush in to clean so you can use it for other beverages beside water without worrying about it getting icky, and since it is glass it doesn't impart flavors. This cup is a great buy and totally worth the money!
B007UYBOK4|5|My baby love it, it is very comfortable and easy to use. I recommend this product for moms who look cost vs. benefit
B002UDGVZS|3|So I will start with the fact that I have purchased 4 different monitors :<br />1) 2.4GHz DIGITAL WIRELESS BABY VIDEO MONITOR SYSTEM WITH NIGHT VISION -- 2.4\\" Color LCD Screen (Two-way Radio communication) by Smart AV ,<br />2) MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM,<br />3) SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\\" LCD,<br />4) SUMMER BABY TOUCH COLOR VIDEO MONITOR by Summer infant.<br /> I have a 3yr. old and I was still using my Sony baby call monitor which I still love, but now I need to see when she gets out of her bed and I wanted the two way feature \\"talk to the baby feature\\" so I could talk to her and tell her to get back in her bed. I should also say that I want to see as much of her room around her bed as I could her room is 11 ft. by 12ft I put the camera in the corner on a shelf six feet off the ground about 10 and ½ ft away from her bed, so if she got out of her bed I could see where she was. I could also see her during the day playing in her room. Well, let me say that they at least now don't make a monitor with a \\"clear\\" picture.<br /><br />So I bought the 2.4 GHz MONITOR by SMART AV: It was good I could see her ok during the day, and at night with the night vision and I could hear her and she could hear me when I talked on it.<br />CONS: Not the best picture but it was good enough. The camera did not adjust down far enough I had to put a coaster under the back half to get it to angle down some more. The big problem was it did not have the rechargeable batteries the other reviewers said it had. (Amazon told me it was probably because they bought it from a different seller not DBroth.) You can put regular batteries in it but if you want to plug it in you have to remove the batteries first. I tried to purchase the rechargeable batteries from them it has been a week and a half they still have not answered my emails. I returned it. Update: I never received a response.<br /><br />Next up the MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM: it had a ok picture during the day a little grainy but you could see. Night vision was grainy but ok. CONS: grainy day and night vision, when you touch the talk button to speak to the child it did not always work I would have to let it go and press it again to get it to work. I had it replaced with a new one thinking it might have been that one and the new one did the same thing. I called Amazon and they said they are not selling these directly anymore because of that happening to the batch of these they had maybe a bad batch they are investigating it, but you can still buy it from third party sellers on Amazon. UPDATE: Amazon is now selling them again.<br /><br />Next up, was the SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\\" LCD: this one had the best picture of them all but only for during the day (although it had a yellow glow at the top of the screen from the light in the room but the light was not in the cameras view I adjusted the camera down even further and it still remained. It has a nice night light and music that you can turn on and off from the monitor. I really, really wanted to like it.<br />CONS: The camera did not adjust down far enough for me, so I put a coaster under the back half to angle it down some more, There were also some \\"delays\\" (like when walking or just moving fast the screen would \\"miss some frames/some of the movement\\" in the picture.) The temperature gauge was not correct, the alarm for detection of sound in the room  was a pain to adjust, the zoom function was a BIG pain you have to go into the menu out of the \\"picture screen\\" and put it on zoom then go back to the \\"picture screen\\", the volume was not very loud at all my husband was like it doesn`t turn up louder than that?  The \\"talk to the baby\\" function was \\"choppy\\"(not as clear as the summer infant baby touch) and my absolute deal breaker was, I would think the MAIN REASON you would purchase a monitor like this the night vision: at night with and without a night light on in theroom I could barely see anything much less my daughter in her bed you would really have to stare and look good to make any thing out, the infrared led's must not be strong at all. (If you want it for close up it might work I don't know never tested close up tested all of them in the same place about 10 and 1/2 feet away from her bed up on a shelf I need to see at least part of the room around her bed.)<br /><br />I was so aggravated by this search, I printed out a twenty percent off coupon from the internet for Babies R Us and went and bought the SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR,  the new one they have with the touch screen monitor and pan and zoom camera. I put it to the test compared it to the SAMSUNG and MOBI. My two most important things were the night vision to see her at night and the \\"talk to the baby\\" function so I could talk to her. This summer infant model has a secure private connection unlike the other summer infant monitors. Its picture is ok (not HD but none of them are) slightly, slightly, slightly grainy during the day but still really good, and its night vision although a little grainy was the best out of all of them for the distance, (again I did not test close up) plus I can move the camera around remotely from the monitor to see where she's at in the room and I can zoom in easily the functions appear below and to the right of the picture when you touch the screen although the closer you zoom in the grainier it got but that was with ALL of the models I tested.<br /><br />AFTER A LOT OF TESTING AND DEBATE, I RETURNED THEM ALL EXCEPT FOR THE SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR. I really like it. I am glad I just went ahead and spent a little more money and bought it. The pan and zoom features work great. (THIS IS THE ONLY MONITOR OUT OF THE ONES I TESTED THAT HAS THE ACTUAL PAN FEATURE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE CAMERA AROUND THE ROOM REMOTELY FROM THE CONTROLS ON THE MONITOR. The Samsung does not have the pan feature.) I can see her WHOLE room day or night. After a certain amount of time it goes into power save mode when it is not on the charger and turns off the picture but you can still hear the sound and if you want to see the picture again just press the button on the top. If it is on the charger the picture will stay on unless you press the button on the top to turn the screen back off. The monitor has a lithium-ion battery and the camera has the option to put regular batteries in it if you can not plug it in a outlet. The monitor also has a belt clip that doubles as the stand for it when the monitor is not on the charger. I called summer infant to ask about recommendations for the rechargeable battery for the monitor the company says not to charge the battery more than eight hours and let it run down before you put it back on the charger for maximum battery life.<br /><br />UPDATE: IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS WITH MY SUMMER INFANT.I have since purchased a second extra camera so I can watch her in the play room too I love it.<br /><br />I STILL USE IT EVERYNIGHT. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AT ALL. I THINK I SHOULD JUST MENTION. I ALSO HAVE NOT DROPPED OR POSSIBLY DAMAGED MINE IN ANYWAY.
B00EBCEP6I|5|Great Fabric, great fit, great quality. Love it, especially when you mix it with pink. You're gonna love it too.
B0064551VI|5|awesome, baby likes wearing it in the pool. it fits snugly, and looks totally cute. the inside is lined with mesh, and all seams are soft.
B001WAJVZM|3|I agree with the many reviews that indicate this product does not work without the shower diverter.  It slides off with absolutely no effort.  Since my daughter is only 1 and loves to pull up on things, I personally can't use this on my shower at this time in fear that she will pull it off, slip, and hit her head - so instead of being something to make bathtime safe, it would essentially make it less safe than just leaving the faucet exposed.  I wish that I would have read these reviews earlier or that the product specified that there was a need for a diverter, but that is not really the company's fault.<br /><br />Regardless of it's uselessness for my shower, it is a very high quality, durable material and very cute.  My daughter now just uses it as a bath toy!  I live in a rental house with an outdated bathroom from the 50's, and if I happen to move before she is old enough to not need this then I'm sure it will come in handy for it's intended purpose; but for now she can just be happy to have another toy at bathtime!
B0002FQUEI|5|i love these bottles -- you cannot imagine what a relief it is to find bottles that actually work as they are supposed to -- the milk flow is always good, they do not leak, the nipples are just right, the cap can only be screwed in one way, bottle is ergonimically designed so that it is easy for the baby to hold ... what more can i say!! after all the frustrations with other bottles, i'm glad i followed a friend's advice and gave these bottles a try. they are the best!! thank you gerber! <br />
B004BDNKEU|5|I was given one of these when my son was born,but sold it when he grew out of it.It was a no brainer to purchase one again when my daughter was born. I bought a cheaper one trying to save money,but returned it and realized this shopping cart cover was the way to go. It is sturdy,easy to put in the cart and covers all the parts of the cart that your child can get to. It is also a very cute pattern. Worth the money for sure!
B008U5PL8I|5|Our 6 month old baby was getting her legs caught between the crib bars with a traditional height crib bumper. The full coverage crib shield was fairly easy to install and fit our crib very well.  I have had it on the crib for about a month and have been very happy with it.  No more waking up at night to a screaming caught baby!  The directions say that it needs to be installed on a crib with the mattress set to the lowest level, but we were able to make it work with the mattress set high.  It fits very secure.
B000NWWOYU|5|My daughter has used this since she returned home from the hospital with her daughter. It has worked beautifully. The baby sleeps very well in it. And helps keep her in position.
B008G4LKJ2|5|Exceeded my expectations. My 3 yr old loves it and looks forward to the rain. It a bit long but it doesn't matter because he still growing. Highly recommend it.
B000HZFL0M|3|Very beautiful and comfortable looking. Does not bounce unless you do it manually (it vibrates).  Not easy to move around.  You naturally reach for the top and the awning falls right off. I got it as a gift but would not purchase it myself.
B000WJPCFW|5|My daughter loves this! We started using it around 4 months (when her back and neck got nice and strong) and now at six months she still loves it and uses it every day. She plays happily in it while I am getting ready in the morning and when I am working in the kitchen in the evening. It gives her the opportunity to be upright and see what's going on, but have a good way to entertain herself as well. The older she gets the more she enjoys it because she can do more of the activities herself instead of needing me to show her how. I shopped around a lot and this is the best one I saw. Some of the activity centers really don't have much on the tray for the kids to do, play with, or learn. This one is really great. Oh and for some reason my daughter loves the alligator puppet. She will sit and kiss and talk to it forever.
B008EF1R7I|4|Purchased this for use at daycare. The pillow stuffing is uneven and uncomfortable. The blanket part is cute and comfortable.
B00171WXII|5|These should be given to all parents at the hospital instead of those icky bulb aspiratiors. I swear by this thing. It is truly amazing and has help my children breathe easy during cold season.
B004LEE70K|5|This is exactly what I wanted! I am in love with it. It's good quality and is described perfectly.
B002V87MJQ|5|It worked great for us! Easy to set and safe, It is a solution for our living room, so my boy don't get to the kitchen or dining area.<br />I would recommend this to my friends or anybody!
B00E280NIK|5|Awesome product
B00KLKS5CO|4|I read some poor reviews about this product but for that price decided to take my chances. I have to admit I'm very happy with it. It is a bit big but then again, I expected that from previous reviews so wasn't disappointed. I only needed it for a newborn photo shoot (not sure what other uses it's good for) and it's very easy to just tuck in and make look nice.
B005BSXFEY|5|Great product, on time delivery
B00FFJ27ZC|5|Very reasonable high quality
B00DJP12YQ|5|Very good stroller
B00QC28CH8|4|I bought two different bags online not knowing which one I would like.  I ended up picking this one.  I LOVE it!!!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It is very lightweight, can be worn over my shoulder, medium sized & is cute.  My youngest just turned 2 and I needed to phase out of a bigger diaper bag. This fits plenty in it still but isn't too bulky for outings.  I also like that it has the 4 metal circles on the bottom so the bottom of the bag doesn't get ruined.<br /><br />Love also that is has a place on the side for my water bottle (or a sippy cup!)
B004L0VUAO|3|We recently purchased a home with a pool and were looking for some fun toys. The cards arrived and are fun and easy to use. However, the other reviews I read were correct. Within a week three cards had split. I have 2.5 year old and 5 month old. My 5 month old was chewing on them (he does not have teeth) so I am not sure if that had anything to do with the plastic covering separating from the foam, but it makes me wonder how long they will hold up in the water - we have yet to try them in the pool or bath tub. I would not buy them again.
B001GHZ2L8|4|These switch-extensions work VERY well. They came with the requisite screws to attach over your existing switch-plate. It took no more than two minutes to install. The glow-in-the-dark feature is great for the little ones.
B00DJVEIAA|5|Easy stick ons for your shirt when taking pictures.  Can be reused.  Stickers from week 12 to week forty.  They are great
B000H1MRJO|5|I bought this cot primarily for my son (2 at the time) to use at sleepovers at his Auntie's, and for my nephew (just under 2) to sleep over here.  Both of them LOVED it.  I loved how easily it sets up and folds away... I have to honestly say I was blown away by that aspect after wrestling with so many pack-n-plays over the last 8 nieces and nephews.  It also folds up really small and is easy to tuck into a closet or under a bed.<br /><br />We recently started camping, and the cot has turned into a MAJOR DEAL.  He loves sleeping on it, and wants to continue sleeping on it even after we return home.<br /><br />That aside, the \\"sheet\\" is \\"sheet,\\" if you catch my drift.  It is scratchier than the cot surface.  I threw it away immediately.  We usually use a child's sleeping bag or a normal crib sheet on it.
B00NFY534Q|5|Great product. Highly recommended.
B00CXVI4M0|1|For the life of me I couldn't get this product to work. I REALLY was excited about it as it seemed promising...Firstly you need to pry the rubber seal at the bottom of the window out as you're supposed to install the bottom clips between the glass and the rubber seal. I tried to trust the installation (which to me seemed like it would just damage the rubber seal) but the bottom just would not stay in place. Awful design....do not waste your money.
B003554H9M|1|We made the mistake of taking this gate check bag on a trip before testing it first and the back wheels of our stroller would not fit inside of the bag!  It says that it will fit large-size standard and double strollers but the bag is too narrow for strollers like ours with wider wheels.  Be sure to measure your stroller including the wheels first!!
B000AV5LZ8|5|My 2 year old LOVES this!  It's easy to climb up and is the right size to make sure she doesn't fall into the toilet.  It has REALLY helped move along the potty training and is better than the little plastic potties.  She used those, but this makes her feel more like a &#34;big girl&#34; and seems to make her want to use it, rather than us having to push the little plastic pot.
B004SNMK62|5|My grandson loves this.....goes well with the raceing décor in his bedroom!
B007UYBOKY|3|First, very disappointed it does not come with clips that hook into car. The seatbelt is the ONLY  safety belt<br />It also does not come with a drink box holder, critical for young kids on a trip.
B000056OV0|5|I was looking for a big bath tub but couldn't find it anywhere then I found this one on Amazon and try it. I like it very much. Got more room for my baby, he seems to enjoy it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for big bath tub. Not to mention that I will use it for the next baby.
B00970CC6E|1|Fan stopped working after 1 week. Not satisfied at all. I only have 1 star because you can't choose no stars.
B000YFR9SC|5|Great seat.  Easy to clean and stays in place.  My child loves it.
B00CXVMHLY|5|I can through it right in the wash and it comes out looking brand new!  It also came with a carrier pouch that is small enough to fit easily into a diaper bag or handbag!<br /><br />LOVE IT!
B00KWP0KU8|5|I've been searching for a car seat mat to protect our leather seats from the heavy weight and food crumbs of my toddler's Britax seat. Other mats made it difficult to use the latch system due to being too thick, didn't fit our seats well, or didn't seem like good quality for the price. This protecter met and exceeded all of those needs.<br />*It is thin, but sturdy and quality feeling fabrics.<br />*Has well placed openings for the car seat latch system.<br />*Perfectly fits beneath the Britax on the seats in our 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe.<br />*I love the tougher material hanging out on the sides since my toddler has discovered the joy of climbing into his seat so now he steps on the mat instead of the seat.<br />*The mesh pocket at the bottom is great for hiding snacks. Although my toddler can't reach them, it's nice to keep them tidy and out of the way.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this product and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends or buy another for future car seats.<br /><br />Also, as an unrelated bonus, the company sent a cute child's ebook to our email account!
B002ANO4NO|5|I purchased these for my son's nursery because I wanted something neutral to go along with my \\"animal\\" theme. These are so cute and work well with the Carter's Monkey Bar's Wall Art. My son loves looking at all the adorable animals on his nursery walls.
B003NWPOGW|1|I've had my G-lite for around 2 1/2 years and I love/hate it.  I think it has some wonderful things going for it, but also some truly horrible things.    positives:    -can stand up on it's own -- wonderful if you live in a small space  -is wonderfully light, so you can carry it if your child wants to walk & then gets tired  -is really easy to push and handles better then some of the other strollers, I've used  -is comfortable, according to my son    negatives:  -after a while, at least with mine the seat gets caught in the frame when you close it (you might not notice the first couple of times) and it tears and then it is ruined!  You can't do anything to fix it because it is plastic (yes, I called Uppababy about it, but they couldn't help me because I didn't have the receipt -- I have moved it was just gone -- also, it was probably out of the 1 year warranty)  --Uppababy doesn't just sell the seat part separately so that I can replace it (even though the rest of the stroller works perfectly) so now I'm out a stroller.  I'm on to Maclarean at this point -- even though I love this stroller and so does my son, not going to spend more money on another one :(  -the sunshade is just too small - in order to protect your child from the sun you need to buy an extra sunshade.
B00003TL7P|5|My husband and I bought the Diaper Champ and have not had a problem with it. I use scented trash bags I get at the dollar store and it really only smells when you are changing the bag. My only complaint is that it is sooo easy to use that my less than a year old son started to throw away clothes and toys in the Diaper Champ. I didn't know until I emptied it and by then most of the stuff I found was so gross from sitting in the bag that it was garbage too. I still think that this might be the reason I still haven't found some of his missing toys. I still think it is a wonderful product, I just think it should be removed out of reach for a child who understands how to use it.
B002L800G8|4|Baby sleeps great when using this. Has a very low  quality zipper that comes apart at the top.
B00CI53502|5|Perfect shape for my baby's mouth and great case for brining along when we go out and need to bring her food along.
B006WHR6CU|5|I skimmed through a few of the 1star rating for this product and let me tell you that some folks are sippy cup challenged.<br /><br />I bought these munchkin sippy cups in a 2pack back when my son was 6mons old, today he is shy of 2yrs old and he absolutely still  loves this cup. In case you are a new parent like I was when browsing for the correct sippy cup understand this, if you are looking for spill proof sippy cup, that you can hear &#34;click&#34; when it's on correct, fits on the side of the diaper bag, in my car cup holder and super comfortable in the hands of my kid then wait no longer and order. Like any other plastic product used to drink liquids and/or hold any type of food for old or young you will have to:<br />TAKE TIME to unassemble,<br />THOROUGHLY SCRUB with warm soapy water, (I use a tiny baby toothbrush to get in all crevasses and cavities),<br />DRY PROPERLY to avoid mold and weird smells, and lastly,<br />ASSEMBLE product to fill with your toddlers favorite drink. This goes for any container you put up to your mouth so, if some people complain that it's to hard this or to complicated that on this particular product then they are lazy. there are only 2 pieces you can take apart on this cup and that the top dome and the rubber spout area. It's spill proof all right, but your gonna find yourself using some thumb power to remove and replace spout- that's it, seriously.<br /> TIP* if drink isn't flowing properly after watching your kid suck on sippy cup for 10sec then take the tip of a sharp knife and make the opening wider. I used an exacto knife to tweak flow on my sons' sippy cup. EZ peasy.
B00N0WW0NU|5|This is a wonderful thing that each Baby needs to have. This gives the baby a comfortable sleep.
B000XPS93W|2|This did fit my play yard perfectly, but it tore in two places the first time I washed it.  I machine washed it once (as I wanted to wash it before use) according to the directions and tumble dried it on low as stated.  Very poor quality.
B000058DN9|3|They were not soft spout.
B0083TTLG4|5|Awesome stuff! These are genuine avent bottles at a great price!
B001MRYHHM|4|This item really helped our child sleep through the night. It was easy to install and it is very easy to clean.
B004V903RG|5|WIth my first daughter 3.5 yrs ago we tried a box of medela bags but they don't freeze flat and I have a FreeStyle so can't pump into the bag anyway.  I then used Lansinoh bags the rest of the time with her, it was great to freeze flat but sometimes a milk shingle would fall or the corner get hit and the bag would leak.  Started using some Lansinoh bags again with daughter 2 then found these and my husband likes these bags much better, haven't had a leaker yet and I have about 1300oz frozen at this moment that we are rotating/drawing from as she approaches 12mo.<br /><br />Would highly recommend.
B00GUN3Z1W|1|Not strong enough to hold my 10# puppy!
B00OOLW1P8|5|Just what I needed for a great price
B0018775IE|5|We ordered these for our son's nursery.  They were very easy to put up and have stayed up without falling or peeling for the 6 months they have been there so far.  I was able to move them easily and they did not leave any marks on the wall.  Nice product; cute design!
B0002JETOW|4|Well built product, clips work great and it's very stable - doesn't come undone, doesn't wiggle around if you use the included hooks.  It is not, however, built out of particularly dense wood and if you have a 40 lb Wheaten Terrierist like we do, be aware that they can and sometimes will chew a hole straight through the wood in order to be able to great you when you walk in the door.
B00D73A9EO|5|This is the most beautiful gift we've ever received for our new born baby boy. And yet it is very practical. Our baby boy can sleep in it for hours while we can easily take him out with the wrap on.
B004BJ0SNA|1|I bought this because my 10 months old are starting to open up cabinet doors and drawers. I tried using this to keep them closed but it has failed on me. I even tried putting them on differently thinking maybe I just did them wrong. But nope. Nothing worked. I got so frustrated that I wanted to just throw them away.<br /><br />First, it was very hard to get it to close tightly so the doors don't open up. Even after I have almost broke my fingers off trying to close it to as tightly as possible. The doors would still open up. That was no good because my daughter can end up closing the doors on her fingers and hurt herself. Aside from that, it was VERY hard to open/close this. To pull it close was kind of easy but to open them back up was hard. There is a small button on the side to press and at the same time, you have to push the little button up in order to release and allow you to pull it open.<br /><br />I don't have fat fingers. I actually have tiny hands and I found that to be very hard to do. It's a positive thing because that means LO won't be able to open up the lock herself. But, it was PAINFUL for me to open it. When I was trying to lock up the doors it was so hard for me.<br /><br />I tried any possible ways to do it so that it wouldn't be hard and close the doors tightly. Nothing worked.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I might give these a try in the future maybe...But for now they're just stored away. Eventually it might even become garbage.
B007VBYVVA|5|Cloth Diapers are hard to find for a good price. We needed a large quantity to take for ministry in Africa. Perfect find!
B00BI2VW6K|5|After trying different products, this one was recommended by our pediatrician.<br />Our baby is sleeping and feeling much better. Wish we would of discovered sooner.<br />Will order another one once we run out.
B00LD8ZD0K|5|great books...my granddaughter loves these.  I am going to purchase another set for my house.
B005XP3TGE|5|So helpful, why this wasn't invented ages ago I'll never know. perfect helping hands for getting baby in and out of any car seat. love them.
B00005QIZX|5|I love this item, my daughter actually waits for the celestial show to appear at night. It has a few drawbacks though like any product. I have the weird clicking noise too \\"at times\\" that someone else described. The ceiling projection could last longer too, only about 10 minutes. You can resoothe the baby from the main monitor though so it is really not a problem. Great item for a new baby!
B00KGVEZTK|4|Next time I will pay more attention.  How it is advertised.  I'm thinking there were 2 seat protectors and there is only one in the box.  What a let down.  I do like the product.  For the price it should have been 2 in the box.
B008BN9HXY|5|A great product for potty training, as well as overnights for the times your child might need extra assurance that they wont wett he bed.
B003II51OQ|3|ok
B00020L78M|5|I love this play yard! My son started a kind of \\"army crawl\\" at 5 months and he was getting into everything. This play yard is large enough for him to crawl around and play in, although I may have to buy the extension when he gets a little bigger. He will probably figure out how to move it around when he gets bigger, but I think you'll find that issue with any play yard that isn't anchored in some way. It's very sturdy. The only downside is that it's pretty difficult to open any side of it. I just reach down and lift my son out, or step into it myself when I need to reach something inside of it. I don't mind it, but it might be an issue for some. The good thing about there not being an easy-open gate, the baby won't figure out how to open it! Overall, very satisfied. It's been a lifesaver and my baby is much happier now that he his a big safe space to play in.
B00KDCCKEE|5|Item worked just described, holds sippy cups in place and easy for child to get it out or put it in
B005PK1D7E|4|I can see how it would work in most cars but it didn't in mine because it is just too big for my 2011 BMW X3.  It hits the gear shift.
B002WN2ASI|5|I always thought buying these was a waste of money. BUT my nephew has one and when we were over for dinner my daughter (5.5 months) would not put his down.. she was so intrigued.. I bought this because of the options.. so many contrasts, peak a boos.. and texture.. This is phenomenal.
B0043D28BY|5|Thanks
B00DQL6CIE|5|Handy container to store the wipes.  I actually keep them in the kitchen at my office to wipe my fingers and hands when making lunch or use for a quick wipe up.  Love it that it fits in small spaces.
B006YPTWHC|5|These bottles were the only ones that my daughter would take when her dad was in charge of a feeding. They are a perfect shape for my exclusively breastfed daughter. She took to them right away and the flow was just right.
B002QYW8LW|5|my daughter loves this. It is a great teething toy & the perfect size for tiny hands!
B00821FLSU|5|WAY better than all of the other plastic models for a more stylish, sophisticated look in the nursery. I love the locking function, and the fact that you can use any bag you want is a huge bonus. Thank goodness for Ubbi!
B001190D5Q|4|I've been using this Butt-Paste for a while.  Due to many operations of my digestive track I pass some stomach acid and find this paste helps.
B002Q82XXG|5|Easy to carry, plastic has no taste,This travel bowl love is popular, the recommendation of a friend bought this,Easy to carry
B002FKAMLA|5|We bought this because we had a hardwood floor and wanted something for our daughter to crawl on. She loves it! We have since moved and have carpeting and she still loves to play with it. You can put the individual tiles together to form boxes and the material they are made out of has stood up to our puppy chewing on it a bit as well as our teething little one! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B001QXCF0I|5|Perfect item just what I needed great buy!!!!
B002RXM9M0|3|Wouldn't suggest for small kids......the clips are everywhere and the stuffed animals are too.....clips could be a little stronger.
B001OW6K2A|5|We bought this bed for our 2 year old daughter. She loves it. It's very cute and a nice shade of white. It shipped quickly and my husband had no problems putting it together. It really helped with her transition from the crib to the bed.
B004DC9TAS|5|My husband & I haven't had a chance to use this stroller since our baby isn't due until November, but so far, it seems perfect for us! The handling is amazing!!! Can't wait to get all of the use out of it that friends of mine have gotten out of their BOBs!!!
B00MBCKAUK|5|These fit perfectly! We've bought several other different brand crib sheets that didn't fit, but these are perfect! Every after washing (cold water).
B00LIX3AW8|4|Fits a lot of toys. Very cute.
B00BF1STME|4|Very nice.
B0035ER5A6|4|I have a similar bag and I love it.  I actually hang the little hooks on the laundry hamper and as I take off his little socks I put them in the bag so I don't have to worry about sorting them out later.  It really keeps the socks from getting lost.
B00JBYNNB4|5|Great way to persuade your toddler to use the potty more regularly.
B00I4Y7J3K|5|This is a very good quality car/booster seat and my son loves it! It has great detail, sturdy and functional design, and the best part for me, is that the harness can be removed when he no longer needs it.  There is a clever hidden seat belt feeder that allows for the seat belt to be incorporated comfortably and safely when the time comes. I am thrilled that I will not have to buy yet another seat when my son only needs a booster. Great product, would recommend highly to anyone looking!
B005JWDEE8|1|ORDERED THIS IN BLUE AS A GIFT, AND WHEN IT CAME IT WAS WHITE. THE EXPLANATION WAS WE NO LONGER HAVE IT IN BLUE. SO WE SENT YOU ONE IN WHITE.
B00792KRAA|3|Does what is it is supposed to.  It keeps the water out of my little ones eyes when in the tub.
B00004TFLB|5|I was very please with how fast I received my order.  It was also in very  good condition.  Overall, I was happy and would order from them again.
B00NFETGMQ|5|It feels cheap but it works really well. It might be lighter-weight than you might expect<br />Baby loved in instantly.<br /><br />We wanted to use this because baby was spitting up and sounding wet when lying down flat.<br />I don't think the straps are necessary because baby will go in a crib before she is mobile enough to come out of it.  It is deep enough that there is no worry.<br />It is reinforced under the baby's back and head with rigid plastic. This is a good thing (I have seen other products that don't do this and it pushes the chin toward the chest).<br />You get good at rocking it with your great toe!<br />I'd say about 3-4 months is when we moved our baby from this to a crib.
B00J942T52|5|I purchased this for my four & Half year son. I have midsize suv & getting in & out of the car on his own was difficult for him. Also, on the long road trips, his legs were hanging without proper support. This foot rest solved both the problems. I am glad I bought this . Now, my son can easily sit in his car seat & get down on his own without any issues & keep his feet well rested on long drives.
B00B4DCZXM|5|My son loves them! He's a month old and wouldnt take the one that was given at the hospital. Received one as a gift at the baby shower... That was it! I just had to order a few more. Love that it comes with a sterilization case... Awesome!
B00171WXII|5|This thing is awesome. Works so much better than the nasal bulb. Used it on my 13 week old daughter who had a cold and was clearly able to help alleviate some of her nasal congestion.
B0091E31KM|5|We slept ONLY because of this machine. We bought two just to have a back up.
B002F9MV88|5|My son has had a major problem with spitting up since day one. All the bibs I had previously been using were not waterproof at all! They were just a layer of terry cloth and usually after just spitting up once the entire bib was soaked completely through and his clothes were soaked too, meaning that he usually went through at least three outfits a day. If not more! Which also meant constant laundry! These bibs are wonderful! They are a lifesaver. I am no longer doing laundry on a daily basis or every other day for that matter. They are still soft, with a layer of terry on the front and back and than a layer of waterproof material sandwiched in between. No matter how much my son spits up now it never soaks through. The bibs are also reversible which makes it where not just one side starts looking worn. Not to mention these bibs are also ecofriendly! That is always a plus in my opinion!
B005Z9S2TW|5|If your child is getting into the fridge you NEED this it is amazing and you cant even notice it, the best feature is that you don't have to do anything to lock it, simply close the fidge
B000JOT2RO|4|Great price point bowls suction works decent my nephew pulls them off the table. Wish they would improve the suction cup! Overall decent for what you paid helps with self feeding!
B001MMW57Q|4|Works
B002IEBTDS|5|Stll using this bag over two years later.
B0055FN03O|4|Great product, but skip the case!  The case is too bulky.  The Neat Solutions' toppers that come in a package have a resealable bag.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Sesame-Biodegradable-Disposable-Placemat-18-Count/dp/B00193DXVK/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
B009QV2E3K|2|I have the heaviest wetter for a son. He's 2.5 years old and significantly taller than his peers (generally in the 90th%). So finding not only a super soaker of a diaper, but one that is also large enough to fit somewhat comfortably is tricky. I've tried many different things including hemp fitted diapers with wool soakers, but I wanted to try this because he just doesn't seem to sleep as well when he feels the wet against his body (like he would with a fitted diaper) and the mixed reviews and low price convinced me it was worth a try. Unfortunately it let me down. Of course 2 microfiber inserts are not nearly enough to hold all of his nightly output, but also, the way it fit even on the largest snap setting wasn't exactly comfortable and was just a little too snug and kind of seemed to cut into his legs a little. Also, the quality of construction just doesn't measure up to the other diapers I have in my stash. All my other diapers (of a variety of brands) are made in the USA and the quality is distinctly superior. Additionally, when I got the diaper it had a funny odor to it. Almost like it needed to air for a while (like some furniture that you buy). Of course I washed it, but it still had a strange smell to it. I don't know if that is from the packaging (I've never had any other diapers smell this way upon receipt) or the materials.<br />I'm glad it wasn't pricey, I don't feel like I've lost too much that way. Maybe my newborn will not be as heavy of a wetter and will be able to make use of it eventually.
B0050386O4|5|Great quality. I don't think it is any heavier than any other infant carrier. The only negative is when driving in your car w just the base and no baby or carrier on the base, the base rattles.
B003OUWINU|4|This is our second britax car seat, and I plan to keep buying them as long as we need carseats. The seat is comfortable, easy to use, and quick to set up. No complaints.
B000LBD9RE|4|Pros:great for city use, love the ease with the recline feature.. can be done in one hand (unlike the maclaren which needs both hands), basket and umbrella are good size, easy to maneuver, good value for the money    cons: isn't as compact at the maclaren when it folds, heavy to carry when travelling so you may need another light weight stroller for travels.
B000KHTD38|1|I was very disappointed in these bibs. They stained easily. They even got MOLDY! The neck holes are so large that my child still doesn't fit them at 11 months, and I have had these since she hit about 6 months old. They do cover a large area but sometimes they would actually get in her way when trying to eat because they are so wide. They don't do any good because the neck holes are so wide that they don't protect her clothing. They don't snap or velcro, so I have to pull them off over her head, which ends up being more messy than it's worth. Don't waste your money. If you want to buy cute iPlay bibs, get the ones that are more like plastic. They fit better and work better too.
B002FB7FAK|5|We used size one til our son was about 16 pounds.  We noticed that he was leaking out more and that the leg holes were getting too tight.  We first bought the Thirsties Wrap in Medium.  It was my mistake for not noticing that those are NOT THE SAME as these.  Those don't have adjustable snaps!  At some point they'll fit him but we ended up having to buy more-- these ones are great with the snaps- being able to adjust them based on your baby's weight/size.<br /><br />Side note- we continue to use the newborn prefolds- we just changed the way we lay them in the liner and no longer you the snappies to hold it in place.  Just as effective!  Check out tutorials on YouTube for assistance in trying different folds.  Save yourself the money from buying larger prefolds.  :)
B00A8EZOHM|3|Disclaimer: Yes, this is a Vine review.  However, it's being used by someone who's expecting a child.  I'm reviewing this item in terms of what I would be interesting in buying and using.  How I acquired the item is not relevant to my views.<br /><br />First off, let's get this out of the way: The fabric is removable and is, for all intents and purposes, washable.  There's a tag right on it saying it's removable.  Now, you probably need to wash in delicate mode, I don't know. But you can clean this.<br /><br />Now, with that said, I'm sure the First Years True Fit Car Seat is excellent for some parents.  It is not, however, one that I would have bought.<br /><br />This car seat is primarily for the following:<br /><br />Someone who intends to keep the car seat in a single vehicle<br />Someone with a Latch System in their car (new cars apparently have this)<br />Someone who is VERY concerned about safety<br />Someone who doesn't have a newborn<br /><br />None of these apply to my family.<br /><br />This seat is not easy to install in the rear facing position in vehicles without a Latch System.  You'd be a masochist to remove and re-install this over and over with a traditional belt system.<br /><br />The car seat comes with an upper headrest insert that comes in a U shape.  This is for preventing injury in a side collision.  The headrest only comes into play with an older child, say 3 or 4 years old.  The practical effect of this safety measure is that your child is either going to have to extend their neck outward to look out the window or be forced to look straight forward or downward during the entire trip.<br /><br />This, to me, is ludicrous.  I have no intention of installing a TV screen on the back of the front seat to keep the kids entertained.  They watch enough TV as it is.  Boredom is something that a child needs to learn to cope with.  It's not something that needs to be fixed so that they're entertained all the time.  This might sound like a side rant, but it's the practical effect of the upper headrest being used.  The child would either risk worse injury by extending their head outward or they'll want/need a TV in front of them to keep them from going bonkers.<br /><br />That said, I know this is a selling point for many parents.  I am not one of them, clearly.  But others will want to buy this because the headrest provides extra protection.  If that's what you want, this is a good car seat to get.<br /><br />The most practical system for a parent with a newborn is a car seat/stroller combo.  That means an easy to remove seat you can quickly and easily latch into a stroller and be on your way.  This is not that car seat.<br /><br />I believe in reviewing items for what they are, not what they aren't. This is a good seat for someone with the Latch System or a child old enough to where you can use this front facing.  Installing this in the front facing position is WAY easier.  Quite bluntly, I just wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a newborn.  It's not just the Latch System, it's also the practicality of having something you can use with a stroller.  So this one is for older kids.  And it's for parents super concerned with safety and are okay with forcing a kid to face forward and not look left or right that often.<br /><br />Further info:  I installed this in a Honda Element, a vehicle that has a lot of space between the front and rear seats.  I had to use the headrest in order to make the seat lock in place.  In another vehicle I don't think I'd need the headrest in order to secure the seat in the rear facing position.  In any case, this is another reason why the seat is hard to install over and over - the combined weight with the headrest is quite a bit to wrestle with.
B000H1MRJO|5|Great Product! Will order more
B00IZJF0I0|3|A simple cute memory book. Does not have many sections for detailed memories. Serves it purpose for the price.
B000XT30G4|5|Great for the baby! And a classy look, too. Not your normal looking baby gate...
B004GXA6RY|5|I wish the table could be removed with one hand versus using both but overall good item for its price and very pretty !
B0075CIFVM|2|Pretty cheap quality for the price. Lots of competition out there in this price range. I expected better than I got
B00DF29KA6|5|Was for our grand daughter she said she loved it. That is a great review.
B003D3O8D6|5|Angel Dear are the best crib and bedtime companions. My son loves his even now that he is 4. So we got this set for our baby girl. The fabric is so soft and the design is beautiful. They will fade a bit with washing but like I said 4 years later and my sons blankets are still looking good.
B0018CK9W8|5|This is the biggest and most secure car seat I have ever seen.  It is a giant among car seats.  Even the way it sits in a car makes it feel more secure.  It does take some sizing which I did with the child before I put it in the car.  Putting it in was pretty fast and easy too, which is not something I have experienced before.<br /><br />It is very easy to get children in and out of this seat.  The fabric is wonderful and soft and buying it in granite will probably give it some longevity.<br /><br />I did research before I found the one I thought was the safest when our latest grew out of an infant seat.  I have probably purchased twenty car seats between children and grandchildren (and a DIL who gave them away every time one of her three children grew out of one).  THIS is the only one I remember for its quality.
B001L6JB52|1|I bought this as a gift for my friend. The motor was weak, barely sucking air. I put my had on the pump and couldn't feel anything!! When I took the tube off the bottle, it felt like it was blowing out. On high I barely felt anything! I called the company and they said I had faulty tubing and sent out new tubing. Yeah, no. That's wasn't the problem at all. The motor is weak and this is an awful product. I ended up buying her a different brand, threw this one away, and gave the bag to my daughter to play with. The bag was probably to most useful thing from this!!
B0038OLMXE|5|I bought two of these and immediately ordered another like them, only the regular height.  With three little dogs and one with a piddle problem I thought we'd have to tear out carpeting throughout the house and replace it with tile.  But, after putting these in I think we have the probblem solved....  The gates are not unsightly and they are very sturdy.  In addition, they are EASY to assemble!  I bought the bronze because they should not show any scuffing or stains.  Also, Amazon's fast shipping is a godsend!!
B004P5PF42|5|I love it and use it daily. It comes in handy in so many different ways. To many to name. It should be the most wantd item for any baby shower.
B002RT8O6E|3|I am a big fan of the natural baby company and my Grobaby diapers. They are the only diaper that could convince me to go cloth. That being said I have never understood this type of product that is half dispoable, half cloth. I tried it out in a free sample because I thought it would be a nice alternative to disposables when out and about. I found that really I would rather go with disposables or just stick with my cloth and a wetbag even when out. Grobabies are so easy i think these make them more difficult. I always seem to get a sticky residue on my diapers afterwards, they are nowhere near as absorbent as the grobaby inserts, and they are harder to dispose of then a regular disposable diaper. Compared to other diapers of this sort ( disposable liners with reusable shells) they are a great product. But I think I am just not the right person for the overall concept, I would rather use my cloth.
B000262HMQ|5|This is a massive stroller cover that easily fits my Chicco Cortina Keyfit 30 Travel system without any disassembling.  The material is sturdy and will hold up to appropriate use.  If baggage handlers drag it across the tarmac it will get destroyed just like any other bag without wheels would get destroyed - but at least that is not the $300 stroller.<br /><br />Negative - The black color combined with the size makes this item appear like checked baggage and not a gate checked item.  At our final destination the bag was sent to baggage claim instead of brought up to the jet way.  Not sure why everyone missed the gate check tag but hey that is the excitement of traveling with an infant.  But the bag held up and is in great shape after our trip.
B009S4NN62|2|I bought these bibs because I liked that they were 100% cotton & they seemed highly reviewed. The downside to these bibs is that the neck is very small. I feel like they are already VERY tight on my 2 month old & he is not a particularly big baby. I feel a bit uncomfortable even putting them on him because of the small neck size. These bibs are cute and in terms of material and sewing they seem well made...it's just a shame that for the price you pay for them that they aren't going to work for your baby for very long at all.
B004EWGDEM|1|Very poor quality.  Was received cracked.  No wonder discontinued.
B0090OM1F4|3|These headbands are incredibly cute and I think they'll look great on my little one once she arrives BUT that will have to be after I go through the bands and remove what looks likes excess glue from a hot glue gun everywhere.
B001ODAHF0|4|After loads of research, I was down to the Maclaren, Uppababy g-luxe, and this.  Uppababy came a very close second as I LOVED their canopy, but comparing in the shop, the Chicco seemed more stable, durable, supportive, and was the only one that did not tip when I hung the diaper bag on it.  Also, it was the cheapest which was a big bonus.  Having said that one major flaw, the buckle does not adjust over the thighs/legs area.  The shoulder and leg straps adjust but the buckle is a very short length.  My daughter is 15 mos and I really have to position her just right to avoid pinching her.  I stopped another mom in the street and she had the same complaint.  I'm not sure how comfortable she will be when she has bare legs in the summer time.  Other than that, I do really like this stroller and may have to lengthen the strap myself (somehow).      Just to comment on some others' reviews, you do not need to take the canopy off to close it.  It does feel light even if it's 17lbs because it is so compact.  It feels just as light as the Maclaren.  The recline is awesome and it is near flat.  I would recommend finding a store that carries it and checking that your child fits into it.     *** Has anyone found a rain cover that fits???? *****
B002QYW8LW|5|My son loves chewing on this thing!
B000V6CZ9M|3|Due to improper packaging, there is a minor chip in the right side of the wooden frame/changing table bar area, and the bottom drawer has issues pulling out on the glider portion...this is due to a bent metal glider piece.  Luckily, my husband was able to partially fix the dent in the metal glider piece for the bottom drawer.  All in all though, plenty of room for the baby clothes and other necessities.  It will work perfectly as a dresser and a changing table for the baby!  Please note that the packaging was partially torn on the front of the box and that some of the nails were falling out of the screw/nail box which caused a minor chip in the top of the wood work.  IT IS NOTICEABLE....  I now have to stain that chipped area to make it blend in as much as possible.  Poor thinking on shipping box...should have been much better padded, especially for how much this nice piece of furniture cost.
B004L2JJAK|5|Use it everyday, love it
B00N6KBNQQ|5|bubbles take time to put together (I recommend to start with the boundaries first, then the largest bubbles, fill the rest last).  Absolutely beautiful!
B000056JEG|2|I had received these with my pump and although it may be nice to use them I found buying the bottles that fit on the end of the pump much easier and then i could combine the milk and place it in a storage container for the fridge or freezer. Also I am not one to spend money needlessly so instead of buying all of these expensive storage containers I found the Avent Via and just cheap gerber bottles with disks on the top the best and cheapest way to store breastmilk. And it helps if you intend on having a huge supply stored.
B00GUN3Z1W|1|Flimsy.  The wood is very thin. THis gate broke the 2nd day we had it, and not because it was defective--it just sucks.  The wood is so much more flimsy than other gates I bought.  Spend a few more dollars and buy a better quality gate.  Also, the wood splinters easily, which is not what I want my kids hanging on to.  I do not recommend this product.
B0000A1O7P|5|love it..i have 2 of them cuz i have 2 babies..made well..will fit tables with a lip...just turn pole upside down position were you want it. then click pole in place.
B007CTPX2W|1|I am so disappointed that I bought this.  It's a pain to install and when installed, the B-Ready doesn't close properly.  I'm 5'6 and my arms don't seem long enough to push the stroller with the board attached… and my two year old had to ride inside the handle for me to even be able to use it.  It didn't ride evenly (one of the three wheels didn't touch the ground), is noisy and clunky.<br /><br />SO disappointing given how much we love our Britax stroller.
B0043IS18I|1|It has a clicking sound that would drive us crazy.  It might have been just a defective one but we are having to return ours because of the clicking sound.
B008B345B8|3|Flimsy
B00A6Y02QC|4|Well worth the money and it makes making baby food a breeze.  I love that the steam and blend features are all in ine item.
B0038OLMXE|4|Looks really nice and works well with the decor in my dining room. To me, its best features are that it opens in both directions and swings closed on its own. It is a little challenging to open with one hand. You have to grab it in just the right spot. That's definitely not a deal breaker, though.    One reviewer mentioned a sticker on the bottom of one side of the gate. It's a little distracting/kind of irritating but easy to overlook and not terribly noticeable by others.
B002WN2BB4|1|Son loves Toy Story, so the cup was a hit.  However, he chewed the straw up after about three weeks.  Sat down to order a replacement, and guess what.  No replacement straws!  Not about to pay $6 for another cup and straw.  Plus the vacuum in the cup will cause it to leak.  Haven't figured a way around this problem with any of our straw cups except trying not to tighten the lid too much.  Good luck!
B004EWGDJC|3|These are good quality but I think I would buy the un-prefolds if I had to purchase again. I am waiting to see how these fit my child once he is older and/or bigger, because they are a bit too bulky for my taste on a newborn. And paying extra for prefolds is now, in hindsight, not necessary or desirable. I use these a lot as rags and as rags the un-prefolds would be easier to handle.
B008H7FTDQ|5|We put my son in a HALO SleepSack every night. He loves it, and he stays nice and warm each night.
B001OC5UNA|5|Bought this gate to keep my 50 pound boxer mix contained in one area of the house. Setup was easy, the cups to optionally screw into the wall made this gate supper secure. The add on extension is great to since it allows me to move the gate from a narrow doorway to a wider opening with ease. Despite the dogs over ambitious tendencies, she hasn't hurt the gate at all, even when excited and jumping against it.
B0011URFRE|5|Nice design and reasonable price, also famous brand.   My daughter is 39 months old with 41 inches and 37 ponds. Since she got this car seat, she feels more space and convenient. She can sleep with her head against the back which both high and deep in. It is much more comfortable than those she had before.
B005YT9Q3Y|5|Great pacifier. I love it and my son loves it. Might be a bit expensive but its worth it. Seem to last my son longer than the recommendation, he only uses it for naps and night sleep though.
B00H57F2B8|5|My daughter, and grandson (3 1/2 mo. old), just love this seat. He's now able to sit up while grocery shopping and enjoys it much more.
B00G34TJRC|5|upgraded after a bad car accident. LOVE these seats. WORTH IT.
B003554H9M|4|It does a good job of protecting the stroller. The bag has gotten a little messy after flights which is evidence that it is working. I did not give it 5 stars because the bright red color really sticks out in the airport and causes a few stares.
B008K16B2C|5|Great bag
B001D0Z4M0|5|Great toy for babies!
B000067QMJ|1|I received this from my sister.  She has a boy and had problems also.  Even with the sheild on, urine still leaked onto the floor most of the time.  There is a small gap between the bottom of the seat and the top of the bowl that is big enough to let urine go between the two and leak onto the floor.  The music never worked for my nephew unless he went poop so I never installed the batteries for my son.
B00A2HUH04|5|This was recommended to me by a friend who felt this is the safest car seat made. This is our second one (needed for another car) and we couldn't be happier. It seems to be very comfortable for our daughter and we love the color.
B001O9H5Q8|4|I bought this online for my 3 month old because I was noticing her flatheadedness a little bit and I didn't want it to become worse.  I read a lot of products online and decided to give this a shot and it was also the cheapest product among the many that I've researched.  I bought my first one at a kids pottery barn store because they carried the one that was made with terry cloth.  Super nice!  It was soft but not too soft and can be washed.  My daughter likes sleeping on it and in a week, I've noticed that her flatheadedness was getting better!  It was a little more expensive (25bucks) than the one online but I didn't have to pay shipping costs so it kind of evened out.  After that, I bought two more online so I can use one when she's on her playmat and one to keep at my mom's house for convenience.  The ones online are not made with terry cloth but with polyester and the filling is more firmer.  Still great products!  Of course, do as much tummy time as possible too.
B00BEHXA5A|5|This was a present for my friends whose baby room theme was turtles, they are also avid surfers.  So it was a perfect combo.  Their baby loves it to, babies favorite blanket.
B003ZFPRHS|1|We purchased the turtlemeter and it worked great for the first two baths. We forgot to empty the tub for a couple hours and the turtlemeter was sitting in a little bit of water. Since then it has been stuck on the same temperature. Changing the batteries hasn't helped
B004Y426XM|5|We love this product! I have used this with my 1 year old son since he was around 10 months old and he likes it. I use it at Target, the supermarket and just about anywhere it will fit when I bring my son along. Folds up great, and is very compact and light. I usually just leave it in the trunk of the car. I think this product is great to have, especially when you don't know what kind of germs can be all over the shopping cart. This helps me feel at ease that my son doesn't keep touching the bare cart. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to buy a good quality cover for a reasonable price!
B00BTWEUOK|5|My little girl loves these! It was the only bottle she would take out of about 5 other brands we tried. It is the closest thing to the real deal I have found. Highly recommend to anyone who is having to supplement their breast milk it doesn't seem to cause nipple confusion like others do. My little one can switch from breast to bottle with no problem. I can't give more than 5 stars but I'd like to! Love love love this product!! Oh and bonus having the binkies! My baby girl wouldn't take any other binky not even the ones they give at the hospital but she takes these and it has allowed this mamma extra sleep!
B003REBITI|3|I allowed my daughter to select the Monkey Nap Mat in Pink. This is her second Nap Mat and compared to the one previously purchased for the same price it is thin, lacks padding, the pillow is stuffing and not an actual removable pillow you can wash(as needed.) Also the straps to close up/carry the Nap Mat are way too short.
B000IDSLOG|5|Yes, it is undoubtedly an expensive item. However, I don't regret I bought it. First of all, it is very soft and light and easy to handle. My baby easily and comfortably grabs any part of the toy. Second, it is easy to chew on (from ears to legs to nose) - my baby loves Sophie because no matter how you turn her, you can chew on it. Third, it makes a squeeky noise that draws baby's attention. And last but not least the coloring of the toy (the dots) keep baby's attention for a while. Overall, it is soft, bends well, light and great to chew on. I would highly recommend giving it a try.
B005XJ2VGE|1|This seat looks great and is easy to clean, I bought it because I love the many features. This thing has two MAJOR FLAWS...with the tray!  #1 this thing is dangerous! The locking tray positions are very deceptive, it is hard to tell when it is on the locked and unlocked positions. In the amount of time it took me to remove my sons bib and set it on the counter, my son leaned forward on the tray and he and the tray fell out, he fell flat on his face! I have never seen or used a highchair with this problem and I have worked in many childcare centers over the years. And to clarify, I DID have my son buckled, it was a split seconds that I had unbuckled him and turned around to set the bib down, preparing to remove him from the seat that he leaned forward and fell out. I tried to catch him but it was to late. he was bleeding from his mouth and nose! I had to take him to the ER! He was fine but it was a terrible experience! The other MAJOR flaw is that the tray does not go in all the way, doesn't sound like that big of a deal right.....well actually why do you buy a highchair? So you can feed your kid safely and with the least mess? So if they tray doesn't go in all the way, where does the food go? ALL OVER HIS LAP! Every time we would use this thing the food would be all over his lap....the problem is the tray has a piece that goes between the legs and that piece is angled out past the tray, so it hits your kids right in the crotch...you cannot push it in any further, to get closer to your child's lap. This thing would be great, if they just changed a few things with the tray. Bummer for us, this things had to go back!
B00957YNJS|3|Although our daughter loves it & gives it 5 stars - simply because it's Dora, as  a parent I give it 3.  It serves it's purpose but just be aware that the bowl is small, must sit right over it.  When lid is up, it is not comfortable on the childs back .
B000IDSLOG|5|My daughter has had this giraffe since she was about 4 months and has loved it since day one.  She is currently 8 months and still loves to suck on it, chew on it, squeak it, or just \\"pet\\" it.  Great toy, and totally worth the price.
B00005JIVI|5|Saw this bath pad, read the reviews, and had to have it!  Now, I absolutely love it!  It's the perfect pad for 1 parent to bath their infants!  My experience with the big, bulky, plastic tubs is that infants tend to slide down while bathing them.  Thus forcing you to have 4 hands instead of 2.  With this pad, it so easy for me or my husband to bath our son with out any assistance from the other. My son, absolutely loves his bath pad.  While he has a tendency to pooh on it... it does wash up nicely.  I just drain it, then throw it in the washer.  My only complaint is that when you wash it, the foam filling does become a little distorted.  But it's not a big deal!  HIGHLY recommend!  Can't wait to buy it as a shower gift for a friend!
B001IYOAQM|5|My wife and I like to take our twin toddlers for walks after dinner.  The problem is that's also when the mosquito's are the most active and feeding.  We didn't like the idea of coating our children in bug repellant, so decided to give this a try.  Not only does it keep the little bloodsuckers away from our kids...they like being in the \\"tent\\" when we go for walks.  When not using it, we keep it in the bag in the storage area at the back of our stroller.      I can't speak to side by side strollers, but it works perfectly with our Contours Tandem stroller.  I would recommend this to anyone with twins.
B00L9NR672|5|Simple to Use - Easy to Clean - You only need a couple of drops of good quality essential oils and the aroma spreads through the house in a light refreshing way - Auto shut off if convenient - It doesn't make any noise at all - Really quick shipping
B00D8W4YZ4|5|Kids like the 'taste' I like that it's natural so we don't have to worry that they swallow most of it! Is fairly sticky and can be hard to get a small dab out of tube and onto toothbrush but that's a minor issue
B002FIROM2|5|It is being used in a ministry for special needs children and adults.  Some tend to wonder on outings and cannot care for themselves.  This is perfect.
B002WDAW5Q|5|This pillow is a must have for an infant.  Helps support while feeding or sleeping.  As they get older, it helps them learn how to sit-up.  Pillow is very well made.
B00I0M8QTC|2|my baby don't like them.
B00110RR6S|2|Tassels came off easily within one day. Very small like an accent pillow.
B00AHVR4KG|5|I wife was dead set on purchasing this stroller.  I was less than pleased when I saw the original cost at other retailers.  So glad I drug my feet and purchased it here.  Arrived the next day and is a great stroller, very well made and solid.
B005TENL4Y|5|Loved it
B00K0QPP0E|5|Rilos & Mimi are great to work with. They use high quality fabrics and liners. The presentation and packaging of the products are perfect for any type of gift. I have ordered several things from Rilos and Mimi and love them all. Diaper Clutches, Snack Pouches, Travel Cases, --I love seeing new things they design and create!<br />5 STARS=Happy Customer :)
B00A0FGLX0|1|We bought this carseat in 2013 as we wanted to use the same brand for our Uppababy Vista stroller. I would've give them 5 stars but the reason that i'm giving them one is because after the first year of use, my (now) thirtheen-month-old baby girl find out how to easily UNLOCK the chest clip. The carseat Chest Clip  has  a very fast and easy to press botton to unlock it and this become a HUGE safety problem! Every time I place my baby on her carseat she finds funny to unlock herself, so I'm driving with cero peace of mind knowing that my baby is not safe, because she's not properly fasten. The last legal safety requirements for babies in cars are that they have to face the rear until the age of two, now I will have to buy another carseat as this one is no longer safe for her.
B002J4U8L6|4|This should allow prints to survive baby drool, and the pages that aren't used with pics have nice black and white graphics for the baby to look at. doesn't hold a ton of pictures, but prints are cheap enough to change them out frequently.
B0018FVFBE|5|We love it!<br />It washed up very well. It fit just right.<br />We will be looking for another one in the future.
B0093Y0IJ2|5|My son loves this potty. He loves that you can pretend to flush and he loves Elmo so that always helps. Now I just have to get him to keep using it.
B00005QI1H|4|Our baby loves this.  He is only eight weeks old but as soon as we sit him in it he starts looking up, waiting for the lights to come on.  Unfortunately, we shipped this to our home overseas and the lights only feature only worked once and now it does not function.  My only thought is that it may have gotten damaged when it was shipped, however, it was shipped in the manufatures original, unopened packaging so I am only giving it four stars.  Also, we love the fact that it is small because we live in Asia and we sit in the floor at a lower table for meals.  Our son is on the same level as us when we sit down together.  Oh, the manufacturers directions do not list a recommended age but we put our son in at five weeks and he was fine.  It has a nice safe incline so he is not truely sitting up but rather relaxing at a nice angle.
B00186UQOA|2|Baby speedo. This swim diaper only fits slim babies. Or maybe just get them a size or two bigger.
B001D4E4G8|5|Fits on our doors just fine. Also - our sons likes to chew on it... Doesn't rip or crumble. Safe and a great purchase.
B001HXWXTA|5|I have been using my stroller for 3 years and love it!  It's very easy to push and turn (better than the double I have), pushes smoothly on park trails as well as flatter surfaces and is simple to fold.  Considering the size, it's weight is quite manageable and it fits easily into the back of my minivan.  My children (6,4,3) fit comfortably into the seats without complaint.  I have never had any problem with the rear wheels as long as they were properly fastened, but it has been nice that they remove easily when stowing the stroller in a smaller vehicle.  I also love the option to have the front wheel in a fixed or mobile position, which isn't offered by  some of the competitors.  My only complaint would be that the sun visor doesn't extend out far enough, but that has been easily remedied by having my children wear hats.  A great investment!
B0010P5Q7Q|4|So, my two and a half year old picked this one out and we ordered it.  It fits great on the big potty, and the non-slip grips that it comes with really do help keep it from moving around.  Of course, the boy version has the pee guard ( which works as expected.)  The only con I can find to it is that it seems a little small for his butt ... or maybe he just sits on it weird?
B0000CBGBS|5|I love this chair.  It helps keep my baby asleep long enough for me to make myself lunch, which is a big deal for a baby that doesn't ever like to be put down.  My only complaint is that it doesn't bounce at all, which now that our son is born, we realize he likes.  But the vibrating feature is must.  I do wish it would stay on for a little longer.  My baby wimpers a little when it turns off.  It was defenately worth the money.
B005GUGSAK|5|love that my daughter can lift it up and it not fall back down on her head choose white so the family could put hand prints on it great idea :)
B009YDCGVK|4|The bag is on the small side, so 1 year old is fine. The only issue is that the buckle strap part on the front to secure the bag to the child is EXTREMELY short and is not adjustable. My son is only 15 months old and with the buckle secure, it's just slightly under his neck.
B008ON9WEA|3|Good. but it's few melting.
B00KFOWKWC|4|I'm using these to freeze my coconut cream in them and use them in everything from coffee to smoothies.  The rubber makes them very flexible for me to pop out the cubes.
B00IMN8SW4|5|My son loves his bath letters! Thanks!
B009C92RCE|5|We have owned Lorex baby monitors in the past and they were awesome.  This is no exception.  It is a little pricey but you are paying for quality.  The camera pans and tilts quietly so your little one won't be woken up.  The screen is great and you can see everything really well.  Everything seems to be solidly built and the monitor holds a charge for a long time.  We had a similar baby monitor from Motorola last year and it went out on us after less than six months.  It was almost identical to this Lorex system.  Based on reliability and my past experience with Lorex I would recommend this video monitor set up over pretty much anything else.  Lorex is top notch and worth the money.
B0081ZOWG4|5|kid says they suck oh wait he sucks them ... hard to find vanilla and sent wore off after about a month or so.
B00M6V1VM2|1|I want to love the design. However they have two flaws: 1) as some other reviews pointed out, the mouth piece is hard to clean: puree gets in there and is impossible to get them out; 2) the zip lock bottom is prone to leak. I tried to squeeze with it half filled and two out of five broke, the glue for the zip lock tore up and broke the pouch.
B003XMWFBE|5|Don't believe any negative reviews you read on this product!  I purchased two of these to use for our vacation travel this summer.  I read reviews and looked at several different backseat organizers before deciding on these. I used them for a 7 year old and a 10 year old and they worked great holding their DVD players, iPods, earbuds, and various other items. They are better suited for a child that is in a booster seat who can lean forward to reach items in the organizer, but would work great to hold diapers, wipes, etc. for younger children who are secured in a traditional car seat.  However, regardless of the age of your child, this is a great product and I have no regrets in my purchase.
B001BWS0MQ|5|We have an old house where the temp fluctuates all the time - turning the heat up or down one degree can make a huge difference specifically in the baby's room.  Bought this because I thought it would be easy to see since I have contacts during the day and am semi blind at night.  Works GREAT - I can see the numbers from the hallway as I crack the door to his room, and also the fact that the colors change according to the recommended temp is fantastic.  Well worth the price.  Not to mention that it looks cool in his room....  Also, very easy to use - just plug in!
B008P8EZOG|5|Works great, long battery life. Durable. We constantly drop it and it keeps going. We have had it for over two years now and still going strong. Excellent product. Highly recommend
B003AOLKJS|2|Not at all like the ones you get from the hospital. Plastic is cheap and way too flexible. Doesn't really suck air in quickly enough to clear nose.
B0052QYLUM|5|Great monitor for the price. Features are limited but it's really everything you need. The infrared works quite well. Also, their customer service and warranty are awesome! We dropped our monitor and half the screen stopped working but they replaced it with no hassle.
B00GHAGOXO|5|Better then described, love the feel of the material. Blanket is made from quality materials. Looks very nice. Shipping was very fast.
B005123EHI|1|Doesn't stick very well and unattractive. I would recommend getting the shades made by Britax. These were a waste of money
B000058CC7|4|We've been very pleased with these gates.  We originally had the Summer Infant extra tall gates, but replaced them with these.  The Summer Infant gates can be opened by crawling babies, so as an infant gate they are an epic fail.    These First Years Hands Free Gates, however, work very well.  They really are secure, and much more convenient for adults to open and close by stepping on a pedal.  It's actually nice that they don't close automatically, because we leave them open when the babies are asleep or when we're carrying groceries or laundry.    The only design flaw is the width of the gate.  Look at the picture.  There's the gate, then there are two bars between the gate and the wall.  Why?  I sure would like to have those six wasted inches applied to widening the gate.  Then I could get the laundry basket through it instead of over it.  Especially handy when you prefer not to pitch down the stairs.
B0001IU5HY|4|The point of this isn't fun so it's kinda difficult to rate that and it has no educational value as that's also not the point. I have had this for 4 months now and it's a godsend at night!  In the crib he'll wake up every hour & a half fussing, but if he's in the chair he'll wake up for the first time after sleeping for 4-5 hours straight! Makes a gigantic difference! You can turn the chair so it rocks froward to back of leave it in position so it rocks outwards and back.  Have had no issues w/ the headrest. Doesn't squish my babies head or press against his ears as others have mentioned. The upright postioning of the chair is really ridiculous cause it's at such an extreme angle that he'd have to be super strapped in (and very uncomfortable at that!) to not fall right out. The angle is so so stupid and dangerous!Other issues I do have are the 7 min timer (that's not adjustable) for the music and mobile. I have to go back to turn it on all the time and it's really annoying! And contrary to another persons review I read...I motor does make noise and it's really loud! We could never have this in our bedroom cause we wouldn't be able to sleep so we have to only use it in our living room. If the dial is turned anywhere past the first few notches you here the motor going back and forth. Also w/ each swing one side of the contraption at the back of the leg moves slightly up from the floor. Not dangerous as it's just barely but that also causes it to make more noise so we have to place something under it all the time. It's very annoying this thing only runs of batteries as we have to change batteries every week it seems. We just started usign re-chargables cause the cost of D's is far too expensive to keep buyign packs of them constantly. This really should have a plug option. Overall it's great though we are looking for another type of swinging chair that doesn't take up so much room and that's less noisy so we can have it in our bedroom.
B004LWZKXU|4|The bunny was all in all adorable! I do have to say, the small picture doesn't reveal the material it is. I was also disappointed by the size, somehow I imagined it would have been bigger, fatter. Gift recipient was very happy with this gift and I don't have any complaints either!
B0006FHFYS|4|My son wasn't sure about the swing at first, but within a week he grew to love it.  He takes naps in it, loves to watch the fish go around and listen to the music, and can stare at the side panel of fish for a long time.  It did go too fast for him in the beginning, but you can tie a bottle of water or something heavy to the back of it to slow it down.  He doesn't seem to care that the motor does make a noise so not a problem.  The biggest drawback- he's only 3 months old and his shoulders are already getting too wide for the seat!  Also, be prepared to buy a lot of batteries if you use it often.  Overall I'm glad we purchased it. =UPDATE= Beware: if your child has neck problems do not put them in a swing, bouncer, etc for long periods of time!  We found out the hard way and need to fix the flat spot on our child's head.
B007VBXJ7M|4|These are fine baby bottles, and a lot of people will be happy with them.<br /><br />The positives::<br />- Only 3 pieces including protective cap<br />- So wide makes them easy to clean inside<br />- Wide makes it easier to grasp for adults (closer in size to a regular 12 ounce glass)<br /><br />The neutral:<br />The claim that they produce less colic and less air due to twin valves is likely just a marketing term. We haven't noticed any difference between these and all our other bottles (We've tried at least 4 different kinds)<br /><br />The maybe not so good:<br />Super wide, means that their claim that its ergonomic for the baby is stretching the truth a little bit. Our little one (7 months) holds all her other bottles just fine, but these ones she cannot hold by herself and we have to do it for her the entire time.
B004GCJMLG|1|This product is the worst. Nowhere does it say that we need to drill screws for installation. We bought it due to high reviews. But after reading the complicated steps for installing this lock, we decided to return this product as it was very complex and needed drilling. We will be looking for a simpler solution and a user friendly product.
B000HZBZ16|4|My daugher used this from about 4 months to 10 months.  As she got older and we adjusted the legs, she would push it like a walker.  The music sounds a bit like a slot machine's and we all wished that there was more to interact with besides the dial of animal noises and the songs for the rest of it.  My daughter never really played with the basketball, star, or spinning swirly things, so if it had sounds associated with using those parts, I think she would have gotten more use out of it.  This fits perfectly into a Pack-n-Play, so we often used the Boppy to prop her up to play with the caterpillar.
B0031ARQLC|3|This bed looks really nice, but it is a bit on the flimsy side. It is not very supportive, and the boards on the bottom seem as if they would break with the slightest jump or bounce on the bed. It will serve it's purpose though as a temporary bed for my 3-year old.
B007HO4U08|4|It's a carseat that will fit my child until grade school. It fits nicely in the back seat of a Ford truck. I couldn't find a better pice anywhere else. I love amazon prime.
B001QC77W0|5|It was perfect for traveling for a week to Mexico. High chairs were scarce and when they were available there were often no straps. Yes,  my baby sat a little low but she didn't mind one bit. Loved it. Possibly the best baby accessory purchase after the moby wrap.
B001GQ2RWQ|4|My baby girl loves to eat in this chair, she feels like an adult because we use one of the chairs in which we eat. The only feature this seat does not have is that it doesnt recline, so little babies that can not seat well by their own, tend to move forward.
B00JUNAIJG|1|Didn't fit my phone
B000MAERLG|5|I was extremely satisfied with this system!<br />I read some reviews that the stroller may be a little bigger and bulkier, but it didn't bother me. I do have an SUV so I did have an easier time fitting it in the trunk, but it does take up some room. But the stroller itself is easy to maneuver and has great storage space underneath and around.<br />As for the car-seat, it is comfortable and adjusts easily with the baby. It snaps into the base easily and into the stroller.<br />We got a good 6.5 months out of the car-seat until we had to switch (baby was about 20lbs and is wearing thick winter clothing).
B003MH54R2|5|I bought this for my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  She just loves it since it is light weight and stylish. It will be great for use in the spring and summer here in the south!
B000YDDF6O|5|I have given this as an extra gift many times!  The babies really enjoy the happy music and it is easy to tote anywhere.
B00NMOE2ZK|2|The material and color was very nice but I returned it. The whole process of putting it on was too complicated for me. I bought it to travel by myself with the baby and after tryng a regular carrier vs this wrap, I opted for the carrier.
B00TX72CG6|5|Really cute! Just a little to big for my two year old granddaughter.
B0061BW6UE|5|Works the purpose...
B001PB8G04|4|the cotton one is not as comfy as the fleece..
B000066BF4|5|After reading the reviews for this set, I decided to make the purchase for my own soon-to-be 4 year old. Like most reviewers, my daughter is also a girly-girl with 2 sisters to impress! My set just arrived. It was a super quick delivery and just in time for her birthday. Although, my daughter hasn't seen it, I love it and I can't wait for her to see it. I have never written a review before, but on first impressions, I am extremely excited, very impressed and pleased. I anxiously await the tea parties that are to come. This is my second piece of furniture from Target for my children, the first was a book case from their Restore and Restyle line. Again, I was pleased with my purchase. So far, so good!&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62;
B006YBHE6M|5|I recommended to a friend that needs a baby shower gift.My grandson loves this.  The sound decreases as  it plays so as the baby falls asleep the sound turns off
B008VWN510|4|Good product. Could be a better one if 100% cotton.
B00031XUG2|4|The ball is much smaller than I expected, but I take full blame for not paying attention to the dimensions in the product description. It's absolutely adorable though, I love it.
B001AW0TW6|5|This extension worked beautifully from the moment I tried it on. Unfortunately, when I first received my Ergo carrier, I tried it on and freaked out when it didn't snap. I freaked out and ordered this product and when it arrived I sighed a deep breath of relief when I saw it fit perfectly and didn't change anything about the Ergo carrier. Now that I am almost 7 weeks postpartum, I have realized that the extension is unnecessary to me now. OOPS! At least I could wear the carrier with my transitional waistline too! Great product still :)
B0013F7GKI|5|We love the dekor diaper pail and the bags are always a great deal considering you don't have to replace the bag too often. I was excited to find the biodegradable bags. They work just as well as the original bags.
B003CL8ICQ|2|Loses suction. Hard to pump both sides at once.
B008M1FM3O|5|Love this stroller. It is everything I had hoped it would be! My 2.5 year old daughter absolutely loves riding in it to so that makes it even better.
B0057MXB5M|5|perfect for babies
B001V9EVCM|5|Bought as a gift
B006I0R644|5|Love this item even tho my baby won't us these kind of pacifiers she will only use this kind of bottle kinda wierd huh lol but love this item.
B001CFFX18|5|I cleaned the tiles with alcohol and installed it. Exactly 2 months later it still working great and I haven't re-installed it yet.
B004LL5R7A|5|These are great wall clings! I have moved them several times to different spots in the room and they do not loose the &#34;stickiness&#34; and remain in place each new spot I move them to. Great quality and they really tie the room together nicely!
B002QYW8LW|4|This is another one of those items I wish I would have purchased early on when my baby first showed signs of teething at 4 months. I purchased it when he was 6 months and he loved it (just like all the cute babies in the pictures). As he used it when he was older, some bristles did get chewed off and that was worrisome.... so it's great for young babies, maybe not so great for older ones.
B002SW3AX2|5|I love these oversized swaddle blankets. Best purchase I have made thus far for my baby who only sleeps swaddled!
B0028H3ACS|5|Great pacifier, particularly for new babies
B005IV0CF4|5|I am in love with the design!
B004FN0ZA8|4|Great value. Love the print! Only complaint is that the seat belt doesn't stay in the red clip when the belt is being pulled out to buckle it. Not a huge deal (it stays in without issue once child is buckled) but a bit of a pain. We also own a graco nautilus and do not have the same problem with that seat.
B003JPAFRG|5|Beautiful, absolutely love it !!!
B001PTGPVI|5|I love them ,, they're great for kids<br />We take them everywhere to protect my kids from seating directly on public toilets
B00OABOHRM|3|Product hasn't been installed, but it sounds like it will work.
B002J4U8N4|5|I like the dice! My son crawls and hits it with his hands and chases it all across the house. The books a fun to look at (and to eat on).
B000H8D5Q6|1|These blocks are super cute, but are not stuffed at all, so the minute your baby squeezes them or sits on them or anything like that, they just flatten out. They are not fun to play with at all because of this.
B000CP2X9O|4|They've held up really well, and the classic colors match any outfit (we just leave them on since our baby is a drool fool).  I loved these bibs until my baby outgrew them when he hit 16 lbs.  Looking for another, affordable product now, and can't find one.
B00NUJ0K58|3|works good, a little bigger than I thought
B002HMC2AA|3|Some parts were cracked. Base brace glue had come apart. Very delicate for assembly. Good for storage but not for the purpose of changing table. Nice looking too.
B005LETP1A|5|I got the blue tether :))<br />My 4,5 months old son like this teether very much! He is ready to use it for hours.<br />It is so soft teether.
B00586QNDO|5|They were adorable and just what I was looking for for my nursery. Only problem was that there was no way to hang them up. Had to get creative.
B00006G963|5|This mobile has great colors, is very interesting and totally captivates the attention of my 10 week old.  It has nice music (not too mechanical or tinny sounding) and plays for a good amount of time - about 15 minutes.   I love to look at it too! <br /> <br />I haven't had any of the mechanical problems that others have mentioned, but have noticed that sometimes if the mobile doesn't want to move, I just need to adjust it by moving the mobile unit in the stand (that attaches to the crib rail) just a little to the left or right.  The mobile will start back up at that point.
B00PNZNSLU|1|THIS PRODUCT IS 3.00 DOLLARS IN AND CVS
B000NG978M|5|This product is simple in design, easy to use, and easy to clean. I previously had 4 different aspirators including a expensive electric one.<br />None of them came even remotely close to working like this little gem works. My child had RSV and if anyone else knows what RSV does to a childs nose drainage, you know you NEED a good aspirator to help the child breath better. This aspirator saved us many tears from our child choking on mucus.<br />Yes, when you think about how it is used, and watch someone using it on a child, it looks waaaaay gross. But I assure you, it is not.<br />My child actually liked when I used it on her. When I used the other aspirators she would turn away and squirm.<br />DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY!
B00CL6RZ0E|5|works great and easy to use.
B004VNFGME|5|I recently bought this booster seat at the military exchange a week ago (same price as amazon but I priced matched Walmart $46). The print I have is a safari with sage on the reverse side. I researched for awhile and set my sights on this one. It was easy to put together (only in 3 pieces), it reclines easily, it also swivels side to side easily, the tray pops on and off with ease, it has a five-point harness and it is sturdy. What else could you want? My little one loves it too. I'm glad it adapts with the growth of your child too. Great product!
B002IQU80Q|5|satisfied
B005VM62S6|5|I'll start with my only objection; the stroller comes unassembled--- no problem with that, but putting it together, while not quite a \\"chore,\\" was a little harder than I would have liked. You've got to be careful about some finicky alignment issues and it helps to have a good set of tools on hand.<br /><br />But you only have to build it once, and then off you go. The stroller is advertised as \\"one second closing\\" and that's certainly true. It can be easily closed with one hand and in a second flat (just be careful to remove stuff from the storage compartments first!). It's not \\"one second opening\\"; it takes two hands and a little bit of a moderate push to get it open. That's not a big deal.<br /><br />We got this for our grandson and we like the way it works. Our grandson's parents have a big, fancy, expensive stroller that's frankly too heavy and hard to store. The Graco unit is lightweight without sacrificing strength. It's easy to push, easy to turn, and the brake is effective.<br /><br />There are some very nifty features. There are \\"adult\\" drink holders --- and by adult drinks, please think soda! There is a copious storage compartment under the seat; that's a great convenience, practically a necessity for all the things that small children/grandchildren require on even a brief outing. And, as mentioned, the stroller is very easy to fold and store.<br /><br />The build quality is such that we think the stroller will last for quite a long while. Lightweight, attractive, easy-to-use, and convenient--- that's a five-star rating for sure.
B00569H3V4|5|These diaper bags are the best! They are sturdy, roomy, have a pleasant fragrance and are wonderful for on the go diaper disposal. Guilt free! I recommend them to all my mom friends and will be a loyal customer from here on out. Great product all around.
B000TBK4RY|5|Awesome chair love it makes bath time easier
B001QK43JC|5|We were frustrated with \\"diaper bags\\" that had no structure, they just flopped all over and you couldn't keep things organized. The structure of this bag provided the support to keep things in order and the neutral color makes it easier for my son in law to be willing to carry it lol. It is spendy, but have found that's what it takes to get more than just a bottomless bag.
B001KZH692|5|This is a solid price on a great cover for baby's new Pack n' Play mattress. Fits without any wrinkles, washed and dried great, and keeps messes on something easily washable. Nice and soft for baby too
B006SFUD4E|5|It works.  As a toddler, my grandson throws his cup a lot.  It holds up to the abuse.  It does tend to drip in the floor unlike other sippers. But he still loves it.
B000PRUA26|1|After my husband installed this gate and I tried for ten minutes to latch it, pinching my arm in the sliding part in the process, he took it down and we will be returning it. It is very flimsy, hard to latch meaning it wouldn't get latched by older children... And as I mentioned I pinched my arm, I can only imagine what would happen with little fingers.
B00HPD4V1Y|5|I love these little squishing  I mske up a smoothie for my child and off we go.. My son thinks this is the coolest thing ever.  They clean up well too...
B00B7M7BMA|5|This is a great pack (and harness).  It is everything it claims to be and has enough room for water, a diaper/wipes and keys.  I really like the swivel as it prevents too much entanglement.
B00006408K|5|A must for any nursery.
B000LM2R44|5|My daughter does not routinely suck on pacifiers, but at 10 months old, these infant pacifiers (other brands can use harder plastic- the soft material seems to work best) are her favorite teether. She sticks a thumb in the hole and uses the mouthpiece as a sort of cushion so that it doesn't hurt if she chews/bites her thumb. I attach the ribbon clip to the edge of the pacifier so that she can grip it- she also sucks on the ribbon.
B00BJCFOYK|5|Perfect addition to the ERGO baby backpacks. I will warn the baby can get a little warm in the carrier, so be careful if using in hotter climates.
B004MNGH4O|3|This bag is really cute has the side pockets for small sippy cups or bottles and the changing pad which can be detached. my problem with this bag is that it is bulky across my back, which is why I bought it. not comfortable to wear at all!
B004HWXCJS|1|I was nursing my premie twins for 6 months and pumping at the same time as one of them was not a good eater. I had to supplement with formula because my supply was going down. I have returned to work and and am depressed every time I pump and see so little coming out. I have tried all the tricks that lactation consultants offer, but this pump is just not good enough for twins.<br />The hospital grade pumps are much stronger. I would recommend hiring a hospital grade pump rather than spending the money on this.
B002D3XEKA|5|My friend is a medical student and just had her first child. I got this for her as a baby shower gift and it was a huge hit!!
B001QVKFMK|3|I am sure this is a fantastic product, but it does not appeal to me as I prefer a sturdier material.
B00PTL46J6|3|The chest buckle it hard to get unclasped I have to work at it for awhile before I can finally get it to come loose and to tighten the harness is difficult to get secure tightly Really have to pull really hard.
B000GE1MEI|5|I love these. We bought two of them. They're not impossible to open like some toilet locks but still enough to keep my toddler out of the toilet. Great!
B00HWIWRSQ|4|It is great.  Would love for it to have pockets or something for extra items.
B00JXR2VFS|5|I have bought quite a few of these for the baby's in my life they seem to love them and I am so happy they keep the baby occupied especially helpful when changing diapers what a great invention thank you Lisa keep thinking up new helpful items
B001CHV1T4|5|Used it for a diaper cake it was perfect, and the parents love it.
B0029WSHSY|3|I received this bra today. I was initially really excited about it because I am currently pumping to build my supply, and I loathe putting on the Medela pumping bustier every 2 hours. This bra gets 2 stars for being really comfortable and true to size. I had to knock off a few stars though for the following reasons.<br /><br />The nipple placement on this bra doesn't work for me. This may be a personal anatomy issue, but the pump slits seem to be for a woman who's nipples are cock eyed, or turned out. My nipples face much more forward than to the side, so in order to use this I will need to see the existing slits shut and rip open the seam to create slits placed properly for me. This is actually a minor thing.<br /><br />The pumping slits are also very small, and the cotton material, while it feels great, is not very stretchy. Why does this matter? Again, perhaps more of a personal issue, but you cannot use a one piece pumping flange! Most standard pumping flanges, like the ones that come with most pumps, are in two pieces. I personally had to order a small size flange, which doesn't come in two piece. This will be easily solved when I create my own slits, but still a little annoying.<br /><br />The big issue: the pumping slits on my particular bra are completely off center, and don't even match up with each other! Of course I discovered this after I had already started to rip the seams and mark the new slits, so I can't return this, but see the attached photo to see what I mean. I put the tape measure there to show that they are literally an inch off from each other, but you can see from the center seam that the slits are totally placed differently. Even if the other issues weren't an issue, that to me is just unacceptable, and I would return this product if I still could.<br /><br />That being said I can't, and I am now going to make the best of a bra I hoped would be much more. With a few alterations it should work out for me, but be aware of these potential issues before you buy.es before you buy.
B000XT30G4|5|Excellent product!!!
B0019UAN5C|4|It's a really durable mat. This is the longest lasting bath mat I've had so far, I had to discard the previous two because of molding issues.<br />It's not as tacky as others I've seen, but I don't agree with some of the other reviews, it's far better than just the tub alone.<br />My daughter went through an Elmo phase and I've had it for two years now, however after ever use I have to religiously take it off and stick it to the wall vertically so it can drip dry every night.<br />I've had absolutely no smell issues, however two years later I've noticed that there are splots of mildew appearing inbetween the Elmo and shells (wasn't aware that they were two separate pieces of plastic affixed to each other but they are... a shell came off today and I could see the mildew behind it). That being said, I'm going to have to discard it because I can't access the mildew to scrub it.<br />I don't regret buying it, it worked great for me- I don't think any mat is mildew free because of the environment it sits in, so if you need a mat for a while it's great as long as you dry it every night. If I was going to get another mat I wouldn't mind buying it again however I don't know if I'd buy it online though. I got it cheaper through babies r us with their typical 20% coupon.
B000JOT2RO|1|Great idea but won't suction to our wood table or formica counter top.  Only suctions to smooth plastic top of highchair. And have to resuction to highchair several times during meal.
B000H1MRJO|4|I am a grandmother who enjoys having my grandsons stay with me,  These cots offer a good sleeping option and can be stowed away when not needed.  They would work well in a hotel room as well.  The only thing that would make them better is if the legs locked flat.  They stay open okay but I would like the security of a latch,
B001XUIEFO|4|These mats are thick and colorful. I did not notice any odor when they arrived and they are easy to wipe down with a damp cloth or cleaning wipes.  The only thing is that they are pricey and I had to order two sets for our living room.  Our whole house has hardwood floors so if the price were lower I would've bought two more sets for our front room. Instead I'm using a foam mat from another retailer that is much thinner.
B004K6LNYC|5|I have tried a number of cart covers for both of my boys and this is by far the best.  It is super portable, fits on just about anything and is easy to wash.  I always keep one in the diaper bag and one in my car. LOVE it!
B003JLJAWQ|4|Really cute, convenient, and easy to keep clean.
B002FIROM2|4|I have a special needs 7 yr. old that loves to run away from me. He is very fast. I needed something for Dorney Park. This looked great. I had it on him for 5 minutes and he was gone in a second. He took it off, just as fast. Its not meant for an older child. (was hoping it would work) Its also very short, which was a good thing. I am very limited for ideas. They do not make a stroller for over 60lbs.except for a maclaren that costs about $500.00. I guess my search continues. This would be perfect for a toddler.
B001A67AE2|3|I was surprised because they are teething and I thought for sure they would hold on to this and be able to chew. They are only 4 1/2 mo this and I bet they will use it later.
B0018Z35DA|4|We are on our third \\"Soother\\"; each time the fish stopped swimming.  It was NOT a battery issue.  We always change the batteries first.  It's not been all bad.  The manufacturer \\"Kids II\\" has always been responsive and usually will send us a new unit.  For us it's worth the effort because our baby loves the soother.  Yes, it's annoying that they break; but the customer service is fantastic.  I love that they stand behind their product. For those that say these are battery hogs -  try rechargeables.   We keep a supply of \\"C\\" and \\"AA\\" which are the most common for baby toys.  Good luck!
B00S2A8FAM|4|Love the diaper bags!!
B0033UWSYK|1|Too many ties. It takes me so long to tie and untie that I don't use the ties at all. Pointless.
B009M63NVG|5|Love these containers for my baby's food. They don't crack open, easy to clean and perfect sizes
B00GU2WAIW|5|This was easy to install and holds a bunch of stuffed animals.  I love that the holes for connecting to the hooks are reinforced with metal rings.  :)  Very pleased with this product.
B000RPNF46|5|We received these socks, and they are just adorable. I love having some solid color socks as well as the ballet slipper socks. We have  gotten so many complements!! And the no skid bottoms are great as our daughter loves to practice standing. Much recommended from us.
B000RFCXIK|5|A very economic pack.  I only use them to store formula so far and the lids are secure and never split.
B006ZVV0P2|3|I have an infinity x80 and the bottom strap does not fit around the seat.  And u cannot adjust the strap
B00GNOG9KC|3|I have a feeling I got damaged bottles. The nipple is supposed to shrink while the baby drinks so that he will inhale less air, but it doesn't happen with these bottles. I have another Tommee Tippee bottle that I bought separately where it does happen..
B001OC5UMQ|5|Finally a gate that is durable & very functional. Easy to install & the kids finally can open & close it without a problem.
B002NUV82E|4|This &#34;bra&#34; is great for hands-free pumping. I ordered according to their sizing chart though and the small is almost too small (I'm currently a 34C, full time nursing). Otherwise I love it. I can use my hands to massage and help express more milk during pumping.The key to increasing your supply is emptying the breast each &#34;feeding&#34; and the pump alone doesn't accomplish that. So that would be hard to do that without this bra. I gave it 4 stars because of the sizing, but it does the job so I like it.
B005RVYC4C|3|Not as form fitted as terry cloth cover. The fabric is a great pattern but fairly crispy in texture. Overall just ok not great.
B00005CARW|5|Love these liners--quick prep, easy feeding and makes bottle clean up a breeze, especially if you forget a bottle in the car or find one under the bed from a late night half awake feeding--you don't have to throw the bottle away because of the yuck.
B00H5OJM58|4|The bag is nice and has great space/compartments, but it won't stay closed.
B000K1MZMU|1|We were very excited to order the Walking Wings for our 8 month old. As soon as it arrived, we wrapped the walking wings around him, velcroed and snapped it shut, and then went about our first \\"walk.\\" After only 3 steps, my son stumbled forward a bit. His stumble caused one of the fabric straps on the Walking Wings to rip totally off - a clean break at the seam. Our son immediately fell to the ground. Luckily, the fall was not hard, as the other strap remained in place. However, other babies may not be so lucky. We had this product a total of 3 minutes before it broke and put our son in harms way. I would not waste the money. <br />
B0098LAUOI|5|Now this is bag I want to carry! I'm not using this for baby, just as a purse. It has a nice sturdy strap, and compartments to separate things. It also has an insulated compartment for my cold water bottle. I usually have a bottle of frozen water that I can sip from as it melts, it's just enough. This insulated compartment keeps it from melting too fast and getting warm. The bag is plenty big enough to carry all my stuff. It also has a small compartment I can carry my keys in, I can even clip them to the little strap to keep them right where I put them! Overall an excellent purchase.
B001WAJVZM|4|We decided on this product after looking at the product line offered by Puj. The Puj product lineup is made from a foam that is sift but does not seem that it will rove very durable.<br /><br />After comparing this product to the Puj at Buy Buy Baby this item was an easy choice. We then ordered it from Amazon for the awesome price!<br /><br />The item installs easily over the faucet and functions exactly as expected. I would buy this product again.
B001T7PO0Y|4|I purchased it as a holiday gift for my 6 month old niece. She loves making it squeak. It is very cute, but a little 'softer' than I expected.
B00IVNDZ8M|5|My daughter loved it 💘
B00FLXNIXM|4|Legs don't fit quite as snug as some others, but that always depends on your child's build.  Otherwise, they're great and we still use them often.
B0052OR0ES|1|These appear to be made on a homemade machine. It took two people to get the letters off the paper successfully. Some of the letters were stretched or folded in on each other while trying to get them off the paper and on to the wall. It was way too much of a stressful process to be worth the time and effort.
B00AV53YNY|5|The stainless bottle is so much better than plastic or glass. I just wish there was a way you can see how much their drinking. But we do absolutely love these bottles and will continue to purchase this brand.
B00R7T0M7I|4|Be aware.. this is more of a hot pink color than light pink as it looks online.  Super cute though!
B004Y426MI|5|Thank you for the prompt delivery of the Fold Activity Gym and Playmat.<br />This is a gift for my brothers baby that is due any day and they loved it.
B00PF84AM6|5|Favorite bottle brush!
B00BMXEZ7I|5|I love this diaper. I usually use Bumgenius and have had no leaks. I decided to try this one and I am so happy I did. It is super soft inside and out. A little bulky but I expect that with it being minky. I plan to buy lots more!
B00L9C7V50|5|attractive for kids
B00SW0LGJE|5|I have 3 kids six years old and under and bath toy storage is a pain in my butt.  I really like this little mesh bag because it allows the toys and itself to dry quickly so I can relocate it to the closet when they're not in use (we don't do baths every single night and I just get annoyed seeing the toys hanging there for some reason... it's also good to be able to put them away if we're just doing a quick rinse and don't have time for playing).  We use mostly solid vinyl figures in the tub so that we don't have to worry about hollow toys getting moldy, and those things can get kind of heavy.  I've been really surprised the mesh has held up strong to the weight!  The suction cups included are strong as well and haven't fallen at all.  One other thing I love about the mesh bag versus a hard plastic holder is that I can just throw it in the washing machine if it gets icky!  Couldn't be easier. I bought this with a  promotional code to test out this time, but I will probably be buying more in the future for baby shower gifts!
B00BXE5NZE|5|I have 2 1/2 YO twins and an older child so I have been through my share of sippy cups. I have to say these are the best. They do not leak at all. My children do not have a hard time getting the liquid out.<br /><br />Only tip is to buy a nipple brush to clean the removable valve and the inside of the spout. If not cleaned properly milk will curdle in there. I had to enforce this to my Nanny and household several times as the twins health are at stake.<br /><br />Like other reviews my only gripe is the base is too large to fit in most cup holders (their stroller and my cup holders in my car). To combat this issue I attach these straps I bought a while back and attach them so the cups do not fall in commute.<br /><br />Other than that these are great!
B00A0ID90A|4|pretty good. our kid sits on it well enough. getting him to actually use it is another matter!
B004T7KQ0Y|4|I'm due to give birth soon and received this as a gift. It's super cute! I love bunnies so this is just perf! It's soft too so I'm sure my baby's gonna love it when he arrives. :)
B004TA93AU|3|I haven't rated anything poorly before but this crib rating took me forever to consider. When I had purchased this crib 4 months ago I read tons of great reviews. The pictures looked fantastic and even though I did read about the changing pad issue and the mattress height I was willing to do some research to fix these. I regret this.<br /><br />1. Our crib came in a giant box that weighed at least 100 lbs. It was easy to push it into our nursery but be warned- it's heavy.<br /><br />2. Unfortunately, we did not inspect the crib when it arrived. In fact we did not look at it until we opened it up to put it together (3 months after we purchased it). The main reason for this was because the box was massive and heavy. I was already 7 months along with complications so my assistance was useless. When we did open it up we found 2 huge chips on the exterior boards that are definitely noticeable. We were able to cover them up however I recommend checking the box/pieces as soon as you can for damage. This seemed to be an issue in other reviews.<br /><br />3. Assembly, was pretty straightforward. As mentioned above because of my condition during pregnancy I was not able to assist except for putting dowels in and holding pieces in line for my husband. We got all the way to the end before we realized we forgot to attach the secure mattress holder... -.-<br /><br />4. Mattress height is an issue. I'm 5'5&#34; and currently 39.5 weeks along. I definitely cannot reach the mattress without facing away from the crib and doing a side scoop. I know I will lose weight but this is going to be an uncomfortable reach. Thank goodness we're using a bassinet when he arrives. Anyone under 5'9&#34; will at least need 2 mattresses in this crib when you place the baby in there.<br /><br />5. The changing pad. I read previous reviews that people used the LA Baby 30&#34; pad but this pad does not work. The pad measures 15.5&#34; x 27.5&#34;. It will not fit without cutting a few inches off the foam. You'll need to find a cover that will fit a 28&#34; pad which I have not found still. I also read that people had to use the changing pad directly from the manufacturer, AFG, however when I look that pad up it has so many horrible reviews. The pad is only 1&#34; thick (or should I say thin) and it's not contoured. Very flimsy/flat pad. Very disappointed with the changing pad issue. I am still looking for a pad or idea to fix this. I left a question in the forum above however as of this point in time- no one has found a pad that fits or they recommend using a towel. If anyone has found a decent pad (at least more than an inch thick) please let me know.<br /><br />6. The look... this crib LOOKS fantastic! I love the white clean finish. The storage space is great for anyone that is low on space in the nursery (the main reason we looked at this crib). It's very sturdy and easy to move around. The drawer space is small though. The bottom two large drawers can hold fitted crib sheets and a quilt. The smaller drawers on the side can hold burp cloths, blankets, etc.. however not a massive amount. My husband and I purchased a wooden storage organizer with wicker bins in addition for diapers, onesies, blankets, etc... that we needed more space for.<br /><br />7. The design of the crib does make it difficult to use standard items i.e... changing pad, mattress, and crib bedding as well. We bought a cute bedding set that I absolutely loved however when we tried tying the bedding set to the crib we immediately noticed an issue. The changing pad on the side prevents you from tying any bedding up without installing a hook or gluing velcro pads (not something we wanted to look at or have our son get his hands on). We were able to bypass this by overlapping the bedding however it does not look as perfect and pristine as it should but we were ok with this as long as it was secure and no loose parts hung off. You might need to check your crib bedding measurements and how it will attach to the crib before you purchase it.<br /><br />All in all the LOOK and functionality of the crib is great. I would give it 5 stars based on this. However the mattress, changing pad, and non-standard design requires special order items and/or no available fix. I haven't tried the toddler mattress yet (since we have not had him) however that was another issue I read in another review. There is no mattress currently available when you convert the crib to a toddler bed.<br /><br />I am not trying to talk anyone out of purchasing this crib however I would read through all the reviews and consider the pros and cons before making your purchase. This crib will definitely stand out and bring your nursery together. We're happy with the crib just disappointed with some of the design- mainly the changing pad.ach to the crib before you purchase it.<br /><br />All in all the LOOK and functionality of the crib is great.

B00083HK0M|5|This was a cheap pail and works just as good as the expensive ones. Had it for 2 years and it still works great. We use to use it for disposables but now we have cloth diapers and it works fine for those too
B00U1QCMA4|5|Product as described and very nice
B0011URFRE|5|5 STARS is not enough to rate this one. I'm a mother of 2 girls under 4, so we had to buy 2 so they would match. :) We originally purchased Eddie Bauer car seats for our first daughter, and this one is by far WAAAY BETTER! These carseats are SUPERIOR in many ways: cushion, materials used, safety/comfort features. It has 3 reclining positions! The head rest grows with your child and wraps around enough for them to rest their head when they fall asleep. It fits like a cockpit, they look snug and feel much safer in these car seats. My oldest can't unbuckle the 5-point harness anymore! She loves the fact that the straps have cushiony wraps around them, and the buckle on the crotch has a protective cover for their groin area. Read the instruction manual, it's in plain language, with clear instructions and pictures, it even has a separate manual in spanish.  I can't believe what a good deal we got, we won't have to buy another car seat since it converts to a booster seat, safe for up to 100 lbs. I highly recommend this carseat! Thanks Graco!!!!  Sonia from Katy, TX
B00EEJOV3A|2|One of the straws smelled like chemicals.  Disgusting
B003U5UDXQ|5|My daughter chewed on this as soon as we put it on the carrier.  She new right away. :D   Love it!
B00171WXII|3|Everyone told me these were amazing so I got one. It is OK, it does the job, but not amazingly better than the blue bulb syringe I was given at the hospital, which works just fine. Maybe I'll get better at it with time, but I am overall underwhelmed.
B004HFQOLI|5|Everything sí Ok. I am very happy about te productos. Thanks. Kind regards. I Will recomend you. Thank you so much.
B00DYOQKJO|5|MAM Anti-Colic Bottle<br /><br />These bottles are great. They do break down into 6 separate parts which can lead to problems with multiple bottles being cleaned. If however you only have 1 baby and are using all the same flow rate of nipples then it is easy to assemble them back together without too much concern for mis-matching parts.<br /><br />The design makes it really easy to thoroughly clean the insides of the bottles. MAM recommends microwave steam sterilizing but I prefer good old fashioned washing with soap and warm water. You do not need a bottle brush to clean these but it is helpful to have a large bottle bristle to make it faster.<br /><br />The anti-colic design is wonderful and works well enough. It’s never a perfect technology with every new baby bottle design but this one it pushing the envelope. Unexpectedly impressed.
B00003TL7P|5|I have had the Diaper Champ for about 3 months now and I have yet to be disappointed. It's easy to change and holds a lot more diapers than the Diaper Genie. I also like that you can use regular trash bags. I even use the Diaper Champ to store my cloth diapers and it works great. Sometimes the cloth diapers get snagged, but it works itself out with a flip of the handle. The Diaper Champ also holds in the odor well and I sometimes go days without changing it. The Diaper Champ is a great buy!!
B001IYEZNK|5|very resistent, incredibly good quality
B0088N4C8C|4|I love this skip hop cat lunch kit.  It even has a little silver mouse zipper pull.  So adorable!  The only thing it is missing is a mesh side pack for a drink bottle.
B001F37M6Q|5|I've been looking for new bath toys for my 3 year old for a while.  I finally had to throw out all the squirters and other toys that collect water and eventually mildew.  I promised my son new bath toys but didn't want to buy more squirters just to throw them out.<br /><br />He loves these blocks.  They float really well and when wet they stick to the floating base and each other nicely so he is able to build some fairly nicely.  The blocks are a nice size, large enough for my preschooler to pick up easily.<br /><br />The blocks come with a mesh bag which technically can hold the whole set, but if you want the base to fit in the bag, you do need to put that in first, before the blocks.<br /><br />Overall this is a great bath toy for any young child who likes to build and any parent who is looking for toys that don't hold water.
B001OC5UNK|2|I had not been shopping for baby gates in 10 years and nought this for a new puppy.  This gate is very flimsy.  I would never trust this gate for a child.  The pressure mechanism is really bad and cheap.  It is supposedly designed for the opening width.  I would not recoomend this gate
B000Q7G3VM|5|I looked everywhere for a child friendly photo book. This was big enough to hold a lot of pictures.  She loved it!
B00CQ9UUK8|5|Love it!
B005I19LOC|4|We purchased this to replace a much more expensive video monitor (the victim of a fatal drop - my fault!) We almost shelled out the extra $150 above the Graco price to get the one we had first, but after a few weeks of using the Graco, I'm glad we saved the $$$. The Graco monitor is fine for what we need. The viewing screen is on the small side, but adequate, and has a nice wide base so I don't worry about it tipping over once I set it down. The night vision is not hi-res, but I can see everything I need to about the child: sleeping positions, where the blankets are, whether he is up or down, the length of latest attempts at the long jump, and how many laps he is doing around the crib before falling asleep. The sound is fine, but on the quiet side even at the highest volume. The camera itself has somewhat limited range of swivel motion on its stand, which might prove tricky for setting up in new places when we travel.  After a few weeks of use, I recommend this monitor with the only caveat being that I can't speak to its longevity, but it looks solidly built, for what it is.
B002ZZ1GMY|4|these are very well made training pants.  We bought Xsmall after finding that size Small was too loose on our 4.5 yr old.  He is on the tall and slim side, just under 40lbs.  Size Xsmall fit him great and has some room to grow.
B00D7MTHIE|5|Is a nice medium sized diaper bag that can be used for more. Has 3 pockets for quick access and 1 outside zipper pocket. Inside has 3 pockets good for organizing.
B004LWZZ76|5|Seriously, they aren't that exciting. They don't really do anything other than sift water through tiny holes. But my baby daughter loves these, especially the two little bird/penguin/walrus thingies. She will even insist on taking them out of the bath to play with after bath time.
B00AB795DA|3|It's cute, but i'm not sure if it really works! :)
B00FZKSF9I|5|arrived on time, color is just as shown - thank you!
B00004TFLB|4|We got this for my son. He's now 9 months old and enjoys pushing all the buttons and moving it around. It seems to be pretty sturdy and tough to damage. One downside, no volume control which is usually something I appreciate in toys. (Volume control and an OFF switch!) This toy is loud and a volume control would make it better.
B00076SL0I|3|We bought this to keep in the diaper bag while we were potty training.  I thought it would be great when we were at a public potty or at a friends house.  Not so much...  It did not fit a single public potty.  It made it almost easier for her to fall with the seat than without.  It did fit some of the \\"home\\" potties we tried it with, but I just was not that impressed.  Our daughter loves that elmo is on it and it is very compact.  I just wish it would fit to make it less likely that she would fall in a disgusting public potty.
B00J7KU3LA|5|Awesome product! My granddaughter would cry as soon as she saw her old aspirator - she giggles when I use this one.  Highly recommend it.
B00NUHZAVO|5|As a pumping mom who has to commute between 2 offices and travel regularly, this bag is my BFF. Pump is ready to go in a jiffy, and you just throw all your milk and BF crap in the refrigerated compartment (obv with an ice pack). It's pricey for a bag (but I'm a cheap person), but worth it. My only question is: Why is this the only company that makes a bag like this?
B0045Y148O|5|This chair is perfect for my 15 mo old. She was so excited to have her own place to sit and gravitated to it right away. We may be purchasing a second one for the family room. Highly recommend this chair. Great sturdy construction with a fun pattern for an excellent price compared to those other plastic kids chairs.
B000V44B4G|4|This is a great product and it converts to any chair into booster chair.  I highly recommend this product.
B000AV5LZ8|5|I LOVE THIS!!!  My two year old granddaughter who is very small for her age can manage this easily by herself and can take it off the toilet and store it next to it.  It is a comfortable seat when toilet work takes time and it is easy to clean and remove when adults need to sit.  I have used other brands and definitely recommend this the most
B006ZVV0P2|1|Great concept, poor quality and not durable at all. I just threw one out that ripped all the way across the top pockets, after 8 only months. As the saying goes, &#34;buy cheap, buy twice!&#34; I'll be looking to replace with a more durable product.
B0091E31JS|5|Good hands free soap/sanitizer dispenser.  Only thing was the foaming type sanitizier doesn't foam up, but not really an issue with the dispenser.
B00G9NOYZY|5|applying and reapplying sunscreen can be such a pain, plus it's not great for their skin. Having a full body suit including feet makes a world of difference and it's easy to zip them in and out for diaper changes. My first one was a hand me down that saw a lot of use and we used it a ton, it's still in good enough shape to be passed on.
B004JU0H6O|4|It fits perfectly into our Graco Pack n Play Rittenhouse Cuddle Cove line.  We've been using it in the bassinet portio. Of the pack n play since both baby and I didnt like the mat that came with it. Baby is now 2.5 months and has been sleeping daily in the bassinet portion. She just hit 12lbs so with the mattress we're hitting the max weight capacity and exploring other options , like a crib.  We're inthe process of moving and didn't want to fully commit to a crib till we moved in to the new house (which should be within the month). My only complaint is that due to re usage, te mattress has begun to sunk in where baby has been laying.  We even tried flipping the matress over.
B00003TL7P|5|I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!  It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don't have to stock up on refill's or run to the store when you realize you don't have anymore.  There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!
B001ABZGU2|5|our son loves this toy.<br />descriptions matched expectations<br />I would definitely recommend this , great product can use it with other toy or by itself.
B00PRX6BZ8|5|This combo is awesome and works perfectly!!!! Great buy
B005IV0CF4|5|Love that this milk dispenser is vertical instead of the usually pie shaped dispenser.  Saves much needed room in my diaper bag.  Also FYI -  the top two compartments fit four scoops of powder.
B010KOBPEU|4|Purchased these for my sister, or maybe I should say my new niece. So far they work as intended to block out light and heat. Pretty straight forward product so no surprises here, would recommend for its intended purpose.
B007OGWHFO|5|I like the print of this paper and it is a nice thickness. The paper is good quality, what I was looking for and arrived in a timely manner
B00HO02V4M|3|Good product for tub, adheres well and dries nicely. I was counting on the &#34;soft&#34; description and that's where the lower rating comes from. It's not soft. It's functional.
B0042D69V0|5|Excellent product.
B000CSQ71G|5|My son has really enjoyed playing with this toy for 2 yrs now and has found many other uses for it besides all the things it already offers.  I am really pleased with this purchase.
B002WB14FU|5|I really love my Dutailier chair!  I have been using it since I was pregnant and no other chairs in the house were comfortable.  I love the reclining feature.  Spills wipe up well from the material.
B00AHVR1TK|4|I just recieved the graco ready to grow classic connect but I would like to know if the graco snug rider classic car seat for infants will fit in the carriage
B003EEM7X2|4|We bought this bed for our 3 month old daughter's new crib. Matters has nice finishing and fits perfectly into Delta brand crib. As a package I also received waterproof sheet but not the crib sheet. Mattress has good support & springs are well sewn. But it could have been little more firmer & little less bouncy. However Our daughter loves it & she has been able to move around pretty easily on the mattress on her own.  Mattress is finished with a breathable material and it is lighter to lift & change the covers conveniently at the same time by a single person. We have been using it for the past 3 months & I have no complaints.<br /><br />For the price I paid I feel little disappointed with mattress's firmness & support that's available in other competitive brands. That's why I am giving a 4 stars also I didn't receive crib sheet which was part of the bundle. If Lajobi reduces price go ahead & buy it. Its a good mattress.
B000X5J1H0|2|VERY difficult to get tops on these glasses.......actually virtually impossible!!!! And for the price they want for these, I say it's not worth it. The older cups like these were GREAT!
B000ZK3YBC|4|I don't have any issues with spills, but I have a very short distance between the countertop and the freezer. The sticks are easy to remove by twisting the whole tray.<br />Be careful as we have warped our first set by putting hot water on it to clean. The plastic is quite flimsy (in order to be able to twist it) and it will simply bend and warp if you pour hot water on it.<br />I have bought a second set so I can say I'm satisfied with the product!
B000S35QLC|1|So the deal is I bought this to be used outside US. By Outside US I mean almost any other country that uses 220V AC electricity. There is no specification here saying the device only supports 120V AC. Usually most devices that have AC/DC inputs support both 220 and 120V AC. This is not the case. The people I gave it as a present had to buy additional transformator to change the voltage. This wasn't going to be the case if instead of proprietary Sony rechargeable batteries, there were AA or AAA type batteries. But no... companies like Sony and Apple just love to have proprietary standards. I hate you for that Sony!
B00NT80WQW|5|Great onesie! I was looking (for awhile) for a camisole onesie for my daughter to wear under summer dresses and tank tops. This was perfect! They wear and wash beautifully. Worth the extra money :) I wound up buying more! Def recommend.
B001H9NXJ8|5|good
B005C9ODEI|5|Very nice, fits most anywhere and has a toy which my daughter loves, def reccomend it. Great price.
B001CFACMI|5|This is very helpful for my son (4) while he is in the shower. The shower head is too tall for him and the water gets in his face...so we just move the nozzle down to this, and he can control it better. And he can shower alone! YAY!
B00328CURI|3|The gate is a nice way to fix a baby gate \\"semi-permanently\\" to the wall without using some tension screw device.  I selected this gate for the top of the stairs in a bi-level home, because of the permanent fixture setup, AND because it doesn't narrow your walking path by more than an inch or two, unlike gates that tension themselves in place, which also require you step over something.<br /><br />1.  The screws that come with this gate are garbage.  Throw them out.  Use 2.5 inch or longer wood or drywall screws to affix the gate and the latch to the wall.  You'll burn the heads off or strip the garbage screws that come with it.<br /><br />2.  The gate is held up by two threaded rods that have a hole on the end for a hinge.  You screw in or pull out the bolt from the nut that is inside the gate to adjust width.  The problem is, there is nothing clamping the nut to the gate but the flimsy wood that the gate is made of, and the corners will crack in a month of normal use.  Take the threaded pieces to the hardware store and get a nut for them to put on the outside of the gate and hold tension.  The gate is 100% better, and easier to use with this in place - AND it won't break.<br /><br />The latch sucks - multiplied times 10 if the gate is loose and the additional nuts I mentioned above aren't added.  After using real screws and adding the nuts, the latch is not bad to use, and tricky/strong enough no toddler or child can open.<br /><br />All in all, it's as nice a baby gate as I've seen - just obviously had some corners cut in the hardware department.  It will cost you an extra $2.00 at the hardware store to get good screws and the two additional nuts.
B0050GD2E0|3|Doesn't stay clipped in place very well, falls off when I fold it. As long as I make sure I don't lose it, it gets the job done.
B009YZJ5EO|1|I did not like these bottles at all.  The nipple is really firm which makes it difficult for baby to latch on to.
B001BRI44K|5|I have two boys that are now 4 and 2. It took me forever to find a reliable baby sling. I had looked everywear until finally one day I found this great sling on line. It is very stylish and very sturdy. You can cradle your child in the carrier, face you, or face forward. I have taken this thing everywear. My first son had colic real bad for about 6 months. I could put the carrier on, put my son in the cradle position and be hands free until he fell back to sleep. It has helped me out through many sleepless nights of walking the floor. I think this is a great baby shower gift.
B006I0R8LU|5|Very pleased with the quality of this mirror.  It's plastic for safety, but the image is very clear (which is fortunate, as many a morning I end up applying my makeup using the monkey mirror before work!). My son loves it- he loves looking in the mirror and he will also grab it close to chew on the monkey and frame.  We have a winner!
B00L62FI6W|5|Great product, I love the way it is secured.
B00GJIXT3W|4|Bought for a baby shower she loved it
B001F0RAB6|1|I did not read the packaging correctly & simply assumed these were the drop ins liners.  They are not the same thing. These are so cumbersome & hard to use without causing a leaking problem that we have discontinued using them after using just 2 or 3.  We ordered the correct item we were looking for, the actual drop in liners that drop into the bottle with their own ridge & not the fold over flap that this item has.
B004K6LNWO|3|It is not safe when being made in China (lead, PVC,...found in product before). I will go for \\"Made in USA\\"
B00TP3Z8KA|5|Fits an old cradle mattress perfectly.
B003D8HH0W|1|As I sit here with half a sippy cup's worth of milk soaked into my lap I have to wonder, \\"What were the makers of this cup thinking?\\"  Unlike the other reviewer stated, the nipple itself seemed to seal just fine with me, what was absolutely ridiculous is the way the top seals to the cup itself.  No matter how many times I twist the cap on and off to make sure the seal is perfect the milk inevitably comes out, not in drops, but in a constant stream (not to mention that taking the time to close and reclose the cup while holding my toddler on my hip is a pain in and of itself).  Isn't the whole point of a sippy cup not to leak?  I've seen similar reviews on Toys r' Us.  I just can't understand why the makers of this sippy cup simply didn't turn it sideways to see that the construction is incredibly faulty.  Last time my child used the sippy cup she ended up sitting in a puddle of water in her playpen.  I'm tossing these out tonight!
B00JAJOF3K|3|Simple, light weight design, sturdy.  Great product now that my triplets have stopped throwing their plates on the ground.  The little cup allows a perfect space for dipping sauces allowing my kids to experiment with flavors while they eat.  Wish it stuck to table, the non-slip bottom does not work that well.
B002UD65WM|5|Great covers have lasted me 2 years and do not fade or tear still very soft my baby loves rubbing his face on them
B003TPRD8U|1|Who would ever make a car seat with the harness adjustments in the back of the seat and not linked together? Save your sanity and buy one with the harness adjusting straps that adjust together and are in the front of the seat.
B00H3X7ZXM|1|Kinda nice at first after taking forever to get it positioned just right to see my son. Shakes like crazy the whole time driving and eventually won't stick. Would never recommend.
B001AAE7OY|5|Works great
B0000DEW8N|5|Perfect for our grandson's transition from high chair to big boy chair.  Fastens securely to dining chair & then has additional security belts to fasten around child to keep them from slipping out or falling over.
B0045JKUU2|5|In short, I love this high chair so much that on a day when I didn't even have time to shower, and my older twin had a cold and was clingy and miserable, I still sat down to give this chair a 5 star review.   I bought two of these for our 10-month-old twin girls because they were the right price, got good reviews, and offered basic functionality. I did not expect to ADORE them when we began using them.  I expected all of the following to be great, and it is:  - easy to wipe off/clean the seats including seat cover, frame, and straps  - easy to take the trays on and off and clean them  - easy to change the recline position, which I do frequently -- and while feeding two infants at once  I have not yet folded them down for storage as that would be a waste of time for us at this point.  I will also say that I did not expect to love the toy as much as I do. I thought, whatever, it comes with it, who cares. But it is so much fun. The girls really are fascinated by it and will sit and entertain themselves for maybe 10 minutes, which is just enough to buy me time to get their food ready.  I also initially wrinkled my nose at the colors/design. I prefer a more understated, modern look but we could not justify the $200-300 cost (times two) of high chairs like Stokke. But when these arrived, I will say they are very cheerful and not nearly as tacky as they look online, and they actually brighten up our kitchen nicely. Turns out I like the design!
B002J4U8M0|5|My son loves staring at himself in mirrors so I was looking for a safe, plastic mirror he could use. This one is awesome! It stands on its own and has cute little characters on it to entertain him. He uses it in his crib, on the floor and even on his high chair. He'll sit there and smile at himself! Great product for babies!
B0011ECP9S|5|I really enjoy this item when I am on the road and out of town. I have every option just in case something were to happen
B004PBVHZ2|4|Gave this as a Christmas present to my woman who does a lot of make up for weddings. She seemed very happy with them, but really wants Luise Young brushes next.
B00474BM66|1|I have been nursing for over 4 months and thought that since my letdowns have become less frequent and less forceful I could maybe get away with wearing these during the day. NOPE. While my little one was nursing on one side, I leaked right through the pad on the other side. I had just put the pads in place, so they were fresh and clean. I bet it didn't even hold a teaspoon. I think a folded over paper towel would have held more, to be honest.<br />I'm grateful that the return process was very easy!
B001AS52FY|1|too big and bulky which makes it cumbersome
B000B4SVM4|4|I tried several traditional bouncers and swings before finding this product. My baby didn't like the back and forth motions of the swings we tried and she wasn't content in the bouncer. She never really enjoyed being in this glider while fully awake, but she would fall asleep in it and stay asleep! We ended up using it as a bassinet for her for the first 6-7 months. It was perfect at night!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. 360 degree swivel. You can turn the seat all the way around manually. This was great b/c sometimes my baby liked \\"gliding\\" in different directions. Usually I angled the seat at 30-40 degree angles instead of 90 degree angles so that my baby wasn't swinging just side to side or front to back but a combo of both.<br />2. Portable. I read some reviews that said this was heavy and not easily portable, but I disagree! It's just like carrying a plastic tote, and has handles on the top and bottom of the seat.<br />3. 2 seat positions. The back of the seat can be lifted slightly by fastening a buckle in the back. This was great when my baby got older and the default position seemed too flat. Even in the default position (the seat lying all the way down), the seat is slightly inclined. This worked well for us b/c our baby needed to sleep on an incline b/c of congestion and reflux.<br />4. Washable material. All of the material can be removed easily and washed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sounds. The sound was very loud, even on the lowest setting. We got around this by using other sound devices and placing them on the floor next to the glider.<br />2. Mobile. The mobile is easily removable, which is great, but there's just one position for it and it doesn't seem to hang in the appropriate spot for babies. I read that another reviewer made her own mobiel for this.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />1. Speeds. There are 2 speed settings, and they don't seem too different from each other; however, my baby definitely noticed a difference. The faster speed would upset her when shewas younger and the lower speed would bore her when she was older. I have read a lot of reviews that listed problems with the speed. This is a glider, though, not a swing, so it's supposed to be a little slower and, of course, move differently.<br />2. Battery life. This uses D batteries. I was happy with the battery life, but this is the only thing I use that takes D batteries, so I'm not really sure what the battery life should be. Anyway, we used the glider daily for 7 months and put batteries in it twice.<br />3. Safety straps. There probably should be shoulder straps included for older babies who might be able to use their feet to push themselves out.<br /><br />We ended up really liking this. Again, we used this mostly for sleep. We would put our baby in this while she was awake and she would fall asleep in it. She would take naps in it and also sleep in it all night. We usually turned it off after about an hour of her being in it. If she stirred at night, all we had to do is reach over, turn it on for a few minutes, then she'd be right back to sleep (We kept this next to our bed.)
B003OBYTO0|4|Easy to install and remove... My girls loved it
B0097GUCZ6|5|This bra makes pumping so stress free.  I place the bottles in the cups before I zip it on.  It is easily adjustable so I know that as I loose the pregnancy weight, I can adjust the velcro in the back so that this bra still works for me.
B004RSTXXQ|1|We like the product. It is like shown. The general quality is better than Ikea but in the same price range.<br /><br />We are nevertheless not happy because we found while we assembled it, which is a little complicated by the way! several scratches and marks which are partially on prominent spots of the established product. So that they are visible forever. The scratches were partly painted by the manufacturer, but still very clear to see.<br /><br />I tried to communicate with the seller but got no answer. Since we build it up and the baby is due soon, we don't returned it.
B003D7N1YE|3|Turns out my Jeep jogging stroller isn't technically a jogging stroller, but just looks like one. So, it doesn't fit exactly the same, but in a way, fits a little better because it covers the handle bar too. It just doesn't velcro to anything by the canopy. I haven't had a chance to use it yet either to see how it does in the rain, but appears it will work well. Seems to cover pretty well.
B002L3T9YW|5|Cute teether
B00005U193|3|We bought this chair when our son was 6 mos old, he's now 13 mos. I wish I had bought a different chair. It's true that food gets stuck *everywhere* and it drives me crazy. We even have a cover that goes over the top but it's still messy. The tray doesn't fit into my dishwasher, but that's ok. At least it's removable. I've never adjusted the height or reclined my son, so that feature isn't helpful to me. I do like the wheels, but many other brands have wheels. I've never folded it up. The thing I REALLY DISLIKE is that the tray does not come close enough to my son...there is still a huge gap and food is ALWAYS falling on his lap. You would have to have a really big baby for the chair to properly fit him/her. So, I'm thinking of buying a less expensive chair that fits him properly. Really, it's not worth the extra$$.
B00DLDCZCY|5|I was looking a cheaper alternative to a wool cover, and I stumbled on this.  I decided for the price I would give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It works so well, and is SOOO cute on my daughter.  She is a moderate to heavy wetter and this has not leaked on us yet.  Very pleased with this cover!!  I will be ordering more.
B0083BRD80|4|I was recommended by my friend to get this baby carrier. So I got this when my son was 10 months old. I was thinking would it be too late to get it as he will learn to walk soon. Little did I know that this thing works wonder for us. We use this carrier now for local grocery trips and walks to the parks. Me and my husband take turn wearing it. The straps are super comfy compared to my Infantino baby carrier. My son is now 22 pounds and I don't feel heavy when I put him to sleep or taking him out in this carrier. My son loves to be in the carrier and he always falls asleep in it. I would recommend to any moms that needed a new baby carrier. Great product!
B000067QXB|5|I love the Wrap-N-Ride. I haven't used it with my baby since he isn't due until the end of Feb. I can't wait to use it though. I did have a little trouble fitting it on my Graco Snugride infant seat, I found I had to unthread the strap to get the straps through the slots, but only a minor inconvenience. I wouldn't have a problem if my infant seat was a 5 point harness, but it's only a 3 point (2 year old model.) I hated having to bundle my older son in a bunting then try to buckle him in the seat when he was an infant. I already know this will be so much easier with having to bundle a toddler. Now I'll only have to bundle my oldest, and just put a hat and booties on his younger brother. And on super cold days if we have to go anywhere, I'll just put a light blanket or a light jacket on him. I even found that I could still use the infant head support with the Wrap-N-Ride.
B00I9G9HH4|3|i got this off of the main site and the diapers ok but the customer service is poop.
B001C3MHEQ|3|This bottle warmer gets the job done, but I wish it would warm bottles quicker.  It takes a little over 4 minutes, which can be eternal when you have a screaming baby.  I also have to leave the bottle in a little longer once it's done, because it doesn't warm it up completely.
B00G34TL48|4|Our second g4 for our second kid.  Very sturdy, only complaint is that the buckles can be a bit difficult to maneuver compared with friends' models.  Sucker for the zebra print what can I say.
B00FG8AMHM|4|Love this necklace! I get compliments whenever I wear it, but more importantly my son LOVES to chew on it. He just had his first 2 teeth come in, and this was a great option when we are out & about. I didn't give it 5 stars because the clasp does snag/catch my hair, even when it is in a ponytail. To be fair, I don't know that for safety reasons there is another type of clasp that could be used. It's annoying but doesn't keep me from wearing it. Great purchase- would make a great gift!
B004A8ZS1O|4|We are new to cloth diapering.  The Babykicks is a great diaper to start with.  Even if you still use disposable diapers these are a great item to have.  Especially if you have a kid who likes to take off his diaper.  Wearing these on top will totally foil him.
B00A47VH2O|5|I ordered the dark gray knob covers and they blend in perfectly.  It's difficult to see them until you are right up to the door.  The adults open the doors easily, while the 6-year old struggles with it but gets it open.  The 3- and 2- year olds no longer bother trying to open the doors; they realized quickly that it's an effort in futility. I highly recommend them.
B00EYDTTHE|5|I'm really happy with these bibs.  I find that they are quite large, which I like.  They are bigger than many other bibs I've tried and they plastic inside does make them quite waterproof.  My 7 month old is learning how to drink from a cup and sometimes spills water down his neck and under the bib, but to the extent he drools or spills into the bib it doesn't leak through to his clothing.  I love the two different snap settings-- so much better than Velcro! And I love the colors the bibs come in.  I've washed them 10 times or so and no problems so far.  I do out them in the drier at a lower heat setting and so far they've held up fine.  The only downside is that they do make a bit of a crunchy crinkly sound due to the plast inside, but I've not really been bothered by this.  Just wanted to point that out.
B00DI5NXJE|5|They work just as intended.
B0018Z8BBQ|5|My six month old granddaughter can't quite push the keys herself but that does not keep her from whacking the keys with one chubby fist !!  She loves for us to play the music and stares intently then smiles a big grin when the music plays.
B000C29JYE|5|Lost the one I had, & sure needed in the Texas heat to keep my water cool!  The handle is so good !
B007CTPWXW|3|PROS:<br />EASY TO INSTALL, AND FITS SECURELY, HAS A LOT OF POCKETS<br /><br />CONS: EASILY GETS DIRTY, HARD TO CLEAN AND A BIT EXPENSIVE, CONSIDERING MOST STROLLERS HAVE THIS ALREADY INSTALLED.
B004DC9TB2|5|I purchased this for $329 from Amazon just last October, and now I see it is $599! What is that about?<br />Anyway I do love this stroller! It pushes soooo smoothly, easy to run with! The cover goes down farther than most strollers, completely blocking the sun out of my little one's eyes. It is quite light and opens and closes easily. My 6 month old falls asleep every time I used it.<br />I also like the see through portion on the top so I can peep in as I run / walk to see what she is doing. And if the sun beats in too bright, I cover the &#34;window&#34; with the attached shade. Last month the latch broke when getting my child out and I had to contact customer service which sent me a replacement seat no questions asked and it arrived in about 5 days.
B00J5PRMCA|5|works great for stroller n shopping!!
B00LL38GYW|1|This was a recall item!
B000JIMVV4|5|My daughter loves this!  We have one for day care and one for home.  She loved it from the minute we put it in the crib.  I dare say it is her favorite!
B008PPQ7GI|5|My son was 7months old when he got these and he LOVES them.
B000KNTQQ6|4|After reviewing many different seats, I chose this one for the many features including the comfortable seat padding and the 2 set of cup holders. There is also another version that has night lights in the headrest that you may want to consider if doing a lot of night travel. Overall I am very satisfied however, it does not recline and my son's head will bob while napping. That is the one improvement I would suggest to Evenflo.
B000P0SE4O|5|I researched strollers indepth before settling on MiaModa Energi. I considered several serious jogging strollers like Instep and Bob Revolution, but these were more stroller than I needed, being a walker and not a runner. I've been using my Energi stroller for several months, and people always comment on what a \\"cool\\" stroller it is, and they love the all-wheel suspension. What I love the most beside the \\"coolness\\" factor is the knowledge that my baby is comfortable and safe. The seat is well padded, stroller frame is sturdy, and brakes hold well. Added bonuses are the parent and kid trays, medium sized storage basket, and parent window. I wish the canopy was a bit larger - it shields the sun most of the time, but could cover a bit more. Also, the stroller weighs in at 25 lbs, and can be a bear to use on longer walks, especially going uphill. But foir more general everyday use, it has been ideal, and folds up small enough to easily fit in the back of my minivan.
B004X8GJPA|5|These are a must-have for anyone with little ones.  They fit perfectly into any Kalecom potty and are fantastic for travel.
B001PN82LA|5|Great Products nothing else comes in second place....There are so many uses for this wonderful product. I am getting my friends hooked like I am. And we do not have a baby...
B003I867WQ|5|I is practical to carry the baby shopping
B00BEVSSDA|5|good
B0017VM3QU|5|This was so easy to attach to my Valco Tri Mode stroller and hold my Peg Perego Primo Viaggio carrier.  Such an inexpensive solution to create a travel system that I can easily convert or use as needed in an instant. Love it and the stability.
B00NFY534Q|4|The bibs are great so far!  The fabric is even softer than I imagined (super soft cotton on print side and white micro-fleece (?) on the other) and the dual snaps to grow with your baby is such a great idea.  These are keeping me from changing my daughters outfit multiple times a day due to her drooling - now I just grab a dry bib if needed!  The seller was very responsive and even checked in with me via email to make sure my order arrived and to make sure I was satisfied.
B00JU9B9QG|1|We love the product, but were very disappointed when we ordered these thinking it was  6 packs of 2... very disappointed to find it was one pack of 2. The description needs to be clearer on that - and why they are charging so much for one pack of two? They were returned and we will purchase from another vendor. Our little one loves the Y-cut and it is the only nipple that flows fast enough for our chunky monkey! (6 mo and 23lbs.... he's an eater!)
B0052QYLUM|5|Amazing product. Wish it was easier to mount though.
B00HNV8M90|2|Ok, but not as good as I expected. They're hard to handle, very flimsy, but they stick pretty good. We haven't even used ours becuase I didn't like them enough
B0034H4J4O|2|The clasp on the front of this support does not stay closed so my son's head kept bobbing around whenever he fell asleep.  I've thought about sewing a bigger clasp or even a set of magnets that may help it stay closed.
B0019UBM1Q|2|Thought it was cute but when it arrived it smelled really bad.  How some plastic smells toxic.  I thought it would go away but we've had it for over a month and it still smells bad.
B00IYCFI26|5|These are colorful, nicely designed, and so far, are easy to use and remove, at least once.
B00IN8OIX6|5|good
B004GCJMLG|5|My husband and I are working on becoming foster care licensed and we have to lock up EVERYTHING.  This makes having locked cupboards a breeze and it is very nice to not look like we have locked cupboards.  Anyone with kids or needing to lock a cupboard for safety reasons should check these out.
B00FU2JUGS|4|These things are $10 everywhere else on planet earth. Its just a piece of plastic with rubber feet. Dont buy this as it is clearly over priced.
B004XIRSU0|5|Our car was totaled in an accident and the insurance company replaced our carseats. We immediately purchased another Nautilus. We love this carseat!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-fully padded. Many high-back booster chairs are skimpy on the padding. But this carseat has great padding, especially the side impact pads on the sides of the headrest.<br />-weight range! this carseat is rated from 20 pounds to 100 pounds! that's crazy! we have our 15 month-old rear facing, but I know that we will be making a safe decision when we turn her around and transfer her into this carseat when she turns 2.<br />-easily adjustable headrest. you don't even have to take this carseat out of the car to adjust the headrest! I love this. you can use 1 hand to squeeze the button and move the headrest up or down.<br />-cupholder! &, even better, a cupholder that my daughter can easily reach and use! wonderful!<br />-the color. We bought the green and silver carseat this time. our other one is black and gray. my daughter loves the colors. they are very classy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I don't know why but I have had problems with the tightening strap on both Nautilis carseats that we have had. I have a friend who can easily pull the strap to tighten the harness, but mine never work that way. I am always tugging and yanking very hard to tighten the harness. I do not know why, but it is frustrating.<br /><br />We love this carseat! & it's a great carseat for the price.
B005PGWE6C|5|We tried to use the cheapy one that comes with the carseat, but it just wasn't small enough for our newborn's head. Get this one, and use both to start with. He couldn't support his head on his own, but this was just the help he needed. We didn't have to worry about his head bobbing around or falling forward nearly as often. It's so easy to snap into the seat and you can just leave it in there for the next trip. Even if you decide to get a different brand, at least get something to support baby's head.
B00E7B20SI|5|This is a little pricey, but WAY cheaper than buying a new car that has AC vents in the back. I feel good knowing that when we get in the car & it's cold/hot my kids get Collen's down/ warmed up faster.
B004044LD4|1|my friend bought it last week and didn't like the product. poor poor workmanship...<br />definitely will not recommend to other people
B000IDSLOG|3|Just another teether in the box of tricks we have bought for our son. Nothing special to him. He doesn't prefer it to any other.
B0038JE60U|5|Ive been through four bottle drying racks and this is my fav! I dont have a problem with there being no draining mechanism. I wash my bottles at night, assemble and put them away in the morning, spray the drying rack down with some 7thGen all pourpose cleaner, rinse it and just plop it upsde down on a dishtowel to dry it. It sounds like a lot, but it take two seconds. I can fit 6 Dr. Browns with all the accessories, 4 5oz medelas, 2 bowls and all the lids and nipples for everything on it. I love it. It doesnt take up that much space (but I think that depends on the amount of counter space you actually have to work with) it gets the job done and it fits a lot of stuff! I love love love it.
B0048SOBGO|5|We purchased these labels for use at daycare 6 months ago and they have stayed affixed to the bottles perfectly.  We wash, scrub and steam these bottles and have had no issues with them coming off at all.  I read a review that said that the ink didn't stay on...my guess is that it was user error. (You have to lift the tab and write under then seal; not write on the top of the label.)  We nubmer the bottles as well as putting our daugher's name on them to keep track of where we are with her feedings which is great.  Love this prodcut and will be buying more for her new bottles and sippy cups.
B001OI28CK|3|Used for less than a month and peeling. 👎🏼 Also a hassle to get on.  Better than ruining the pillow I guess.<br /><br />Update: used oreck fabric shaver and it is like new.  Sad I had to buy a fabric haver just to use it, but it's better than paying for a whole new pillow case.  For the price you'd think the material would be better quality.
B005UV0UEA|5|I wanted something simple and easy. That's what I got! I was able to put it together on my own simple simple. It did have a strong &#34;factory&#34; smell the first day or so but it quickly went away. I believe leaving it open for awhile to air out helped a lot. My son is not born yet so I don't know if he will love it or not but so far I do! I used these with my other kids and they loved them too so I cant see why he wouldn't
B004R5PHUW|5|I bought this blanket for my new born and it lasted 2 1/2 years its her favorite blanket can't sleep without it. It got a lil burnt so we had to retire it n replace it with a new one but she still loves her blanky.
6065005118|5|I have a lot of people asking me if I painted these on my wall.. I think you can tell they are stickers, but at first glance I guess it's not too noticable
B0039VHG1S|5|These truly are the softest wipes I have bought, love 'em. I wish I could afford for all my cloth wipes to be these.<br /><br />I have only washed them about half a dozen times so far but they look like they will hold up really well. Didn't shrink or wrinkle after washing at all and are just super soft, great for a sensitive bum such as during a bad diaper rash time.
B008VUGJ74|3|Bib looks nice but is backed with satin material.  Not at all practical for feeding purposes.  Put it on a teddy bear.
B001IACJQ4|3|Worked as advertised thought was missing a button, should've gotten a darker cushion though
B008LXVEPI|5|I just got mine today!  I previously had a Petunia Pickle Bottom, but it was time to be replaced.  One thing I like about this bag is the new quiet magnetic closure and snaps as opposed to the Velcro that my previous bag had.  I also love the waterproof changing mat & that it is a bright yellow!  So Cute!  My old bag had a bolder pattern on it; this time around I wanted something a little more subtle & classy.  I love the look of this bag!  This is a great diaper bag!
B004XBUDZE|5|This item is everything we thought it would be gives the baby room a nice touch. Made with ceramic. Good quality and detail
B000A88JZA|5|Purchased a used pump.  :-(  Needed new parts, since we just tossed all the parts that came with it out.  This was a great replacement.  Had no problems since.
B00CXJ94KS|4|Giving as a gift. Looks very cute, but is very small. Could easily fit in a diaper bag for convenient travel. I would have been disappointed if I had paid more than $15 for this item.
B00A2429GW|3|The ornament itself is adorable.  However, the marker provided is a like a white board marker, so any personalization wipes right off.
B00R1SD94S|4|Great pillow for use during pregnancy!
B00LK5J73U|2|I like the wide view of this mirror, but the design is pretty terrible. For something that should be incredibly simple to assemble, it takes a good deal of time because the pieces don't fit together easily. Additionally, they fall apart without much pressure applied, and I am nervous that it will actually fall off onto my baby if I hit a large bump. Another downfall is that this mirror is not secure enough, so it vibrates constantly when the car is in motion. This makes it tough to look at, and pretty much just annoying.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this mirror, but its been constant frustration since I opened the package.
B005HJ29YE|4|This item is ok but does not resemble an owl. Large item that looks more like a big pink Tweety Bird. Granddaughter can reach it and seems to like it. Also clamps tightly to the handle of her car seat for on the go entertainment.
B001F6J3JC|5|Kids love it
B001668HEI|5|Perfect!
B008G7P7HA|2|This is too bulky for most kids. My son is grabbing at it all the time. It's also very hot in the summer, we don't use it.
B00VZGAWTM|1|It does not work at all.<br />The small one is so loose that it cannot even cut a piece of skin, not to mention the  nail.
B00318CO6G|2|We bought this for my daughter to take her milk to school in it for lunch because it's stainless steel, and Thermos brand should keep things cold. Plus we liked the feature of a straw AND that it claims to be leak proof. However, it leaks when you tip it over, even when closed. It's entirely possible that we got a defective one, but the part that holds the straw does NOT stay in place when you close it tightly enough so that it won't leak around the screw-on part of the lid. Therefore it either leaks out the top (not the straw, but the part that holds the straw) or where the lid screws on. And, even if she doesn't tip it over, the milk is never still cold by lunch time, even if I keep the thermos in the fridge all night so it should be plenty cold. I don't think 5 hours (at max) is too long for it to stay somewhat cold in a thermos container. I end up washing a sour milk-smelling, leaking thermos every night and looking forward to buying something new for next year. Probably not Thermos brand.
B00003TL7P|5|I've been using it for 2 months now &amp; have had NO ODOR AT ALL (until you open it to empty it!)  My sister had a diaper genie &amp; it stunk all the time &amp; was a pain to buy the refills.  I love that this just takes regular kitchen bags.  It's easy to use so I keep one hand on my baby while I flip the lid witht hte other hand.  I'm serious, no odor at all!
B005A3OGRA|4|i've bought a lot of sippy cups hoping to find the perfect one. i love the design of this cup and was hoping my 8 month old would love it as much as i did. the handles are great and easy to hold for baby, it's easy to wash with minimal parts (i hate washing those valves), and it's totally spill proof so my baby can (and will) throw it around and i won't have milk splattered all over my floor. it also has a top, which seems like it would be a given for sippy cups, but not so. anyway, my baby doesn't like this cup as much as i do and i think it's because the flow is too slow and takes too much effort. he'll drink from it if he's really thirsty but more often than not, he doesn't want this cup. you can get replacement spouts but there is only one flow option. i wish they had different levels of flow, like most bottle nipples. i love the simple design and was hoping this was the one. i'll try this cup a few more times but it will probably end up in the cupboard along with all the other rejected sippy cups.
B00073HJG8|4|Great asset to my daughters room. Keep the toys off the floor.
B0073DNYSW|2|The tabs and connectors would not stay in holes. It is a great compact rocker.  I would have liked it except it wouldn't stay connected together. Maybe I got broken tabs and mismade holes.
B001IA7VL2|2|I wanted to love these because my favorite brand of pads, FuzziBunz, is no longer making overnight (super) pads. But I don't. They seem to slip more, bunch more, and although they are pleasantly thin, they absolutely hold a LOT less and lead to leaking - a problem I haven't had with other brands. These are are not even my second-favorite brand. I'll use them as backups or panty-liners, but I'm disappointed.
B004LE8ZMG|5|Very good quality. Didn't shrink and fits well.
B004LE8UPS|5|Love that it matches my daughter's nursery. Great place to write memos. Fantastic price. I Would recommend this to anyone.
B0051GJ7PC|4|A bit on the complicated side to assemble, but very worth it.  Sturdy and solid.
B0069JBKHI|5|I got this for my daughter who just had a baby......it's amazing.....sound is great, picture is really clear.... It gives them total piece of mind.....awesome!!!
B001QKJ9SC|5|You do have to drill into your door jam but I prefer this to the hokey door knob solutions.
B0012EZ0EY|3|I love Dwell Studio and I love the look  of this bag - when it's empty. It's not as roomy as it could be and when packed with baby essentials (which it will be) it looks overstuffed. The waxed canvas makes for waterproofing, but the overall effect looks stiff. It's a cute, chic bag, no doubt - but I do wish I could have seen this person. I might have picked out something more yielding with a lesser price tag!.
B006ZVV0P2|2|Poor design.  You secure these to the seats with two straps.  The top one has a snap and is adjustable, goes around the headrest. The bottom of the cover has an elastic band to secure it on the seat.  This elastic strap is too short and does not fit around most modern seats that have lumbar supports, the side supports that &#34;hug&#34; you into the seat to keep you from sliding out.  Since these straps aren't adjustable, the cover just doesn't work. The elastic is too short. The manufacturer should have used an adjustable strap rather than the cheap elastic.  These did not work on a Honda Odyssey, Ram 1500, or Mini Cooper Countryman.
B008PODPZK|5|My daughter loves it
B004IJ0FMM|5|LOVE these bibs!  And, the babies like them, too, with their bright, whimsical designs.  The best part is, they wash beautifully (clothes washer OR dishwasher) and do not stain.
B00KZBXSKI|5|If you swaddle your child you gotta try this!! We first used the swaddle me sacks but the Velcro was loud and my son started to break himself out of it. There's no breaking out of this. Plus the best part is there is 2 zippers so all you have to do is unzip a little down near the feet for late night changes and his whole body is not exposed. The small was to small for him. I felt as though is was to tight and he was not going to be able to breath in it. Small is up to 14lbs I think. He weighs 12lbs. The next size up fits him perfect. I recommend and will buy for friends!!
B00FB5I7N6|1|Was disappointed by this product as my son bit the strap holders they are Rubbermaid that is so easy to chew on. Now both holders are torn and it is harder to adjust the straps on his chest also always would worry that where he chewed on the holders might hurt his face as if is kind of sharp. And I m not sure who to contact to replace the holders or if I can replace them.
B002A9IZ0Q|5|Very pleased with this 4-in-one crib.  It is very sturdy, has a nice color, and is fairly easy to put together.  Best to use two people when putting it together.  There is not one bad thing I can say about this crib.  Our 1 year old loves it.
B005XTCMSQ|5|This serves its purpose of distracting my almost 3year old daughter from messing with the oven knob.I don't know how long before my lil one figures it out but for now it works, will recommend
B0041IGKLA|2|This disposable changing table cover is very thin and small. Though there are some cute pictures, but it's just not practical.
B003I7ITS2|5|This is a great carseat - the side head protection is really nice.  It's also pretty light.  It's easy to install and the 5 point harness is pretty easy to work.  I also have the Combi Zeus 360 which I also really like for the ease of getting baby in and out.  But it's really heavy and we don't move it out of my car.  The side protection is better in the Recaro.  The fabric seems to stay pretty cool as well - at least baby's not sweltering when I get him out like he was in his infant carrier carseat.  I would definitely purchase this again.
B003OYLWO2|5|All of the other positive reviews are correct about the features and convenience of this stroller: lightweight, good sun protection, seat recline, stands folded, reasonable price, etc.  When planning a trip to Europe with our 13 month-old last summer, I obsessively researched umbrella strollers and this was the big winner. It worked wonderfully in some of the least child-friendly places: airports/planes, elevators/escalators, cobblestones, public transportation... you name it.  We used it in airports (sometimes running to make connecting flights) and it easily folded to go through the x-ray scanners and we had no problem \\"gate checking\\" it when we reached our flight. It's so lightweight, I was worried that it might be flimsy.  However, it stood up to the roughest terrain and we're still using it almost daily a year later with our 30-pound 2 year-old.  This is one of the few baby gear products that I am almost evangelical about.  HIGHLY recommend.
B005C9ODUW|3|I use this with my Ergo carrier and size has been generous to fit my larger than average baby. However I cannot seem to get the adjustable sides to be tight enough to keep out any air. Detachable hoodie was useless for us as it was not long enough to provide a comfy fit. Having said that, I still feel like this does provide the extra warmth in the cold windy days so still useful.
B00834D7DC|4|I love this car seat. It's so comfortable! My daughter and I travel 4 times a day to my older son's school. She doesn't cry anymore and feels sometimes asleep while she would cry in the infant car seat...
B005M4SKJW|5|Super durable and does a great job of catching food. Makes clean up easier!
B000ALIMYU|5|don't know what I would do without this.  child has been using halo sleepsacks since she stopped using a swaddle at around 4 or 5 months old.  We give her a blanket as well, but that always ends up at the foot of her crib.  It also keeps a child from crawling out of the crib and hurting herself.  great product!
B00B1M2TUK|5|Nice sleepsack.
B00GSX1XEU|5|It was perfect for my 9 month old baby. We have tile so it slides perfeftly.
B004BSFC46|5|I bought these for my newborn grandson and we alternated putting them on his wrist and ankle.  He wasn't very aware of them but when he realized they were there he was very interested.
B00D15N008|5|Beautiful
B00OVSBY48|5|Great buy. Buy Buy Baby had it for $99.99
B0088TJPWY|4|Very choc but just fits my two year old. He's in it but not for long.
B006SFUCT0|5|I gave this as a gift to a close friend. She really loves this.
B0033QQ73W|5|It is great for my 4 year old daughter who is very tall for her age.  Great for Pre-K!  She loves the Disney Theme.
B00005BUMY|5|Great spoons for my little one.  Here's the summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- These spoons come in a 16 pack; I don't know about you, but somehow spoons in our house keep getting lost, kinda like the other sock in the laundry.  It's good to have a lot of these on hand.<br />- Decent spoon scoop size - even with runny food, a fair amount still gets in the mouth.<br />- Gender-neutral colors<br />- These are recyclable once exhausted, although I have yet to deliberately throw one away.  Accidentally thrown away, that's a different story.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They can feel a bit flimsy at times, but these are meant to have a limited lifetime, so it was a stretch to even come up with this con.<br /><br />On a personal note, I like these as opposed to the fancier ones that are heat-indicators.  I have those ones as well, but usually go by the \\"finger-test\\" or just mix it up and try some myself.  ALso, when you lose one of these it hurts the wallet less than the heat-indicators, which are much more expensive per each spoon.
B00B0Z5KR2|1|These blankets are small, very thin, and look and feel cheap.  The edges are not hemmed, just stitched.
B00EYDTTHE|5|Love the bibs. Excellent quality!!! I ordered 2 sets . :)
B003CK3LDI|2|I bought this for my 5 month old son because he likes having a paci at night as well as a stuffed animal. First of all, the paci on this is horrible and it is way to small for a 5 month old to hold in his mouth. Would be soo much better if it had a larger pacifier and a MAM type pacifier. Do not wast your money
B00F2MQ410|5|Works great! Perfect height for my son to wash his hands but not reach everything on the counter. Totally seems safe and sturdy for my 30lb toddler. He can pick it up easily, not too heavy. It will definitely last for a while.
B004QO0M9A|5|My daughter loved these since very little when she could only look and them. Then she started putting them in her mouth, then pulling the toy and enjoying the noise and the different types of fabric. She loved and enjoyed them for a long time!!!<br />Even her older cousins played with them.
B0000ASU29|5|I did a lot of research on finding the best croquet set for the money.  I did not want cheap wickets and flimsy mallets.  This was above my expectations.  Worth every penny and in a wheeled heavy duty case also.  Happy Customer.
B003K082GG|1|The wrong adapter (not the one pictured) was sent to me....an annoying hassle to say the least
B00BZUQ7L0|5|These are great for in a pinch or traveling.
B001GQ2SA2|4|We bought this for our little baby girl who is 2 months old. She liked the cheap mobile that came with her playpen so we went looking for one. This one did everything that we wanted, from the projection to going along with the theme of her room. The only problem I had was the packaging that it came in. The box was open and crushed, pieces were everywhere in the box. It worked once I got it together and batteries in it. So there was no need to return it.
B00E6VZVYY|5|I love this bag!! We use it every day for my son to take his snacks and lunch items to school. It is super durable. It's easy to clean and it stays clean, too! I was worried about the Velcro wearing out but it has not at all! I bought the small size bag when I got this one and will be buying more for sure!
B0044UJEAO|5|It is very soft and has good design pattern on it. Amazon provides the lowest price on this product that I can find. Somewhere else you may end up pay twice as much.
B00QH3C872|4|Awesome<br />I'd give it 5 stars if it came in other organic color choices as well. Right now they only offer white, which I do understand why.
B00000J4SP|5|I purchased this for my grandniece as someone gave one to my grandson 2 years ago and it was terrifc entertainment for a long time for him.  I am pleased with the construction as well.  My grandson will be able to pass it on to his future broyther or sister.
B00MXRPN46|5|This toy comes in very handy at dinner time. It easily suctions to my daughter's high chair and doesn't come off unless forced. The toy is very easy to clean up after a messy dinner.
B003C2UJ86|5|Good product. Material is soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. Machine washable. I would consider placing a liner underneath since any fluids will seep to the Bloom pad and that is not washable nor does it have a removable cover so it stains.
B000O3GCFU|5|I purchased this to carry hot water for baby bottles while travelling.  It works excellent at keeping hot liquids hot.  It is kind of hard to pour out of but really happy with the purchase.
B00J73W6YY|4|Very cute!
B001A08QMI|5|Love love love this blanket.  Silk on one side, softness fleece like on the other.  It's not too thick or bulky.  Bought for our new baby girl & it's one of my favorite blankets & I have got many compliments on it also.  Must buy.
B0037NXG7G|5|My son outgrew this at around 6 months, Started leaving red marks on his stomach I LOVE the high rise.<br />Now he's 9 months and just under 30 pounds. Thinking about buying the next size up, wish they had x-tra large.
B000KVUBBC|4|Great gate, easy installation.
B004K6VCI4|5|We purchased this carseat as a replacement for an infant-only seat after a serious accident. We had the [[ASIN:B001OD6YS4 Chicco Cortina Keyfit 30 Travel System, Miro]] and were disappointed that Chicco makes no forward-facing only carseats. Looking for traits similar to that carseat lead us to this Recaro.<br /><br />Things I love about this carseat:<br />1. The straps are thick and have embroidered lines that show which way is out.<br />2  The crotch area buckle has a sleeve so that the child's weight is distributed more evenly around it.<br />3. Once installed, the thing is like a rock. You can't budge it.<br />4. The end of the tightening strap can be stored under the fabric flap where it comes out. No dangling strap for a child to pull on!<br />5. Three levels of tightness on the straps themselves (in back).<br />6. LATCH strap storage.<br />7. Little mesh pockets on the sides of the seat.<br />8. A pocket for the manual that is on the side of the seat. Other carseats often have pockets underneath the seat, which would mean uninstalling the entire carseat to get to the manual.<br />9. Comes with a WHALE (We Have a Little Emergency) kit, which I had never heard about before receiving the seat.<br />10. Bright red markings showing the strap path.<br />11. A built-in handle on top.<br />12  When the child falls asleep, her head remains upright, keeping airways clear.<br />13. The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />We bought the pink one because it was less expensive than the others. I don't know why this particular product's price varies so much with the color.<br /><br />After the accident (and a different carseat that I didn't like at all), it matters a lot to me that the seat my daughter is in feels substantial and solid.<br />I feel very safe with our daughter in this seat.
B003VZ8BXO|4|If you walk everywhere like I do or jog occasionally, this stroller is perfect. However, if you're a hardcore runner or don't have lots of smooth surfaces around you, I wouldn't recommend it.    We've had this stroller for about a month and so far I really like it. We bought it because we live near a park with tons of trails (dirt and paved) for runners and walkers. I use it 4-5 x / week and I am so glad I bought it. I wish I would've gotten it sooner. Our daughter is 8 months.   I would say that there are mostly pros, but several cons that some might want to take into consideration before buying.     Pros  1. Comfortable for my daughter. She sleeps in it all the time. When she's in the carseat, the two covers work perfectly to block out sun and wind.  2. I can take it anywhere. Street, mall, stores, cafe, trails. The front wheel locks and unlocks making it easy to switch from jogging outside to walking around in a mall.  3. It takes me 2 seconds to fold it and put into my car trunk. And the carseat snaps in and out of both the stroller and the base in the car very quickly.  4. The storage basket underneath is huge! I love it. I'ved filled it with two bags of groceries, jackets, toys etc. and it held everything no problem.  5. Handle is comfortable and adjusts for different heights. I'm 5'2\\" and my husband is 5'11\\" and we can easily switch the height for either one of us.  6. We liked the fact that it's a jogger with the all-terrain wheels, but that it also had the carseat attachment, so that our baby could see us and vice versa.    Cons  1. If you're outside and the front wheel is unlocked, and you walk too fast, the whole stroller shakes. It's scary. (It's perfect for when you're inside a store) So, I keep the front wheel locked most of the time when I'm outside.     2. It's heavy (with the carseat attachment). Because I keep the front wheel locked most of the time, when I want to turn a corner or get on or off sidewalks, I have to tilt the whole stroller back tolift the front wheel up and it takes some effort. Granted, I'm short, so maybe I don't have the leverage for it, but even my husband felt like it was heavier than it should be. This will probably be easier once we take the carseat attachment off and my daughter rides facing forward.    3. The cupholders are too small for my standard metal water bottle. We just removed ours entirely and replaced it with a different holder, the Sunshine Kids buggy [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]] which works perfectly. The only problem now is that I can't use the MP3 player since it was attached to the cupholders.    Overall I would recommend this stroller! Hope this helps.
B00OC6CNBC|5|Adorable!
B000GCE5C6|5|Love this! My daughter is 17 months old and would fight me every time I tried to use a normal toothbrush with her. Not only does she allow me to brush her teeth now, she actually finds it fun. Definitely recommend this product!!!!
B005G37S42|5|This is a fantastic diaper bag! I have it in Honey Lotus, and I actually did a video review on YouTube, so I will post a link to avoid having to go into detail again. I didn't buy it on here... I actually bought it on the JJ Cole Website, but it is the same bag, so I figured I would post the review here for anyone interested in the bag!    [...]    If the link doesn't work for some reason (I should... but just in case) You can also go to youtube and type in \\"JJ Cole Myla\\" to get to the full review.
B008J4FHZ2|5|Love my mixie  bottles!
B00WTBMSR6|5|I'm really pleased with this door lock - simple to install, easy to use, works as intended and it's not visually obtrusive. I highly recommend this product.
B005SP2LWW|5|My baby doesn't like being carried but if he did, I would wear him in this thing all day every day. We also have a moby and the boba takes the cake. Not only is it easier to put on, but the slight stretch in the fabric makes it more comfortable.
B0031VLRYI|1|It is very cute but the toy doesn't hold it in her mouth. Not worth the money
B006TWH4R0|2|Baby won't take it.  Doesn't even play with it.
B007S1T4Q0|5|my grandbabys a primi. this helps mom to wash him. we love it and so does my daughter. and will recomend it to others
B0000634T0|5|I just love this hamper for the fact that it's collapsible All the baby stuff takes up room. This product was able to fit into this tight space we had between the wall and crib. Although it isn't opened completely, you can still fit your baby's dirty clothes without any problems. The mesh netting provides ease when doing laundry - just pull it out w/ all the clothes in it and take it to your laundry room...no need to take the clothes out and place in a separate laundry basket. And the price is  reasonable too!
B005ZNCIGG|1|We returned this only after a couple of days. The material isn't good; very plastic and rough kind of feeling.
B003C0AGUO|2|We got these pacifiers from the stadium and my son only liked these ones. We lost one and knew we needed more so I ordered these. The symbol came off in less than one day. The one we have been using for months is still on there. He still enjoys them but it is a bummer the logo isnt on there.
B002R0DVL6|5|This particular baby carrier is extremely versatile and easy to use. The baby when in it, seems extremely comfortable and always falls asleep inside, which she would never do with any other baby carrier we have ever used.<br />The product is lightweight, but still feels sturdy and durable.<br />The ERGO has a front pocket that zips as well. We have found we can fit a baby wipe flexible container, two diapers and even a few squeezable snack pouches in this carrier, which makes this item particular valuable when going a long distance walks, mall trips or just hangin around the house and doing chores.<br />I highly recommend this item.
B0070767DU|5|These have been very helpful in dealing with several breastfeeding issues. I've used them as warm before feedings and cold after to deal with plugged milk ducts. I've also had to pump a lot and place these inside the hands free bra and think it helps increase the pumped amount. They're also really nice when cold weather increases nipple/breast pain! Just be careful when microwaving them - my new mommy brain left it in too long once and the pouch exploded!
B003XIBVEU|5|This item was highly recommended to me by a new mother. It is very soft and designed to make swaddling quite simple.  I gave it as a shower gift and it was g really a appreciated.
B000GU2Y58|4|This is my go to for baby shower gifts. They are affordable, unique and durable. They have several different styles.
B0035LLG2W|5|My Munchkin bottle warmer broke unexpectedly, so I purchased this &#34;fancy&#34; bottle warmer. We LOVE it! I love not having to worry about putting in the correct amount of water.<br />About once a week, I add a little bit of vinegar + hot water to the water reservior, then rinse. Keeps mold from forming.
B0049SP0AE|5|We have purchased the elephant version of the Snuggle teether as add-on gifts for at least three baby showers.  My grand-daughter (now 9 months old) loves hers. When she was younger, she liked to crinkle the tummy section.  Now she is more interested in gnawing on the feet.  This teether is soft enough for pre-teething babies to cuddle and lightweight enough for them to hang on to it by themselves.
B00AMALBV0|3|I dislike that the changing table has to stay attached when it turns into a toddler bed.  And as of today, the toddler rail is only available via the manufacturing for this color.  So it takes 3 weeks to even get it.  Overall its nice and sturdy, just big once you have a toddler and not a baby.
B007CTPWXW|4|It fits nicely on the Britax Affinity. Wished the centre compartment is larger though. Not sure how it can fit diapers (teeny tiny ones, maybe?). Love the various pockets for mobile phones and drinks.
B001KVW6V4|5|I bought this 5 years ago for my Grandson and he still carries it around.  He loved this item so much we had to get extras.  It has been through many washings and looks dingy now and not as smooth as it was, but that does not matter to him.  I think it has held up very well for 5 years!!!
B00006JZEN|5|We placed this book along the wall next to our son's changing table, and from the first day he was home from the hospital, he was mesmerized by the black and white pictures. At about 2 months, we flipped the book to the colored side, and he still loves looking at the pictures.  Now he reaches out and grabs the book and plays with the crinkle parts.    I highly recommend this book.  No, it doesn't fold up easily, but we don't use it as a story book to read to him, but more as a toy to look at and touch.    This is up there in our top 3 best purchases for baby so far.
B0001EM8I2|5|Not much to say but I wish I had bought this much earlier.  Its nice and heavy and helps to prevent the dent in the seat effect from the hard plastic bottom of your baby seat.  Also it has a rear flap that goes up so crumbs and liquids don't go right into the space under your seat.  Nice product.
B0025YQ4UE|4|We ordered this whole set on-line (the 4 piece set, blanket, wall hangings and mobile).  I was so happy upon seeing everything in person as it's much cuter up close.  There are patterns you can't quite see on-line that make it so much cuter.  The colors look great in person and everything is good quality.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is I don't know what to do with the bumper pad since we can't have it in there with the baby.  I kind of wish you had the option to buy the set without it.  Hopefully I can think of something creative to do with it, because it is really cute.
B001QGTBIY|1|falls off easily, not very tall. i put them on the bottom of the corners where my 3 year old bangs his head... it falls off and doesnt do much to help... find a different  product that caps the corner on top and bottom
B00KZBXU2E|5|Works like a charm to keep our baby asleep at night
B008X6RH0E|5|Love these! Easy to clean and my daughter (2 yrs. old) likes them. Great upgrade from all those cheap plastic spoons! What more could I ask for?
B007SNJA44|5|These bowls are great for toddlers. I got it for my four year old niece. The Gyro Bowl has been out for a while and many have been sold because they work well. These are durable and easily used bowls that don't spill the snacks, dry cereal or mac and cheese when carried. The handles all around the bowl make it easier for kids to carry. There is a snap on top to keep food fresh. The bowl is inexpensive and well worth the cost. I think anyone with small children should have at least one of these bowls for their child. It makes things easier for parents since there will be less spilling of food to clean up.
B008KCR7VK|4|Great price for an item that almost all families with two cars need (who have purchased the B Safe car seat)
B00CXVJWKI|5|excellent product
B00BHPHZYG|5|Looks really nice and lightweight. Good to carry around and matches with a lot. Came in a timely fashion
B00440CZPU|5|It is too small but good for you fill up little thing and light. lip is tight enogh no leak.
B0009PAVQ4|4|This is a great idea - it really does keep your infant upright (once they can hold their head up).  I was able to use it for my 4 month old, but only for a month or so.  It was great when we went to restaurants with booths and I could sit her up next to me.  I used it around the house only a few times. It outlived it's usefulness fast because it really restricts her movement, which she doesn't like, so she started losing patience with it pretty quickly.  I wish I would have bought it earlier when she wasn't quite so active - it probably would've had a longer life.  Now she's pretty much sitting up on her own so it's going into storage.
B003FLLQXG|5|Great-grandson likes this teether! :)
B000U5FOT2|3|We purchased two superyards and assembled them to gate off our livingroom area and allow for entry from two points.  This product is excellent at keeping a baby in one spot or another.  The gate is well built.  It is easy to assemble and reconfigure.<br /><br />It is also dangerous.  Our boy (one year old now) can stick his arms and legs through the gaps in the slats of the fence.  This may seem innocent at first, but if he were to fall at an angle, whatever limb was stuck through the gate would break.  I am severely concerned about my child being handicapped for his entire adult life due to North States attempting to save $5 in materials and labor per kit by keeping the slats separated by over 2&#34;.<br /><br />This product is well built - but expect a recall.
B004AHKUHM|5|No static, very clear, works great-ESP for the price
B001GQ2RWQ|5|Portable, flexible and work in all types of chairs. We purchased two because we have twin grand babies and are very happy with this product.
B000VX4QI8|3|I was really happy with this purchase until 6 months ago when the giant screws literally started falling out on their own.  I'm sure it could have been avoided by tightening them every so often but it wasn't something I personally thought about and since it hadn't happened with other cribs I've purchased in the past, it wasn't something that I thought I should expect.  It is a beautiful crib and sturdy...until screws start popping out.
B005WWIJEK|5|This works great for cloth diapers on the go, as well as dirty baby cloths that have to be changed while out. The butterflies pattern matches nicely with my brown diaper bag.
B004NY9KP0|1|This bag its not made of a good material (not durable at all) and is very difficult to store the cart in it. Loved the cart tho
B00HT6E6GW|5|Another must-have item for any nursery. I have twins and needless to say, there is a lot of &#34;output&#34; everyday. I feel like I am constantly changing diapers and some are quite smelly! Having the Diaper Genie helps keep odors contained and once full, it is so easy to simply cut, tie, and toss. Refills can be expensive, but I think well worth having a nursery free of diaper &#34;aromas&#34;! The elite model is great because of the foot pedal to open the pail, makes diaper duty easier and cleaner overall.
B000067QMJ|2|this was the 3rd potty i bought my son who is 18 months.the first one was 3 in 1 step potty from safety first.i though it was ok but my son didnt like it,so i went and bout the musical flushing potty, the lid snapped shut my son could not open it by himself,it was hard to take out the pee bucket and the flushin handel was to hard for him to push down it wasnt nice and soft. this royal thing [stinks].the light stays on 24/7 which causes it use allot of batteries.the pee bucket wont stay secure in place and it leaks.there is no seal.im on my 4 and already dont like it.im gonna try the baby bjorn,but ive heard it is only for tiny kids.well see.saveur money dont buy this one
B009YSYCZS|4|Very easy to use, easy to clean, and portable.
B001579YRM|5|I would not be able to clip my son's finger nails without this clipper.  It is so helpful to have the lights because no matter how bright the room is, I am always creating a shadow over his nails.  It is also perfect for when you are in a dark room because you can still see the babies nails.
B00A7ZEGQ2|5|I love this wrap! I first tried a babytrend backpack and learned that it can cause hip problems with your baby so i never used it! I was hard for me to get things done around the house and breast feed. I found this and the day i got it loved it! My daughter loves it too!
B000HZDN9I|5|I bought this for our little girl.  SHe is just three months old but very soon she will be needing this as she will be so bored and sick of her bouncie chair.  The reviews I read said it was easy to put together.  They are rigit it is pretty easy to put together.  BUT IT TAKES TIME, this is not a fast project.  I still don't have the chair spinning freely like it should so have to go back and figure that out, it just does not seem loose and free like it should it would take effort for my baby to turn in this as it is.  It is not near as heavy as I expected from the reviews, I don't think it is any bigger or worse then our old evenflo excersousor that we had for our first two girls.  i love all the toys on this and hope my little girl will too.  Overall I am very impressed.
B00440CZQ4|5|Bought this after reading lots of reviews for feeding spoons. Was looking for a reasonably priced soft spoon that my daughter can use as well to learn to feed herself.<br />I love the soft texture, very gentle on the gums, yet not too soft so still can hold food well.<br />Deep enough to scoop out runny food. Fit my one year old's mouth. Very good quality at this price. No complain.<br />Highly recommended. =)
B00DBWK2DO|5|Best baby purchase. It suited our budget and is the post modern look I wanted...so much better than all the cheezy crib designs out there. Comes with a toddler rail. SEems quite sturdy. Will probably be using this for a very long time!
B001FOGIZQ|5|While in the process of setting up the crib for our first child, we have window-shopped extensively for a decent mattress. Needless to say, our search ended with this one. Our requirements were simple - The mattress should feel comfortable and should be very nicely made. An average quality product won't do for your bundle of joy :)<br /><br />The Sealy mattress fit perfectly in the crib that we purchased from some other vendor. The mattress is water proof and feels smooth and soft on touch. The sheet from the bedding set covers the mattress nicely. The mattress has side pockets to release air from the pressure of some weight being put on it. This is important as the mattress seam stays intact after constant use and will prolong the life of the product.<br /><br />While looking, we saw some mattresses priced over $300 and for no apparent quality difference. This mattress is very decently priced and surpasses our rigid expecations.<br /><br />Overall, we have been extremely pleased with the mattress. Highly recommended!
B001AZMLN8|5|My 9 month old daughter loved these from the moment she saw them. The bowls were a little smaller than I thought they'd be, so we don't let her play with the smallest, blue bowl yet, but the set has captured her attention and interest. I like that they are simple, sturdy and versatile. We play with them in many different ways (stacking, hiding, rolling, and knocking down of course). She's been playing with them for just over a month, but I think they will engage her, off and on, for a long time to come.
B0038TXHLE|5|I searched around for months for the PERFECT crib set and this is the one that caught my eye. The seller is great had the product to me within 2 days of me making payment. The material is not that cheap feeling stuff some sets have. Its very thick, plush and super soft. The stitching on the bumper is Great as unlike other sets where its like an iron on. Its truly one of a kind!! If i had to pay more for it i would have, the price is great for the value you receive.
B00073HJG8|4|I Ordered This Net And It Came Quick And Was Perfect For What I Needed It For. I Put It Under A Hanging Play Toy For Our Small Pet And It Works Great. Only Problem Was I Wanted To Order More Then One But Could Not Add More ToThe Order. Every Time It Would Only Allow You To Order 2 But The Price Was Way Different. Other Then That Was A Good Net Great Size Good Material.
B00026I1W6|3|The quality of this comforter is really not bad for the price.  However, the color is very different from what is pictured here and even on the package.  I was very disappointed.  I thought I was getting a cool beige-it's yellow.  I don't know if this was a bad dye lot or if the color in both pictures is not correct.  If you are looking for a warm yellow-beige, this is the comforter for you. If you are looking for cool beige/linen color, this is not it!
B00171WXII|4|I like the concept but I don't like how hard it is to suck up the boogers even with saline solution. The boogies just don't want to stay in the plastic container.
B0043D28B4|5|Love this book! I received this as a gift and my son loves it. It is great for story time, he picks it up and runs up to me to read it to him. The characters are adorable . Also wonderful toy for his crib. In the mornings I can squeeze in a little more sleep time for myself if he has a couple of soft things to play with in his crib. This is perfect for that. Makes crinkly noises too which babies love.
B000YDDF6O|1|this toy fall off within 1 week of purchased, and the quality of the music after that was extremely bad.<br />I expect a toy for toddlers to be resistant. It was a waste of money.
B00CWN3HSU|5|Though I expected to use this for the newborn grandchildren, the 18-month-old granddaughter claimed it as her own. So my husband adjusted it to the toddler setting, and she was delighted.  It is sturdy and stable.  She can also easily push it across the carpet.  I have not used it for the newborns so cannot comment there.
B00EVLIHWM|4|Our grandbaby loves this. It is easily assembled and simple to adjust. It takes some coordination opening and closing the tray cover and you have to be careful because little fingers can get pinched.
B004KV6UH2|5|This is the best cup we've bought yet. The weight inside the straw makes it easy to get every last drop. Easy to clean too.
B001N45V92|4|Nice panels but we ended up adding some gingham fabric, ribbon and a curtain liner to them to make them even better.
B00BK770I2|5|Love this and only place I could find this to match a set I had bought on ebay. A little pricey being $50 but had no other options if I wanted matching bumper.
B004AHMCLY|4|Got these for my son at 9 months and he loves them!  He doesn't care for the hard plastic ball so much but he carries the other two around everywhere.
B00Y8SFF14|5|My daughter has been teething for many months but still does not have any teeth. I can see the tops of her front bottom teeth they just haven't broken through.  We have tried different teethers but she always uses them for under and minute and then doesn't want them any more.  When I handed her this teether after I had chilled it in the refrigerator for an hour she instantly dropped the toy she was playing with and put the teether in her mouth... the correct way!  I could tell that she liked that it had water that was chilled and the texture on the part that went in her mouth. It was the perfect size too.  I completely forgot that it came with the clip until I looked at the packaging again to write this review and then I knew that not only did baby like this teether but mom did too!
B000LSL5ZK|5|Nice colorful spoons, lightweight and dishwasher safe, we let our kids pick out their favorite colors when they eat. :)
B007A2ZSZ8|5|I have used these on my desk drawers to protect my toddler from things like sharp scissors, super glue, and permanent markers. They have a great locking mechanism that requires at least two fingers to squeeze the buttons to unlock. Very satisfied...need to buy more.
B00MRZIGXY|3|Good cup but disappointed the cup coloring did not match what I ordered. The photo showed the lids were green and pink-but the ones I received were white.
B00IOGIF5E|5|I wanted to use a different brand but these are the only ones she will take. I now love them!
B00AANPUUM|5|Very cute - love it
B007Z0JBM6|5|This is a great toy for infants and parents will enjoy it because they can use it to distract the child long enough to finish powdering and clothing your child after a bath. My son loves this toy and will ignore everything else when its around. It has three different instruments and has three different settings along with three languages and lights up. It also has good battery life. We've use it everyday for 5 months now and still working like a charm. Easy to clean as well. This is my first review for a product and I'm happy to support this toy.
B0057EEC44|3|I purchased these and the Mam ones so I could find them at night and wanted to compare them. These don't glow and the Mams do. I still gave them 3 stars because these are my little one's favorite type of pacifier (he keeps it in his mouth the longest.)
B004QJIWEM|5|Lids do not stay in place
B00P7RKUVK|5|Favorite wash cloths. We've used them for baths and now as wipes at diaper time. LOVE them. Soft and perfect.
B000056J8C|5|I use this rack daily, as we don't have a dishwaser here in Italy. It does the job! We use Dr. Browns bottles, and they fit just fine. The bottle/nipple brush works great. I like that the rack is sloped so the water just runs off. I put it over the edge of the sink so the water just goes in there!
B0035ER5CY|5|good
B00A9YW6F4|2|The jury is still out, but from the first look at the instruction manuel, not enough care was given to making sure this is safe.  If the manufacturer isn't willing to spend the money to have the instructions written by someone with a command of the language used in the manual, then it makes me wonder if that same manufacturer really cares if this product is safe or not.<br />We are not putting the stickers on.  They were a bad idea from conception.<br />The suction cups are not a bad idea, but they don't work very well on even a hardwood floor.  When the baby tries to stand up by holding onto the walls, they move and cause him to lose his balance.<br />One of the little balls fixed into one panel as a toy will roll easily.  The other one is stuck and I can't make it turn.<br />The directions are a joke.  Examples of instructions: &#34;Warning: Put the fastener of pillar into the hold to make sure this gate fastness. &#34; &#34; To open this gate: Turning the Locking Knob anticlockwise to UNLOCK, make the arrow of the Locking Knob aim at the black point of the switch Seal&#34; . &#34;If not often to open the gate., please turn the Switch Knob to the Lock. to make sure the safety.&#34;  WHAT??????? (punctuation errors are copied as written)<br />As it turns out, the structure isn't terribly difficult to put together, but we have parts that are not shown in the manual and we don't have parts that are shown in the manual.<br />For a safe play area that looks bright and cheerful and changes shape easily, I would give this a three.  Taking into consideration all of the negatives, that rating goes down to a two.<br />There must be other safety enclosures out there for the same price.  This one was not inexpensive.  It looks good, but beware of all the begatives before purchasing it.
B000058DQE|5|I've been searching for the perfect everything for my little girl, Kyra Jasmine - (my first!) who's due in mid-July.  I've been logging onto all the different websites, perusing through reviews by concerned and kind consumers like you, reading the famous &quot;Baby Bargains Book&quot;, etc.  More than anything, I rely on research and testing of products by experts (i.e. Consumer Reports and Good Housekeeping).  Yeah, doesn't help being a doctor - you can say I'm extra cautious and skeptical of what I hear. Among crib sheets, the one that makes the most sense appears to be Gerber's &quot;Everything Basics&quot; fitted cotton-knit crib sheet.  It was rated tops in terms of safety by Good Housekeeping and at the same time was half the price of the leading competitors! Good to save up, especially as young parents starting out, but more importantly, to have a peace of mind.  As for color..like it matters! I don't even know what &quot;ecru&quot; is! Pick whatever makes you go &quot;ooh&quot;. Now, I'll be searching for the creme de la creme of other baby products.  Geeez...this can be tedious, but we'll be glad atfer we make the right decisions!
B00FHVL9RK|4|Perfect
B00004TFLB|5|The first one we had came broken ( the orchestra button didn't work). However, the new cube we received works perfectly! My son cried everytime we played this so we set it aside for a while. When we took it out again, he loved playing with it. The sound quality is pretty decent for a toy and the buttons are easy to press.
B0006842VE|5|I am so torn. I love this set, but my husband thinks it is to feminine.  We do not know what we are having, and I think either way it will suite both sex.  Your opinions are greatly appreciated.  <br /> <br />
B00B7M7BKW|3|One thing that I would have liked to know before hand is the knowledge that the seat protector was not tested with my specific car seat. Because of that the State would not install my car seat with the seat protector, I still kept it for the other side that has the booster seat so it's all good.
B00029T4D8|5|Bought this for our almost 3 year old daughter who refuses to sit in the highchair that straps to the chair because she is a big girl not a baby. This is the perfect height and she thinks it is a big girl booster.
B000G7YQPM|5|Why is it so difficult to find good quality cotton blankets?  This one is soft and washes SO WELL.
B001REGNK4|5|They may be a little pricey--however...WAY worth it!!!  We have had our Pacimal for 3yrs and its still my childs FAV toy/animal!  Benni (aka Brody the Bear) Bear is his go to when sad, scared and night night!<br /><br />We actually got one for school naps Woof Woof (aka Rocco the Rhino) & Another Brody(so when we wash Benni).  Rocco goes to school now with our little one and stays there during the week.  We just bring home the paci nighly and wash.<br /><br />OH the paci's are VERY durrable-my little 'monster' is very rough on it, taking it off and sticking his finger in the holes--it stays together!  We bought a couple 'spares' for times when we are washing it, nighttime accidents, lost paci's (oh yes we actually lost it one time and had this one OVERNIGHTED).  Get spares, dont be caught without!!
B0071D1AKI|5|We are teaching my toddler the importance of washing hands and along with a foot stool this makes it easier for him to reach the water.
B006SFUEG6|3|If you need one on a budget this is fine but it bends and does not work well with walls with high trimming.
B00F2MQDU2|5|My son LOVES this!
B002GD4H6M|3|We thought this would be a great option for saving space and having our LO at the table with us for meals.  We got this when she was 6 months old and starting solids.  She is now 8.5 months.  Perhaps it will be better when she is older, but the track that rotates gets lodged with food- the seat while it can be washed, it a pain to remove and you basically have to disassemble the whole thing just to get it clean. (Not something I want to do every evening!)  I am now looking for a traditional high chair- I'll probably use this just for travel.
B00BBF7UVA|3|The little tabs you have to depress to open or lock the deadbolt get stuck in the down position sometimes, making it so that you can't unlock the door sometimes if you're on the other side.  It does do what it advertises though, and keeps the children from being able to get out of the house.
B004OR1DT2|5|This chair is awesome!  My little guy loves it. It waseasy to assemble, it's easy to clean and it is easy to move around.  It'salso super cute. It's eady to get baby in and out too.  We've used it a few times and so far so good, I am really impressed.
B007AYNPRE|4|Nice wall decal. Did not like how it was packaged for delivery! No container or box. Just rolled up and wrapped in plastic. Sticks well if put in proper place within 1st or 2nd try.  I had trouble placing first few pieces and reattached to the wall about 4/5 times.  Those pieces have lost their adhering ability. For the price, I just bought another set of same wall decal and will replace those pieces. It was cheaper to do that than buy a spray can of adhesive.
B004044LD4|2|+This mattress seems to have the right balance between being firm enough to be really safe, but not being rock hard<br /><br />-Unfortunately, my mattress is about 2-3 inches too short, so there are gaps in both ends of my crib.  It makes me worried about my child's safety.  I need to wedge some blankets in the gaps at the end to make it safer<br /><br />Because of the length, I would not recommend this mattress
B003U2SE44|5|This was one of the only diapers that fit practically from the beginning.  Fit nicely from about 7-10 lbs.  very nice, easy to use and care for.
B005PWVIZE|5|I ordered several different kinds of cabinet locks (that is what new moms do) but i like these the best...coupled with the door gates my kitchen is baby proof, thank you!
B00BY5OLIW|5|I've been in search of the perfect sippy cup and I think I found it.  Where do I start?  They have a textured outside and sturdy material. It's super easy to clean and dishwasher safe (top shelf). The valve is easy to remove and clean (I put it in a dishwasher basket- top shelf). The cup has a screw on cap that seals really well and surprisingly, it does not leak!  Throw it on the floor, toss it like a batton, and no leaks.  I tried drinking out if it to see how difficult it would be for my toddler and at first it didn't work (the valve slit was stuck together), after I fixed the valve slit, the sippy cup worked awesome.  It requires the child to suck to get liquid but once they've got the hang of that, you can remove the valve and let it free flow.  And by free flow, there's three small hoes on top so not too much will come out. I love that this works like its suppose to and I love that it's essentially a three stage cup.  First it's a sippy with a stopper valve, then it's a sippy cup with no valve, and finally it can be a standard cup.  Great product for a great price.
B007VBYVWE|5|Love these, i make burp cloths out of them! and they are handy to keep in the car to wipe down the inside of the windshield
B004G8QSYO|5|My son loves these.  When he was 2-3 months old, he would stare at the bright colors and listen to the bell & &#34;crinkling.&#34;  Now that he is 5 months, he loves holding these blocks.  We take them on all our car trips.  His favorites are the 2 blocks that &#34;crinkle.&#34;
B00913D2DO|4|Good quality, fabric is soft and color is deep. Looks great on mattress. May be priced a little high though.
B001RCMSPU|1|I paied 28 dólares and Is not the same product like a picture! Im not recomend
B000XSCCUU|2|We recently purchased this monitor since we had another baby and wanted the ease of 2 cameras and one handheld monitor. The features on this model are nice (scan function automatically switches from one camera to the other every 8 seconds), and the size is nice and sleek. However, the video quality is HORRIBLE on this system, especially at night (which is the time we need to use it!). There are hot spots and the image is fuzzy and very grainy. The reason we purchased this system is that we also have a Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor (#02640A) and we LOVE this one. We could not find an additional camera online anywhere at first, which was why we decided to replace it with this \\"new and improved\\" model. Don't waste your money - stick with the cheaper Best View, and call Summer Infant customer service to order an additional camera over the phone for $119.99 if you need one (1-800-268-6237). The video is FAR superior - you can see every facial expression with the Best View monitor even in the dark.
B004I8VDWO|5|Soft and warm. Great for baby
B001DU0LGY|3|Received it this morning and took a few hours to get it together. I'm happy with how it looks but it actually took a bit of customisation to get there. Issues such as the rear wall holes do not quite line up and therefore if screwing in as directed the screws would split the wood and be visible. I got round this by slotting the holes on the panel that fits behing the cupboard section.    Also fitting the rails to the draws gave me issues. I had to use smaller screws since the ones i was issued cause the wood to start splitting. I'm also a little annoyed about a few blemishes which are visible on the front of the chest. This was as received out of the box.     If purchasing just take care.
B00DLGSLTC|5|Love these blankets
B000N0SNHY|4|Liked these better than munchkins.
B004203QQ4|3|Our daughter loves this thing! However, I probably would not buy it again simply because our dogs also love this toy and consequently have already punctured it. Sadly we have to keep it up high so the dogs can't get to it.
B0015MUWAU|2|got this blanket from my baby registry and was very disappointed. The blanket is very thin and delicate and even had threads put out in some places. Just a decorative Blanket. Does no good for the baby. With the cost of the shipping included it is so not worth the money. There are plenty usable blankets out there.
B0012VPBMS|4|I like he colors they look just like the picture the only thing I didn't pay close attention to before I ordered was the word TRANSFER I was purchasing decals the ones you can place on take off and re-use these you can't but they are very nice
B000JVXZF2|5|great for grandma's house and to take along to visit relatives
B000TFLMVM|2|My daughter loves playing with this mat and I love the interchangeable manipulatives.  However, throw away the dragonfly (butterfly?) immediately! I was sitting beside my daughter watching t.v. and monitoring her on the activity mat when I looked down and saw the tail of the dragonfly in her mouth and down the back of her throat.   Her face was red and she hadn't been making any sounds because her airway was completely blocked. And obviously she didn't have the cognitive or motor ability to remove the object.  Now at 7 months old my daughter still enjoys the mat, just without the dragonfly!
B00008439C|5|Our toddler boy still enjoys this for naptime and asks for certain sound combinations.  With our little daughter due soon, we decided rather than taking it away from our son, we will buy as second one for our daughter's room.   <br /> <br />It was very effective for our son his entire life so far.
B00029TCNK|3|I was really excited after finding this crib. I had wanted one from target but they wanted to charge $130 for shipping so this seemed like it would be a good alternative. Unfortunately the crib took a long time to arrive and once I recived it I was disappointed. The crib had a lot of nicks in it and the quality was not what I expected. It took my fiance only about a hour to put it together so that was a good thing. I hope the crib will last but I am not sure about the pice of particle board that is supposed to support the matress. I wish I had read some of the reviews before I purchased this crib because if I had I would have never bought it.
B00H4E9WLI|5|I am really loving this chair and so is my daughter. She will sit in it and play so I can get some stuff done around my house.
B001LENCUE|1|This bottle leaks all over the place.  Its a piece of s***. Baby milk is $22 a can. Youll make a bottle next thing you know its all over your bed , baby bag ect. Don't buy!!
B0070U5ISM|1|The plastic rod that supports the items above the childs head snapped and no longer supports the toys above my granddaughter. This happened less than 2 weeks after she received the item. Needs to be better supported.
B00B40QFXQ|5|these are so adorable!
B001LQCOIS|5|I did the most basic way with my first child using steamer and blender.  For my second one, I try Beaba Babycook =p  And no regrets!!!  This is way more convenience and faster! not to mention, FRESHLY MADE!!! I just need to give 5 minutes work to prep and clean. and the rest 15 minutes is just waiting the food to be cooked.  So I now \\"cook\\" twice a day for breakfast and dinner with ease =)    I can see the difference in taste too. The liquid that comes out from the food are used, when pureeing, so using Beaba Babycook enhances the food taste. Yes you can use the liquid that was coming out in the steamer too. However, it is hard to measure how much water I should put to steam the whole batch of food.  More often, I put a lot of water because I worried for burning the pan. So the liquid ended up not as concentrated as the one in the Beaba Babycook.    *Thanks for reading my review, hopefully you can find it useful.  I apologize for any grammatical errors - ESL =p *
B0074U6YZE|4|Yes they are thin, and COULD tear easily if you are not careful. It was pretty easy to use, but the bigger stickers may require 2 people to help ensure it doesn't rip.
B008AHQ28Y|4|This nursing cover works but baby seems to get very warm underneath it.  Granted it is summer now, so in the colder months it will probably work much better.
B000IDSLOG|4|It's very famous. Friends recommend me to buy it for my kid to ease his teeth. It turn out to be very effective.Usually baby hold its neck and eat its head. But my kid likes to eat one of its foot...and stab other feet in his face....I try to correct him but no use...however it's a great toy
B0017T2RYU|2|Says it has 500ft range. It's more like 50ft. SO FRUSTRATING. What's the point if you can't even walk further than 50ft from your baby??? Your ears have better range than this worthless thing!
B001GQ2SA2|3|Baby didn't care for this, only maybe few minutes and that's it
B00CMS6962|3|I ordered these pads less than a year ago (admittedly from a different Amazon seller) and really loved them.  I have always had a heavy flow and they were large enough for me to use without changing frequently.  They were really comfortable and I didn't hate washing them out quite as much as I thought I would.  The most impressive thing was that they kept me drier than disposable pads ever have.  I think this was due to the moisture-wicking material used for the top layer, which drew my flow down into the middle layer of cloth.  I've never had anything leak through to the bottom layer or outside of the wings, which was a worry initially.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved these so much that I recently re-ordered, only 5 months after my first order, so that I'd have plenty of replacements to rotate.  I thought they would be the same exact pads, but it seems the top layer is now made with velour and that was really disappointing.  From what I can tell so far, the velour doesn't seem to be anywhere near as absorbent as the moisture-wicking material.  The velour makes for a really soft pad and for all I know this material might be easier to keep clean than the moisture-wicking stuff, but I wish I would have known about the change in product before I spent my money.<br /><br />I would have given a 5-star rating if not for the unexpected material switch.  I hope the change doesn't prove to be a problem, but I felt the need to give a heads up to anyone considering ordering/re-ordering these.
B000RFG066|4|I like these sippy cups - they're easy to put together, wash clean, and for the most part they don't leak or spill. That being said, I have a 19-month-old boy that gets a personal thrill from banging them upside down on his high chair tray. When he does this, they DO leak. If you have a gentle baby that doesn't enjoy making a ruckus with his cups, these won't leak for you. As it stands, only Playtex has made a sippy cup that can stand up completely to my little guy.
B00UUS65B0|5|My Hip Cub mirror fit perfectly on the headrest in my car! Several others I had tried were too loose and caused issues when looking back to check on my little guy. The saying along the top couldn't be cuter and I will definitely be recommending this to friends and family!
B0000DEW8N|5|This seat is awesome, It is very sturdy and easy to travel with! <br />It doesn't take up alot of room and the tray can be thrown in the dishwasher. <br />There are three different height settings. <br />It even has a carrying strap so your hands are free! <br /> <br />I have no complaints with the seat at all, one of the best choices I made!
B00D7ZAQX6|5|Worked great in my machine :) I will be purchasing more in the future!  I would recommend to friends and family.
B002VXQ4Q8|5|I have been using my Balboa Baby Shopping cart cover for several months now. I don't go into any store without it. I have a 22 month old that loves to touch everything and even put her mouth on the cart and it was just gross - since we have been using this cover she has stayed healthier and it is more comfortable for her to sit in as well. The cover it self folds up into a little built in pocket so that there is not an extra bag to worry about. I love that. It is super easy to get out and put away. Putting the cover on the cart is really easy and I can do it one handed while I hold my baby with the other hand. It is a great product made of durable WASHABLE material and the color has help up great for me. I have the Lime Poppy Cover and we love it!
B00171WXII|5|NoseFrida works better than I expected. It has a longer suction time than a bulb syringe so it really gets that mucus out of their nose. My baby has a cold and she slept SO much better after I used this along with a humidifier.
B00BJOMBE4|5|You can either hang it from your rear view mirror (I'm too old for that) LOL or use it as a key chain! Perfect size!  Let's go RANGERS!!!
B00T4BCH98|5|I keep this small bag by my toilet for the rinsed poopy diapers.  They're put it soaking wetv and sit there for a day before being washed and this bag contains both the water and all smells.
B005194OJ8|1|Very big, bulky and crappy!! I've had this for about 6 mnths and wheels are falling off!! Hard to close!  BAD BAD STROLLER
B004U5BSN4|5|I love this monitor. Discreet camera and love the option for multiple cameras with the one handheld display. Great product!
B004IYFLN0|5|Used the G-Lite on a recent trip with our 8-month old and it worked really well. Lightweight, but really strong and easy to fold up. Would recommend to anyone.
B000R7L80C|5|I loved the way it hold on to place.  we used it on our vacation, we can never know how clean the tables are and this product came in handy.  my little one loved the fact that she knew the characters.
B007LXSBJG|5|Great produce, mom and dad feel safer with it in the crib
B001MMW57Q|3|Well-made, but my kid never really figured it out. I gave it to him well ahead of molar teething time, and he popped it in and quickly dismissed it. When molars started coming in, he had no interest in it.
B003T0MV6E|5|I have a smaller travel pillow than what's available on the market today......the only travel pillowcases I could buy locally were much too big.  All the old pillowcases for it had worn out.  What to do?  Go to Amazon, of course!  When I saw the measurements on these, I knew they would fit my smaller pillow.  They are very well-made, wash and dry nicely (a little bit of shrinkage....but hey, they're 100% cotton flannel!)  This flannel is softer than some used for pillowcases......I like them very much.  Just be sure to MEASURE your pillow before ordering these, because they ARE small.
B00O8RRJ7S|5|Love it!!
B005VLXIS4|1|I regret spending even a cent to buy this product. It is extremely unsafe for infants as the locking mechanism to secure the tub is faulty. My poor baby had a nightmare experience and since then we have given up on this tub.
B00HT6E6GW|1|Save yourself some money and use a normal trash can... And empty it often.  Kicking myself for falling for this one.
B004W7VUOM|3|Smelled like a million old mothballs when I opened the box
B009R27JVU|5|holds poop what else can you ask for?
B004KSPFC6|3|We bought two of these and one has held up well, but the other has had a corner come completely unravelled. I expected more from the company in general and from the price we paid. LO is three months old, and the corner began unravelling very early on. So far, only about 6 weeks of use each, and it probably only made it through about 2 weeks before failing. I love the company, and since the other one is fine, I expect it was a defect in the workmanship of only the one.
B004QZBEFU|5|These are great for sending my son's food to daycare.  Quality is great especially for the price!  I purchased these in different sizes, b/c I loved the product so much.
B00L8JIO4G|5|Beautiful Gate. Functional. Easy to install
B002KING2O|5|better quality then what I was expecting. Great organizer for cleaning supplies. Carry it around as I clean and looks super cute. bought with the matching hamper and I don't even have kids. Just liked the style for my laundry room.
B002JLKHT2|4|This is a very handy item. I had a different one, and wanted to try one with more pockets. VERY useful for organizing a large purse. I can always find things, even in the dark. And when changing purses, things stay in the same basic place. My only regret is that it's black. A lighter color would help find things even easier.
B00DDFCF0C|3|This works fairly well when in range.  You get a clear view and the night vision works well.  It is not an amazingly clear picture - certainly not HD or anything.  The camera angle is fairly narrow, it would be much better if it were a wide angle camera.  A fisheye would be ideal.<br /><br />The audio is clear from the camera to the display, but the speaker on the camera renders 2 way conversation pretty useless.  Your child will not recognize your voice.<br /><br />The largest problem, however, is range.  I have a pretty large house (~5,000 sq ft over three floors).  It is standard wood and drywall construction.  I am in a very rural area, so there is not much RF interference.  I had very irregular reception.  Sometimes I would have full range power a few rooms away, but move ten feet further and the reception drops to zero.  Other times I would have full coverage, but then the microwave (or something) would cause it to lose all connection for a moment.  The MOST annoying problem is the out of range chime.  It is loud and cannot be disabled.  Thus, if you leave this in a area with good coverage - but it periodically loses the connection - you get an out of range alarm.  This cannot be turned off.<br /><br />There is a temperature gauge, but it reads about 5 degrees hotter than actual (checked with laser thermometer).  This is probably because the temp sensor gets effected by the electrical heat from the camera body itself.<br /><br />Thus, this is okay, not great.  The reason to buy this is because you like the larger screen.  The other features are a bit hit or miss.
B007D462KI|5|I am a first time mom who was using disposable pads. I was getting irritations from the disposable. I searched for reusable liners and ordered these. I love them because of how soft they are next to my skin as well as thin bad super absorbent.
B00158DS0U|5|I highly recommend.  I use these for my bag every time we use the stroller. I even hook my dogs leash on it during walks.
B00794DDBS|5|LOVE THESE. I don't know what I would do without these blankets. I like that they're stretchy so they can accommodate my growing baby girl.
B000I1A7AO|5|I been using the product for 10 years. It last a long time. I needed an ice mat to fit into my cat's automatic feeder. This product is high quality. I also cut the mat into 4 cubes
B003XT9Y7U|5|Perfect for my baby girl.  Fits great in my jogging stroller and my double stroller.
B0038JE3RQ|5|These are great changing pads- they're so convenient and portable, easy to clean, and they work great. I bought 3- one for upstairs, one for downstairs, and one for my diaper bag. So nice to have one everywhere! =)
B002QYW8LW|5|Very good！
B000067K0L|4|Baby happy withe this
B004RBC3XK|2|The mesh is horribly hard and rough... The baby has to have long shorts/pants and a shirt that will guard against chaffing. Not as easy to use as I thought it would be... you kinda have to squeeze both you and baby into it.  I wouldn't think it would be very comfortable to sit in.<br />Also weight recommendations contradict each other... The tag says 20 pound limit and the booklet says 24 pound limit.. not sure which is right.
B002WRGGWA|5|Great product
B005O8IK6O|5|Was the perfect Father's Day gift for grandpa!! He loved it and it just turned out perfectly!
B001V7QLX6|5|I am editing my review after using these for a week. Initially I was disappointed because these turned out to be basically a double cheese cloths with a pattern on one side. However I revised my review and now give it the full 5 stars. They are very soft yet strong. Excellent for swaddling. These go through wash every day and so far show no signs of losing color or tearing. They are very large and offer lots of different options like folding in two or wrapping with multiple layers. We go through these wraps first on the daily basis before turning to the less than perfect wraps from the other brands. The presentation is beautiful and it would make a lovely present to the parents.
B004BJ0SNA|1|I got these and the VERY FIRST time I tried to put these on a cabinet and tighten, they broke. Each of the 3 in the set was broken withing 1 minute of opening the package.
B000LXQVA4|5|Loved it. And my baby too.
B00BQEGW3S|5|The only pacifier that she can keep in her mouth!
B00DNZ6BVG|1|My baby it doesn't like it...c r ying.  Seat is uncomfortable.<br /><br />1
B001CCHUTE|5|I absolutely love this cover!  I went 4 months without having it and now know that it's one of the essentials.  I tried using blankets when in public but the ease of the Bebe Au Lait cover and its large size help completely cover you and the baby.  My favorite part is being able to look down and see me son.  I also love the corner burp cloths and was very happy to find that the pattern did not fade when I washed it.  Excellent product!
B001VEJ2GC|5|Super duper soft and washes really nicely (icky things get on here and it’s still snow white and so soft).
B00N19UP0C|5|Wash wash wash and they WILL soften up! I was skeptical of the reviews that claimed these were comparable to that &#34;other&#34; brand of muslin blankets as I have both and I was initially disappointed with the feel of these. However, after washing and drying them several times (beware putting velcro items in with them - they will snag) they are just as soft. The patterns haven't faded at all and I now like them even more than that &#34;other&#34; brand. They make cute backgrounds for photos, can also function as a nursing cover (I just loosely tie 2 of the corners together), burp rag, sun shade, and more. We don't leave home without one! I would definitely purchase again.
B000WJLKQM|5|Great Product, didn't get to use much because Grandson outgrew it!
B00JUHG36Y|2|Tried twice to get this item as it shows on the page. Description and pic shows it having a wired plug that plugs into an outlet. It is not. It is only battery operated. Second time sending it back.
B00GSNFG84|5|Purchased for my upcoming granddaughter.  Loved the quality.  The stroller turns on a dime with such east!
B00AM5NTIS|5|Absolutely wonderful customer service! I already ordered another pack just to have more on hand.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Can use generic caps from other pre filled pouches at the store<br />Holds the most ounces compared to other brands. Not too bulky also for babies.<br />Dishwasher safe<br />Freezable<br />Can stand on end<br />Fairly easy to clean<br />Just Great overall!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Don't over fill and freeze!<br /><br />We really like these over the other brands, I have tried others like the Sqoooshi animals which are smaller and flimsy.
B000BXHPEU|5|This product is so easy and fast to use.  I am not getting why some people are having difficulty placing it on the seat.  That's all you do!  Place it on the seat!!!  What is so difficult?!?!  Folds and unfolds easily, places right on and within 3 seconds of closing the bathroom door, your child is using the seat.
B00B507BGK|5|I can't say How it will perform in a collision (hopefully never will) but I felt that with it conforming to the stricter guidelines in Europe, it was a safer seat than those I researched. I almost went with the Britax Advocate, but did a whole lot of research beforehand. There aren't as many official reviews of this seat, but I found mostly other parents highly reviewed and recommended it. As for comfort, my son loves it.<br /><br />Shoulder Pads are stationary on the straps so I don't have to constantly adjust them, which I like.<br /><br />Much easier to pull the straps tight as opposed to the Britax Boulevard, which is what we had before. It also seems much more substantial to myself and my husband in terms of safety. Overall we are very happy with it-my son really likes knowing he has a \\"racing car seat\\".
B00P8SDZGK|5|Product was great!  Definitely helps to keep the smell out of the room in addition to use with the diaper pail.
B00R3AY9NE|5|A great product
B00CSAWIP0|5|i GOT TWO OF THESE FOR MY TWIN GRANDSONS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD.  THEY FUNCTION AS DESCRIBED AND THEIR 8 MONTH OLD SISTER CAN USE IT TOO.  THEY WERE EASY TO INSTALL AND FIT SECURELY ON BOTH MY DINING ROOM CHAIRS AND A STANDARD FOLDING CHAIR.  THEY TAKE UP LESS SPACE THAN A TRADITIONAL HIGHCHAIR WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO USE IN MY HOME. THE TRAYS ARE SMALLER THAN A STANDARD HIGH CHAIR, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE TRAY HAS A CUP HOLDER - THAT'S THE ONE WE USE THE MOST.
B00KMQYKSK|5|Good condition
B008NDC86K|5|I did a lot of research for a carseat. My child was 10 months old when I purchased this one. I love it. I have a 2 door escort that I was worried about it fitting into and what not, but I have absolutely no complaints about it! It is the perfect size, comfortable for her, and worth the money!
B001QXCF0I|4|Love it. The husband has even put it in the dishwasher with no problems. The wee one loves it. It is great!
B00PB5NDPI|5|The quality of these sheets is excellent!  They are super soft and cuddly and made very well.  Wish the sheets on my bed were that comfy!
B0028RY9IW|5|I currently use this over my glass BornFree 5oz bottle, it's nice to have a soft cover over the glass. It also fits a 8oz canning jar... Great product. I will be purchasing more, as my daughter gets older (she's only 6 months now), because I plan on only using glass or stainless steel cups with her. I don't use plastic- this is made of 100% silicone. Highly recommend.
B004V8VQC8|5|Great toy, great service. This toy is very good for baby's development. Our 3-month old granddaughter loves it. Thank you!
B004J4VY0S|5|I will recommend these to any mom who wants to breast n bottle feed at the same time.
B00KA8I58G|5|Who knew that we wouldn't need a big high chair to feed our son? Bought this for going to grandma and grandpa's house 3 days a week. Works great! Travels easily and cleans up easily.
B001OC5UNA|5|Did the trick and easy.
B00EDFS7T4|5|I purchased these decals on 8-2-14 , received on 8/16/14 and put up 8/17/14.<br />Shipping was quicker than expected! And the decals look great! Took me about 10 minutes to put it. Doesn't come with instructions but I followed the picture on here. It was the perfect detail to finish up my children's bedroom. Awesome deal for the price!!!!
B00HNG5T1O|2|Our little boy was born with medical complications, and would cry up to 15 hours a day.  His ONLY comfort, up to surgery four weeks ago, had been rocking or swinging in a side to side motion, making a swing the only chance I had to eat, or shower, while my husband is gone away to work four days a week.<br />We've been though two swings, this is our third.  The first two swings were made by Fisher Price, most of which have poor reviews about the motor.  After purchasing the first swing by FP, it barely \\"swayed\\" with our 7lb 1 month old in it, and the second FP swings motor died (even though our baby is now only 13.5lbs) just a few months after using it, feeling disappointed in that brands poor quality motor, I decided to purchase this Ingenuity Inlighten Swing.<br /><br />After spending time setting up this swing, and testing it out for an hour, we've decided we'd like to take it back to the store.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />The instructions are very unclear, but we managed to get it put together, somewhat nervously, because the parts seem delicate and cheaply made.<br /><br />When we put our son in it, we found that it lists to one side (the right) when used in side to side swinging motion (our son's favourite).  We tried to tighten and fiddle with the swing, and adjust the baby's position, but it didn't make a difference with the tilt.  Not only is this a safety issue, but our son's head flops to one side because of this, I had to roll a receiving blanket to put under the side of his head, without it, I imagine it would strain his neck.<br /><br />Another negative we find the music is very quiet - too quiet really, with any other household noises, it's not very audible over these day to day sounds.  I also don't like that the music is timed and shuts off.<br /><br />Finally, at the longest length, the straps barely fit our son with the plush insert in - he's only in the 25th percentile for height and weight at 5 months old.  He'll grow out of it long before he comes close to 25 lbs or 12 months old - which means there was no point in buying it today.  Even with adjustments, and the plush insert out the straps barely fit, but the insert is necessary as our son's head/neck isn't supported, his chin tucks into his chest without the insert in, and I worry that he will asphyxiate.<br /><br />I'm sad because finding the time to go back and forth to the store, and put the swings together, takes time I don't have.<br /><br />I love the idea of the MP3/Ipod option, the vibrate option, the colours, the mirror, lights, the side to side swing motion and HOW QUIETLY the swing moves (no squeaks or creaks), but safety is our priority, and this swing is just far too unsafe, and for the price, seems very low quality.<br /><br />I'm happy being brand loyal to good companies and products, especially with so many purchases to be made for our baby in the future, and I really wanted to veer away from the other swing/toy manufacturer because of all of the reported issues with most of their swing models.  This Inlighten Swing just isn't cutting it though. :(
B00292SOEQ|4|This is a great toy, however my husband had to do some alterations as the caps on the wheels kept falling off.
B001N4NFNG|5|The decals are adorable, fit our decor perfectly, and look very elegant in the room. We ended up having to peel them off a few times and they stayed in nice condition. I highly recommend!
B00ICU438U|5|This is a must-have for all parents.
B00DTUN3J8|5|These stickers are such a great idea.  Put them on a onesie, take lots of pictures and years from now when you wouldn't normally remember how old the baby is when you took the picture---You will!!<br /><br />Adorable, especially if you're into owls.
B00I3X6EE2|5|Adorable, durable and cleans up well.
B006ZISU44|3|It is a little bit smaller than I thought, not very easy to assemble and a little bit heavy. The cushion is not really soft, more on the hard side, but I believe that most of the portable beds are like that, you may be able to compliment with an external, softer cushion though. It feels solid, I think it will server us well.
B0030EH8OO|1|2nd time using it, the left front wheel snapped off, causing stroller to pitch forward onto its' left side, taking my baby with it.  She was in the seat harness and thankfully it held.  She was in a hooded winter bunny suit, so the left side of her face was cushioned as it hit the sidewalk.    No mitigating factors in Kolcraft's favor -- baby wasn't overweight, stroller wasn't over-loaded with extra baby stuff (diaper bags, etc.).    Hope to find grounds to sue Kolcraft very soon.  Deplorable workmanship.
B004K6LMVQ|5|good !!!
B00BUTJGZK|4|This set is really nice, better than expected.  It arrived early.  I gave it a 4 because of a dye stain on the bedskirt.  I contacted the supplier and the were very courteous and helpful.  I received my new set in a matter of days.  The quilt is huge.  this was a perfect set for my son and makes me happy to know it will last since it is made well.
B00009VE04|5|I absolutly love this crib set the colors are perfect.  All the extras make it a great buy.  I was able to decorate with the wonderful wall art and the poems for there hands and feet were perfect i love it. It can be used for a boy or a girl easily!
B002WYKJWG|5|We already had a crib (that cost about $300) and we wanted a spare for the downstairs bedroom.  I did enough research to ensure it was not a recall model and ordered it online without seeing it in person.  I am impressed with the straighforward design, practical with no frills, easy to erect. It even comes with a bite protector for the front rail; the expensive one doesn't have that and baby  chewed through the clear sealing coat!  From what I can see the only advantage the more expensive cribs have is in the method of atttachmenting the mattress frame.  The expensive models have at least two bolts in each corner securing the mattress frame to the uprighs, this crib has only one screw per corner.  Now unless your child uses the crib as a trampoline this screw should do the job.    Finish is nice and the crib is extremely sturdy..good buy.
B0003QDLY8|4|I was really impressed that it was so lightweight. The cupholders by the handle bars definetly come in handy. Very spacy, well cushioned...and considering I drive a small vehicle it fits really well in the trunk. I gave it a 4 because the wheels do tend to get you a bit dirty when you're storing it. Overall my son loves this stroller!
B00G15LRWS|5|My 2 year old son loves these !! Very well made and fun !
B00AAJNHA6|1|Less than 2 months after receiving it has stopped working...the camera will no longer rotate up...no option for contacting the company.
B001UF8BL4|5|Got this for my nephew for christmas, he loves it, perfect too for a play pen
B004GY8A58|5|Great
B0009JOSNM|4|I found this carrier to be safe and easy to use but my daughter, who at 5 months is over 20 pounds, is outgrowing it.  Most people will be able to use it much longer than we will.  It provided head support when she was a newborn and now that she is bigger she enjoys facing out and seeing the world. At this size the top folds down and she can experience the outdoors as I let her touch trees, for example.  All in all a great product.  If they come out with one adjustable up to 40 pounds I'll be first in line.
B00JS7XYWW|2|pockets are too shallow, the straps were cheaply made.
B00T9QLAYG|1|Had to return....didnt work well.  This is for short cords.  I couldnt get it to wind our medium to long cords
B0085DJ71M|5|So soft and beautiful! I have a lot of different A&A swaddle sand I'm glad I have these in the rotation. I don't use to actually swaddle because material is so soft my baby breaks out easier.nhowever, I use as stroller blankets a lot. I might even use as scarves once my baby no longer needs them!
B00292BF1K|5|We'd be totally lost without Bunny--our 2-year-old is absolutely devoted to it. My son received this as a gift at birth and has been attached to it since about 6 months old. We actually have two of these that are identical (he doesn't know!)  so that one can be in the wash. They wash and dry beautifully. I throw them into a mesh lingerie bag so they don't get too stretched out. Now that he's 2, he no longer uses a pacifier, but his love for Bunny is still strong--in fact, I think the fact that he still had the bunny made taking away the paci much easier! Now this is my go-to baby gift.
B001QXD2X2|2|I bought two of these for my son - he insisted on a seat that looked good.  At the same time, I bought my daughter 2 Graco Turbo Boosters.  I do not like these seats.  First, the arm rests are not adjustable and since they're so low it's difficult to get the seatbelt under the arms appropriately.  But the worst feature is that the seat is too narrow.  My son leans over to pick something up, the seat tips.  We drive around a curve, the seat tips.  I got so tired of telling my son to 'sit up straight' because the seat was leaning that I went and bought him 2 Graco Turbo Boosters.  SO MUCH BETTER!  No more leaning seats every time he moves an inch.    The ONLY thing I would recommend this seat for was if it was going to be in between two other carseats or boosters - they would help keep the seat in place better.
B000056JJB|5|for several reasons.  It is mulitpurpose and as you know if you are a parent that is a big plus.  Right now I use it to catch my son's flying food but it can later be used to protect the table top from art projects.  Wonderful addition to any shower gift!
B003FZPD1I|5|This is so much better than the fleece Halo sleep sack we had been using for my son this winter. The fleece made him sweaty and this is still warm but also breathable and seems to regulate his temperature nicely. The zipper is big and much easier to manage than Aden and Anais sacks. Love the snaps that making getting in and out super easy. A great sleep sack for all seasons!
B003EAMRCM|5|Perfect letter size for cute craft projects! Wonderful product!
B004IZWQYQ|5|We gave this toy to my 9 month old for Christmas and he loved it! It comes with 3 balls that are see through with balls inside so they make noise when shaken.  The balls are big enough where my 9 month old can put them in his mouth.  The height of the ball ramp is perfect, he can sit down and the top of the ramp is at eye level.  This toy has peaked his interest longer than any other toy he has.  He sits down and drops the balls down the hole at the top and watches them go down the ramp. I think this is a great toy for a 9 month old! The pieces are big and easy to put together. I would definitely recommend this toy.
B003R60RNE|5|Love them, they are so cute!  Bought them as part of a baby gift for an expectant mom who is a Cowboy fan.  She just loved them.  Delivery was quick, thanks
B002J4U8M0|5|Adorable mirror and precious bugs. I have seen people asking if it stands up on its own and the answer is yes.
B002GDF3T2|2|These are ok but not as good as the regular Dr Brown bottles. I had trouble with these leaking
B009W8XW0G|5|We love this product in our 2 cars.  Our daughter doesnt have to worry about getting all of the snow off of her boots now in the winter.  Thanks!
B000PE8B8O|1|I wish the product description specified what type of pump these tubes could be used for. I have the older Advanced Pump in Style and these tubes didn't work. I ended up getting the correct tubes from a local women's center for $8.
B001IACJQ4|5|This has been a great chair. We have had it for the past 2 years. You cant beat it for the price.<br /><br />Only 2 little things. One is that the chair will occasionally squeaks although this is fixed with a little WD40. The other is that the cloth gets a little worn over time but I guess that is to be expected given the price.
B00B5TL2C0|4|Work well for my 20 month old. I wish there was a way to know for CERTAIN it's not going to pop open.  Fairly easy to clean, except for the lid. That takes a toothpick.
B005MQRA1E|4|Easy to install as far as child safety seats go.  the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the head bolsters interfere with headphones my child wears to watch DVDs.  Not a &#34;show stopper&#34; but something to consider.
B00067AEGC|4|We have 2 of these gates and love them. It says not for use with pets, but we bought them for our dogs and they work great. The only issue is that they are a pain to adjust. We have one open as wide as it goes and making it smaller takes quite some time. But they're very durable and open wider than any other gate I've seen.
B002M77N22|5|My son is now 8 weeks old and we've been alternating sleeping/napping in this with the playard with crib we have in our bedroom and his actual crib in his nursery. When he is gassy and fussy, he doesn't like to lay flat. This is the only place he will rest for more than 20-30 minutes, especially for naps. Its inclined, so it cradles him and mimics him sleeping in my arms. Its also helps push his knees in closer to his belly which obviously makes him feel better. Its very easy to put together and stable. Also light and easy to travel with. I highly recommend it!
B000W8RN46|3|We LOVE our Halo sleep sacks and wouldn't change to anything else, but I now have mixed feelings about the early-walker foot opening sleep sacks. My daughters feet froze at night; the reason we had her in a sleep sack to begin with is because she moves around a lot at night so she can't keep a blanket over her, so this was no help in that department. We tried putting socks on her, but she only pulled them off and kept waking herself up. We went back to the sleep sacks with no foot openings, and have had no problems. I highly recommend Halo sleep sacks, but if you have children that move around a lot at night and take their socks off while putting themselves to sleep, you might want to stick to the regular style and avoid the pre-walkers. The regular style also keeps her from being able to climb out of bed, which is an added bonus we hadn't previously realized!
B005KWLEVW|5|My granddaughter loves this.  We put frozen fruit in there, although I wish it held a little more, it is the right size for her 6 month mouth.
B00TX367DY|5|Fits perfectly, colors are subtle and match my Graco Pack N Play perfectly1
B006SFUEF2|5|Best thing for an almost 2yo.  She sleeps :)
B00A0ID90A|5|Amazing and easy to use! So much better than the multi piece ones out there. Only 1 piece to pull out and clean. Great for boys!
B000FRBCJG|1|These are pretty ugly baskets and the price is not cheap enough to warrant that.
B0035RQF54|5|Super easy install. Works fine. Just wish they would have used a softer material or something. I'm starting to see scuffs and chips in the paint on my door frames where the latch hits at each closing. But oh well. The kids destroy everything else. Why not this, too.
B00083HK0M|5|I gave these as a gift to a friend who needed it and she says it is are great and loves it
B008RW6VZG|3|I really wanted to like this stroller, but I suppose it just wasn't meant to be.  I like so many of the great features this stroller offers but using many of these features is cumbersome at best.<br /><br />Assembly for this stroller wasn't bad.  It took me about ten minutes to snap it all together.  No tools are required so that's a plus.  If you are familiar with the pictogram instruction manuals from Ikea, then you'll feel right at home with the instruction manual for this stroller.  I wasn't impressed with their pictogram instruction, especially since it failed to tell you how to use the universal car seat adaptor that is included with the stroller.  I had to figure out how to attach that by trial and error.  Maybe it's just me, but something that has the important job of holding your infant  should have some clear instructions on how to use it.<br /><br />The \\"lightweight steel frame\\" for this stroller is HEAVY.  I was shocked at the weight of this stroller.  It's not something I would want to be lifting in and out of my van on a regular basis.  I thought the Britax B-Agile double was a bit weighty for a light weight double, but next to this behemoth, the B-Agile seems like a feather weight.<br /><br />Folding this stroller is cumbersome.  You need two hands to press the releases to fold it, and because of the stroller's weight I felt like I was getting pulled down with the stroller as it folded.  The stroller doesn't self latch when it folds up, so you'll have to manually latch it with a latch the likes of which I haven't seen on a stroller since the old Graco strollers from 11-14 years ago.  Between the massive weight and ancient style latch, I felt like I was time traveling.<br /><br />I do like the upholstery for the stroller.  It's very nice.  The seats are also nicely padded.  My eleven month old seemed to find the stroller comfortable in both seats.  She had plenty of leg room in the rear seat, but I think an older child might feel cramped in that seat.  It's important to note that the weight limit for the rear seat is 33lbs and the front seat can hold up to 40lbs.  I was a bit surprised to see that the box for this stroller says it's for infants aged 6 months and up.<br /><br />The recline on the front seat is quite nice.  Simply pull up on the metal bar to adjust the back rest.  This is actually the type of seat recline that I prefer on a stroller.  It's much nicer than the \\"infinite recline\\" features that utilize a mesh strap.  The rear seat has a zipper recline where you pull down a zipper that is located on either side of the seat.  It's does the job, but it doesn't recline very far.<br /><br />The \\"generous\\" canopy isn't anything to write home about.  It's a big canopy, but it doesn't offer full protection for the child riding in the front.  The child in the rear seat can be fully covered by this canopy, but you'll have to unzip it to get to your child.<br /><br />The included rain hood it a nice touch, but whether or not you'll need it depends on how frequently you get stuck out in the rain while using the stroller.  I have a Chicco stroller that has a rain hood that has been used just once in seven years.  Rain hoods like this are really only worth the effort it takes to put them on if you're actually going to be out in the rain for an extended period  while it's raining (think a day at an amusement park or a soccer game, not a quick run through the parking lot from your car to the store).<br /><br />The stroller handles nicely and offers a smooth ride.  The front wheel swivels well and offers good maneuverability.  The one touch break is nice, but I found the one on my stroller to be a bit stiff.  Maybe with use it will loosen up a bit.  The adjustable handle bar is a nice feature, too.<br /><br />Aside from the massive weight of this stroller my biggest annoyances with the stroller come down to it's inability to be folded up with it's attachments in place.  If you add the second seat, you'll have to takeit off to fold it up.  The idea of having to install and remove the second seat anytime the stroller is being used is very unappealing.  The same goes for the universal infant seat attachment.  You can't fold the stroller with that attached so you'll have to go through the process of attaching and detaching that every time you have to lug this stroller in and out of your car.  I suppose the people who designed this weren't too worried about how convenient this stroller would be for the parents who would be using it.<br /><br />Surely there are better double strollers out there for those seeking a tandem model.  Testing out this stroller gave me a newfound appreciation for the Britax B-Agile double.  That one is lighter, folds up easily and bit more compactly and can hold up to 50lbs per seat.  It also has better handling.<br /><br />For what this stroller costs, I would pass on it and find something else.  Sometimes it's best to visit a local baby store and test drive several models to see which one will best suit your lifestyle.  The Hauck FreeRider just isn't a good match for our family.it off to fold it up.  The idea of having to install and remove the second seat anytime the stroller is being used is very unappealing.

B00KF4DDZU|1|I bought this pillow two different times for my 2-year-old daughter. The first time I put it in the washer to wash it and the pillow stuffing came out in the washer. Big mess! The other time, my daughter slept on it the second night of having it and the seams tore open and the stuffing came out. This pillow is poor quality!
B00ECHYTBI|2|We bought this monitor in February and it broke about 6 weeks later (the USB port broke off and fell into the white monitor unit).  Infant Optics replaced it and it broke again last night after about 6 weeks (monitor wont hold a charge -- appears to also be an issue with USB connection).  They are sending out another one but like others who have written reviews here, I am FED UP with the incredibly poor quality control for such an expensive product.  It gets two stars because when it worked it served its purpose.
B001TPROFE|1|Too small even for my preemie who wears smaller than normal sizes...
B0026K2BG8|5|Great gift for my little granddaughter. I have gotten one of these for each of my grand children, along with a keepsake box for their mothers, in which they may store each childs lost teeth.
B00LYQ53JW|5|This product is awesome! My little one is a month old and I just got mine recently. We've been putting diaper rash ointment on with our fingers, and it's a mess! Using the Baby Bum Brush is so much faster, easier, and virtually no mess! This will certainly be a product I recommend to others!
B001F268ZI|4|These were the only bib we could keep on my daughter for quite some time.  do start to wear out after a number of washes.  expected though.
B000JVXZF2|4|It is nothing fancy but it does the job. I took the cover off because found it really wasn't useful. I use it for a second highchair because I take care of my grandkids and didn't want to spend the money or take up more space for another highchair. Besides when they grow I will be able to use this as a booster at the table too.
B000067PE5|1|I soaked it in a hot soapy water as I always do with the other baby's stuff. Small cups got deformed and cannot be screwed into main parts. Very disappointed.
B00BZO1PEA|5|Love, love love this highchair.  This is our 3rd chair and our son loves it. It is super comfy, super lightweight, looks great in our house and easy to pull right up to the table... also easy to clean!  No big pads to dry out.  I wish I'd found this one initially.  With kids products stuff is so hit and miss.  So glad I found this, it works out perfectly for us!  :-)
B004O9WY9S|3|Be warned that you'll need to order 2 of these if you're looking to replace symphony valve covers/tubes, etc. For bizarre reasons, this \\"kit\\" only contains one of each. Seems like a \\"kit\\" should contain two to be full replacement, etc. Grumble, grumble.
B00K6KY6H2|5|I really like these blankets, but swaddling with them does not work for us. These blankets have some stretch to them, so my wiggly baby can get his arms out without fail.
B000MUBWTG|5|This is the only swaddling blanket that worked for us. We have given it as a shower gift many times. Everything about it is just right, and so soothing for littlest ones.
B00003TL7P|5|We decided to try something different than what our other friends had purchased.   So we got the Diaper Champ and it is great.  Holds more,easy to use and cheaper because you do not have to buy the replacement bags.  We have no noticed any odor.  We use Glad odor shields garbage bags and have had no problem.
B00FDMRMS8|5|Amazing for late night bottles and travel, not an oz of formula wasted!
B000PGMS68|5|I have a small apartment and was hesitant to buy a full size high chair, but ended up with this one after reading a ton of reviews.  It is a great product. No assembly and very easy to use. Chair pad and tray wipe up clean, easier than my baby does!! Folds easily and quickly, fits in the small space on the side of my dryer. My only complaint is I wished it came with a Graco \\"mix and move\\" toy which attaches to the under-tray (optional)... Only because they are hard to find, but handy. happy shopping!
B0046RDGAE|5|I purchased this recliner for Christmas for my son. He absolutely loves it! It is everything I expected. It is a little hard to recline and he can't do it by himself yet, but it is good quality. I expect it to last a long time. He hasn't spilled anything on it yet, so I cannot say if it's difficult to clean or not. So far it's a great buy!
B004WN7AH2|5|I love this! It is so convenient for carrying stuff on the stroller especially when your stroller doesn't have a lot of storage.
B002PI3J80|5|You unzip this an wipe it and is ready to go, the best bib for a toddler, 90% of the mess ends up in the bag..
B003PCYMP4|5|Love these! My daughter has had two (one was destroyed by a dog) and she LOVES them. Great baby shower gift
B007C5B384|5|Love this bar.  I hate that it costs extra with a $600 stroller, it should be included.  I use this bar to hold my infant seat since the adapter has bad reviews.  It doesn't work perfectly, but just fine for quick errands when I don't want to get my baby out of the car seat.
B002QYW8LW|4|We got this toothbrush because our daughter hated having her teeth wiped off with a damp cloth, and we didn't enjoy being bitten every night either! The first night we used the banana brush, she was totally excited and toothbrushing time was actually fun! Later that week I let her practice brushing her teeth on her own. Unfortunately, she was able to bite off one of the bristles from the toothbrush. We still use the toothbrush almost every night, but I don't allow her to chew on it. Overall, a great product. Just use it wisely.
B005G5TN5W|5|Best baby product ever
B000BUQNXW|4|[Good]<br /><br />It's comfy. No surprise since it's cotton on top.<br /><br />The sheet's inner layer has a water resistant vinyl to keep your mattress dry.<br /><br />Compared to buying a water resistant mattress, it's cheaper.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Lack of convenience: Vinyl is very heat sensitive. It's very easy to screw up the vinyl if you dry it too hot or too long. Ideally if your climate permits it, I would hang dry it. Having to think about how to dry this thing instead of just dumping it in two machines to get it done is a bit annoying for us.<br /><br />[Misc]<br /><br />We didn't have any incidents yet to test the water resistance. I will update the review when this happens.<br /><br />[Verdict]<br /><br />If you don't want to have to think and still have something water resistant, I would recommend getting a water resistant mattress instead. If your budget is an issue, then this isn't a bad choice.
B000H1XM8E|5|I hesitated to register for this blanket because it's so expensive, but I am so glad I did.  It's worth the money because we get so much more use out of it than the smaller, cheaper receiving blankets.  This is our favorite blanket for cold weather or air conditioned rooms, while we usually use the Aden + Anais muslin blankets (also expensive but worth it) in warmer weather.  I also thought about getting this blanket in a different color or pattern, but I am glad I went with the off-white flannel with chocolate trim stitching.  It matches everything, and when it's in photos (which is often), it's neutral, keeping the focus on my son.  The blanket is a great size (big enough for swaddling), super soft, just the right thickness (warm but not too heavy), and washes/wears well.  The only things I would change are the tags.  There are two, and while they are silky and soft, they are still annoying.  One is kind of large and has swaddling instructions, which I think is unnecessary to permanently attach to the blanket.  The tags are sewn in with the decorative edge stitching, so cutting them off might mess up the blanket.  They are centered on one side, which makes folding the blanket in halves awkward, and we're frequently adjusting the blanket so that the tags aren't near our baby's face.  Even with that minor complaint, though, I still give this blanket five stars.
B00PJRBUEY|5|So far my child has liked it.
B00E3OY80W|5|I received this free for testing through infulenster.com's voxbox campaign. I thought it was an pricey thermometer since I've always used the regular thermo (from the hospital). The instructions were very easy to follow and it took my less than 5 minutes to understand it all. My toddler ran in horror when he saw I was about to take his temperature and I prepared for the worse. I quickly put it in his ear and in less than ONE MISSI---BEEEP it was DONE! It took longer to turn the device on than it did to give an acculturate reading. My toddler was as shocked as I was! I wish I had this when he was a newborn and baby! It would have made life as a new mom (or any parents life) waaay easier! This is a MUST HAVE for all baby shower registries!
B000FT9J2G|5|It is beautiful!  I found it easy to assemble despite other claims.  The pad thickness was also fine after you put a plush cover on it.  The pad fits nice & safely snug with frame.  Side rails are ideal for hanging the diaper stacker, blankets or clothing.  Very roomy drawers.  I was excited to find a beautiful & practical piece for the price and hoped I wouldn't be disappointed when it was assembled.<br />I was NOT disappointed at all!!!  It will be beautiful in my grandson's nursery & his room as he matures.  Thrilled to find a great piece for a great price!
B0025L37VG|2|I got this breastfeeding pillow after reading others' reviews about how great it was.  I ended up using it a total of 3 times and packing it away (for what, I don't know, but I can't bring myself to throw it away since it was almost $50.)  Unless you're traveling a lot, this is a pointless design.  You have to inflate it to use it and, while you can keep it inflated, you will have to re-inflate it after a few uses as it deflates a little each time.  Also, unlike a Boppy, which you can quickly put on with one hand while holding a baby, this pillow requires that you strap it around you and you need to have two free hands to do so.  Plus, once it's around you, the pillow isn't thick enough to hold the baby high enough to make breastfeeding comfortable, so you end up slouching, hurting your back even more.<br /><br />I thought it was a complete waste of money.  I have the Boppy now, which I am very happy with.  Not only does it work great as a breastfeeding pillow, but I also use it to prop up my baby during playtime and he loves it.
B004BF774M|4|Cheaply made, ordered a 48-pack and was more than we needed for the shower so we didn't feel bad tossing them out after. None broke as per previous reviews and all opened and closed fine. Very very small but perfect for the baby clothespin game. It was a big hit.
B007HVKV8G|5|Bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas....she loves it. She is a  big Dora fan. Will last for many years for her.
B003UB3P3A|5|Britax has always been the brand of choice. Don't compromise on safety. This seat is well padded unlike most others. Safety and comfort what a concept. Great colors for the mature child. Cup holders work well. My child loves it. Britax does it again. Great seat.
B00OVSBY48|5|My daughter has the whole car seat and I just have the base.  It makes it very convenient for both of us.
B003VWCYSU|5|My daughter loves this chair. She is 18 months.
B000J28F56|5|We just bought this stroller and the primo viaggo car seat in mod verde. Our baby hasn't arrived yet, but set up of the stroller was very easy and it is MUCH smaller than the other travel systems we saw in the store. The car seat clicks easily into place AFTER we found the secret little latches that are on the bottom of the seat. Otherwise, set-up was a breeze. The stroller opens and closes very easily without any difficulty. The sun shade is extremely generous in size (perfect for the Arizona sun). The wheels seems like a decent size for a lightweight stroller.   All in all, the stroller seems like a very good buy with plenty of smart features.
B00NH1BA6W|5|So easy to use. Looks great. Fast deliver. Couldn't be happier.
B00GHM87IC|5|Well recommended. Brilliant car seat
B00LBH9MH8|1|These hats were advertised as 0-6 months. The babies are 6 months old, and they are way too big. Maybe in a year, they may fit.
B00073HJG8|5|when they say jumbo, it is actually oversized.  It fits ALL my 3 daughters stuffed animals in one.  It is great.
B0077M41Z4|5|I bought these to clean out our straws on our coffee tumblers, worked great and good at fitting into small spaces.
B000YDDF6O|5|My 12 month old loves this toy. We've had it since he was 3 months old and he has yet to grow tired of it. He plays with it at home and on the go. At times it's been an absolute lifesaver. Who would have thought that such a \\"basic\\" toy would've captivated a little mind so intensely and for so long.
B00064NZQQ|3|This is an o.k. toy.  My biggest complaint is that the height is not adjustable and my son has already outgrown it at 6 months and he is the perfect age to enjoy it.  It is also difficult for him to slide back and forth to reach the different toys.  Should have bought an exersaucer-the height is adjustable to growing babies.
B000GKU4VE|5|I was disappointed to have to immediately buy something else after having spent so much on the stroller, but it has no seat padding and the Warm Fuzzy is necessary.  We are in a warm climate and it doesn't make our son too hot.    Highly recommend the stroller and this accessory.
B00DQL6CI4|1|I ordered this so that I can have my wet wipes easily accessible. However, the container is not air tight, so the wipes dried out. If I want to use it, I have to find wipes in packages that would fit in this container. Waste of money ((
B008BGNT4E|5|[[VIDEOID:mo3MZXJKTZBVBT6]]We purchased this at 4 months old, when the baby could barely hold herself up.  But she was soon after able to sit in it and we could put her favorite toys on the tray, even though her feet didn't touch.  She is now 10 months old.<br /><br />It didn't take long for her feet to touch the ground and she was off.  She can easily maneuver herself around in this.  She loves it because it allows her to be more a part of the interaction with the other kids because she can walk in it well, while she's not a good walker by herself independently.  She gets in the middle of every fun event she can.  She can maneuver around corners but the kids love to push her around.<br /><br />It also allows her to be under my feet in the kitchen quite safely as long as we are super careful.  It gives her more freedom than she would otherwise have if put inside a gate to keep her out of stuff.  But beware!  The baby grip seems to be extended in this thing.  She can get to wall outlets and other things she ordinarily wouldn't be able to get to. In the video she is pointing at a wall outlet that is covered with a plug cover in the hall way.
B000JVXZF2|5|I bought this mini-high chair for my 6 month old and it works really well.  I like that it has an adjustable height and it is easy to assemble out of the box.  It folds almost flat for travel which is great when traveling with 2 kids and space is limited!  It attaches securely to every chair I've tried so I say it's a winner, especially since it was so inexpensive!
B004RBC3QM|4|If you are a new mom and want to keep baby close but maintain your mobility in the house or while shopping, this is a tool for you.  Just be sure to try one out if you are short-waisted or short-statured, as it may not work quite as well for you.
B002AWROL4|5|Perfect fit for my older style bassinet.
B006V84KQU|4|Pretty happy with this set.  Son likes it, that's all that matters.  At first it was hard to twist and lock...but it got easier over time!  Fits great in his car seat cup holder!  Win-win!
B003CJFED4|4|this is quite a bit smaller than I had hoped it would have been. The application was not easy as some letters didn't peel off so that they needed to be stuck on after.
B002UD660S|5|I'm so glad I bought these to put on top of my changing table. They are soft, clean well in the washing machine, provide full coverage on my Stokke changing table (which is a funny shape), and make me not worry about the consequences of major diaper explosions.
B0011URFRE|5|This is our fourth seat - two in each car for our 2 and 4 year old.  The construction is sound, the kids are comfortable, there are cubbies which allow you to tuck toys into each arm area and a cup holder.  It's just a good, solid seat.
B00A5B319Q|5|We. Love. This. Stroller.<br />I did a TON of research when it came to buying this stroller for my 2 year old son and newborn. Here are some of the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros: my two-year-old (90th percentile for height) can hang his legs down, not straight out like other strollers<br />the sunshades are separate so I can completely cover the baby while the toddler can look around<br />the reclining seats are also separate so the baby can sleep without having to recline the toddler as well<br />large basket under<br />hand brake<br />easy to use foot break<br />easy to fold/unfold<br /><br />Cons: no parent console (we bought a velcro console at BuyBuyBaby, but it comes undone often)<br />seats are reclined a little even when the seat is adjusted fully forward (it seems this is common with jogging strollers)<br />have to purchase child tray and belly bar separately<br />when the belly bar and child's tray is in use, it is in the line of vision for my toddler (because of the recline of the seat)<br />heavy (about 50lbs)<br /><br />For us, the pros outweigh the cons. We primarily use this stroller for family outings, but do use it for jogging occasionally.
B00AM5NTIS|5|I purchased this product to give to my 4 and 1 year old, after wanting something more substantial than the applesauce pouches we had been getting.  I've used these for pudding, smoothies, milkshakes, etc.  They are easy to fill and seal tightly.  I use a funnel to fill mine, or sometimes just a spoon.  The kids like the product and have had no problems using it.  I like that they have a larger capacity than the disposable ones at the store and can be frozen.  Cleaning is easy - I've just rinsed mine with hot water and turned them upside down to dry.<br />Overall, a great product!  I did my research before buying these and feel they are the best design out there.  Highly recommended, from one mom to another!
B00FWUTADG|5|We found one of these for my daughter at a craft festival and she instantly fell in love with it (at 3 months old).  She has it with her all the time and so we knew we needed a back up.  She loves to snuggle it, and I love that her paci never gets lost!
B002KCNEDG|5|These cups have entertained both of my kids. I got this as a second set so they could take them outside and play in water / sand / pool.  They are small and easy to transport as well.
B00881ECVG|5|I love this lamp! I've had it for over a year now, use it every night. it's really cute.
B00CYB3TD8|3|I have a seven year old daughter that I purchased the original Bella butterfly by Slumber Buddies.  It was fantastic.  It sounded better, not to bright, the volume was on the inside where parents would get to it instead of on a big button on the outside like the new one.  Everything about it was just better.  It also had better sounds (ocean waves, etc.) that were nice and soft and not tinny and bad on the ears.  This Summer Buddy item is fine if you are just going to use the night light option, but if you are going to also use it to soothe children to sleep, this is not the one to get.
B009YY4PBI|5|Adorable.
B008QPUYIE|5|100 bucks at Walmart , plug in is nice to have , excellent swing .
B004FN119C|2|Love the feel but for the price I felt they were too thin.
B005OOXRFW|1|Poor quality.  Wrong color.  I wanted and ordered pink.  Received blue.
B003WKW6J8|1|EDIT 11/2014:<br /><br />We purchased 3 of these around Dec 2013, and by Nov 2014 they are all dead.  The problem is that these are not durable at all.  One drop and they are dead.  If you give this to your child, don't expect it to last being put down \\"too hard\\".<br /><br />I disassembled on that was dead, and the quality of workmanship was horrible.  The solder holding the LEDs was rusting and cracked, and the circuit board was hastily assembled.  For something that is essentially solid-state, with almost no moving parts (except the power switch), this thing should have lasted for decades.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY.  Especially not at the inflated third-party seller price of $50!!!<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />I like these little lights, they work fine so far.<br /><br />However, they absolutely EAT batteries.  As a result of these lights, we've had to practically take stock in rechargeable batteries.  We use the [[ASIN:B004RP2VNI Sanyo eneloop Rechargeable Batteries]], and we bought extra AA batteries so we don't run out.  We leave ours on all night for a night light in the nursery, and they last at most 2 days.<br /><br />I've never seen an LED based light eat through batteries so fast.  You've been warned!<br /><br />However, all 3 of our lights have worked for the past 4 months just fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the battery cover requires a jewelers screwdriver to open.  I know this is to keep kids safe, but it's kind of a hassle.<br /><br />EDIT:  These have still be going strong with no problems.  They are about 8 months old, and all three we bought are fine.
B00N4ODINK|5|It was great and arrived pretty fast!
B000MOKPTK|4|I got this for my grandson because the arms are just not what they used to be. I can carry him for quite a while and I don't have to worry that my arms will give out. He enjoys being with me while I do things around the house. I had one with his sister and they are just so handy. With both of them, when they saw me coming towards them with it, their little faces would light up because they knew they were be close to Granny!
B009CMTBDO|5|I'm 30 weeks along and, for whatever reason, I rarely feel my baby kick. Because I lost a twin at 12 weeks, I've become a nervous wreck from the lack of movement and have probably been driving my OB nuts with the constant paranoid visits to check in on the heartbeat. Finally, I just decided to buy my OWN doppler and save myself the frequent trips to my doctor. Best decision ever!<br /><br />When the AngelSounds doppler arrived in the mail, I was a little concerned with first impressions. It's a very simple, no-frills unit. Lightweight plastic device, battery, headphones, extra cord for recording, done. But to my amazement, this thing works like a charm and I have absolutely zero complaints. As it turns out, I have an extremely active baby in there - I just can't *feel* a lot of her movement. With the device, I simply wet my stomach with water or slop on some lotion (no need to buy special doppler oil) for best results. Her heartbeat has always been easy to find - you can usually hear it faintly while you search around, then suddenly it'll hit you loud and clear when you reach the sweet spot. It's AWESOME to hear her kicking around like a little ninja and SO sweet when I can hear her little hiccups. My husband also loves this thing - I think it's made everything more \\"real\\" to him now that he can hear his baby.<br /><br />The peace of mind this little device brings is INVALUABLE. I'm able to go about my days with no worries now, as opposed to having panic attacks thinking that something terrible must have happened to the baby. If you're having troubles sleeping at night because of lack of movement, I can't recommend this doppler enough.
B002ZF33SO|4|This looks like it will be a great comforter. My son is a big fan of the Avengers, and especially Captain America, right now. And he needed a new comforter. So I purchased this - even though it was a bit more than I wanted to spend. I'm excited to give it to him for Christmas - although I wish it didn't come with the item information printed on the outside of the box because my son is very observant and asked me when he saw the package on the front step \\"Who's that Superhero Squad blanket for?\\" Oh well... Who needs to be surprised for Christmas anyway?
B000IDSLOG|3|I had high hopes for this highly praised teether.  Baby loves to chew on it, but only for short amounts of time.  It's the taste of rubber that baby finds unappealing.  I have washed the toy in warm soapy water several times and still cannot get rid of the rubbery taste.  My son will chew on it, then gets a look of disgust across his face, chew on it more, drools, more looks of disgust, then eventually drops it.  I put it in my mouth to see what all the weird looks are about and sure enough it has a weird rubbery taste no matter how many times I wash it.  After my baby is done chewing on it, I go to give him a kiss and his mouth and cheeks smell \\"rubbery\\".  I also have to watch him closely because the giraffe legs can easily gag baby, but that's his favorite part to chew on, of course.  Other than those two gripes it's a good teether.  It's soft, good size, cute, and my son is attracted to it.  Just wish I could make it not smell/taste so bad!
B0009PAN7Q|5|This was actually my second purchase of this seat.  This one is for Grandma's house.  We also have a BabyBjorn potty chair.  My daughter uses both, but she's getting to the point where she's a little big for the potty chair and likes to use the \\"big\\" potty but is still to small for it.  So this seat works perfect.  It's easy to lift on and off and it fits her behind just fine (she's on the small side).  She can easly lift it on and off herself and move it around the house when she wants.  A little pricy, but recommended.
B0026IAY3W|3|good quality, sturdy, washes well, but definitely not plush, thick or soft, which is what I was hoping for. Very thin. But it does look exactly as pictured, so as long as you're aware of these other aspects, you won't be disappointed.
B000BNQC58|5|I can see why people complain about the low light of several of the colors and do not disagree. However, when displayed in a dark room on the green setting my nephew (and we) absolutely love it. It creates the coolest galaxy effect around the ceiling and walls. I find it very calming and soothing and fortunately so does the kid!<br /><br />I do not see how people would use this for an educational toy. Perhaps you just have to have a room with the right dimensions to actually make out the constellations but we haven't really seen them very clearly yet. Fun toy though.
B001PEXRC8|5|Fits the crib mattress with a little room. Just what I needed to store mattress under under a bed until we need it.
B000056OWC|1|I received this tub as a shower gift. I had registered for it since it was highly rated in Baby Bargins 4th ed. Although my son was a big newborn, he kept sliding down the tub. I had to really hold him well to wash him. When I would remove him, his feet would scrape the bar. I ended up bathing him in the kitchen sink. Later, I converted the tub to the upright bath seat position. That was pretty hard to do. When I would sit my son in the tub, it was fine. Upon removal, his legs and feet would get caught under the bar. I wrote my comments on The First Years website. Someone emailed me back right away. They have a satisfaction policy. They sent me a postage paid label to return this tub to them. They sent me a different type of tub. My 19 month old is too large for it, but I'm expecting baby #2 in a couple of weeks. I anxious to try the new tub. Kudos to this company for wanting the customer to be satisfied.
B002EL4IQA|5|I first bought this mattress for my brother when his wife was pregnant. Then for my sister in law when she was pregnant. So when I get pregnant, there was no question as to which mattress I would get.
B0032G9E0G|5|Love boon products. I have received many complements on this drying rack. Really functional, and easily dries bottles and all their little parts.
B007C5J1Z6|5|These are not like some of the other chews we have had, they are softer, I placed one on a chain and made it a necklace, they come in very handy, saving my child's ( 10 yo with aspergers) clothes, bedding and other non edible items. The chews seem to calm as well as entertain my child, a must for outings and during school work.
B008HS7ADW|5|Bought this book for a friends grandson. So adorable and it happens to match the baby's room decorations and stroller and car seat covers. But looking inside there is a place for every special memory that a sweet baby will have on their journey as they grow up and become older and someday go back a see all the mementos and kind words their parents and grandparents had for them when they were first born.
B006PATBI6|3|If you are like me and hate leaving labels on things then do not but this product.  I bet you are thinking that you have tracks for getting labels off right?  Well the thing is that those tricks will remove the finish and scratch the top of this thing and you won't want to leave it out after.
B009KQCJ7C|5|Great product for curious kids!  Sturdy and looks better than those bulky/flimsy boxes.
B000MXL03G|5|This is the only sleep sack I will buy for my kids.  It's nice and thick, perfect for the cooler months. It's beautifully made and will last a long time, even after repeated washes.
B0039MIUXA|5|Wonderful sturdy stool.
B004L2JJAK|4|Works great on the outside seat that has a headrest, have to tweak things to get it to work in the middle without a headrest. Once they are in place I can see my boys well.
B004GJXM88|5|Disposable seat covers are great to have if you have small kids. They are also great b/c they stay in place and covers the whole toliet seat.
B00IN8OI4A|5|I know some previous reviewers have commented that it's very challenging to &#34;sip&#34; liquid out of these sippy-cups, which is true, but my son LOVES them. He was teething pretty bad when we introduced this sippy-cup (at around 5 months), so he naturally started chewing on the spout, which in turn, makes water come out. Now he's 7 months old and still loves these sippy-cups. He is much more efficient at drinking out of them now and understands how the spout works.
B0027SE43C|1|Received the item but it's used and the box was already open.  Plus, it's missing the DC to USB cable as cited in the item description. Just awful customer experience.
B009ZU3KGW|4|I had a really hard time trying to find a good booster car seat cover to travel with. I settled on this one for its value. The material is very thin but it held up very well during a recent trip where we had to check it with our luggage. Inside there is plenty of room for my daughter's booster with extra room to spare. There is also a flap in the back to attach with the suitcase. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00Q3A7T7I|5|I love this product. My daughter wears it everyday. It helps with her teething, any fever, sickness. Even my other half whom was VERY skeptical tells people how amazing this works!
B000BTLJL4|5|Great sleepsack!  Easy to secure your baby but still enough room for them to move their feet and kick.  Option to leave arms out or in is great!  Our twins now 9 lbs and 8 lbs fit perfectly and it is essential for us to use for bedtime. They are really warm as well so cotton pjs underneath is sufficient. We used fleece pjs and it was too warm with these sacks.
B005EHNL3M|4|We installed these on our daughter's bed last night.  It's a very nice product but I have 2 things to leave feedback for others.<br /><br />1.  The height is 20&#34;.  We just bought a new full mattress for our daughter, not a pillow top, and found this was not high enough.  The mattress may have been a little higher but the product would be best if it was 24&#34; high or adjustable.<br />2. Since the end points can't be moved you have to shift the placement of the product if you intend on installing them on both sides of the bed.  We were able to keep them in almost the same place but took a little work.<br /><br />Overall, even with a little coverage, this is better than nothing and feel it won't be an issue for our daughter.  It's a good product, very easy to assemble.
B006PB2B6O|5|We got this seat to be an auxiliary seat and for use with airline travel.  We didn't want to spend a lot.  When this seat arrived, I was amazed and impressed with the quality.  Our other convertible seats are Britax Boulevards, and since the price on those is so much more expensive, I expected that this seat might be visible cheap or flimsy.  I was surprised to find that it was not.<br /><br />What this seat certainly lacks compared to more expensive seats is ease of installation.  The LATCH clips work adequately but are old school metal clips--no fancy red buttons or easy to use latching mechanisms.  When installing through LATCH, this seat doesn't tighten separately on each side, rather, it has one strap that tightens the seat in.  That works fine and adjusts easily enough.  It installs very similarly to our Graco Nautilus, for anyone familiar with that seat.<br /><br />This seat was also great for use on an airplane because the base is narrow.  You can easily carry it down the aisle of an airplane, and it fits well within a plane seat.<br /><br />I feel secure with my toddler using this seat.  I still prefer the Britax for our everyday use, but if that isn't an option in someone's budget, I find that this seat is of worthwhile quality and is well worth the price tag.
B00849L3PK|3|Nice drink cup, but my 17 month old won't drink from the hard plastic spout. She likes her stainless cup with the straw better.
B004BHAIZU|3|We originally ordered this little guy in gray, but we ended up getting the brown one in the mail.  Oh well - our baby loved it anyway!  It was bigger than I thought it would be, but that ended up being somewhat nice, because it was easy for our baby to grab and hold on to.  She loves hearing the little music and smiles every time she sees her little owl.  My one complaint is that the velcro is pretty much useless after a couple of weeks.  We just tie the little owl onto the carseat or let our baby hold him, because the velcro doesn't work at all any more.
B003JFJ6I0|5|I am so pleased with the quality and the service received when I bought this item.  After researching the type of playpen I wanted I knew I couldn't get this in the UK so I spent more to have this one sent over from the US and it is worth every penny.  It fits perfectly in my living room at 1 metre squared and has so many items to keep a baby / toddler entertained.  The playpen was very easy to assemble and can be taken apart very easily too if needed.  The quality is excellent and the colours look so pretty.  In addition I could not believe the speed of delivery considering this was coming from another country.  Overall all a great item and great service.
B002ECE0P8|4|Bought this for my teething daughter.... She loves it, especially the key with the bumps on it. She will play with this toy and be content with it for a long time. Great item!
B002DN8HCK|3|This sippy cup is ALMOST perfect.  I was looking for a stainless sippy with a straw and handles.  My 16 month old loves this cup and drinks from it very easily.  However, the straw is NOT spill proof.  Very annoying especially if your child likes to drink in the car like mine.  If he throws it and it lands upside down it means spilled milk.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just make the straw spill proof like the dozens of other sippy cups with straws out there.  Obviously the technology exists!  To travel with this sippy, you have to remove the straw and replace it will a plug.  This means that there are two steps from traveling to drinking -- you have to exchange the plug for the straw, a messy proposition if you're in a moving car or on the go.  And don't think you can improvise by skipping the plug and just using the plastic cover.  There are holes in the cover!  It's like they designed it so it will have maximum ability to spill when traveling.  Hopefully they will fix this one flaw and then it will truly be the perfect sippy.
B000Q8TIEK|5|Got this stand for our UPPAbaby stroller bassinet...baby slept in this as his crib until he outgrew it at 3 months. Despite the negative reviews for the white version of this stand I went ahead and purchased it as the reviews for the other colors were much better...obviously that makes no sense! It was very easy to assemble...looks very smart and was a great fit with the bassinet. I didn't have any problems with the wood or plastic cracking/snapping. I found it to be sturdy and had no concerns about it falling apart. We never used it to rock the baby- so can't comment on that. A great product and very reasonably priced compared to the ridiculous cost of the UPPAbaby version...will be holding on to it for the next baby that comes along.
B002VBXY6I|5|This toy has saved the day on long car trips.  My son adored this thing at the age of 4 months, when we got it.  He's seven months old now, and this is still his favorite car toy.  The octopus's face is so friendly that he can stare and talk to it for an unbelievably long time.  He loves to grip the legs and rings, and the music is a never-fail way to stop tears and bring a smile to his face.   This is a really great toy.
B00FK599DE|1|Grows mold In the tiny spaces! Disgusting! Do not buy this!!
B0049SP0C2|3|Actually my baby dosn't play with it at all. I guess it's too heavy for him... He is 5 months, 68 cm and 8 kg for now. Maybe when he'll grow a little and become stronger it would be ok.
B002FT3L4G|4|these certainly do protect the bottle and are easy to put on.  the extra thick rubber is nice, however, there is a gap between the glass and rubber that allows hot water in so you need to drain it before feeding baby to avoid burning you, or baby, IF you heat your bottles in boiling water.  once aware of this and tipping bottle over to be sure hot water is drained, they work well.  I do prefer the snug fit of siliskins for my evenflow glass bottles.
B001HX4D4S|5|We got this item as a replacement for the Swan bouncer chair. Our son absolutely loved it, and we used it until he grew out of it. He would sleep in it, we would bounce him in it, and it is so easy to carry. The design is nice and sleek, especially if you are looking not to litter your living room with ugly plastic Fisher-Price type items. We are extremely happy with this bouncer.
B00CLAZLN8|5|The quality of this blanket is wonderful. Lifetime warranty says everything else that needs to be said. Just get it.
B00OBMK07Q|5|My 6 months old twins had no problem using them as their learner cups.  It was great that one boy and one girl pattern combination was available (as the twins are one girl and one boy).  The spout doesn't leak, and yet, it was easy for the babies to such liquid out from the nipple.  No problem with cleaning and pretty easy to disassemble.  I am very glad with the purchase.
B006N1KKGO|5|So well made, and so happy to find it here.  the big name baby store is selling this for double the price!
B000EJ9RII|5|I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 4 months old and it quickly became her favorite toy. And now at 3 years old it is her constant companion. It is easy to grasp, safe to chew on, and very snuggly. It is very soft and pretty. I have purchased several of these to give as shower presents as well as \\"replacement\\" ones in case the original one gets lost or left behind somewhere. When I had my son last year I got one for him too!!
B006PB2BK0|2|Does not fit all cars. Jeep Grand Cherokee was okay but it does not fit in our Subaru Outback. Moves way too much. My husband is very strong and is 230lbs and could not get the latches to tighten enough. Even the tether would not adjust so it could be tight enough. Unfortunately, I have had this seat for too long and cannot return it. I now have to buy a new one for my 4 year old who will only be in a seat for another year or so. looking into Britax.
B005G3FOMU|4|The bear is so cute and the music is nice but I wish the bear spun more or at all<br />because we had to hang the music portion upside down just to get the bear to spin
B00YG4DWRO|5|This monitor is perfect if you want one camera to broadcast to a dedicated monitor, but also have the ability to watch either on the go or out of range via your phone. We had some issues setting up the Internet portion, but customer service was friendly and helpful. The picture quality is much better than some of the other monitors we tested, but it isn't quite the best we saw either. The app is simple and easy to use (once you find the right app - there are a couple doppelgänger apps in the iTunes Store).
B003XQ1H64|5|After carefully researching other harness boosters, I am very satisfied with the Frontier 85.  My son is outgrowing his Marathon, mainly because of the crotch strap position.  The adjustments the Frontier provides for this make pinching and searching for the buckle a non-issue.  It's not difficult to install, but be prepared to spend some time doing it (~1/2 hour).  Wouldn't recommend using this seat to share between vehicles.  We have this installed in a Vibe and there is NO movement using the LATCH and versa tether.  My son loves the cupholders and adjusting the harness buckles is very simple (however, you must uninstall the seat first).  My only complaint is minor.  After having a wetting incident, removing the cover for washing took some time and you actually have to unscrew the head rest. again, the seat had to be uninstalled).  Bought a 'piddle pad' to hopefully prevent having to go through that process again.  The quality of the fabric is wonderful and it looks great.  Glad to have such a protective seat for my child.
B000S8O9ME|1|Amazon really needs a 'Zero Star' rating for a product that is this dangerous.<br />We made certain that the ceramic tile in the shower was immaculately clean (without a speck of oil) before mounting the shower handles.  We were very impressed when tested in dry shower.  Wow - reasonably priced and works as advertised.  As soon as we turned the shower on and tested the handle it loosened and came free from the wall at one end.<br />We waited for the shower to completely dry and remounted the handles.  Again worked well on dry surface but once wet the handles wiggled and then came away from the wall.<br />Don't waste your money.
B007QFMS8O|5|The Infant pillow is the right size and soft. It is prefect. Our new baby will  love it. He is due 03-21-2014.
