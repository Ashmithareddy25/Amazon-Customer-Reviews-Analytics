B000XQ9MGE|2|That makes it a little dangerous when connecting to a car battery, as a spark could ignite any stray gas.  Other jump starters are connected while &#34;off&#34; which is much safer, and I recommend those instead.  (Also worth getting one with a tire inflator.).<br /><br />As for the actual unit I used it on my hybrid & it worked just fine.  Of course my engine is only 1 liter and 3 cylinders, so not a heavy load to turn over.  I've not seen any problems with longevity, though I do charge it full every 3-4 months.  (Good practice for all lead-acid batteries.)
B00OPBDYNU|1|After installing; test drove the car at night, lights were pointed down and we're not safe for night driving. When I tried to adjust none of the adjuster screws worked. None out of 4.
B009DJJIH0|5|Thank you
B004FFLLL8|4|looks good on my car.
B004N6YRDS|4|graet
B00KD0SM6G|5|delivered as advetised
B00VAVT5U4|5|great deal. ive had these for a little while now and they work perfect. I run em like and idiot and on unbelievably rough terrain. I work building well pads and my drive to and from the jobsite is more off-roading in a week then most people do all year. if your looking then take it from me. worth it.
B004MG8RPS|5|Fit my 2008 Tunda perfectly.  Local dealer wanted $225 plus labor.  Don't get ripped off by these dealers.
B00BTLAC66|5|The outside radius is noticably larger than the OEM that was removed, you wouldn't notice unless you know what you are looking for.  This includes the upper center rounds for it fitting to the actual bumper, was about an 1/8&#34; off of the radius.  Not an issue for me, and the untrained eye wouldn't notice it.  Came well packaged and on time.  Has a grayish/black tone for the plastic.  Didnt matter to me since I sprayed it with black plasti-dip.  Did not come with fasteners, but I knew this and had ordered a box of them when I placed the order.  Intallation was fairly straight foward, and took about an hour.  Biggest issue was getting my fat hands up in there to pry the old fasteners out.  If you have the fog lights, remove the two upper bolts, and you wont have to re-aim them when re-attaching them.  Would do business with CarPartsDepot again if needed.
B00OTX3C9A|5|Very well made.  It's understated, yet elegant.  I think fondly of my loving departed everytime I see this cover, and it makes me smile.
B00RVE1HBE|5|I love it! Make my car look sexy.
B003TTL0TE|5|Excellent quality!  I love it.
B000UOBIZC|5|I bought this whole Tri-Lynx system and I love it. Well made and sturdy. You can buy and feel good about your purchase.
B004IYQV5C|5|OE quality with a excellent aftermarket heat shield. Perfect fit and nice quality. 97 f150 4.2l.
B00A80EVXO|4|Perfect to stick on cat when son is learning to drive. A little bigger might be better. Perhaps with flashing lights LOL
B00302IZA2|5|Perfect fit
B000GU11DY|1|WARNING- can NOT return after purchasing. Make sure you have the exact fit. Also it does NOT come with battery acid included!!!!
B009D4RSK4|5|Looks great and fits perfectly my 2015 Genesis Coupe.
B00BT96ZT6|5|What a great price for 10 NGK sparkplugs.<br />Jim A.
B00FOXCI76|3|Quality is decent for the price. No directions included but it pretty self explanatory.
B001EOV3RK|5|Perfect fit for 2015 RAM 2500 4X4 with towing package!!
B0083G3AXC|4|good
B00XULVDHK|5|Works great to keep the sun out of babies eyes in the car.
B00J4T7AUQ|5|excellent cleaner
B002801NI8|1|The key requires a 13/16 or a 18mm socket. The lug nuts on my truck require a 7/8ths socket... so, if I use these lock nuts, i have to get a new lug wrench... awesome.
B0016LG0CY|5|works great ...used it for easy power hook up for cb radio ..great product
B00CEXK9TS|5|These went on easily and look great!
B0054HV0D0|5|The product complete all my expectations... some Hinges will not fit with the old holes and thats because<br />ir you change the doors panels and you didn´t change the old hinges... remember that the old hinges have<br />some wear in the pin area. But this hinges are just what I was looking for. Thanks guys.
B009D41M9C|4|As advertised. Unfortunately people like to steel these
B00AM1SB2G|5|These visors worked perfectly.  The safe ventilation makes such a big difference dealing with the Summer heat.
B006GLA8TA|5|I absolutely love these easy to put on I didn't need any help, a great purchase!
B0035R0TEC|1|I don't know if it is the design or what but it failed on me when I was driving over a bridge in afternoon commute traffic. It was cracked and leaking fuel only after about 500 miles driven.  I had changed fuel filters on three different trucks ( 2 company trucks and my personal truck ) with no problems these were harder to get the threads going as others have stated. I will not buy this one again, stay with the metal ones.
B003ELWA9G|5|Easy to install, godd instructions. Looks as good as when new!!
B00O2FDSNU|1|Arrived missing parts that fell off due to cheap design/construction.
B00FC22PVS|4|Having issues with one bulb flickering and one of the ballast has a buzzing noise but the kit is great!
B00AB2PBU6|5|fit is real good/ no slipping.  Very happy.
B004UQR1UM|5|Works great and doesn't have any metal.
B00R5778OW|5|Product is exactly as advertized. Great deal. I was pleased with this product.
B00P710W4G|5|Bought for a recent VW golf and took me back to the early 90's as it is a very similar cloth as they used to make the seats with. Reminded me of an old '87 quantum and '92 passat I used to own. Now the fabric is very cheap.<br />These covers feel very thick and soft. Very well made. Installation is mildly tricky, as you have to choose very carefully the anchor points, otherwise the covers will be loose.<br />Haven't owned them long enough to tell about the UV resistance.
B00TV20F80|5|perfect fit echo 225 did run bad new RB/K93 Zama Carburetor runs better then new BUY IT.
B00ATT2W7Q|5|Came quick and performs exactly as expected. Includes everything needed for an easy DIY installation. Finished product looks and works great.
B0006SU3QW|3|Used this to coat some dumbbells, and it worked well for the ends, but not so much for the handle area.  The plus side is that it does peel off easily when you want it to.
B00NID5IG2|5|Just got my first pair of the Tourmaster Response riding boots, and all I can say after a long, hot day of riding my sportbike is ...nice!  They are super comfortable, and light!. It was in the mid 90's today, but my feet were nowhere near as hot as I was in a jacket, or my hands in were inside my gloves. I was concerned that they might be too stiff to feel the shifter, but that wasn't the case at all.  An A+ from me. I will very likely buy a second pair right away, cuz every time I find something I really like... it gets discontinued.
B00C8YXGB6|1|My first rating of this product was 5 star.  I bought 1 set in March and another in April.  Worked great.  Fast forward to the end of July when I needed to use one--less than 4 months.  Dead...all three in the set.  I get home and check the other set.  Dead...all three in the set.  What the heck.  Then I figured it out.  The switch is not mechanical.  A circuit monitors the momentary switch and turns on the 3 white leds, then the double-blink, then double-pulse, etc.  In short, the batteries are under a constant drain, albeit small.<br /><br />Wagan needs to be up front/honest about this. They should recommend that the customer not remove the battery tab until the product is needed.  But even that would be problematic in that two screws have to be removed and even then the case is so tightly sealed that it is impossible to get apart without prying it apart with a very thin screwdriver or knife blade.<br /><br />When you need these, you need these.  You don't need a dead light or a light that takes tools to get apart to activate and then not even within a reasonable time.  It will most likely be dark, wet, and cold when you try.<br /><br />I just love this warning from the User's Guide: &#34;All  batteries discharge over time.  Replace batteries every 6 months&#34;  Yes, batteries do self-discharge over time, but fresh batteries will last over a year on the shelf.  The discharge on these batteries is from the light, not aging/shelf life. And you don't even get 6 months.<br /><br />These are safety items meant for use in an emergency.  Fix this product, put out truthful warnings, or pull the product.  Otherwise, shame on you Wagan.
B007KPVLEW|5|worked and look great.
B000FQ25Y8|5|Arrives before time. Fits perfectly.
B00Q3CQARG|5|I love the color, design, fit, and feel of these covers.  They fit my 2000 Ford Explorer's high-back bucket seats perfectly.  They've only been installed for about a month, so I don't know how well they'll wear just yet, but they seem fairly well made.  The only down side to these covers is that they come with elastic loops and metal hooks instead of proper tie downs (straps with buckles or Velcro straps).  I also could have used some form of instructions since I had never installed seat covers before, but I found instructions on YouTube that helped.  All the instructions I found called for the buckles or Velco, so I'm still not sure what to do with the metal hooks.  I just tied the elastic loops to each other using some black ribbon to make them reach and create a snug fit.  So far, so good.  They look and feel great.
B002OEVNBK|5|Amazing shine
B000N9LVH4|5|Good mats strong looking.
B00BQYCJN0|5|excellent in expensive and arrived quickly
B000B8N3MS|4|Twisted right on.  Had to drill a hole in the top to attach the tether, there than that it worked great.
B0014UQKDG|5|Had our local garage mechanic install the two lift supports and they are working like a charm. It is easy enough to do by one's self, but I didn't have the time. I removed the original ones earlier.
B004MW27A8|5|Great product and great supplier
B00FDQPCR2|5|This thing is bright. Simple as that. I can blind the neighbors that are like 300+ feet away. Love this light!
B000E8OTZ0|5|Very firm which is good as the Supra is a sports car.
B005OVK3H0|1|One star is too much. I received this item and had it placed on my car.... 5 months later I am replacing the same part!!! A refund would be greatly appreciated!!
B0062ZGYNE|5|everything transpired according to plan
B0009IQXJ0|5|works great, highly recommended
B0011V4V2U|5|Good pads.  Definite improvement over stock.
B00RV83UUG|5|Bright as heck!
B007MNUAVW|5|Hasn't given problems yet, it's still in good shape.
B009VYWIMO|5|Works great, had one before for 4 years and only the monitor went out and was the reason for replacement. I travel red dirt gravel roads almost daily and the transmitter has held up great.
B00DQO6IX0|5|Though the estimated installation time of 15 minutes (possible perhaps if you hve access to a lift) was overly optimistic this item can be installed in a relatively short period of time by anyone with moderate basic skills and patients. My first one lasted ( yes I'm on number two) about three years when one day I had power into the Controller but not out to the plug. Anyway, the plug-and-play aspect of this product is great and the addition of the power feed wire did not complicate things that much. Overall very satisfied. For the record I am not a mechanic. Bill W.
B002YKEZ5U|5|The bit is exactly what my technicians were looking for.  The bit is small and able to handle heavy loads.
B00W5MG8XY|5|👍
B00JXYER4Y|5|Quick delivery and great prices
B002OWCLNQ|5|As expected, great product.
B0014BYKVO|5|husband uses it as his mobile office.  He loves it!
B002UC8LXE|5|Great fit better than old one arrived on time
B00F6AR7V4|2|A video showed this tool working on 08 GM hinge pins. The opening at the top of this tool is to narrow to work on the new style hinges.
B000E3BXDG|4|I have a stiff riding truck and these shocks softened the ride. It's no caddy but it is smother.
B0096GKU40|5|Excellent mat for the 2010 Crew Max Tundra, OEM and fits perfect. The non-slip surface really holds objects well and prevents slipping when driving around. Cleans up really easily, and allows water to run right underneath when washing the vehicle.
B002R61K04|3|Got the oil pan assembled on the new motor...low and behold, the pan leaked through one of the weld seams. Canton was willing to take it back, but it was such a hassle I just had the pan welded locally. Check the pans before you install them...we all know pulling an oil pan off an assembled, installed motor is no fun.
B00IDHJZXU|1|Most frustrating experience... Very little worked as advertised.. Voice control may give you anything at any time..<br />Will not stay in any mode for any length of time.. The equipment did seem to be of quality construction. I sincerely hope I received a defective unit. I am thankful for the quick return to Amazon and credit for my purchase.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Great Fit good quality cloth. Thank You.&#34; I like the fact that it is cloth,and it fits the entire window of my F250 truck.<br />I have purchased many of the foil covered air bubble packaging, and they do not last.
B0018YD2S4|5|Great product and easy to install.
B003OSIHXW|1|Safety hazard! The rubber part of the wiper (driver side) started to detach itself in the rain on the interstate. I've only had these for a few months and have never had this happen with even the cheapest blades I've purchased. Super scary.
B00MG687JW|2|I am in fact, going to try to return it.  Now that I needed it and actually looked at the direction, i see that they are incomprehensibly written and the product is so complicated and has so many parts, that I could never wade my way through it.  I'm going back to buying one of the big old ones, where if i keep it charged, it can quickly be attached to the car and I'm done.<br />Even the fact that the Chinese one specifies Diesel is not clear as to whether it is in addition to regualr cars, or specially for diesel.  I don't dare to even attempt to use it !!!  Should have returned it right away, but was away and didn't get to it for a long time.<br />NOTE that Chinese products are generally a piece of garbage in any case, and if I'd noticed its source, I'd never have ordered it.  Every Chinese product I've ever bought has been defective, or broke down very quickly.
B00UEOLXEY|5|Very nice lights for a great price!
B000C6ZRDW|5|Great product.  On my jeep for a couple of weeks now and works great.  Packaged professionally and didn't feel or seem cheap like some parts you may get from Autozone.
B003Y9A0OK|5|If you buy Chemical Guys products, you won't be disappointed.  Another fantastic product, that gets the job done.
B00C5RJ4D0|5|Ordered for my husband.  Item is as described and was delivered on time  He loved it.  Would definitely recommend.
B008JP9P5O|5|GOOD BRAND FOR REPLACEMENT
B00BF2V8ZS|5|Works good
B00076QA4C|5|keep my groceries where I can reach them after a trip home from the grocery store
B00AAH2S26|5|Also works very well!
B000V9ATEW|5|They are of good quality and stabilized our camper well
B001ELSS30|5|It's a very firm mount, it fit great &  straight forward install. I suggest some medium strength loc-tite on the 3 mount to block fasteners. My 4.3L has headers, a comp cam and a few other goodies, so its got a few more pony's than a stock engine, I was breaking OE and mid-grade aftermarket left side mounts in about a month.It almost feels like a solid mount which is ok with me as long it holds up. Its well made and I'm happy with it so far. I only did the drivers side. Update:11/12/15 seems as if the mount softened up a little. Holding up great. Very happy with purchase.
B00J6C76UK|5|Perfect! Stays secure and does not move. High enough so that my daughter can't kick it. Great product!
B00R328BQS|5|Very nice keychain..... Heavy duty and nicely made.
B00RLGU7TK|5|All the bulbs you will need for your interior. Not super bright but looks super luxurious.
B0016LG0CY|5|WORKS
B004TG3R6U|4|The mounting holes were about 1/16&#34; off each, making the last screw hard to get started, but they worked on my Coleman 7632B & 7633B units. Considering it was the lowest price of the choices I had, I'm pleased, & the quality of the material seems durable. The two I ordered were shipped seperately, but both arrived early.
B000NWBBGC|5|as usual AC Delco quality is outstanding, I always buy this brand for my 05 equinox
B009ITAAG8|1|In a word, terrible.  Standard Group 27 Dodge truck battery, these would NOT tighten sufficiently to make positive contact.  Also, the set screws are at a &#34;point&#34; which also does not make full contact with the raw cable as it only contacts a portion of the wiring. I even attempted to use the lead shims you can purchase here, but these are not &#34;soft&#34; enough to expand to accommodate the shims.  Tapping them gently on the terminals only strips the shim completely off the post.  They are a good idea, as I have two cables on the positive terminal and was planning on using the small hold to run my new subwoofer cable to.  Again, good idea, but poor engineering.  Battery terminals are tapered...these are NOT.  Waste of money.
B003GC96U4|5|Works great!
B00236K7RA|2|These goggles would be great if they didn't cut into my nose, the padding is inferior.
B00Z2LY9DG|5|This fits in my car so well! There were no problems getting it to fit my shift rod at all, and it actually made it easier to shift! It makes my car!!
B002H9CMCQ|5|Great product to control rust for us who do it our self. It works...
B00KJB1Z1S|5|Super fast delivery and excellent product!
B000ET8D0G|5|AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!
B002MB4L0A|5|Great cover!! Fits like a glove on my 550i very please with the guality. Easy to put on and take off.
B00684TAYY|5|Great product, super fast shipment!!!!
B002PL59RG|2|It was sloppy even with a new cable...
B00KTI9XIS|5|Works as well as orig one easy setup
B003SYX070|4|I bought two of these as indicator lights one has already failed but the one that works,  works well
B000ZMWZ88|5|as listed
B00KY41U42|5|Perfect fit for our new Kia Soul.  I am using it every day and it works good and looks great.
B0088USCPO|4|This product kept my 96 Infiniti i30 running, but there is still issues with idle and acceleration.  Although this could be another issue with a separate component, the issue didn't surface until after the replacement
B007E8RBH6|4|I like, and always have used K&N filters.If I ever drowned out my Outlander L 500 again I won't have to get a new filter. As far as performance. I did not notice much of a difference. .
B00IRONOKY|5|I Gotta say it's not the best helmet  in the world but for the money you cannot beat it music and flip down shades are pretty cool
B00OQEHZ9A|5|Came intact
B000C2QSKM|5|It is so nice to have cool air in my car while it is so hot outside.  I compressor arrived new as stated plus my mechanic verified it was new. I saved over $400 by buying this product on line.
B000A835AY|2|Works pretty well but leaves a residue on my car's interior. Probably won't continue using this.
B0041DZQW4|5|Perfect fit just bought the wrong color, that's my bad for not reading it properly, comes in a OEM box and it's the real deal, color looks off but it's better now that I have my DDin head unit it it
B0097SDVBG|5|Just what the doctor ordered ........ 40 wt is hard to find in my area and just what my hot rod needs.
B00KMUE5U4|5|Despite the fitment warning, these are direct replacement pads for our 10' Grand Caravan SXT.  As described and arrived undamaged via USPS.  Does not include new slide clips so you will have purchase separately for around 10 bucks at your local parts store.  Paired with a set of Centric Cryostop rotors.  Hopefully this will fix the typical Dodge death wobble caused by warped rotors. Will consider for future purchases.
B0093PHSDA|5|This stuff really seems to work. As long as I don't let the bugs stay there for more than a week they come off pretty eary.
B00B32DBNM|3|This was my third installation of an Air Lift product (air bags) and the second one which was a complete bear.  This one - product # 88138 - was not only recommended by Amazon, but also by Air Bag tech support. After installing it however, I wonder if any of the two were correct.  Here is why:<br /><br />I have a step van made by Utilimaster (FedEx type), built on a Ford E-350 Econoline chassis, and this is where your troubles will start.  In order to pin down the exact correct air-bags, I researched multiple web-sites, ahead of ordering, with hopes to make sure that what I'm ordering fits.  For a regular Econoline all this may not be necessary, but it's good to be aware nonetheless.  I was told these types of vans sit on a regular one-ton E-350 van chassis, and that is how I ordered the parts.  Amazon's usually good info even claimed:  &#34;This fits your Ford Econoline E-350 van.&#34;  So did the guy at Air Lift.<br /><br />Only after the fact, but after receiving the parts, did I conduct a search according to the VIN.  And finally I got the proper result.  My van is built on an E-350 superduty chassis, which is somewhat different from others, AND is not listed under van options with Amazon (only superduty TRUCKS are listed).  Now, for the rest of you hopefuls, get ready to abandon any idea of installing this in the &#34;2 HOURS&#34; so many others boasted about.  Here is why:<br /><br />Don't even think about 'pre-assmbling' this stuff, because if you have a van with similar physical attributes like mine, you WILL be assembling ALL parts, right up to the 90º air valve, UNDER your vehicle.  In ideal conditions the assembled parts will slip 'right in' between the axle and the frame, but we don't live in an ideal world, we have to deal with Ford and the geniuses at Air Lift.  In my photo you will see, that the upper part to which the airbag is connected, must slip UNDER a sort of sub-frame, bolted to the chassis in question. That can simply not be done when the parts have been preassembled, because the parts (#07463 & #07464)need to be slipped into position at a slight angle, and by the time the long vertical bolt, sticking out of the airbag lines up with the hole in the frame, the outside upper edge is too far out from the frame already mentioned.<br /><br />So off you go, trying to figure out how to do it otherwise.  If you have a frame like mine, you'll be doing some interesting drilling.  Eventually, with 101º of desert pleasantness and hoards of ants 'loving you', you get a little tired of this challenge.  And you'll find, that these guys at Air Lift are just a bit less genius than you wish.  The lower part of the assembly - the one that 'fits' onto the axle, part # 03982 - requires that one remove the Axle Vent Tube Bolt arrangement, a sort of junction where various brake parts come together (see corresponding photo of Fig. 18).  No, you can't loosen the part and 'twist' it to make the lower bracket fit into place, not on my rig.  I completely removed the and re-attachet the Vent Tube Bolt only, since solid metal brake-lines have a way of not cooperating with bending or twisting.  That made me think:  Couldn't these guys just cut out another notch to make the lower bracket fit AROUND this bolt arrangement?<br /><br />One last stroke of genius I noticed, is how the air line from my passenger side airbag has been forgotten to be addressed adequately. There is every imaginable detail paid to how one must arrange the valves to a vehicles frame and where to run lines to keep from getting abraded, not to ever kink or bend the lines too tightly.  In fact, there is even a comment in the instructions NOT TO run such lines within 6 INCHES of a hot surface (I imagine the exhaust pipe qualifies for that), but no attention has been given to the fact that where the air line enters the bag, IS closer than six inches to the tailpipe (see photo).  There is also no mention that a piece of rubbery hose could be intended to cover the airline in that crucial area (after you've inserted the line into the airbag it's a little late).<br /><br />Yeah, the whole thing CAN be done by an amateur.  Do it on a cool day, and if you can, do it in a place where you have a lift and can stand up under the vehicle (my belly muscles are still tight from all that back and forth under the van).  And have a buddy help, that would speed things up a bit too.  Product quality &#34;installed&#34; probably deserves five stars, but the hassles and missing information on certain parts does not.  I took the van out for a spin at 30 lb. pressure (I have front bags too) and it handled very improved, so no regrets there.  Now I'm ready to sell the dang thing.  Sorry, photos won't load,  I'll try later.line in that crucial area (after you've inserted the line into the airbag it's a little late).<br /><br />Yeah, the whole thing CAN be done by an amateur.

B0049DSVGY|5|Delivered on time as expected.  On a Sunday at that.  10 minutes installed.  Lights work.  Easy fix.
B000IDYKQO|5|I don't have spare panes of window glass around to test all the features. But the ones I could test worked great.<br />Nice and compact and not too heavy for the key chain
B006ZVF9H2|2|This is not the part pictured.  Not even close.
B00632UROI|5|Very well made and fit very well.  The only negative is the mats are made from more of a plastic type material, (shiny and slicker) than pure rubber,  Because of this, they will probably stay newer looking for a longer time, and  will probably resist staining and mud sticking to them better.  Overall, I am very pleased, just had some notion that they would be more old style rubber mats like the Ford bed mat that purchased from Ford at purchase.  Amazon is a much better place to shop than your local Ford dealership, however.  Happy Happy Happy....
B007XCN0XW|5|These make my Jetta look MEAN. Easy installation. A heat gun would be best to have for removing the rear. The front was simple, just push an rotate counter clockwise.

B000BYEKCY|5|Perfect for a 03 Pontiac Grand Am GT V6. Plugs came exactly right gap. Price was incredible and a rebate; $2.00 each. Change the plug wires for a complete job. Use a thin layer of Dielectric grease inside both ends of the wire boots. Makes for a great tune up. Took 45 minutes. Only change spark plugs when the engine is cool. I let mine sit overnight in our garage. Used the TEKTON 3/8 drive flex head ratchet, 3&#34; and 6&#34; Stanley extensions, Craftsman 5/8 spark plug socket.  6&#34; extension worked best for the plugs in the back.  ACDelco 9726UU Professional Spark Plug Wire Set. Hardest part was getting old plug wire boots off of the old plugs. If you get new wires, than it doesn't matter if you damage the old wires. Just yank them off and through them out. Change 1 wire at a time as you change the plug. Get the parts here on Amazon it's the best price. I did mine for well under $50.00. Car has more power and transmission shifts less. (UPDATE) My gas mileage in the city has since changed from 14mpg to 16mpg. The engine starts much faster and cruises up hill without shifting. I'm happy with the results.
B0084LT800|5|Awsome product. Fits and looks perfect. Easy to install.
B00JA3BMDW|5|This is awesome! My dad lovea it!
B0088BBQC4|5|Very easy to install and fits my '02 Nissan Maxima GLE like a glove!  Great sound when accelerating, too. I've had it installed for about 1K miles now with no check engine light or performance issues.  Not sure if adds any HP or not, but torque and throttle response does seem improved and that &#34;grrrr&#34; sound under hard acceleration is well worth the $$$.<br /><br />Recommended.
B007Y5CO4Y|1|I can't believe I spent over $30 for this thing!  Yes, it does fit my SAAB windshield, but there is too big of a cut-out for the rear-view mirror, and it doesn't stay in place very well.  The roll-up aspect, which I thought would be cool, is the WORST.  It's like alligator wrestling in your car.  I tried creasing the shade in pleats so I could fold it up like a conventional shade, but the creases didn't take.  Finally I started folding it in half before attempting to roll it, and that made it a little quicker to take down, but it's still this gigantic, inflexible roll filling up my backseat when not in use.  The insulation value is no better than a shade you'd buy at the local big-box for $9.95.  I feel really stupid for getting this.  Don't make the same mistake I made.
B00OFU33PU|4|ok
B003Y7VD5C|5|These towels are amazing, they are extremely soft, thick and fluffy. After washing them there was absolutely zero lint left behind.<br />So they are completely lint free car towels. Yes they are expensive, but worth every penny.
B000JFJM14|1|If I could give this lower I would.  The unit I purchased came in February and I tried to use it for the first time today (which is past the return policy date).  Needless to say the cap is cracked which ensures that a seal is not made so as much as it is pumped it does nothing.
B00CO8E1N8|3|Ultimately did the job, but not without issues.  This thing adds about ten inches to the height of the jack, so you really need the car up high to get it under the transmission.  The assembly is quite heavy and is bolted to the jack with a single bolt.  It is really a bad design because the bolt is too big to fit a wrench around.  Also the bolt quality is poor, so the first one stripped out under the weight of the tranny = no fun.  But it did do the job with a little playing around and modification.  Three stars is probably generous.
B001QGFWNM|5|easy to put on in minutes.
B00196LCO2|5|The window keep falling down about 6 inches when we were driving.  I had to manually slide the window up with the palm of my hand to close it then when we drove again, the window would slide down again.  So I ordered the correct part for the back passenger on the driver's side for a 2005 Honda Civic LX.  Now the electric window goes up and down and it finally can stay shut and keeps the rain out!!!!
B008C0WOOU|1|I purchased two of these sunshades, 1 for a 2014 Dodge Challenger, and 1 for a 2015 Dodge Challenger. The 2014 shade fits my car like it was advertised...custom fit, however the 2015 shade does not fit my fiancee's 2015 like it should. Even though the description stated this shade was for a 2015 I believe it's actually a 2014 as when I overlaid my 2014 on top of the 2015....they were identical. Buyer beware, these are NOT custom made for a specific year.
B00IQVZ96K|5|Nice fit.
B003END2VE|1|Lights were a total waist of money.. After the first rain storm they stopped working.
B000EDUTWM|3|Arrived with some sort of a glue residue on the front of it, and one of the pieces of double sided tape on the back was falling off. The tape didn't seem that strong anyway. Luckily I was planning on adding a back to the piece and hanging it up with a picture hanger; if I had used the tape I don't think it would have stayed on the wall very long.
B000RFUYQI|3|thanks
B0013TNMY8|4|Good product exact fit.
B00E8CZAWY|1|I bought this device for a 7,000 mile motorcycle trip to power my GPS and CELL phone. 1,000 miles in the USB PORT stopped working and the indicator light stopped as well<br />Very disappointed with this device and its poor quality.

B00SHZKCC6|5|These work very nicely.
B000CA56S4|3|Went on the car just fine but afterwards the brakes started making noise.  Had my mechanic check it out and he could not find any problems.  The Outer edge/rim of the rotor is a little chewed/chipped up.  Not sure if the pads or caliper is making contact the that is causing the noise/damage.<br /><br />They look cool but I would go with OEM next time.
B007ED9JFS|5|Excellent product thanks.

B000WEIIZI|5|Super easy way to get 12 volt power in my jeep
B00YE5Q132|5|Excellent.<br /><br />As I travel frequently for business and am often miles away from home portable car jump starter and this device has have come up with the goods.<br /><br />The Power bank/Car Jumper comes in a fabric covered plastic carry case.<br /><br />Inside you find powerbank, a car cigarette lighter attachment to charge the device, a UK mains wall charger, a micro USB to USB cable, a set of short jump leads, a laptop charging cable, eight adaptors for various makes of laptop and the instruction manual.<br /><br />The Power bank has 1 USB charging ports to charge such things as an Ipad and Android Tablet, Phones etc. and can deliver 2.1 amps.<br /><br />It also has a dedicated charging port to charge the unit's battery which can be charged either by the wall charger or the cigarette lighter attachment.<br /><br />There is a simple on/off slider type power switch and a button which allows you to control such things as laptop voltage select 12V, 15V and 19V as well as control the built in torch and emergency flashing light.<br /><br />Their is a jump lead port which is &#34;keyed&#34; so you cannot insert the jump leads around the wrong way and has a rubber cover.<br /><br />The Power bank has a 4 led bank of lights to indicate the state of charge, these light up on power on.<br /><br />There is a simple button on the unit which you press quickly to switch on the emergency light, or a number of long presses to control the torch various modes high, strobe and SOS.<br /><br />Clearly the whole unit has been well thought out, the body of the device is made of strong black plastic which is reassuring given that you do not want any short circuits when you are jump starting your car.<br /><br />The flashlight is nice and bright and has three different flash setting, which again an excellent safety idea if your car has broken down in the dark and the red/blue emergency light is bright and affective..<br /><br />In use, after initially giving the Power bank a full charge, I was able to easily charge my Ipad from dead to 100%, the power bank has 12000mAh of power, more than enough to charge an Ipad and them some.<br /><br />I tested the unit with my multimeter and can confirm that the laptop ports various voltage outputs delivered correct voltage.<br /><br />Fortunately I have yet to need to jump start my car but feel confident that this will do the job.<br /><br />Overall an excellent product, the inclusion of a cigarette lighter attachment is a nice touch as you can keep the Power Bank topped up.<br /><br />Excellent Product, Recommended

B000CGMQ6S|1|1998 Chevrolet S-10 exact oem match. It leaked after only being installed less than a month. plastic covers suck
B0084LT79M|5|good price for a great product
B00C8YXH9C|2|The light and modes are great, but it still has the fatal flaw that it will drain your batteries if they are left in.  Used it for about 5 minutes, put in storage for a month and now all 9 AAA batteries are dead.<br /><br />That flaw makes it not useful.
B00KBQWR3Q|5|Installed on a normal headlight in my nissan and works great. A bit of light spill in the top but i just sent headlights to the lowest level and its good. Projector would be more efficient but this works well. Better view at night by 300% and view on wet roads much better but you know wet roads can't get good visibility really but i am satisfied. 5000k color was definitely the best choice.
B00IIOMAOE|5|First off the most important thing you need to know is that Scorpion helmets run small. I wear a large Bell and Shoei helmet and I had to buy an XL. Go into a store to see what size you need before buying.<br /><br />Weight<br />The helmet isn't going to be very light but I haven't noticed neck fatigue after several hours of riding<br /><br />Features<br />This helmet has very good ventilation at the cost of extra wind noise so I'd highly suggest wearing ear protection if you're planning to do some highway cruising.<br /><br />The helmet in XL was a perfect fit so I was unable to test out the inflatable cheek pads.<br /><br />The quick flip down internal sun visor is probably one of the best features of this helmet. It is convenient to have because it doesn't force you to carry 2 visors (one for the night/crappy weather and one for the day. The I ternal visor isn't as dark as a normal pair of sunglasses but it does the job just fine.<br /><br />The anti fogging (or maybe it's the superb ventilation) is great for keeping any fog at bay and the breath deflector on the helmet seems to be working pretty darn well<br /><br />Final thoughts<br /><br />The helmet is probably the best bang for your buck. It has all the features of the Bell and Shoei helmets for 1-2 hundred bucks less. I can't seem to find anything I dislike about it. Worth every single penny.
B00BGZ29FW|4|The key fob initially comes with a ring and a piece of black leather that attaches to the ring when you buy the car. This cover will fit perfectly if you cut that leather part off the original fob. But I kept it on and it's worked just fine. I'd say this is worth more like $5 but oh well. Looks cute and I can decifer my keys from everyone else's.
B008CQEMN0|4|Lightweight  for my 2 year old grandson
B004P5MWFC|5|great
B007W9NXMY|5|Really like this helmet. Sharp looking.  It is nice to have to ride through states requiring helmets and you just want to appear to meet that requirement.  Note that this is not a DOT HELMET THAT MEETS SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. Arrived on time and as advertised.
B003CKNUBQ|5|worked great
B000COTXIE|5|Great gauge for low pressure tires.  It's a Milton, what else can I say.
B0012TZ1RU|5|worked great
B000C5CERK|5|Works fabulously for our durango. Ty so much
B000C8NVU6|5|Great fit and no leaks.  Just don't over tighten.
B0031GRMFG|4|perfect fir for my truck so far so good
B00KL3ALGO|4|I like this but would rate it higher if it were larger. Too small for our needs. I have a 2014 Ford Escape and there's almost 1/3 of the window that isn't covered. My 2 yr old doesn't even keep his up. Super easy for him to peel off. But I'm still using it for my infant. It is very easy to install and it doesn't leave residue or anything. Definitely like it better than the ones that &#34;roll&#34; up or are sticky. Fits great height-wise just too short for our windows width-wise. Visibility is still good too, which is nice. I would recommend to measure your windows first before ordering.
B00HBNK414|5|Arrived quick and looks good. Real carbon fiber and not a look alike

B007GMHTQ8|4|Highland vs Reese Power, one and the same<br /><br />First of all I didn't buy a Highland U-Venture Cargo Basket from Amazon but I did buy a Reese Explore Cargo Basket from Walmart. Turns out they are the same thing. I first saw the Highland model on Amazon and was hesitant to purchase it as I wouldn't want to ship it back to Amazon if I wasn't happy. I soon found the same item at Walmart but it was also an online only item. BUT, Walmart also had one by Reese Explore that looked exactly the same and was sold in stores. Turns out they are the same exact product, the manual inside the Reese Explore box says Highland on it just under the Reese Explore logo. The item line also displays the 1041900 Highland model number here on Amazon.<br /><br />Upgrading Hardware<br /><br />Now that we've gotten that out of the way, this basket seems to be of decent quality given the price point. It IS a third of the cost of a Yakima Loadwarrior. With that being said, I did upgrade some of the hardware. There are rubber washers to go along with the screws that hold the basket together. Unfortunately, if you tighten the screws, the washers bulge out and will eventually wiggle out from under the screw head. So, I went to Home Depot and purchased some screw covers and new neoprene washers (I also found the supplied washers to be a bit too squishy maybe it was my imagination though). With the diameter of the screw covers being the same as that of the neoprene washer, they aren't going anywhere. I also think it gives a bit more of a polished look rather than exposed screw heads (see photos). They do protrude out a bit more than the screw heads but I'm OK with it. I should mention, you probably won;t want to use the screw covers if you intend to take the basket apart now and again. The screw covers don't look easy to reopen without damaging them.<br /><br />Fitting & More Upgraded Hardware<br /><br />Last thing I want to mention is some folks may need some additional hardware depending on their rack. The manual mentions it fits a minimum bar spacing of 25 1/8&#34; and a maximum spacing of 32 3/10&#34;. It also mentions that those spacings should be at 1 of 3 measurements. The low end of 25 1/8&#34;, the high end of 32 3/10&#34; and in between at 28 3/4&#34;.  Now my rack crossbars are not adjustable on my Mazda Speed3 and the distance from center to center of the cross bars is somewhere around 27 1/2&#34; or so. What this means is I wasn't able to place the mounts on center with the cross rails. They are a tad bit off. When I first attempted to fit the basket, the wide U shaped bracket had the end of the bolt sticking up above the floor of the basket on one side. This would be OK depending on what you plan on putting in the basket. I intend to put a top carrier bag on it and don't want this bolts poking into the bag and damaging it. To solve this I picked up some 3/4&#34; rubber grommets. Home Depot has a package of mixed size rubber grommets in electrical. Of course the bars are 1&#34; diameter so it was a bit troubling stretching them onto the cross bars but they do fit. I pushed those grommets along the crossbars to where the mounting brackets would sit. (4 mounts, so you need 4 grommets, the Home Depot package has 2 of the 3/4&#34; per so I bought two packs. Those made the U shaped bracket sit a bit lower and still achieve the same tightness but the bolts were still sticking out a bit more. To get them down a bit more I used some 5/16&#34; washers. I used two on the side that was closest to the center of the cross bar and 3 on the side that was further away from center. This gave me enough spacing that the bolts stayed below the plane of the basket floor and still secured them onto the cross bars. I am spray painting the stainless washers at the moment but will take a photo once I have everything mounted on the cross bars again.<br /><br />In the end, even though I needed to buy some extra hardware, I'm still pleased with the cargo basket. Time will tell if it holds up well and doesn't rust. I'm hoping not to get caught in too much rain while using it though. For the price of the basket (a little over $100 after tax from Walmart) and the additional hardware ($20 roughly from Home Depot) I'm pleased. Matching it up with a Rightline Sport Jr which ran me about $65 from Advance Auto after a coupon. Now I'm ready for my trip with some extra cargo for under $200!!!l tell if it holds up well and doesn't rust. I'm hoping not to get caught in too much rain while using it though.

B000JFNAMQ|5|Excellent scale for the money...
B00CGK0P4S|5|Great product, easy install, fast shipping very happy with outcome.
B00B5PG6XO|1|Rear end is quiet again, but bearings have failed with less than 500 miles of driving since installation less than 1 week ago. This is unacceptable, do not buy.
B00HVHKB8G|4|Went on easily, gave my Subaru key a meatier feel. When you put the cover on the buttons sit deeper so you have to press a bit harder to activate the lock/unlock sequence. A minor annoyance, not a show stopper.
B000GAROLM|1|wrong tank, returned.
B000GRZEM6|5|mounted with out too much trouble. Would gave been easier if I'd had some little bitty fingers to reach up inside the frame gussets, but she was inside and doesn't know a nut from a bolt........... They look really nice.
B000C9Q1TS|5|Worked just fine and engine runs great. Might cost little more than others but looks like good quality.
B006A2JGHU|5|It's pink and does the job. Functional and cute. Works for me.
B001RM4AXI|2|I had to send these back because one of the cables was broken (it wouldn't allow the spark through)<br /><br />The finish on these is not very good either, they seem to have glued everything together with shower silicone, and didn't do a great job smoothing it out.  Its all globby. Maybe that is why the one cable was broken.<br /><br />I would get something else.
B000IEVL10|5|Great price. Fits perfect. Installs in minutes. Saves the windshield from all sorts of flying objects.
B000E7WLJW|5|Borrowed one from my friend had to buy my one.  His looked like it was starting to tear near the 'weld' points so I will be careful to not over tighten.
B001TI5IIQ|4|Works great! Just need some elbow grease!
B000CF6I4A|5|Easy to put on. Look good. Nice price.
B00336X0AK|4|Works great, dark enough for during the day and light enough for evenings rides
B00AHQIQIU|5|good replacement product  no problems yet
B00480J4I2|3|This bulb is just as advertised. But keep in mind there is a left and right and they are keyed different.
B00EEMJBYQ|5|LOVE IT!!!
B0034ZUZM6|5|This Superwinch is everything that was advertised and more. It has done a great job loading my truck with big logs up to 30&#34;. Now the only thing sore after a long day of loading and hauling is my thumb from pushing the switch.

B006QZEF0O|1|Waste of money. My scooter is still way to ritch they sent a 75 and 80 main jet when the book calls for a 70 for high elevation. Estimating can only be so accurate
B000UODGIY|5|I made the mistake of buying the &#34;yellow ones&#34; first. Bad move. This brand is so very much stronger and more secure.  These blocks are heavy and substantial. They link and lock easily and safely with the levelers and I feel my RV will stay in place which makes road trips even more enjoyable.  You can buy with confidence!
B00HZX1NTM|5|I really like this cover, perfect fit !
B004FDY27K|2|Looks good against my helmet. I like its size. However, the little clip like tab on top of the bracket that supposed to hold the Unit down in place did not do its job. The wind blew it up and out of the bracket the first time I rode with it on. The small USB cable was the only thing that kept it from blowing away and down the highway. When I ride, I have to keep feeling for it to make sure it is still there and on occasion push it back down into the bracket.....Then after only about one month I developed a short in the wire of the USB Cable. Not happy at all!!!!!!

B000FPYA3I|5|Arrived before time. Fits perfectly and easy to install.
B003PI6SOQ|4|To be honest, I got exactly what I expected.  Make SURE you go and download the installation instructions before you even THINK about ordering this.<br /><br />They're not very detailed, they're not something you should consider if you think you're handy with tools.  This is not DIY... this is home mechanic, and if you don't know the difference, this isn't a project you should be attempting.<br /><br />Beyond just running the wiring, my project started with removing the dash, removing the interior molding, paneling, roof lining, doors, ac/heater unit, fuel pump, and radiator.  And that's JUST to GET to the wiring this kit replaces.<br /><br />I cannot stress this enough: if you cannot disassemble and reassemble pretty much your entire vehicle, this is not something you should attempt.<br /><br />That said, this kit will do the job.  My only real complaint is the fuse box itself, as I was hoping to be able to add more fuses directly to this box at a later date when I add more accessories to my vehicle.  The fuse box itself is kind of a sealed unit, so I'll have to add secondary fuse boxes if I expand beyond what I have wiring for.

B0009OR906|5|Gave as a gift. To work buddy's so I can find mine when i need it
B006BDFLPE|5|Bought 2 FOBs for fraction of dealer price, then took to local dealer who was going to charge $32.50 to program, but did it for free (probably wasn't worth the paperwork at end of day). Both working great.
B0039O1UWQ|3|I mounted this roof rack on a set of Rhino Rack DH 1375's [see separate review] . I wasn't going to spend 300 bucks on a Yakima or Thule that are powder coated steel as this rack is staying on the truck. The assembly instructions were pretty poor but it's not that had to figure out- HINT: mount the front, back and 2 bottom sections to one side rail first, putting the bolts in just a few threads finger tight and put that rail on the floor and attach the other side rail. The rack parts are all aluminum but the hardware is steel.  Regarding the hardware, the U-bolts are pretty  cheesy steel and would not fit the square tubes of the Rhino Rack.  As a temporary fix I got some heavy duty black zip ties at an electrical supply until I can find some better hardware, if not for this one problem, I would have given 4 stars
B000N5W7BC|5|Fit great!

B00MRIBD3G|3|I have a Volkswagen Jetta '07.  They're a bit loose and don't work well with this car's seats due to the various switches and knobs.  Honestly, they were a bit over priced for the quality of the image and the fabric.  The bottom seat cover will slide every time I get into the car.  Buy it.  Don't buy it.  You won't hate nor love it.
B00NMOC888|5|It fits great
B007Y34V3S|3|Not great quality amd definately not made by Taylor Made lIke another reviewer stated.  Buy the Taylor Made Hull Gard fenders for less money and the get your own fender lines. These were made of thin material and were too large in diameter with no room to store then in our 19' boat. The Taylor Made Hull Gard 5.5&#34; x 20&#34; were perfect for us, we just had to buy some fender lines for them.
B009RC2HVC|5|Fit perfectly.
B008X035MY|5|(this is a copy and paste from my review of the other struts in this set)<br /><br />Wow... my struts were old so maybe I was used to crappy rides... but these things feel great. They seem well made and feel very smooth on highway. They smooth out those dips on the highway, etc - barely notice anymore. Very happy<br /><br />They also take the time to mark the side that faces you (for DIY assembly) with a chalk mark. Includes new nuts, etc. Full package. Super easy replacement on my 95 civic ex sedan.

B009EKR55U|5|Awsome product great fit
B00H1KY4LI|5|A great buy! Extremely bright for the price!
B00HE67HEA|4|Not many inexpensive options out there. The color match is good enough for small chips and scratches. Clear coat applicator does not allow for a match due to the texture.
B004WABZQC|1|[DON'T BUY] Summer 2015: my comments &#34;Bought it. It fit perfectly and it worked great for a 2005 Honda Civic VP&#34;. Now a year later, it was deceiving because the mount fits and looks as the original but, the mount created several noises and strange vibrations in my car. I bought the original HONDA part and replaced it, and the problems are gone. Not worth it to save $40 and diminish the performance of your car....I came back a year later to change my review to save some future trouble to some innocent soul.
B00DOPE05Y|4|The first one that was sent was the wrong one however they were quick to respond and send me the right one at no extra cost. The right part was quick to install and works well.
B000VL1OVC|5|Bought my dad a uprising exhaust pipe for his 1950 ferguson tractor . This is a perfect fit for his 1-1/2 pipe to prevent rain from getting down in it. Very well made, and a great price.
B00KMYYQ36|5|This took my 6 year old boat covers back to full water repellency! Prior to this use the rain would go right through. I first removed all of the mildew that had accumulated on the underside of the tops. I then cleaned the other side of the fabric. Once everything was dry, I applied the Fabric Guard. The rain now beads up on the cover like a freshly waxed car.
B00HQTO9QY|5|All orders were delivered on time. I really like the large size. Telling friends,
B00FDQPCR2|5|Easy install. Very good sensitivity. VERY bright.
B002MB594M|3|These mirrors fit the description and their double sided tape is crazy strong.  The biggest problem is that they are SO convex that everything in them is tiny.  I have some 2&#34; on our Jeep and the size of the images in these 3&#34; ones are just as small as the 2&#34;.  Backing up a boat with our F150 is very difficult with these since the view makes obstacles at the back of the boat mostly impossible to identify.  The other drawback is that they have a deep casing so you loose almost an inch of mirror viewing space with the casing.
B001B7E0FM|5|Delivered on time and was as expected
B008032Q42|5|fits perfect on Toyota 2008 Toyota yaris
B00BAZBKHG|1|Very displeased. They original radiator clutch fan started ticking at 120k miles. Order first replacement and installed on my GMC which is not an easy job. Very little clearance and timing consuming. After first install the new part started ticking a week or two later. I was sent a new part immediately and a return shipping label which was convenient and fast I must say. Now after second install of new part the clutch fan is now ticking after 3 or 4 weeks. Labor lost but more frustrating having to do the same repair for a third time.
B000H6QWWC|5|Great straps, but I have to agree with others that the packaging really is a nightmare.  To remove them from the packaging, the only sane way I found was simply remove the cardboard backing from the plastic, noted by another reviewer.  BUT, there's no way to do this without destroying the instructions.  I was also unable to find instructions at the manufacturers website, www.hamptonproducts.com.  So, make sure you understand their use before removing from the packaging.  I bought 4 pair for 2 motorcycles, so I had 4 chances to try to remove them from packaging.  On my first attempt, I tried to cut away at the plastic.  If you're up to the challenge, make sure you don't operate the ratchet, or the plastic gets jammed up in the ratchet system.  I ended up cutting out the plastic out with a dremel.  Argghhh.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Great straps, and I don't believe packaging should decrease my 5-star rating.  But I don't blame others for doing so.
B00W2XEAEU|1|these are designed to tape to the out side on the door not to insert into window track. I swapped the tape around and was able to get the front ones to work but the rear ones are not convertible. Stuck them to the outside,,,, we'll see.... the only good thing I can say is that the tape is 3M. Love 3M...
B0009IQXFO|5|Fantastic inexpensive soap!
B001NZXH2E|5|These worked great in my 2011 Hyundai santa fe
B001O0VO5U|5|Inexpensive pads, no noise heard what so ever. little to no brake dust keeps the wheels clean.
B00RGQ1OJW|2|Returned.  Said it was 7 inches tall unzipped, 9&#34; zipped.  It was 4&#34; unzipped, and barely 7&#34; unzipped.
B001CS76YM|5|These OEM all-weather floor mats are a perfect fit for my daughter's 2008 Honda Fit.  All of the needed installation accessories (floor anchors and fasteners) are included.  Installation is quick and easy.  The mats are well constructed and are higher quality than after-market mats.  They will provide great carpet protect during our wet & sloppy Northeast winters.  The seller shipped quickly and the transaction was flawless.
B00THRN0HM|5|Arrived on time and was all that is advertised.  It is currently keeping all the weather off my bike.  It also comes with a carry bag which is nice.
B00EAJD8E2|2|Does not come with quick coupling like the stock connectors so you need to cut and splice wire.  I did not expect this and it's disappointing so I have no used any of them.
B001AJKRNA|4|Mirrors shake..had to put some foam tape  to stabilize mirrors a little more.
B0073VJRDU|5|So much nicer than our flexible one that broke in the car wash. No issues with reception.
B00278V2XM|2|They are ok, not super bright,  but the are not weather proof,  the plastic bulbs fall off , easily,  recommended to put inside headlights, not outside car.
B006B3C3XC|5|Cant beat this price! The LED has 2 connectors so its universal for all BMWs. They are bright, too bright that i had to put electrical tape on one strip of led. Overall im happy because this fits great.
B005JVHIZ0|5|I've used Royal Purple in several different cars now.  It has always performed extremely well.  I started using it in our new Ford Focus after the break in period and we were averaging about 33 to 35 miles per gallon.  We then got the maintenance package through Ford and they are putting Motorcraft oil and filters on it.  We now only get 31 to 33 miles per gallon.  My wife drives the same route to work every day which makes it easy to compare the difference in mileage.
B00F8Q52CM|5|Easy installation, quick delivery, overall great experience and awesome product
B00R54ULN0|4|There is an inner liner and the mit stays put but allows one to rotate it if needed to use a &#34;clean side&#34;. I started with the lime green one and got some tar or other grease based dirt on it. Even though I've washed it in detergent (once with microfiber detergent) 3 times, it will not release the grime. No swirls or scratches so I'm happy.
B000KZ0ARS|4|Looked very used
B004JBXJEK|5|OMG! Love it! Fast transaction time, it's so cute and colorful!
B00MC7H3LS|5|Let me just say I've bought many many many led automotive lights in the last few years about $1500 on Amazon to your local autozone and these are the best by far and at a fair price. I've never been satisfied with led tail light mainly because the distinction between tail light and brake is not very good meaning if you have the tail lights on and you hit the brakes the brightest is not noticeable enough to catch someone's eyes and here in Phoenix AZ were people text and drive at 80+ mph and have absolutely no effin skills in the driving department..  brake lights are important. And these bad boys are awesome you can tell the difference big time. These are the 4th order through JDM led and when they say bright golly they mean it. Don't wast your money on autozone or those like brands. If you care about seeing and being seen I'd recommend these. Totally buying Amber led for the rear turn and switchbacks for the front from JDM very happy.<br /><br />The picture of the tail lights - Left is led - Right is incandescent. While in the picture does it no justice they truly are brighter, fills the whole light housing with light no dark spots. Picture of the bulb out is a better comparison of tail and brake function
B0083Z2T1W|5|Love this thing! Have always wanted one. It was easy to install and use right away! Just need a screw driver
B00LGYFTSC|5|Came very fast and looks great!
B00WOY33EA|5|This product worked amazingly well. This is how Ford should have made these in the first place. Excellent product and I'm very satisfied with the quality and the ease of installation.
B008ZVNESQ|5|Looks great
B00OZXXL54|5|Great price!  Works  great,  love the different positions, so I could get it just right for maximum comfort.
B005ESEU8G|5|Looks great
B000FPYHOU|4|I have a 1976 Corvette with a non-functional clock. This clock sits on the center console and is easy to read and find the light button at night. Great interim solution until I get the clock fixed
B00BFLVVU6|2|Battery will not hold a charge.
B001UHQXQ2|5|I would buy this again good shipping good product.
B00V6X93CG|5|Nice battery. Came fully charged with all the screws and terminals.  Very good price. Couldn't find anyone locally even close in price.
B008CE0W5Y|5|Very bright and has no problems after being totally submerged.
B002MQCY7C|4|A little hard to adjust first time, but so far they work great!
B00684TAYY|5|Works great for a fraction of the price from a dealer
B000VU9D20|5|These inline fuse boxes work great for wiring boat consoles. They will last a long time
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with my Android.  Get the Torque app and you can do heaps of cool stuff for cheap with it.  There's no reason a home mechanic shouldn't have one of these.
B00EXIEVO6|5|Product as expected. Seriously serves the purpose
B004KEFDI6|4|Works to remove light rust.
B00KRATLM6|5|Easy to cut to size for the car. You need good scissors though.
B004YD1VIY|5|Works perfectly. Very good quality.
B000C0TBIA|5|Good quality belt.
B005M4GC74|1|So frustrated received it with damage.
B00UJUUWP4|2|Did not smell like a new car scent.
B009PHF036|5|These were installed several months ago on my Suzuki XL-7. They have held up great and work as well or better than the OEM shocks. Highly recommended!
B001KO0OXI|5|New diaphragm & gaskets as I needed.
B007TY59TM|5|Delivery was on time ! The item fit my 99 Camry great. I bought both left n right rear regulator W/motor.  The left passenger window motor is not set up correct. The up button makes it go down and down button makes it Go up . You can cut the wires and correct that little issue its not a big deal. Overall it's a perfect fit and works as it described. I had called auto part stores around my neighborhood only to get prices of 135 for the left side regulator W/motor and 99 for the right. I don't understand the price difference but anyways. To have $40 each from here is amazing !  They work great guys trust me . Any one with a bad experience must have not known how to install them! It's easy , u can YouTube the instructions on how to do it. a novice can do it ! I'm very satisfied with the seller and the product ! I'm a happy camper !
B009J7P45G|3|Maybe it was just me, or maybe it was the age of the spoked wheels, but I really had to fight with those spokes to true up the wheels. I believe that a lot of WD-40 or penetrating oil and enough patience to let it set for a few hours would have been better. Other that my experience (or was it in experience) this was/is a solid little wrench that got the job done.
B0052XHBO8|5|Worked great, easy to install.
B0016KFX9G|2|I'm really not sure what to say, but there is not much good to say.  The Reese sticker cover-up as stated by another customer was the same for me.  So what is this product and who made it??  I shouldn't have to even ask this question.  Next, it was a bit of a pain to install, I had to shave (not easy) out the hole in the frame to get the hitch to even mount correctly.  Taking off the muffler was not overly difficult, but an added frustration.  Last, the point of securing the mount to the frame loop to keep it steady is ridiculously poorly set up.  It looks &#34;rigged&#34; and I could have done that myself.  Overall, dissatisfied.
B00JODFDJW|5|been 2 months and about 1500 miles no problems yet, on a 2002 fxdwg
B007A9AM0W|5|I love this jacket. It's nice and cool in the summer and it has a flattering fit. I am 5'6, 130 lbs and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly.
B00KWMNI6Y|5|Excellent quality, excellent price, shipped quickly!  The package was opened when I received it due the weight of these heavy duty floor mats, probably best to ship them in a heavier weight or better sealed plastic envelop.
B005JC5BIA|5|Ready to weld to tractor bucket as is.
B008JATS56|5|Fits fine and works fine. Way cheaper than buying from the dealer.
B00EDEOP46|4|Nice item. It's really cool
B00FGPTDES|1|Did not fit 2012 Rubicon 2 door.  Holes did not align.  Returned for refund.
B0002SRD0U|5|Works great!!
B00KVWQHD6|5|fits perfectly in the switches in my '92 Honda Civic
B0012H6HMK|4|Bought these in January 2015 and have been very pleased. We have used them several times over the past seven months and haven't had any problems. The travel trailer lights add a festive feel. Other campers have commented on them and the uniqueness makes it easier to find our campground spot at night.<br /><br />The light covers are made of plastic so banging them around a lot probably isn't a good idea (as with most plastic items). I toss ours into a box when they aren't on our camper. If you're expecting eight feet of light space you may be disappointed.  I'd say that the lights themselves are about five feet long. The part from the light to the plug on either end adds two or three feet. They remind me of Christmas lights in the space from the light to the plug. Also, it looks like you should be able to plug multiple strands in together. I hope so anyway. We liked these so well that I just ordered our second set.
B001B5EO28|5|Installation was smooth although the guide is nearly worthless on the Celica.  The performance has been very solid and the break-in was good.  So far this clutch has exceeded my expectations.
B005H0OQFI|5|Fit perfectly easy to install works great. I can leave my windows cracked on hot summer days now without worry or getting my seats wet. And they look amazing
B0006JO0TC|5|best thing for the lake were there is no place to charge up the battery
B000BZWUYI|5|It work as they say  very good.
B00KB507J8|5|Great decal, I like the size.
B003R7I0FU|3|Got for a friends car dit perfectly
B00SUNH7GY|5|Just received my lights installed them on my bike in four locations have a chieftain Indian motorcycle that I installed them on approximately two hours for  installation  so far they're working fantastic I would recommend
B000NBWCFC|5|Works well with the glasses to find leaks in hvac systems. Use it all the time
B00RV83UUG|5|Put on the front of my ranger it lights up the world
B00L7X7QC4|3|they looked great for about a month then noticed the red lenses began to melt around the brake light.
B00IMUC9YA|5|I really like this steering wheel cover. I love bling, it adds a little something special to my car. Is there a seat cover that matches?
B00TQHHCTK|2|keep searching this is an alright product. There is better my friend!
B004LF140U|5|Incredibly easy to install, and just as described. Saved me hundreds of dollars and hours of time than the alternative
B00JJBWMDO|5|Great product in great timing! Thanks!
B00RM327NG|5|Works just as intended. Easy to remove when not using which is nice.
B00AN5RN2A|5|wow no warping after 15K miles
B00T9LO1BK|5|Tough as hell. Smooth as butter.
B003TTL0TE|5|One of the best mitts that I have found so far. Love em
B001TNFFK2|1|Doesn't help with Auto Ride Control. It was 2&#34; from helping on my 2014 Yukon Denali
B00LW834Z2|5|Keys arrived quickly and the instructions for programming them were very clear and easy to follow.  They work like a charm.
B0093K2XPI|5|Plug and play! Works as it should
B001Y93990|4|Easy to install and fits the windshield of my car very well.  I didn't do any before/after temperature readings, but I can definitely feel that the steering wheel is not nearly as hot when I have used the cover.
B002YKBAXK|5|Got tired of making a mess and frequently dumping the small bottle. A must-have for bleeding brakes.
B000BOC2E2|5|Sealed my tire that had a nail i couldnt get out. Jeep tire no longer leaks
B00C7I4XQ0|4|I recently purchased  &#34;&#34;Your Kitchen Organic Ground White Thai Pepper From My Farm. (1.8 Ounce&#34;&#34; and it did NOT come with a shaker lid. So I purchased this little set to use for my white pepper and I think it will work great. My lids screwed together great. and since I'm using both sides for the  same spice I think the size is perfect for my needs. Good sturdy plastic. Happy with my decision.
B00LNNR9GG|5|Great product and speedy delivery!👍🏻
B000CMKEIO|4|Nice mats! The passenger side didn't fit as well as the driver's side.
B0014F1I1A|5|Fantastic seller and product.
B008X034A2|5|(this is a copy and paste from my review of the other struts in this set)<br /><br />Wow... my struts were old so maybe I was used to crappy rides... but these things feel great. They seem well made and feel very smooth on highway. They smooth out those dips on the highway, etc - barely notice anymore. Very happy<br /><br />They also take the time to mark the side that faces you (for DIY assembly) with a chalk mark. Includes new nuts, etc. Full package. Super easy replacement on my 95 civic ex sedan.
B00404WDUC|5|Good
B00GHRYALA|5|fit just right
B0068MXNRQ|5|Fit perfect and does its job.
B00EC102X8|5|Perfect fit!
B00E1SKTJ4|1|1) Did not fit.  I have a 2005 AWD Magnum, these look like they're for the RWD car.<br /><br />2) If they are going for the whole Tommy Boy  experience,  the rotors need to come in something nicer than a generic white box, and the pads should  be better than just shrink wrapped  together.
B00AQKBQES|5|I bought this as a gag gift because my daughter HATES the weeping angels. Installed it on her trucks back window behind driver seat, and its been a couple days and she has not even noticed! I am waiting the fussing I will get over this but it hung right onto the window just fine and was exactly as described. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Dr Who and the Weeping Angels!
B00FW1JP9O|5|Showed up two days early! Exactly what I wanted
B00PSRORH2|5|The shades work great. Love how they stick to the window without the suctions.
B0072LCY86|5|Perfect fit in my 2012 Liberty. It retained all steering wheel controls perfectly. Highly recommended!!! Volume, Chanel, input and preset channel chance all from steering wheel.
B00HXPPY0G|5|Great love it
B00JXS3BXI|5|can carry and deal with a lot of weight. really good stuff this is.
B000WL3M3O|3|A month after installing the Lloyd mats on my Porsche, the back/bottom side started to peal off (as i removed them to vacuum).
B000C9IXKS|4|thanks
B002WGKOSI|5|Great for a tactical vest. Lots of pockets. Fits many sizes. Almost too big for me at 5'10&#34; /180# but with it adjusted down it snugs right up. Plenty of water capacity for any activity.
B0012PQBVE|2|This product was advertised for vehicle with Rear AC and that is not true. My did not fit and will have to be returned. I am not happy.
B008C8TM1K|5|Just right, works well, easy to install,
B0007M3094|4|Fit my 03' Infinity FX35 with installed after-market Curt tow hitch.  I need this long ball mount because the tow hitch is installed and hidden underneath the bumper and cannot be reached by regular length ball mount.  I took one star off because some paint chipped off in more than one place.
B00029XC1I|5|My husband works for the railroad and he was looking for something to put on his hard hat. Perfect size!
B003ZOLAH0|5|Right part and it works well.
B000EVYGZA|4|Not an electrician by any stretch of the imagination, but I wanted to repair a dryer by myself and I also needed to figure out why one of my guitars was humming like mad. This allowed me to finish both of those projects safely. I have no idea what all it is capable of, and the instruction manual was a little vague (or maybe over my head). It's a useful tool, and I plan on learning more about its capabilities and using it more in the future.
B0069ARUKI|5|Great item, I needed it to keep items in da back of da truck from moving all over
B00DILUBL6|5|As described.  Saved me a trip to the autoparts store.
B00HNY0RIQ|1|Did not fit my quad, and would not accept refund nor replace with correct one
B00DULV8PC|5|good product thank you
B003F06Y6G|5|Lovely natural scent which is effective without being overpowering, and does not trigger my chemical sensitivity allergies at all.  I have been buying this product for a couple of years and I love it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works well. The company sent me a couple of emails making sure I was happy with the item, and providing some FAQ responses. It was a bit tricky to close the first time, but is quite easy once you get the hang of it.  Just remember to twist, and it folds into the right size (is actually quite small when folded, and takes up less storage space than the vertical folding screens, easily fitting into a storage slot in my door).  I have a mid-size SUV and the size works extremely well. Better than those cheaper folding screens, providing a more complete window coverage
B000C9WJ76|5|Good
B00BTLEIIY|5|I have these in my 2012 Honda CRV and they fit very well (after some strategic but minor cutting). Over 8 months later, still going strong!
B004ZF4930|5|Super happy with the lights and the support from the company and any problems I had
B008JQ1AN8|4|perfect fit
B00HFL9AK8|5|Excellent product and price. The shipping was really fast. Thanks.
B00MLO3S52|4|[[VIDEOID:7641e15a2168758390c2c702d13d6b76]] I got this WOWOWO® Neoprene Winter Neck Warm Face Mask because it has the vents in it and its neoprene. I am out in the elements all day delivering mail and I need a mask that I can wear with sunglasses and not have them fog up. I have another brand of mask that I payed twice as much for that has no vents in it so this one already has 2 advantages. Price and vents. It fits nicely and forms pretty good to my face. The nose hole is where it is supposed to be. That seems to be a real design flaw in some cheaper masks. Not the case with this one though. The only thing I would have liked to have seen changed on this one was the fact that there is not much wool material on the neck. It needs more to be tucked in a coat better. If you move very much the wool starts to creep out of the neck area of the coat. If this part was abit longer then this would be a 5 star review from me. The price is right on and the vents seem to work great. I could breathe easily through the mask.<br /><br />The WOWOWO® Neoprene Winter Neck Warm Face Mask gets a 4 star review from me only because of the lack of material on the neck. Other than that it is a great mask. If you have a scarf or maybe a coat with a larger collar then I think this will work great for you.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br /><br />I was provided with a sample for free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest review.
B0009PCPNQ|5|I had bad spots in my car from years of spills! It looked awful in my backseat! I looked at Tuff Stuff on Amazon and seen how many five stars it had, so I bought it immediately. I can see why it was rated 5 stars, my seats look like it did when I bought it brand new off the lot, that's how wonderful this is! I'm not a verified customer on this product because I bought mine at the store near my town. But I just want to let everyone know that it's a miracle worker! I even used it on my car mats, and I have no more stains what so ever!! Now I want to get every stain in my house, that's how excited I am!!
B000CJWXAY|5|Correct fit, working perfectly upon install.
B000CHJ7R8|5|Direct replacement for factory.
B007H2PYKA|1|This chair is very dangerous. I just received them yesterday and my husband and I were so excited to use them to star gaze last night and when my husband went to lounge back his finger got caught in the track under the chair arm. He thought it pinched him but it turned out it cut a chunk out of his finger. We took  picture of the injury and are going to send a complaint to the company. There was no warning or anything accompanying the chair. There needs to at least be a warning that this could happen.
B002BEC1NC|5|Good
B012FKI1EO|5|Good quality part A+
B0019I9SV4|4|not the best quality but it did the job
B005H5Z50S|1|BLUETOOTH DID NOT WORK WONT TURN ON WASTE OF MONEY
B00F64ROUO|5|Perfect fit, looks great
B00KTHV5SK|5|The key worked great it just cost me 40 dollar to get it cut at a locksmiith they should tell you that u need to have it cut
B00E18RZ0U|2|For a Honda part, this thing fails. it looks great, but it has flaws.<br />i have the red one, my bike is 2 weeks old, and i need to get touch up paint.<br />the front corners of the cowl, rub on the bike and scratch the paint. you need to get some little rubber feet for the cowl so it doesnt rub.
B000FW4LT4|5|I love it, light weight. I would like one a little longer to reach half way across the windshield (I'm 5'1&#34; and I drive a smaller SUV).
B001IF2BDU|3|The set I received did not fit the back doors, they were to long.  The front windows were good.
B00CXB84N4|5|Just what we were looking for. Good price, works great. Be careful- it will burn through a lot of propane if you don't turn it down once it is warmed up!
B003COIZPI|5|Nice vest, definitely recommend!
B00G4UYSAS|5|it work perfectly
B0049ON7PI|5|Fits perfect, way cheaper than buying these at the dealer.
B00NX5GOQ8|3|The narrow section in the center of both back mats is designed for vehicles with transmission humps on the floor. I don't know of any minivans with such humps. Most spills probably happen in the back, especially if you have kids, so that lack of center coverage isn't advantageous. However, the price is decent and they don't smell much after hosing them off and leaving them outside for a week. They're functional, but not great, and thinner than my old mats. Meh...
B002VG80IA|5|east to install; fixed the AC problem
B006TXCMF8|4|These were nice. But undecided I wanted something else. Good overall.
B0030CC2XI|1|Did not fit my YJ jeep
B001PVQUWA|2|I own a 2011 Honda Pilot LX. Product says it will fit so I purchased it. After having put it on, it is half an inch longer than supposed to be. I have it on still because I am not throwing my money down the drain!
B00480FIEG|5|Great product. I am using it on a 2010 Honda Civic LX-S; not very easy to install but that's because of how cramped it is inside the engine compartment of this car.<br /><br />The bulbs have been producing nice, even, bright White light.
B005OZ5GXC|5|exactly as advertised and expected.
B003EOZNQA|4|very reliable shock absorbers
B00HJ6O4A0|4|has a tendency to blow up in the wind. kids love taking it to the beach..
B00SKKD83I|5|Great product, fast shipping.  I will do busines with this company again. Fit like a glove, no drilling.
B000EGJ1UA|5|Put it on my k1500 suburban with a 350 vortec  my stock muffler was dual pipes into the muffler with a single pipe going out so I used a y pipe before the glass pack and it sounds great
B003L36UGQ|5|I have a 2008 Dodge Caravan with big black tires and lots of black plastic trim. I had just finished cleaning my tires with Wesley's Bleach White and thought the tires would look really nice with some shine on them. I researched amazon and found Lucas Oil Slick Mist Tire and Trim. Not wanting to wait, I picked up a bottle at a local big box store.  I finished my tires in about 5 minutes and they looked great! With nearly a whole bottle left I decided to try using it on my black trim. Wow! This was really impressive. My dull grayish black trim is now deep black, clean, and shiny. With most of the bottle still remaining I tried it on the rubber door gaskets. They are now deep black, clean, and shiny as well.  I had the best results spraying it on, spreading it with a soft cloth, rubbing it in thoroughly with that cloth, and then wiping it off with a clean cloth. I went through quite a few clean cloths.  I highly recommend this product.
B0067EZIE6|4|Had a large National Cycle windshield but didn't like the look. I like the look of this smaller shield much better but it doesn't stop nearly as much air as the bigger kinds. I have to use ear plugs over 60mph now because the wind noise is deafening. Was silent with my bigger windshield. Great item, just understand what you're buying.
B000BW8W48|1|The head gaskets are very poor an not even close to to being round.
B0009IQZX4|5|worked great
B000E26H5G|1|Total waste of money, does not stick to the vinyl on my EZ up at all.
B0002Z9R4S|3|Not the right tool so I apologize to the owner for the purchase of such a valuable item and refunding the money without careful research relating to my vehicle's wiper.
B004AQUCK8|5|Fast shipping, great quality parts. Thanks GLM!
B008WTV3OI|5|A lot cheaper than bumper repair
B000C2Y1P6|4|Perfect fit for my 06 Elantra manual transmission, however, it rubs against the firewall which could become a problem over time.
B000C5IQYA|5|I rate this as a 5 star because i fine it has more hose power than the original good pressure.
B00NLOA3VI|5|Fit my Honda Accord lovely! Looks wonderful! Thank you!
B008SERY72|1|Bought these a little over a year ago. We did not use the vehicle for 6 months and still the floor mats are destroyed. Almost immediately they started peeling the black fur all over and are no torn around the edges and lifting. They look like total garbage.  Would not purchase again.
B00PF0HIKK|4|They are really bright!! The bulb went right in and works perfect but they do cause some radio interferiance. Other than that I'm happy with them
B00544ZBYW|5|Great replacement light for my BMW 1150 GS. Half of what the 'fatherland' charges for their lumens.
B004DVM7RG|5|Great for twin cooling fans on a car.
B002UC4VMY|4|When ordering the tank I was not informedthis retainer rings came with the tank and so I wasted $10.00 by ordering this part
B00ARXB0RM|5|Great product.
B000C30LQ8|1|It was the wrong size. Had to send it back.
B00407RTBW|5|good match
B01237AQSS|5|This is a great 2 person hammock! I liked it so much I ordered a second one( see photos) there is one hammock up and the second one is on the hammock in its bag as I need to get tree straps for it! It is so easy to get in and out of this hammock unlike other hammocks I have tried. I feel very safe and secure and peaceful when relaxing outside! I love how easy it is to hook up to the tree. (You must purchase your own tree straps) It does not twist up at all. It is very lightweight folds up into its own carrying bag. My husband and I both fit into this comfortably and safely, our combined weight is 436 lbs. So wonderful to take hiking, camping or while at the lake! I revived a discount for my honest unbiased review!
B004ADWDQC|5|great  price and the parts fit perfectly
B00BCRMBGQ|5|As a mom, I have been looking for seat covers for my 2013 Ford Escape. This car is the vehicle we take on road trips and also everyday excursions. I needed something easy to install and wanted it to look nice as well. I was lucky enough to receive the Oxgord car seat covers at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. This product really fits the bill for what I was looking for. It looks stylish and took about 30 minutes total to install. I am very happy with the Oxgord seat covers.
B005IQSQXY|5|Just as advertised and described!!! Love it!
B0002JM8PY|5|Works well . Good product.. Drys &#34;&#34;&#34;FAST&#34;&#34;&#34;.
B0045SBV6A|5|Great. A must have for those 500 mile trips.
B002ZS4QCS|3|I little awkward but handy.
B002PYBZJO|2|Very disappointed by the number of PIDs that it found for my F150. Torque Pro picks up over double automatically.
B00318V1X8|5|Look great! Fast shipping.
B005ETCIO8|4|These work well, but had a few that had early failure. So expect some failures. Also doesn't work with cars that monitor the bulbs to be out and tells you.
B0036GGFV8|5|Was up in the air on a tail bag. Always used tank bags but my ZX12R has a non metal cover an all mine were magnetic. So started looking at tail bags and stumbled across this one. 1st day I was real impressed with the quality of it, very nice materials, awesomely built has a lot of nice little touches like rubberized zipper pulls (makes it very easy to open/close with riding gloves on, the Ogio logo isn't huge and obnoxious like on some other brands and is embedded in a nice piece of rubber. Little touches like that add up and make a difference. Zippers are very high quality an seem like they will last (only time will tell), has a great lined seems water proof top pocket, perfect for wallet/phone.  Took a little thought to attach it to my 12R as I wanted it to be very solidly mounted but didn't want to see straps anywhere. Ended up hooking the looped ends under the passenger seat in an X to a carabiner and let me tell ya it looks an works fantastic. Doesn't budge at all on the bike, hit 160 this morning with it on there and no worries at all it didn't so much as twitch. Holds a ton of stuff for the size especially if you zip open the expansion. So far I'm in love with it, I'll never go back to a tank bag again this is so much better looking and way more useful. I'd recommend it to anyone looking at tail bags. If I ever ware it out ill for sure buy it again no hesitation... You won't regret this purchase it's a great bag and as usual Amazon has it for cheaper than pretty much everyone and it arrived at my door with free shipping in 3days. Awesome purchase all around very happy with it...
B00ZW68KAO|4|I bought these to replace the lights in a motorhome.  The lights we replaced were 921 type incandescent bulbs.  These &#34;warm&#34; color lights are similar to the 921s in brightness, but maybe just a hint less bright and the color is white a very slight hint of peach in color rather than the yellowish color you would expect to see from other &#34;warm&#34; colored lights.  The big difference is in power consumption.  The original 921 bulbs used 12  watts each, but these use almost exactly 1 watt each!  (I tested one at 0.08 amps on a 12 volt battery.)  We can now turn on every light in the motorhome and consume less electricity than just two bulbs would have consumed before.  As long as you are okay with a just a slight &#34;warm&#34; color these are an excellent power-efficient upgrade.
B000K0R2P6|1|Returning this ASAP. Trust the negative reviews. They say its a universal mount, and that would be true if the universe was comprised of one truck. This did not fit my truck even remotely close. Even if I welded the bracket to the frame like they suggest in some applications, I would have to fab a smaller bracket to weld to the frame first to make a level spot to weld their bracket onto. Universal fit should not mean, fabricate your own bracket to weld to our bracket to weld to your truck. And like many people stated in previous reviews.... I was also missing some hardware (2 bushings). So if you have a 97 F350 Powerstroke, don't waste your time buying this.
B00238EVAM|4|Good goggles for the price. They fit nicely and the lens is crystal clear. I've used them every day for the past couple weeks and they serve my purpose well (motorcycle riding ). A little bit, about a half-inch of the foam inside has already worn away but for under ten dollars I wasn't expecting to pass them onto my grand kids (!). I'm satisfied and if the missing foam ever becomes uncomfortable I'll buy another pair.
B0006MRQM2|4|Worked as advertised. Camping recently and had strong winds and Valterra hooks worked great.
B000IDUW5C|5|Great safety item. Window punch and seat belt cutter.
B00HFLH5LE|5|Really work's well,Fixed my mirrors so I can adjusts them.
B0027ACXEW|5|Fit perfectly and work properly
B00NVBW5EY|4|How much can you say about a piece of plastic. It works. Mad I didn't think of the idea. Although I'm assuming this has something to do with my car but i drove a mazda 6 and it slides all the way down sometimes so if something does fall that i need i kinda have to dig down there but i guess I'd rather it still fall in that which is why i purchased it so I'm happy
B000BPZ4TQ|5|Awesome,  perfect fit for my 1997 silverado
B004RNR9QY|5|Excellent quality.  Tough and durable.  Link less as advertised.
B000SL4AA2|1|This compress or burned up the first time used it. Tried to put 10lbs of air in my car tire since t was running low and just stopped working. The motor started making a different noise and just stopped pumping air. Not reliable!
B000LNIBR0|5|Sticks stuff together incredibly well.
B000U3HYN8|4|It works, and does a pretty good job. Let us see how long it will last.
B00UV76HKE|1|Broke while using only had it ten minutes.
B004U9YMT2|5|My plugs were old so it may have to do with that... but after putting in these NGK's my car has super spunk. I am very pleased. Also... if you are curious I checked the gap upon arrival - VERY ACCURATE and CONSISTANT<br /><br />I believe these were set to around 30'ish? I can't remember the exact number but whatever it was they were all the same.
B006FXGYB0|5|not too difficult to stick on
B00J713S98|5|Easy installation,  500 hour life span. Just what my old Bayliner required
B00DQ5JRUA|5|So far so good. The fuse is hard to pull out by hand. Other than that, nothing really to complain
B001EB9YZG|5|Awesome product. Not only does it spring forward to relieve tension from unsavory situations, it also swings up and down to act as a breakaway. I won't ever buy any other clutch or brake levers for any of my dirt bikes.
B000E471Z4|5|Perfect fit.
B000HBGKMY|1|got better results out of a hot glue
B000C9PFJK|5|02 Tahoe main belt tension. Fit perfect, just like original that lasted 250K. Remove air intake (flat or 5/16 socket) and use 15mm socket to release belt tension. I installed 2 new Continental belts too (Continental Elite 4060930 Poly-V Belt & Continental Elite 4040377 Poly-V Belt -for A/C bottom belt). All worked out great, no more squeak!! Highly recommend, so far. If you need A/C belt, order 38159 Tensioner.
B000VUR6CE|5|These are good for the price.  Getting a variety of bits is key
B001BB4LBG|5|excellent
B001JT16B8|4|Works great! My car is a mobile office this powers my laptop and keeps my cell charged perfectly!  As other reviewers have stated, the fan is louder but not much of a bother to me.  The plug in end is on a pivot which works great for my pruis port location.
B00U5HTL4Y|4|Good quality, but did not match enough of my dash interior for my 2010 XLT.
B00CMJ5P0C|4|Fits well and dresses up the engine compartment a bit.<br />the tricky part about checking the NAG-1 fluid is the temperature of the fluid. It is kind of a guess if you don't know the exact fluid temp.<br />I guess if you check it after a long ride, you know it is up to the &#34;hot&#34; marking. Internet forums are evenly divided on the accuracy vs the factory tool.
B007Y5DEL6|4|It fits my 2008 Subaru Outback perfectly, and blocks out almost all the light. It is just a bit cumbersome to roll and unroll while sitting in your front seat. But I guess that is a small price to pay for keeping your car cooler on a hot day :)
B00LCBL0DC|3|Worked good
B00COYNTNK|5|Total Disney fanatic! Love this so much. I drive a Honda Fit and the windshield is overly gigantic, it is a little small for my large windshield but I use it anyway because it's too cute and I have yet to find one that would fit right. My window is at a pretty steep slant, so it tends to fall below my visors unless I take the elastic strap and put it around the clip on my visors. But again, too cute!!
B00666G16O|5|Bought these to replace the stock pads on an 1198S.  The initial bite isn't a brutal (the stock pads could hurt soft parts) but they slow the bike down from any speed without drama and just as quickly (street or track).
B00D8WQ9EI|4|music feature works great but if you are going over 10 mph or your bike is loud nobody can hear you talk on the phone
B003LLRZLC|5|The battery arrived quickly and had much more power than the original.
B00YE5Q132|5|The DBPOWER portable car battery jump starter arrived two days earlier than expected which was a nice surprise, I found that the jump starter extremely well packaged.<br />Once you take it out of the box you are greeted by a stylish carry case, when you open the case you will find the power bank on one side and the accessories on the other, the power bank is very well protected by a foam surround which gives it that feeling of added protection.<br />The power bank multi functional use is amazing you can obviously jump-start the car but you have two usb's for charging your phone, you have a super bright light on the side with 3 settings one is a constant light which is self explanatory the other two are blinking warning lights you can cycle through the light settings by pressing the function button for 3 seconds.<br />Next to the on/off switch you have a dust flap protecting the socket where you put the jump cable in, you also have the power input for charging the power bank with the charger included, you also get a car charger for charging the power bank and a usb charger for charging your phone.<br /><br />The jump starter cable on first inspection worried me as I thought that it might get really hot when using it as I have used jump cables that have been red hot when you use them, the clamps on the cables feel really heavy duty and will withstand a lot of usage.<br /><br />I tried this on my car that had been stored in the garage for over twelve months, I honestly didn't expect it to work the way it did, I got the car running on the second time of cranking the engine, the jump cable did not even get warm which really surprised me. So my honest opinion is this product is amazing you will not be disappointed and the fact you get a stylish durable carry case as well as a car charger a phone charger and a super bright light makes this product unbelievable for the price.<br /><br />Oh and a free gift as well by scanning the QR code on the side of the box.<br />I couldn't be happier with this product.'t be happier with this product.
B003CJGDE8|5|You'll need different adapters for different makes; Honda uses 5mm, Suzuki uses 6mm (i believe). Can use on single-cylinder, twins, triples and 4-cyl to gauge ignition and cam timing, vacuum leaks, and of course, to dial in that beautiful bank of carbs. Pretty fast learning curve, and NO MERCURY to lose. This is a &#34;must have&#34; tool. I set ignition timing on my truck using one gauge and no adapter by pulling manifold vacuum.
B00UTQKU7S|5|works as intended-------thanks
B0006Z9ST8|4|Convenient and effective, just as it should be.
B00GV7C9NM|5|Perfect fit replacement.<br />I'm surprised that GM hasn't made a detail change to this model van.  Auto designers seem to change things just to be changing them sometimes.<br /><br />Not only was the part exactly the same the color was too!
B009DJM1W4|5|Fits my father's dodge truck perfectly and matches the other one.
B00JOO5VLQ|5|Very easy to install.  If I can do it, that means alot.
B00R8GO0WS|3|Love it. They are universal so they can be used er cut to the size you need. Just perl n stick.
B008CE06ZA|5|A solid hitch that does a great job.  I didn't have any of the issues that others described with in town towing, though I was only towing 3K.
B00PM3TIQ2|5|303 is good for convertible tops. It is not shinny like Armorall
B00523AMBC|1|The 2nd summer one of the plastic fittings broke-off.  I could unthread the old fitting but I could not find a replacement that goes from that small size to the required hose size on the other end.  I ended-up having to DIY assemble (3) pricey fittings ($15) from a local Big Box store to make it work again.  IMO they should use more standard fittings or provide a backup set...
B00K1VYG1W|5|Everything lines up great ! Looks awesome and has no flex .
B00480J4QY|5|these lights worked in my 2006 Kis Spectra 5. They are brighter than stock kit
B007HCBMB0|1|Wrong part. Not even close. Had to go to competition to get the right one
B001F11ZQQ|1|This is the second time I ordered..did it last very long.
B006QH54WU|5|Per my husband - a perfect replacement and the best price I could find.
B000C2A3JO|1|This  didn't fit my blazer 2000, even when on the Amazon site says &#34;This fits your : 2000 Chevrolet Blazer &#34; This article does not fit my vehicle. I want instructions of how to return this item please.
B005RNGN8I|5|Great
B0018RAYEG|1|These rotors look beautifully machined, but somehow the plane of the brake surface and the mounting surface are not aligned resulting in a visible wobble.  I reinstalled the worn factory parts and performed the same visual check; no wobble whatsoever.  I did not continue with installation of new parts to see if the wobble affected performance or feel, choosing to return the parts unused for a refund.  I'll try some other brand of rotors when I have to replace the pads again.
B007V8WBPQ|5|Nice bright little courtesy light. It works very well
B000BNOIB8|5|I installed this on a 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 that has aftermarket bed caps, side rails and spray on bedliner. It was easy to install. Looks and functions great. I was concerned that there may be issues with the side rails but it fits perfectly. I highly recommend this tonneau cover!
B0010DZZPG|3|Was not an exact fit for my 2008 Prius, even though amazon's compatibility engine said it was. I will try the same brand, but the right part next time.
B00AUV40UK|1|BEWARE  - These are not Aquatabs.<br /><br />Dont be fooled by the description.
B001OMVCIC|5|A must have if you have a newer dodge ram and you do a lot of towing!  Huge difference towing a camper after install. Everything is level and pulls straight down highway!  Took about 1.5 hrs to install as long as you have right tools.
B00449TTVO|5|Great product.  Fixed my AC issue!
B000C5E860|5|Perfect for our replacement we needed.
B00HLV06YQ|5|One of the best helmets and I have tried tons of them. Large is a large.
B003WDDLTO|5|aaa
B00I1S11BU|5|Fits perfectly on my 83 nh80
B00LTX89PA|2|Aesthetically pleasing. USB outlets work fine. Have yet to get any 12V accessories to work. Either won't work at all or will not stay in. These accessories work in other 12V outlets. Maybe just a bad one but thought it was odd that a couple of them wouldn't even stay in the outlet. Just wanted to push out.
B00PYBHOI6|4|Had a small issue with shipping, but otherwise great product. Used it with buffing compound M2 and really got my car looking nice buffing up the areas where i wet sanded the clear coat. Being new to body work i think this product is great and worked well for me for this being the first time i have ever done this.
B000MY07XY|5|I can't imagine riding my scooter without them.  This grips take some work to get on but are worth the effort.  Mine had been on for over two years until I tore one when the bike turned over.  Otherwise, I think the first pair would still be going.  I find nothing negative to say about this product.  Buy it!
B0000CBIK5|5|It looks very simple, but works well. And the connector fits my bike perfectly. Although the shipping speed is a little slow for me (2 weeks), the shipping is free!
B00UXX245I|4|Nice covers. Very simple to install. About 10 minutes a seat. I had Coverking covers before that didn't last a year. These seem the same but I'm hoping they last longer.
B00N5IFGZI|4|Fits perfectly on car and makes it look absolutely lovely. My complaint is that instead of getting what's in the picture with the chrome edge, it was all black. Don't understand why one thing is advertised and another sold and shipped. fortunately that does not affect it's functionality hence my 4 star rating in spite of disappointment with the difference edging.
B0071F2SSO|5|Perfect fit. No problems at all. Purchased it for a 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.
B00MRCK23E|4|Replaced my factory license plate bulbs with a set of these LEDs. These LEDs are amazingly SUPER-bright, probably 10x brighter than what I expected. I had to aim them upwards because of how bright they are. Unfortunately, after 5 months the LEDs started flickering and ultimately at the 6 month mark they stopped working.
B000TK3U4O|3|I don't get the hype. Not that bright at all. Extremely expensive for what it is. Better last me years because the silvania I had from autozone for $11 was just as bright (and wasn't even burnt out yet, I just wanted an upgrade)
B00ARUQRDW|5|Arrived as promised, installed in a matter of minutes. Looks great
B0012WHBSO|5|AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!
B00BRAVJYS|4|It fits on my 2010 Jetta and works as it should.
B000AS706E|5|AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!
B005CLMWYO|5|Good quality..works well..was tough to install that rod ..pain in the ass
B001GJ3FIS|5|Great price, and everyone at my garden wants to know where I got it.
B002XL2HVO|4|It is so useful to have a tray this narrow to fit in awkwardly shaped drawers!  I wish the slots were slightly longer, though; the average butter knife just barely fits in it.
B0031GX3T0|4|perfect fit for my truck so far so good
B0015BKT5Y|5|Great fit love it
B0043DSGX8|3|Extremely sturdy, but it arrived crushed.  The packaging was undamaged, so perhaps it was secondhand?  Still usable with a bit of work, but it's actually overkill for the repair I bought it for.  This clamp is very, very heavy-duty and not for minor repairs.
B007NNH1V8|5|cheapest yet fastest arraival
B000CB7DG6|5|Saved money & quality product - will buy again.
B00DZZ4X7S|4|OK product. Only issue is that no matter how much I try to tighten down the screw it still spins. The screw doesn't seem to tighten down the rubber in the fork stem tight enough to keep it from still turning.
B004303LMC|5|Fiebings has been around forever and make great products for leather and horse tack care. This is another one. It is easy to apply, long lasting, and perfect for keeping shoes protected and looking good. Highly recommended!
B00DTU95Y0|5|works good, looks nice, solid piece
B000AR7KVA|3|This is a OK rubbing compound that will remove light scratches and abrasions on your car's finish. Not as abrasive as some pastes, it works fairly effectively with a moderate level of effort. Anyone needing to remove or diminish deep scratches should try something else, such as one of the compounds from Megular.
B001804UBG|5|Better than oe
B004J2DHDW|3|These strut kit seen fine although my springs were not seated properly.  Plus the struts are for the FE1 suspension only. The LS and LT1 have the FE1 turning suspension. The LT2 has the FE3 sport suspension. The SS/TC has the FE5 lowered stance suspension.
B0002KNZL4|1|good for nothing
B001C1HLYE|3|Not quit black but, dark gray. Not quit as firm as They seem softer than specified. My throttle side grip was torn slightly.
B00BJJZ2QS|4|They fit pretty well on my 2013 with only 2 complaints.<br /><br />1. The pins on the mirror side were bent making it very difficult to plug into the truck harness especially while holding the mirror.<br />2. The bottom side of the mirror is not flush with the truck, even after tightening the bolts<br /><br />Other than that everything on the works great. Before even installing them I swapped the puddle lights with LEDs to match the rest of my truck.
B0082ODYAY|5|Very nice and colorful sticker.  Applied to the rear window of my car.  A reminder of home even if we have to live in Texas for a while.
B00BSG3AIE|5|These lights work perfect.
B00OH5TAGY|1|Three of the four worked, as they should, however one leaked.<br />Result --flat tire-Auto club call-a ride on a donut and the waste of time. In this case one hundred per-cent is the only acceptable number. Therefore it FAILS
B000234ITE|5|It did a great job!
B00NM1E8J8|5|Fit perfectly easy to install
B0010AYJEC|4|I like it but no screws
B001U04MHG|4|Bought one at Lowe's, and it worked fine for several years. Now it won't stay on for more than a few seconds.  People have complained about non-replaceable batteries but this does have a plug in battery pack of 3 AA NiMH.  They just don't tell you what to do.  You peel the paper circle off the bottom and there are 6 screws: 3 to remove the base and 3 to remove the magnets.  Take out the 3 screws for the base, to remove the plate containing the magnet insert.  Then you can pull off the bottom with the three feet.  The battery pack has a 4 prong connector.  My battery pack is a Grepow(R) 114578-MH29711 (AA13900mAh 3.6V).  Now if I only knew where to get a replacement battery pack.  May have to disassemble and make a pack my self.<br />Follow up.  The battery pack is not directly available anywhere I could find but one can buy a similar pack from battery space and modify the connection.  However, in my case the battery pack is fine and still has 3.6V output.  Tore in further and got to the circuit board but obviously that is not replaceable.  Time to get a new lamp.  I will make certain I get one with more easily accessed batteries and certainly one that is more stable.  This one is fine if you will always have some iron sheet to stand it on.  But most of the time that is not reasonable.
B001AV545Y|5|It was as posted
B009JRE7ZY|3|Serve their purpose. Made of thin Chinese made plastics. They don't extend far out so in the rain, I can only bring windows down to the edge of the visors or rain still falls right into the F150 poor design. Easy to install.
B005XEFADU|5|My husband and I can't say enough good things about Happy Camper.  We've been camping for 38 years but we've only had a camper with a bathroom for five of those years. We camp two weeks at a time at the beach and we've tried all those other so called best products for the holding tank and they don't stand the test !!!  Last year my husband was having to dump every three days and it was to the point that we didn't even want to use our bathroom any longer.  We just got back from our two weeks but before we left I began searching for a miracle and found it in Happy Camper.  I read almost every review before purchasing it and had no idea first of all that heat can effect the way holding tank products work, this product promised to deliver and boy did it ever!!!!  My husband only had to dump once a week and that wasn't even really necessary because Happy Camper broke down all waste and toilet paper, even he was amazed.  I will no longer be purchasing anything else this is an awesome product.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you !!!!
B00757KJTI|3|It does compromise the signal. But if you're in a nice metro area.......no problem.  I don't have to worry about the car wash etc anymore.
B002FUO59K|5|Really good it improve my HP
B002Q28WH8|3|Fair
B000EFMU4A|5|Well, there is not a whole lot that can be said for hubcaps, but here I go.<br /><br />The quality of these hubcaps is good. They are not flimsy or cheap feeling.<br />The installation was simple.  Just put the metal ring on the hubcap, and then push it onto the rim.<br />They look great.  They look so much better than a rim without them, and they just give the car a nice clean look.<br />Easy to clean.  Just wipe them down with a dry cloth or with any sort of cleaning solution and they clean right up.
B00IKPFFIY|4|Works perfectly in my F350. Doesn't seem quite as &#34;heavy duty&#34; as the factory original, but at least this one works.
B00VR6T3D6|4|Looks great in my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander!  The blue really compliments my interior.
B00E8K24DE|5|Just like I thought it would be. Looks good!!!
B001GJ3FIS|3|Works well but it leaks even with the rubber washers.
B00852684M|3|works fine.  lost one on first ride.
B000K0443E|5|02 Tahoe orignal speaker. Great clarity, quality, easy install with no modification needed. Highly recommend.
B008EX2FQ2|2|the scent is okay but lasted for 3 weeks only
B00JR33MYW|5|Exactly what I needed to match the other entry door.  Very solid feel when holding on to the bar.
B00681BE2S|5|was surprised this product worked so good. Other products wouldn't sync with my car.
B00407V5B2|5|Exact match!<br />Good going there Dupli-color
B000T28GBO|5|as expected
B002AMAXNA|4|Haven't tried it's functions, but it is solidly built, the blade is sharp, and it seems like it would work well when needed. bright color makes it easy to grab, but it is small enough to stash in a door or console compartment.
B002XM3AVY|5|Better than oem.
B001JYQ7QC|5|these are great !!!
B000CM3H4M|5|just what I needed.
B00080QHMM|5|Bought this for our RV. Compact, user friendly. Does the trick.
B00L1RUGJ6|5|Slightly taller than OEM (1996 Yukon,) had to trim the OEM hub cap internally just a bit but otherwise these are great. Cheaper than going stock. Hopefully these are more rust resistant than OEM as well.
B004I0Z58K|5|Looks like original equipment.
B007XZK2YY|5|Awesome product, I can sharper turns now and you can really feels a difference in the handling
B008EEYWIA|5|Fits perfect!
B0085FP6MY|5|What a deal!!! Fit was perfect and easy install.  Hardest part is getting door panel off.  Mirrors are exact replacements for heated/electrically adjustable and flip-up for towing.  Absolutely a great buy!
B00B2YHFO2|4|work like a charm very clean and bright
B00F6GKKQC|5|Great set
B006ERQ1JW|1|No Instruction were included, box arrived it was torn open.
B00MTHPAN4|4|worth the money

B00BBMDAL2|5|Great service. Terrific product. Very pleased.
B0009IK5NU|5|I couldn't find the replacement wiper blade anywhere. This one worked great for my jeep
B000UVCK9S|5|My daughter bought this to give to her friend for his birthday.  It was super easy for him to install and he absolutely loves it!!!
B004YTP11G|5|Love it!!
B001AI9L0G|4|gets kinda worn really easily but still works
B00EK5AWQI|5|Perfect. They even come with amber bulbs.
B00AB2PBU6|5|nice seat covers, thanks!
B000G16JA8|3|It works OK but the corners should be marked or tagged to aid installation
B00QEXZVHE|5|Lights are very bright. My friend My Nguyen is the best when it comes to car lights. He recommended it and I was happy I listened to him. Thanks Bro.
B00KTHZR7K|5|Awesome remote for my 2010 Chrysler Town & Country Touring minivan that had only one plain old style key when i got the van, only cost me 25$ at the Chrysler dealer to program it, and from Chrysler company cost 180$ one key very big difference...
B00FMCQSJS|5|Excellent fit and look. Altima 2015
B002E2WMWG|5|Great Product. Works Perfect. Will buy again for my other cars.<br />Install Video: https://youtu.be/DLrLH_mdwbY
B000NPUJQC|5|durable
B00652G4TS|5|Awesome Product. Work Nice. Worth the money.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oem_6qH3G-Y
B00554PR6I|5|The wire harness worked great
B008EEYVXG|5|Exact fit, excellent quality
B006H34AE6|4|This brush fantastic, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  When you're finished you can simply rinse it with water and let it dry. It's a must-have, especially if you're using a microfiber mop. When I bought it was $7.39. Now less than a month later they more than double the price? What's up with that?
B0053GIPZS|5|Purchased these to move cars and farm equipment. They work as good as the most expensive binders. Excellent value.
B00MC6RQAM|5|Looks great.  Nice white color with a hint of blue on reflections.  Much better than yellow looking halogens.
B000C9C4FI|4|Worked as designed.
B000GTZCQC|5|Looks great on my kx250f.
B00DMT00U6|5|Installed belt drive kit on 2007 Honda Element. Works like a charm.Saved myself some money also.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Fast shipping and this battery worked perfect
B001DKR44G|1|Doesn't work
B00BCRWEB8|5|The best! Have had mine going on 3years ... Still works great day on day out. This fridge has been in two kw's and two cascadia's fits good. Gets really cold..do don't set the thermostat too cold or will freeze drinks and milk.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Fast shipping, great quality parts..fixed my problem..Will do business with them again
B0049GECYG|5|Good product
B00H7HSN3A|5|Love this vinyl sticker. Easy to put on. Comes with great instructions. PLUS it looks great too!!!!
B003TS2VXY|3|I am interested in purchasing this item, but first must know how it is mounted to the windshield.  is it mounted by using the already existing screw on the windshield bag? thanks
B0067MZHY4|5|Made installation a breeze!
B000K0WQD4|4|Worth the money, a smother ride for my F250
B000IYK6YI|5|This cord is the real deal !
B005SUW6T0|1|I opened the package and the first thing I noticed was that the new springs are about 5/16ths smaller than my 2011 KLR 650 original springs. I called Outlaw to confirm that this kit  belongs to my KLR, and they confirmed with a yes. Next I noticed that the kit includes one extra friction pad and plate. Installing the whole kit w/ the extra friction pad and plate made the clutch system too tight to where it did not work. I removed the extra friction plate and pad and this made the clutch system too weak to the point where the clutch slipped and not work at all. After four tear-downs, loss of (8) quarts of oil, a gallon of antifreeze, and many hours lost, I have come to the conclusion that this clutch system does NOT work on a 2011 KLR 650. I will be asking for a refund. Buyer beware.
B000C59LAS|4|I put these onto my '97 Ranger which still had the original front shocks on it. Front end bounced for days. Removed the old ones, put these on and the ride was much smoother, but they're still a little on the bouncy side. It's probably some worn out springs that are helping with that issue, though.
B000JFHNQA|5|This is all you need to jumpstart any car. I have used it nearly 10 times on different cars on a single charge. The portability is what makes this a must have. Recently it was used on a mall parking lot where there were so many cars close to the SUV that needed the  jumpstart, it wasn't possible using jumpstart cables as the length didn't reach. Used this portable bad boy and within 30 seconds, lady's  SUV was up and running. Think I had this for a year now, and after almost 10 cars with no recharge the booster pac finally needs to be charged.
B00HZ47M7S|5|A GREAT PRODCT, MUCH MORE THAN WHAT I EXPECTED. THE PRICE WAS ALSO VERY REASONABLE. IT IS AN EXCELLENT RODUCT IN EVERY WAY!! THANKS
B00BFUJ4T2|4|So far so good. I applied it 3 weeks ago and it still look great. The tires don't look wet, but they look fresh with a slight sheen which is what I wanted. The interior plastic has a nice shine and no stickiness like the Armorall I've used in the past.
B001EK7YU4|5|I am not a professional by any means, that being said. I  Bought this gun for one purpose (hydrographics) but have used it for many more. has the broadest range of spray i have ever seen. the fan is literally about 13-15 inches. and it really atomizes well. makes painting very easy. I cannot see why you would need anything more, works great IMHO
B00O1QUUKY|5|would buy again..thank you
B00FNG9UR0|5|Perfect size.  What's not to like/  LOVE IT.
B00GBRG4TC|5|As good as the OEMs
B00E6A9LZU|5|Fab gift even for non-Futurama fans!
B009B5ROYU|4|Be aware these plugs state you should not adjust the gap.  I didn't know that prior to buying but went ahead and adjusted anyway.  Got 6k miles on them and so far so good.
B000GU5JEG|3|I like this thing. Just added the platforms from pegs, and the stock pedal was a little to small. I had it over 3 months now. I think it's way to expensive for what it is, but it's the only thing that I found to fit my bike. For a while it used to keep rotate, but now it stopped.
B009IUL2FK|2|Beautiful knob, but Sadly didn't fit.
B000GS0CI6|5|It was delivered in perfect condition, and is exactly what was needed. Which is great because UFO is not actually *making* these any more for our KDX-250.
B00JQFVSM4|5|Well made jacket, feels like it was custom made for myself.<br />Quality stitching, good zipper, nice fit, excellent inside and outside pockets.<br />A value at the price paid.<br />Have received compliments from others.<br />I love it!
B00650NY6G|5|I bought it and easily installed it myself on my four door car after viewing the short video. It looked great and went on without difficulty. Thus, I plan on purchasing enough more for my four door SUV.
B007Z8VG30|5|Perfect and a excellent sticker
B0002UEN1U|5|Excellent seal. Just replaced my intake and rocker cover gaskets on my Navigator. Perfect seal and great results
B000A0O27C|5|It was what was I expected. It fit well,with room to spare, and it represents our country's flag nicely. I feel much better knowing the Florida sun isn't going to dry out my spare tire prematurely.
B000JFNAMQ|5|Very good scales! These are worth the cost and also worth a 10 star review rating.
B005OUWZAE|4|Thermostat was great, top notch part.  However they do not mention in the description that an O-ring is needed when installing a new thermostat.  The one you need is here:  [[ASIN:B00AWI2670 ACDelco 15-34584 GM Original Equipment Engine Coolant Outlet O-Ring]]  or search for:<br />GM Part Number : 25189205<br />Or AC Delco Part Number:  15-34584<br />Or FelPro Part Number: 35458<br /><br />Would be great if they came as a set like many aftermarket ones do.
B00CFCHSZG|1|I have only used these a short while and they have fuzz all over. Don't recommend.
B001R4JHRA|5|Simple to install and easy to use.  I ride my bike in the mornings before heading in to work and have to leave my truck parked in an otherwise accessible parking garage.  So, having some secure way of securing my bike in the bed of my truck was something I needed.  This little gem is perfect for that.
B005O0QQ1S|5|Great!
B00AQAQI6E|5|Works great
B00KL3ALGO|5|I didn't think this could be that good but it really is! Keeps my daughter comfortable she no longer complains about the sun being in her eyes, even though it doesn't cover the full window. It sticks to the window so a breeze to take off and on. Excellent product highly recommend.
B00ROC106U|1|Broke in a first use! I put it in and as soon as I pulled down the window it came off and almost hit my husband'eye! I really wanted this to work but I am very disappointed.
B001G7SU6M|4|The antenna fits perfect for my 2001 Toyota 4Runner limited. However, if you are just getting the antenna, you will need to find an antenna nut separately, at least I did, from Toyota. However, if you have the nut, you should be fine.<br />What's important to note is while installing the mast, there is a cyndrical part of the mast with the black plastic circle on top. When installing the mast, put it in first then screw the nut on top of the cyndrical part so it doesn't keep falling off.<br />Another important thing to note is that my old antenna, the one original to the car, got nearly every radio station loud and clear. With this replacement, it does not catch as many or sounds grainy in certain areas while listening, but is still a fairly decent replacement.
B008MISB2Q|5|Shifting seems to be perfect.
B00DT42U8O|1|Sounds like s***
B00LBPPMSS|4|Makes a rattle nose when i hit bumps but all in all good product.
B007K1Z0U2|5|These fit very snugly, I really liked that they came with their own screws, and the bulbs were a nice tight fit which means it won't leak like my old ones. I'm very happy with these.
B00CNY82FQ|5|looks really good.
B00KIXSXWQ|4|I have used it 3 times it workes great
B00495UQT2|5|fit in the space available, wiring plugged right in, works, simple solution
B006FNKYJI|5|Easy install, keeps transmission cooler.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Awesome light pods for the price! I strongly recommend them.
B00DSR4A8A|5|Bought these for my daughter's birthday. She LOVES<br />them!! The mats completed the &#34;pink-out&#34; of her car interior. That they help<br />fund breast cancer research makes them EXTRA GREAT :))
B000MS5T42|2|After two months of use on the tractor zerks, what began as a somewhat handy right angle connector became a leaky unit that tended to unscrew at the tip. OK, it went back together the first few times, but it appears to have only two and a half threaded rotations to hold it on. I inadvertently unscrewed it one turn too many, resulting in the jaws to fall out, together with two flimsy bits of a foil-like material. Re-assembled together again, minus one of those bits, it allowed too much grease to extrude at the zerk, even when tightened fully. I think it would work only if one scrupulously avoids loosening the terminal tip too much, but it should not be so easily detached at the right-angle base. Once the jaws come out, that bit of foil loses integrity, and re-assembly is futile. I can continue using the original fitting on the Lincoln pistol-grip grease gun, but I won't be re-ordering this coupler.
B000VKTULY|5|Most people have no idea that there's a cabin air filter in their cars. And the reason is it's so difficult to find where it is and how to access it to replace.<br />For my Toyota RAV4, the access panel is behind the glove compartment. It's kind of a pain to take out the glove compartment and to get back there to replace this filter. But you should see how much junk has accumulated on the old filter that's been in there for 10 years.<br />If you know how to replace your filter, you should definitely do it. They say every 6 months, but I think once every 3 years should be fine.
B003CIVAH4|5|FABULOUS
B00DLZSAAI|5|These lights are awesome. As a firefighter I depend on lights to be there in the event of an emergency. For the price I was unsure of quality but I figured for 30 bucks worst case I could throw them on my lawn mower. I have had these lights on the rig for over a month now, in that month they have experienced high volume of moisture, long service hours, rocks and gravel from the dirt roads, and multiple hits. They have yet to let me down. Very impressed with the price and quality. Not to mention how bright they are. I will continue to put kawell LEDs in service!
B007M0ZCHW|5|Very good product
B00LNDKXF0|5|Exact replacement for a broken tail light.  Very Happy with this one.
B002CXIC3U|4|at this moment it works fine.
B00WUOC2CI|5|Purchased for my 2014 Frontier Crew Cab and they fit perfectly.  Look nice too.  Minor issues installing...the brackets were marked wrong.  Brackets have tape on them, marked RB and LB for right brackets and left brackets...but once I read the directions I saw the brackets were wrong, no biggie just read the directions carefully.  Other issue was the big flat washers...when installing the boards on the brackets I had to use my bench grinder to machine down one side of the washer because it was a little too close to the bracket to allow the screws to go in straight...so if you buy these, keep an eye on these things.  Wasn't a huge deal...but they look great...aren't too bulky and they don't weigh alot either. Plus...they will help protect the bottom of your doors from most stones, cinders and salt in the winter.  Hope this helps.  I asked a few questions on here before purchasing for $153.33 on ebay...no one answered a single question...it helps more than you might think to get/give some feedback.
B0040CX36M|4|Fit perfectly on my 2001 Chrysler Town and Country and a great bargain. I would've given this five stars except the fact that cone side and the plastic nail side come fastened together. I couldn't figure out how to take them apart but wound up putting the clip in the door and using a plastic fastener removal tool to remove the other side. Would be a lot more convenient if they came separated.
B0002JMPRK|5|Love this spray adhesive for everything!
B000F194YC|5|Love this. Makes the care look so clean and sharp. It was easy to order and install. Came when it was suppose. Good deal. Met my expectations
B000BZI4JI|5|Fits 2004 ford explorer 4.0l downstream without a problem.I didn't realize I needed 2 until I had already started.
B009IKIB72|5|Quality looks good! (used to weld- a lifetime ago)  It fit perfectly! (&#34;some&#34; -very little- persuasion is required) It sucks when you &#34;do not&#34; have a lift, and &#34;do&#34; have a wife that does not know what a ratchet wrench is. (just kidding honey-thanks for your help!) could not be happier with it so far. Sounds great. And thanks to james for the info! Amazon said it would arrive at 8 p.m. on Monday-they were wrong, it arrived at 4 p.m. ;)
B0002JN2EU|5|Seafoam made me a believer! First off I was guilty of neglecting my car for many many months as I had not changed my oil for at least 12,000 miles if not more. Then that early morning in January it was a record low of -7 degrees. I started my car and it was not the same ever since. The car was running rough and at one point after a red light turned green I pulled away and I blew out so much smoke that it was like the game spy hunter. Right then i knew my car was not well. I drove it right in and changed my oil, the guy who changed my oil said you have to change it a lot sooner there was a lot sludge. Preying that I didn't kill my engine the car ran ok but was spewing smoke on start ups after long drives and was burning about a quart a month. I replaced the PCV valve that was caked in sludge and the car ran alot better but it still spewed smoke after long drives. Did  another oil change 3 months later and it seemed to run fine. But every time I drove my car longer than an hr the next time I started it up it blew smoke. I know you're all thinking lifters are gone or valves seals need to be replaced well that is $3500.00 I didn't have. So to make a long story short I stumbled upon  seafoam during many trips to autozone to pick up oil that i was burning. So I read a lot reviews about it and a lot of the negative ones scared me. But there was not one negative review that said it damaged their car. Only reviews that said they would never put that snake oil in their engine. Well, I had nothing to lose read the instructions and put the amount per oz/qt mix into the crank case. Ran the car for about 100 miles over 2 days in 90 plus degrees. During those 2 days while seafoam was in my crankcase my engine ran perfectly no more oil loss. It ran like it was brand new it had instant throttle response. I changed the oil after that which was black and in the past month the car is 100% normal. Seafoam saved my car and my ass. If you have bad throttle repsonse, oil loss ( that is not from leaks) noisy lifters/valves give it a shot. What do you have to lose? It's not going to kill your engine. Do it before your next oil change and see the results!from leaks) noisy lifters/valves give it a shot. What do you have to lose? It's not going to kill your engine. Do it before your next oil change and see the results!
B001O0HOK4|2|Not the same size as the oem lug nuts
B005BNG1U4|1|The Velcro flap snags your shirt, so I had to flip it around and Jeep logo doesn't show, I bought this because I wanted to show Jeep logo, not happy with product.
B00X69NSM4|2|Quality of the decal wasn't good. Decal would not conform to tanks slight curve. Decal edge was uneven as if it was cut by hand. Not impressed.
B004D60YBC|5|I like it
B005F2WG3C|5|02 Tahoe rear passenger door regulator. Window stopped responding, replaced in 1 hour ..we happy again. Will buy Dorman again if/when needed.
B00KWGKTRG|5|Great item also great seller. It was a perfect fit for my 2007 VW Jetta 2.5
B00J48C9G2|3|god
B004XACFK6|4|Looks great
B00J35C0PG|5|very happy
B0038DD9AY|3|ThIs orange is lighter than my Kubota. Looks Ok but does not match.
B00FB3GDXE|5|Look great on my car!
B00NY0S2OY|2|It wasn't quite big enough, the bike was bigger than I thought. When it came in, it did have a rip in the cover, so it was useless.
B001G4Z5J0|5|YEEHAW!!!!  Yes, it does what you want it to do: It makes you have enough room for that additional camping gear that you got. And the bigger cooler.  And some other stuff beyond that.<br /><br />It's well made, not too heavy, and the finish seems durable.  It is huge, so don't forget you need to have a place to store it.
B0026JAKCQ|4|Got this to replace a worn out one. It lasted about 2 years. Easy fit , easy removal, stays put.  Just fades in the sun after 2 years.
B00AV9EBIM|5|comes as advertised
B006B28QUC|4|Have put EBC HHs on a couple of my bikes, at least as good as stock for Triumph Tiger 800
B000GVHCDG|5|Header was easy to intall, looks great and performs even better!!! I wraped mine in header wrap, as i do with all my race quads.
B000CRGVTK|5|Direct replacement for the mount on my 2000 Maxima SE. I had the car on ramps and it took me about 50 minutes to replace this mount. I would recommend you loosen the power steering reservoir and the power steering line clamp to get better access to the nut of the actual mounting bolt. There is enough of an angle to make it hard to get a box end wrench with those in the way. It looks smaller than the factory one I took out, but it works great.
B000C8TBK0|5|I purchased this for a different reason than normal. It can be used to clean the drains on your sunroof. This cable is just the right size and stiffness to do the job. It is flexible enough to get through the entire drain without kinking. I use it periodically to clean the drains to prevent any backups. The cable works perfectly for this.<br />I did not use this as a cable for my speedometer, but it appears to be good quality and should suffice for that also.
B00335R2UK|5|Perfect fit, think it looks better then the one Toyota sells. Bought this to replace the broken one that came off the truck I'd say it looks a bit more aggressive with out standing out.
B008JQM3RA|3|OEM replacement works well
B001QF5RHE|5|Works well and easy to install.
B008Y2CHPM|5|As described.
B005R4L2P6|5|Fits exactly. Looks good. You get the pair cheaper then buying one replacement original taillight cover and they make your vehicle look more custom.
B002UJVNFA|2|Gets two stars because of price. I purchased these to ride a motorcycle. They DO NOT do a good job of keeping the wind out of your eyes.
B006P88TJ0|5|2nd amendment for life
B004UQIUKW|5|Great! I had horrible water spots on my windows and these pads are fantastic!
B00651CLCS|2|Giving 2 stars as it will not be an issue if hit by foliage when off roading as far as height, and I do get in some stations most of the time, BUT my reception is generally atrocious!  In all fairness, I do live in the pines, so radio signals are not necessarily the strongest, but it's not super snug when screwed in, and even in more areas it doesn't pick up much.
B00A5CM9D4|5|I added the extenders in my golf car as the belts were too short to reach.  Now I can remove them to access the engine and, when they are installed I can snap the belt in so much easier.  I did have to grind about 0.020&#34; of the golf car seat belt to make them fit.
B00JU65OP6|5|This visor is one of the best i have ever seen, and it fits my car visor if you put it on the only way it can work. Women<br />loose their mirror and i have to feel my buttons to open the gate and my garage.I don,t mind doing it for the sun stopper.<br />This is the third one i have bought that has the darker shade, others were like looking through plain glass. My friends<br />all have one now.
B00G1B33BU|4|The manual covers I would prefer that it only covered the engine I have, but understand printing cost. So it does the job . Mike<br />.
B00C2M5STC|5|This product is perfect.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Great battery for my TW200! This thing is small and lightweight! Great item!
B0055G8TH0|5|Exact fit on 2009 jetta
B000H2W270|4|I LIKE IT.
B001PB3IC0|5|beautiful, perfect fit.  got it for a '12 ford escape.  now i need the 'trunk' liner to go onsale.
B006W25ZAU|5|Good
B000E4QJX4|5|Works great. Some reviewers said not all directions work but mine works perfectly in all directions.
B00D3298A0|5|These are so rugged and durable, fit great too ! Can't wait to test them out during the winter as they are able to be sprayed off!
B00W8ADB1K|5|I love my car organizer!  It is exactly the size I needed and so are the pockets!  I use it in the front passenger seat to store items I need to have near me.  When I have a passenger, I flip it around to the back and it hangs just above the built in pocket on that seat.  It's perfect!
B001G6RDHA|5|as needed
B0078U91DC|5|Great set for setting up your rear end differential! Has everything you need in one kit for a full rebuild or new gears. Very complete set!
B00DZL2B9O|4|Nothing fancy but nice to have slots for 18 CD.
B003UVCY00|2|It was bright and illuminated things far away. Originally the charge lasted about 20 minutes. Now after 1yr the charge lasts 20seconds. There is no good way to change out the batteries. Waste of money.<br />handle broke off after about 3 months of use.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Nice
B00L8C2OR6|5|Arrived in a timely fashion. Nothing to install. Works well and makes me legal.
B000CHJTR6|4|Easy installation. Works as advertised.
B00XPL88NC|5|Good grief.  Over my life time I have probably owned and used around 50 or more various air pressure gauges.  Over my life time I have probably lost 40 or more of these gauges or loaned them to friends and family and then never seen them again.  I have numerous of those little gauges that look like pens spread over 30 or more states...the highways of our great country are littered by the gauges I have accidently left behind...<br /><br />Anyway....<br /><br />As I have gotten older I have had more and more difficulty reading the numbers of the various gauges I now use.  As I swiftly sink into my dotage my eyes are not what the once were.  I say this lightly here but truth be told, this can be and is a real problem!  Not so with this puppy.  Nice clear, bold numbers are a true blessing.<br /><br />Now I have a number of bicycles, yard tractors and movers and tillers and of course my wife has a care and I have a truck and I have four grandsons who are constantly messing about the place.  I have a lot of tires the need constant monitoring...so many that I actually keep one of those portable air tanks filled here at the place all the time.<br /><br />I tested this gauge against four others I have access to.  This gauge was absolutely spot on as to the pressure measurements.  As with all things there was a very slight difference in readings form one gauge to another but it was far less that one percent difference.  I can live with that.<br /><br />I love the fact that this has an approximately 10 inch rubber hose with a 360 degree swivel. This thing swivels at both the tip that is placed on the tire valve and the end that is attached to the actual gauge.  It also has an independent bleed valve which is indeed quite handy!<br /><br />In the two weeks I have used this thing I have given it an extensive workout...as have the grandsons.  So far it has held up quite well despite the fact that it has gone through some semi-abusive treatment.  This thing appears to be quite well built.  If it should happen to go belly up within the next year or so and I am still alive, I will update this review and let you know.<br /><br />Due to the size of this gauge I feel the chances of my loosing it have been considerably cut and I don't plan to loan it out anytime soon.<br /><br />Supplied by OdyseaCo<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksl built.

B000C9NNAI|5|Nice kit for GM (Corvette C5) everything you need and a high quality filter.
B006W5NVEO|5|Great customer services a+++
B003AG4UW0|1|Didn't even last a year on my car window. Turned brown. :(
B000C1MW8K|5|Been using these for a couple of years now, great products, much better than OEMs.
B00LR0G2YU|1|Handles very loosely
B002Z36SDI|5|This is the second one I've purchased - the first a number of years ago, and unfortunately, the various bits have gone missing.  It was less expensive to purchase a new one than to repurchase the individual bits needed.
B001DH0Q62|5|It was exactly what I needed. Used on my 2011 chevy silverado
B00LSK2VXA|1|Sucks not sticky
B000C9Y0EQ|5|Z .,Z C
B007JMTNZA|5|Received when I expected and works great.
B00Y5HQJIQ|5|Fit my 2008 XB perfectly.  Just unscrew the factory knob and screw this on with a jam nut.  As they stated it is not painted but solid material just like a pool ball.  Looks great and feels great in the hand.
B00GYHU0ZS|4|The scent is refreshing, I like all of their citrus blends.
B009X3U2FS|2|It is real metal. And seems original to trd. Here's my problem, the picture shows a red trd emblem.  I received a black one and it came with the &#34;pro&#34; emblem as well. It cool and all but not at all what I ordered. Somewhat disappointed.
B003RQBKLC|4|Its good one.
B00GORF8G4|5|wife likes it
B00F571CTG|5|Excellent
B005MZXTBU|5|Show your solidarity by placing this on your vehicle. I have friends and family who support me by displaying this ribbon. Hopefully I have been spreading the word that this is a bone fide disease!
B000NCI854|5|Works great, now I can charge my battery.
B004PQDNZ4|5|This one is great. Was a replacement for a previous white one that we had that had faded.
B0009OR94M|5|Excelent product thanks
B00TGPQQTE|2|wrong cost more to return than it cost
B00E6A4K92|5|Good deal nice sticker
B006BE0ZBS|5|works great
B00802F2US|5|Love them!!!👌
B00K0PVAPO|5|works great
B000IYPS78|5|Have done about 10-15k (km) since it was installed and it has been working perfectly. I've slight overheated only once when I hit a heavy jam in almost 40 C and had also the air con fully turned on, but the temperature went back to normal once we got goin.
B004IQLRYK|5|great experience
B00YQFXK3O|5|Works great
B000UJ0VH8|4|Since buying this I've read there were often fires associated with aftermarket fan motors, hope not!!  So far so good.
B0049Z85CW|5|Works as expected. OE Replacement. Does not come with clips as another buyer has posted. Buy the off brand clips and save yourself a ton of money.
B000EORRXK|3|Works as advertised. Each wipe is saturated enough to wipe off interior surfaces. My only gripe with this item is the smell. It's not offending but I don't particularly like it after wiping down surfaces. Smell does dissipate after a while. But overall, a useful item.
B00H4LK0YY|1|So I bought this exhaust because I heard all the great things about Tsudo parts. I opened the package and the muffler said CNT Racing instead of Tsudo, yet everything else was the same. Fast forward to today, and I had the exhaust all bolted up, but the oem flange is completely smaller than the &#34;Tsudo&#34; flange. Fitment was pretty bad considering how my friend bought an ebay catback 2 months ago and it bolted right up for half the price. I would recommend everyone looking at this exhaust to just go with a ebay catback seeing as how much better they fit.
B00480J4JG|4|Fit right in and works as it should. I am happy with this purchase
B00032K4TW|5|Worked perfect for my 2007 Mazda MX-5 Miata. I zip tied this to the lowest row of the grille, then screwed the license plate into the bracket using the supplied screws. No holes in the bumper or grille! It doesn't extend below the lower lip of the vehicle so it won't get bent all kinds of crazy driving around. If it does get bent, I'll have bigger problems than the license plate.
B001AWU6KQ|5|Inexpensive, but very sturdy
B00L1S0JU6|5|I use a separate towel to dry off most of the water, and then use this microfiber cloth to really dry up all the small spots because this leaves no streaks and really polishes the windows too. It does hold a lot of water so you can use it for a while without having to wring it out.
B004PX4YDM|1|This jack is so tiny that it wouldn't even touch a stock truck. Get a bigger jack if you're lifting up a truck.
B008O9DV78|5|Saved my bacon. Took 2 hours to clean daughters black tank.  Couldn't do it without this product and a wand.
B00941UDIA|5|Hrd to find just anywhre...rec'd quickly and just as we liked it.... will buy again
B003BYFTMG|4|Could have been finished and prepped a lot better for the money spent, but good for general use.
B00E94KGBG|4|Very happy with the quality! Good buy and perfect angles!
B00H3TMTIW|5|Works great
B00B26JDY0|5|Excelent
B000RIBDHO|5|Just what I needed.  Works great.
B002E5HMT6|1|Didnt fit like it said it would
B00FWOKKGI|4|Great price! The only complaint I have is the chrome plated backing was peeled. Other that great light, very bright!
B00J3DJSXU|3|Velcro doesn't stick very well. We had to use our own.
B005SXUE4Q|5|Really cool lanyard!
B0053ZIZXQ|1|Not what i expected- I thought i was getting the grill emblem. I did not read the text  i expect.  I was to much in a hurry to get the grill fixed..
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works well for home and shop use.
B00MAQ5TA8|1|Wrong bag size
B00XXLZ5T4|5|The AUTOFIBER Zeroedge Detailing Towel is a great product! I have used them both to clean the inside and outside of my car. It really does work well and makes cleaning super simple. I have also used these towels on my windows in my house. I barely needed to use any cleaning product but just a damp AUTOFIBER Zeroedge Detailing Towel  to clean everything right away. Also the towels are very easy to clean. I just wash them in my washing machine and they are ready to use for another round of cleaning. I received these towels discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am very pleased and would happily recommend to others.
B0049QQWCQ|4|Love it.
B00W6IYUMS|3|not all that great. they do what they're suppose to but you gotta flex em a bit to get em to stick. ive only had them a couple months and they're already peeling off on the back side... you get what you pay for.
B00B9IVRCW|5|Excellent unit.  Its slower than my old unit but this one is rated higher so I'm sure the gearing is different.  I have a 31' Wilderness camper weighi g 5700lbs and it lifts it right up.  It has an led bulb in the front which is switch activated so you have the option to turn on or off. Also the adjustable foot is nice even thouh I use it tucked all the way inside just so I dont ha e to move it up in every time I tow. I will at least have the option to lower on site if need be due to a slope or hole while setting up.
B00VF3IM92|4|Fits the seats perfectly, high quality material.  Great price.  Durable and the pattern is great.  Looks really nice in my 2015 Dodge 4x4.
B00FDQPCR2|4|Ordered two of these and the one didn't work.  Thank you for the replacement one.  It is working well.  My husband is thrilled to have this motion light without having to mess with electrical.  Thanks again for the great product and even more the GREAT service.  Lynne D.
B000COCUF2|5|Love the look, fast shipping.
B00ANJ8W4Y|5|These are a nice upgrade to the OEM part they replaced.
B003S8340E|5|Worked perfect
B00EJFH6YA|2|Good price but I have had installed less than a month and the outside 6 leds on the right side stoped working
B00011KM06|2|Broke while being carried in pocket. Too large w/ flimsy chain attachment. Soldered replacement attachment ring joint. Hope it will stand up better!
B0002JN2EU|5|this stuff is great, but I did find it cheaper at Walmart for around $6.50
B00A1AX1VE|1|This item looks great but works very poorly picking up radio stations....even local stations have lots of static.
B00KN1AD12|3|Clips did not securely fit my car. I had to tie the straps to the handles inside my car.
B002ERGUT2|5|Just what I needed for my Dodge Challenger that is wearing a twin screw.  It eats up belts that are regular.  these HD belts are the BOMB!
B004I4I3FI|5|Works awesome and simple..youtube instructions is way easier to follow.
B000CGP13I|5|Good delivery time. Easy to install.
B00EF3SAJQ|5|Awesome for the price! Threw these on my Chevy Cobalt Coupe and they work perfectly. Like other comments, I suggest gluing the pads to the plastic stands. I bought kayak J racks to attach to this roof rack as well. Sturdy (also with a pair of kayaks up there!) and didn't move at all over the course of a whole weekend with about 5 hours of drive time - including 70mph driving. Buy these if you are looking for something cheap that gets the job done! Looks great, too.
B00QOYA2VI|5|This light fit perfectly in the mount for the stock light assembly. Super bright LED's, wiring was a sinch, looks awesome!
B00FBKW3RC|2|Good product ballast went out in a week.
B0028R1IIG|4|Cute but small
B009PHUHCK|5|Fits 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited.<br /><br />Hyundai does not rate the elantra for towing.  I pulled a 730lb trailer with no problems, not sure if I would go on a long trip but who knows it may be fine to do.
B005O012MQ|2|It did not come with the advertised, on the packing materials, and was difficult to install<br /><br />Also the 9 days to get it to me was poor
B000C32IUK|5|02 Tahoe, lower A/C belt. Remove lower cover from underneath (5 hex bolts using 15mm socket). Be sure to replace BEFORE/DURING upper main belt replacement ..as this one sits in spot behind the main on the main crank pulley. Estimate 1 hour job to replace both belts for novice. Original belt lasted 250K, didn't look too terrible, but replaced anyway. t expect this one to last just as long, but will buy this brand again for what seems like a quiet long lasting belt.
B0088BX0IM|5|very easy to hook up (like 10 min.)  seams to work great!!
B00JJND26I|5|Easy to set up. Quality components. They are worth spending the cash on for time savings.
B000FOL08M|5|I've had several &#34;cheaper&#34; load stabilize bars and they all were &#34;cheaper&#34;, rusted out and ends fell off.  This is, by far,  superior to any I've had.  The only suggestion I would give to not get it too snug before latching as the latch arm will force a lot of pressure against the side walls of the truck bed, especially in a plastic bed liner and can easily bow them out more than one needs.
B00IZFNJ6Y|5|Tested the device on two of my cars, one showed 12.5 v and 200 CCA, the other showed 12.45 v and 200 CCA.  Both are good batteries as I expected.  One battery, which was bought from Walmart, needs adding distilled water once a year, the other is maintenance free as an original 12 v battery in a 08' Toyota Camry Hybrid. Just hook up the clamps to the battery electrodes and see the readings. This is an easy test of battery and inexpensive way to ensure the car won't die unexpectedly.
B0016ZBP1Q|3|Didn't need it, but now have a spare if I ever do!
B001LHVOVK|5|do the work, save some $$$ in auto shop
B00XTXVJF0|5|This light bar is well built and extremely bright! It has a well focused beam pattern, and is indeed water proof. I would recommend this light bar!<br /><br />https://youtu.be/lh4EWTTRWQI<br /><br />This light bar was sent to me for review.
B009B6INCQ|1|hard to install and the rubber came loose on the clutch pedal.
B00B2HHDH8|1|Went through all 4 bulbs in 2 weeks.  These are garbage!!!
B0049MTGSC|5|Just as described, installed unit in 15 minutes.
B000IG1SOI|5|This cover was a total surprise.  It was exceptionally well made.  Although not exactly designed for my seat, it worked out terrific  with some extra work
B0067ECZWO|4|Don't normally buy  anything but Bosch filters for the German cars but found the quality was there.
B00A3N7WGO|4|looks good on mom's car
B0013T7OL0|4|Fits in seat very well. Comfortable and effective.
B000KKLM1Q|5|GREAT  works super for servicing garage doors!  Lubricated and eliminates noisy doors!  Love it!
B001554V7C|5|Loved the color was not to dark but more of a light blue almost clear.
B00CWNVAPW|1|The mirror is good, and is so much better than my stock mirror, but It lasted only for a day, the latches kept coming off. and falls out from the mirror every time I drive :(
B008BSQSNG|4|May need to do a minor readjustment or 2 to get it just right. Don't know about the included template plate, adjusting on the bike worked better for me.
B009FU710S|5|good price for a great product
B00OLVGIDC|5|Just received the mat this week and it fits my 2015 Chevy Colorado extended cab perfectly. The mat is thick, so it is heavy enough that the wind will not pick it up while driving. Great, heavy duty mat.
B000C9SJUC|5|My 2002 Cadillac began getting a gas cap error with the cap being installed tightly. Upon inspection it appeared to be looser than normal between the part that secures into the filler neck and the top part you turn until it clicks............researching the error code revealed that some 90+ percent of respondents said their problem was a faulty gas cap.<br /><br />Bought this, received it the second day via Prime, immediately installed it and problem solved. No more error messages or codes.<br /><br />And the bonus..............HALF the price of a dealer or a box parts house store.
B00K63R2A2|5|Thanks so much
B007FXKU8C|5|Love them!!!
B0015PMZMU|5|Take your time and you'll never fudge a flare. Works perfect. Only used it about 25 times. I will see in 20 yrs, may be the best tool I ever bought. Seriously, cheap decent tool.
B000VAQKBM|5|The Bosch 13377 replaced the OE NTK sensor in my 2002 Honda Accord.  It fit exactly like the OE unit and the car has yet to protest or fuss, so I'm calling it good.  Perfect.
B007CISU6Y|5|As other reviewers have stated... this is a 3-4 hour at home install. However, the slight lift and the levelling combined, do wonders to the look of my 2013 JKU Freedom Edition. The directions are awful, but there are great YouTube videos out there to help you do a great job. Don't forget some 1.5&#34; spacers and you'll love the look and even more love what you spent to do it!!!
B00EC0Z4Z0|5|AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!
B001L299PI|5|Installed on a 2006 Nissan Murano that has experienced some winters and had a nice bit of rust in the weld nuts. Order a tap (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JMB8I) when you order this, a wire brush isn't going to do the trick. I'd never used one before but did some youtube learning and it worked out well. The muffler clearance gave me one heck of a fight to re-thread the weld nuts (i dropped the exhuast entirely, but found i still needed a 6&#34; extension for the tap because the pipes were in the way... probably do not need to drop the exhuast all the way). Easy enough to do by yourself as long as you use your jack to hold the receiver in place while you bolt it in.
B00DR150OA|5|it fit perfect
B003YDY7YK|5|Our Travel Trailer is only 30A but we can draw 31-32A when running the A/C, (2) fridges, icemaker, etc.  This borderline usage won't pop the breakers in our trailer but it almost always pops the breakers at the campgrounds' pedestals, especially if their 30A connector is pretty worn & thus requiring even more amps due to the bad connection...  A bad 30A receptacle's poor connection can ruin your 30A plug.  (I have replaced ours after it overheated from a poor connection at the box)  Using this 50A to 30A pigtail solves those problems when 50A is available.  The campground's 50A receptacles are almost always in much better shape than their worn 30A receptacle providing more reliable power through a better connection.
B007ZJ8254|5|Perfect after 2 months. Great value!
B0055EALW8|5|Gm oem stuff.  Great price
B000E9QF0Q|5|TRIED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME  MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SHINE
B0028UQ1MQ|5|Works very well.
B0028OA9KM|5|great experience
B008KWOHEU|5|A perfect match with the ones that come with the fridge.  I can't tell them apart.
B006A49BWI|5|Delivered quickly.  Always a trusted product.
B001NQF3YI|4|Great product.
B00CEM6HZO|5|easy to install, work great.
B00KSW5UBO|4|Very cool!
B007ZXXSHW|3|This kit fits the car fine BUT the water pump pulley shaft does NOT have the key built in to it.  This makes installing the two pulleys on it an absolute nightmare due to the tight clearance between the water pump and fender.  Instead of struggling for hours trying to get everything to line up properly I went to my local home improvement store and bought 2 M6.0-1.0 bolts and cut the heads off.  That way I could thread each one in by hand, slide the pulleys onto them, install two of the pump bolts, remove the cut off bolts, and then install the remaining two pulley bolts.<br /><br />Why couldn't Gates just include the key on the pump shaft like the OEM one has?  Big oversight in my opinion and worth docking 2 stars since the pump is such a major component of this kit.
B000VXO2L4|5|Very nice compound. Brought out a really nice shine and for this being the first time I have ever done any body work, it turned out very nicely.
B008KP83YM|5|The best for Vogue Tyres
B000066OC7|4|I use it in my car otherwise I wouldn't be able to see where I'm going!
B00JT4XWNU|5|Fit perfectly on my 2011 Prius
B00KISDJKW|5|My husband got these and put them on easily by himself! They look great!
B009BI94PE|2|These do not fit the face well, as the eye cups make hardly any accommodation for the shape of the head. Thus, as you can see from the head-on picture of these on a mannequin, the lens cylinders tend to splay out, and the area of vision for both eyes doesn't overlap very much (e.g. your left eye can only see a little bit to the right of center). The effect is disconcerting.  On my face, they don't seal on the outside edges, either - I can see daylight out at the sides of my vision, which does not bode well for dust or wind resistance.<br /><br />I'm leaving it two stars instead of one because the construction is of reasonable quality, given the design. The lenses appear to be real, thick glass, clipped in by 3 little metal clips each. The strap is rubber. I wouldn't store this where it would get hot.
B00NWFB2LQ|1|Yes everything  was fine
B002H0RK22|5|This is a nice shield and I found the company easy to deal with. Initially they sent me the wrong item. They did a little investigation ad I sent them a pic of what I needed. A couple weeks later I had the right one. It works beautifully.
B000KKXI7W|1|This wire harness is made for 1998 and up general motors cars. It does not fit in a 1991 like  it says it does. Whoever said this was a 1988 wire harness needs to learn to read properly
B000E4NKEK|5|Worked perfect very easy to install
B00823FSRC|5|I used my cart last week for the first few times. It worked very well, and I was able to get my yak from about 300 feet from cabin to lake.<br />The removable wheels are a major plus for transporting (inside of my yak storage compartment. For the price this is an excellent buy.
B00N78K0O8|5|This 12 pin connector worked out pretty good for the purpose I needed it for, it was very easy installing the pins in the sockets
B0006IX87S|1|Used this for the first time and it split in half with water spraying every where! The canister split at the seam. We had it on for only a couple of days.
B000LDR9HI|5|Bought to clean grease /oil off new gun by recommendation of my dealer and works great. Don't use the red CRC for this though.
B011KJFBFS|5|Fit well with a bit of modification to bracket. Works perfectly on my 1985 Vmax. Almost 200 bucks cheaper than OEM pump.
B001AWJWWY|5|Very nice product.
B00GGEKT64|5|Fiebings has been around forever and make great products for leather and horse tack care. This is another one. It is convenient, easy to apply, long lasting, and perfect for keeping shoes protected and looking good. Highly recommended!
B000J9Y1T8|5|Well my first review on these were one star, TPMS sensors could not be activated by major tire place or the TPMS tool I had purchased for this very task. I ordered the round magnet from Schrader, took all of 30 seconds to activate all four sensors and worked flawlessly with my 2004 Corvette. These were installed in new TSW wheels. So if yours don't work make sure to use a powerful magnet to activate them.  The price on these &#60;$40 each is a great deal. The build date on the new sensors was around 1 year old.
B000CFCV50|5|Cardone Select is the best new (not a reman) aftermarket distributor I've installed on Nissan Altimas. Included cap and rotor are substantially higher quality than the ones included with other brands of new aftermarket distributors and virtually identical in design and materials to OEM Hitachi made products. Fit and function identical to OEM. Make sure you have a timing light and a basic understanding of ignition timing before attempting this job.
B003VLBPJA|3|Worked very well. After 5 months of use mine started to snap and elastic deteriorating.
B002FY23CC|5|Quick turnover time and the product matches the description.
B00KPWXSTS|5|Perfect<br />!!
B00DJDYNBC|2|I thought I had a product that was all lubricant, but the can showed it was only 2 of the 4 ounces in the can. There are cheaper and better products out there.
B002XM56MA|3|Not bad for the price but is cheaply made wish they would have mad a flap for the key hole to help from rusting inside but I did use it to replace the ones on my work truck so they will do just fine
B00LND6AF2|3|My f 350 pulls the fifth wheel a little easier, which is nice. The bad part is my fuel mileage has dropped in all categories, the worst is in town empty. I will  use it only when pulling a load.
B00514BRF2|5|Once adjusted are perfect and look sharp.
B0016IJ3Z8|5|This part fits one of the two back blend door actuators in a 2004 Chevy Tahoe Z71. I had cool air in the front and hot air in the back. Not good on a 90+ degree day. This is a very easy install. Google or watch a youtube video on how to install the actuator and reset the control module that operates the blend door actuators. Everything works great! It's an easy DIY project, takes about 15 minutes and will save you some money from going to the repair shop or dealer.
B00HWI6340|4|So I want to be fair to this product and make sure it gets an honest and fair review. I have not see other lamps from other vendors, I may be wrong, but it seems that these lamps themselves are not the best of quality. But that is to be expected for the price you are paying. The bulbs that come with the lamps are very cheap and I don't see them lasting a very long time so I went ahead and bought the bulbs for the lamps here on Amazon. The wirering harness is shielded with the round electrical tubing ( although not all the wires had the tubing around it for protection ) and was not bad at all for only one exception. The length of the wire which carried the plugs to the lamps is just about 4 inches to short. When I ran the wiring It was very tight and could not reach the other lamp without stretching the wire to its limit and still could not reach. I ran the wire in a very straight line too without any curves so it should have reached but didn't. I cut the wires and added on another 6 inches of red and black wire of my own just to be on the safe side. The plug then reached the other lamp without any problem.  Took out one star for this little issue. Besides this, the system works fine. Not sure how much better a more expensive system would have been which was worth $160. For now, I'm happy with it. Now we have to see if the lamps pass the test of time and weather.
B00T1R3XFC|5|Item arrived as expected and was fairly easy to instal. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BK7M09Q|5|GM recommended
B00AF4UABA|5|I searched and waited over a year for the right product to come along. I had an N-Fab pre-runner grille guard and was going to fabricate a winch mount to it, but I wasn't satisfied with the thickness of the steel plate and was concerned I'd exceed the design specs by mounting a winch. For the same price I found this grille guard with an integrated winch plate, correctly positioned right at the frame mounts. I've mounted a pair of Hella 700ff lamps at the point where the support brackets attach to the guard, tying it all together.<br /><br />Great powder-coat finish, rubber cladding over the vertical stanchions, solid and clean welds 360 degrees on all tubing junctions - comparatively and for the price, this can't be beat. With a scarce aftermarket for H3's, this is a must-have. A Smittybilt XRC 9500 lb winch is on the way.
B00SKEDJTW|5|Great price, great product, quick shipping. A can't beat! Yes this is 8! So great I bought 2
B0013REXO8|5|Buen producto.

B008MISDGU|5|Good price for a JASO MA2 and helps my bike shift easier.
B001KQB624|5|All metal, solid, and installation was not very difficult on my 2007 Ford Ranger XLT. Just pull up a YouTube video about replacing the tailgate handle if you don't know how. One tip for those who have similar models to my 2007: accessing the tailgate handle internal components will require a star / torx screwdriver to access it. Luckily I had someone to lend me one, but I've since ordered a kit of them.
B001DRP9G4|3|It's average quality. There are better fleece filters for the cost.
B00N0GLT6A|1|This filter (Fram CA11477) is listed on 3 different web sites (Amazon included) as fitting a 2015 Honda Accord Sport. It does not. The Fram CA 11476 (that is listed as fitting the 2014 Honda Accord Sport) does fit the 2015. Did something change mid-model year, etc.??
B000CO86BY|5|Well designed, work as expected.<br /><br />Worked perfectly on my F-150
B000C5CEKC|5|Great gas cap, it can be a little tricky unlocking and locking the cap
B00Y13GYIY|5|No more rattling noise...the chain was bad so This product fits my 2003 Nissan Murano ... Very well and No problems
B00OOGP5I8|4|Very cute, gave it as a present.
B00VR6ZXAS|5|Nice thin chrome look frame. Works great.
B00NPKEOZY|3|The side window shades are a bit smaller than expected, but probably as advertised.  The only real annoyance is the suction cups for the side window shades, they fall off very easily and have caused me to crawl under the car to retrieve.  Otherwise the materials are very similar to shades I have purchased in the past.
B003PJKBES|4|I don't have a problem with the hitch itself.  It appears to be a good product.  The installation is a breeze - or SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  They shipped 6 metric bolts with this hitch.  This model, 12245, is the hitch that is supposed to fit a 2010 Jeep Liberty.  The hitch fits, but the bolts shipped with the unit fit only the drivers side front bolt.  The other 5 bolt holes require standard bolts - not metric.  I had to make several trips to the local hardware store (Parkrose Hardware which really rocks because they hire old timers who are retired mechanics and plumbers, etc. who really know their business!) to finally come up with the correct bolt which if I remember correctly, was a 7/16 coarse.
B0036GNSGS|3|Alarm doesn't seem to function anymore for me but the lock is great. Easy to put on and keeps the bike secure.
B0016KFWH4|5|Just as advertised.
B001S82W4U|4|Did what it was supposed to.
B00NICU90S|5|Excellent
B004AQZDEI|5|It was the right shims for my omc 800 mechanical shift.
B00O042A46|1|FILTER IS THE WRONG SIZE FOR 2015 GENESIS SEDAN 3.8. FILTER IS TO LONG.PLEASE CONTACK K&N FILTER CORP OF THIS MISTAKE. ITEM SHOULD BE REMOVED FORM WEB SITE THANK YOU MR CHALLENGER
B007KPR5QA|2|Did not work for me.
B004IYVJOA|3|they work fine
B00W3TNHGU|2|Arrived quickly and looked good.  Needed to beat old one out with hammer and chisel.  Tried to press new on in with hydraulic press, but could not get in all the way even though I bent the 3/8 inch plate steel backing.  Better to buy an entire new unit--I don't see how anyone could successfully replace this unit.
B004FSHQ50|5|Pretty happy with them, couldn't find JDM ones for a decent price I have taken them out and in, no Problems but I am careful. Clean look and come with amber bulbs
B005T87UTC|4|Recommended
B00MXBIGQO|5|Great fit for my 2014 Volt for the price.
B00KVX5O3E|5|Perfect! I ordered one before but it didn't have any markings on it (F/L) etc. This one did.
B004KEKAY8|5|Look good on my car. Only I wish they were aluminum.
B00L7XBABC|3|U gota reverse the wires then only 1 break light works or turn signal choose which ud rather have work
B001T9ZENO|1|very poor quality hardware and craftsmanship! Rivets pulled out when i tried to open it thefirstime
B005FW39EM|5|WoW!! these lights are just as described...even better. They were very easy to install and they add a custom look to the backend. But, it does so in a very classy way. They add just the right amount of PoP  and does not take away from the car at all. I am very happy with this purchase and so far have not had any problems. Nice!!
B00AWNVKTK|5|good
B006H34AE6|5|Works great for my Jeep interior.
B007USCM7E|1|Did not work for my car??? why did you sell this to my car if it don't fit????
B00NLVOLIW|5|I love it, the material soft fits my 2006 997 911 carrera convert. Triple black, the covers Black and that's  a big reason I bought it, it hides it in the open when people stare in my garage.
B00008PWWJ|5|Delivered on time and was as expected
B0060NKA1U|4|Real nice look, custom fitting, quick installation, works great! Only problem was i had to change my oil line fittings , other than that great product!
B000CIV71Q|5|As described.
B00KJ182X2|5|Extremely bright
B000E2CVIS|5|Perfect fit.  Fast shipping.
B00IAGN4UY|5|***fit***, TOYOTA RAV 4 SPORT, good deal,
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works as expected. Easy and inexpensive way to get a USB port if you already have the battery tender lead wired. Definitely recommend!
B0093F47LQ|5|I bought and returned four sunshades locally and online, including my favorite the collapsing two shade type. I bought the largest one I could find in store and found it would slide down and fall. The design of the newer models of the Hyundai Elantra have a much larger and very slanted front window. This is the case with many of the newer designed small and midsize cars. This is my third Elantra all of different generations.<br />This sunshade fits the window perfectly with an inch folding over on each side. It is very thick and insulating, in the Texas heat it has worked well keeping my new car cooler than the surface of the sun.<br />However it is a little bit of a pain to close up, you roll this thing as tight as possible (but honestly it doesn't have to be too tight) and then thrown in your backseat. It isn't designed to fold, the Velcro strap is designed to wrap around the roll. I wish it would fold like traditional sun shades so I could fit it between the seats.
B00ZPBQEZE|3|Not sure how long set wuill last under normal use. I used one of the small pry items on soft rubber, found the edge of the pry peice slightly marred already.<br />Time will tell.<br />But delivery great.
B007REFW32|5|the best decal to complement the apple. Well made.
B0002SA22Q|5|Worked well no problems, 5 minute install
B001D228G8|5|You might not think you need to replace your cabin filter until you take your old one out.
B000W0KTMW|5|So far, works without any problem. My bike is my primary transport & this is my only way to lock it. Don't know what to do whit the silly little cable that came with it though, way too short be have worked on anything Ive owned.
B00YE5Q132|5|Note: The maker supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the product is my own personal view<br /><br />The model I looked at is the larger capacity 16500mAh/600A version this is capable of staring larger engines (a handy guide to approx starting power required for engine sizes is on one side of the case central divider) In this kit you get a nylon reinforced zip case with hand strap which includes:<br /><br />- The power bank rated to 16500mAh<br />- Jump start clamps (insulated the jaws have a no contact casing around them)<br />- Micro USB lead for charging phones/tablets etc<br />- Lead for plugging in the &#34;8&#34; supplied laptop/power connectors<br />- Home power 3 pin charger/adapter and a car charger<br /><br />To &#34;jump start&#34; a car open the rubber flap and just plug in the jump leads (fool proof design you can't reverse polarity on the power bank) It can do this via capacitors that are built into the unit to store the required current (like a flashgun) power it on and connect the leads to the battery terminals. The Front panel has a fast charge 2.1 amp USB output you can either plug in the supplied micro USB cable or use your own (Apple etc). On the left front the output port for powering laptops here you plug the single lead in and pick the required adapter plug: press the &#34;power button&#34; quickly to select the voltage for this output 12/16/19 volts as a safety feature the voltage can't be change with a lead plugged in to avoid damage to a device.<br /><br />Next to the power button are 4 LED's to indicate the charging status/capacity of the battery. A single input for the 2 chargers is provided, this will take overnight to charge via the 15 volts wall adapter (from flat) but you can easily top up the battery as required. Front has a white LED torch this is quite bright and more than enough output to see clearly with 3 modes here each selected by long pressing the &#34;power button&#34; for a few seconds a continuous torch, SOS flashing and a continuous flashing mode. There is a larger red panel on the top to start the flashing mode on this a quick double press.<br /><br />A few reasons these &#34;jump start&#34; power banks are becoming quite popular – you can toss the jump leads out once you have this it's far easier and more convenient to connect this to start a car/van then messing around trying to drive up close enough to get a connection with the traditional leads. Secondly this also doubles as a portable &#34;power bank&#34; capable of charging phones, tablets and even laptops thanks to a connector and tips which are also included. At 16500mAh this requires a fairly long charge overnight (around 13 hours if not a bit more) but you can top it up at any time.<br /><br />Areas I liked: The supplied case makes it easier to put all the leads and cables back in compared to a hard shell plastic ones some come with (small point here) Rubber feet are on the bottom of the battery case helping it grip a surface the build feels quite good for day to day use I can't see it being a problem (I do like the shock proof casings on power banks and it would suit this product well).<br /><br />Could be improved: Instructions are passable but could benefit from a few more diagrams and a bit of translation work it's not hard to operate this but the manual could be a little better. The micro USB cable is handy to have but I prefer the “4 in 1” connector that has the mini/micro/apple connectors.<br /><br />In conclusions minor points aside this is a very useful starter/power bank which as a package makes it's a must have for most motorists. Not only can you get rid of the jump leads you have an emergency light/hazard warning and if you're caught out for juice on a phone/tablet/laptop you have that covered too. A strong recommendation for this one particularly if you need the extra power capacity for larger vehicles.SOS flashing and a continuous flashing mode.

B005VFWOOE|5|Great!
B002J8379C|5|great product
B00EUIDPLO|4|Like this one.
B00K65MN0Y|5|Works as described.<br />Thanks
B000EQP2TY|5|35 years ago when employed in the auto repair trade I paid more for German made brake drums .  I was surprised to open box and find German brake drums!
B00DGVRXD2|3|\\"This is a FYI only\\"  -3 stars based on possible confusion in item title only-  Please read the products website. The white is for water, black for fuel. Maybe they are identical in every way, shape and form (I didn't order from Amazon due to the shady description) but due your research first. Not sure why the title reads black or white??  Also the small screen is a flame arrestor on the black model and a filter screen for the white. Again, maybe the exact same part..  I just want to clear up some reviews stated that the item was not listed for fuel use. According to the manufacturers website, they are different. (the p/n's are different also)  [...]
B00DC6MRIM|3|Cable broke within 90 days, Manufacturer willingly and quickly sent me a replacement.  Cable was difficult to install actually, not sure if I'd buy again.  The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the seller was so great to work with.
B007WICLXM|4|Cuts the gare, catches the dust, looks good.  Installation was a snap.
B003KXGU4E|5|[[VIDEOID:71b1bd78688eb1b0727dcee9bf15413c]]Just got it and it looks absolutely stunning. I'm rocking this here in Phx lol Just so you know, haven't drove it yet. \\"Like\\" my comment if it does looks nice my first attempt of putting decals on a vehicle. It seems like a bit off to me...
B00R26RCVK|1|The headrest attachment only works if your headrests go straight across. The headrests on my car fit into an indentation on top of my seats so that the attachment is too long to fit correctly. A simply elastic strap (versus the plastic attachment) would allow the cover to fit any car.
B00BAZCVDS|4|great color, bought the 55W and they are bright, I can even see them when my HID headlights are on.  One went out about 2 months after install, I contacted the company and they sent a replacement out. I only had to cover shipping cost. For the money, these are the best I could find.
B0041MGDLI|5|fits great and the annoying whinning is gone would by products from them again
B00P5YN60C|1|They are nice but they didnt fit my golf alloy wheels so be warned.
B0050D7G3Q|5|Perfect fit, my first time doing brakes on a motorcycle, fair,y simple with the help of you tube
B000O0HXXS|5|Exact fit everything is back to normal make sure it is the one you need though similar to 4.6 liter cable but they're not the same
B00433SIQI|5|Great seller, would use again!
B00DCCCNOO|5|Works great, I have broken two so they are not very ruggedly made but I am rough on them. After you start to use it you will not go back to the old fashioned way that is for sure. A+ even with the short lifespan if dropped. Do not drop it and you will love it!
B0006MRQRM|5|Great product!
B004SNJPV0|5|It was a perfect fit
B0066RUGGE|2|The diameter of this was not ideal for an install in my 1998 S70 volvo  but with some minor modifications it fit quite nicely in the rubbish bin.<br />Going with IPD-USA poly parts in future.
B00390TJX2|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B0089LTFF8|5|Perfect fit.
B00N3VGPYS|5|great!!
B00FSCBAMW|3|Had to modify the bracket by bending it quite a bit in order for the sensor to be in the correct position. Other than that, it worked.
B00L2M73TQ|4|Everything arrived just fine. Everything is as advertised.
B00AKFKIOS|5|Came complete and worked perfectly
B00LCNXBNM|3|This helmet is a little to heavy for my liking. While welding the filter does not change quickly. I would not recommend this helmet.
B00UAEQX4I|4|worked well.
B0085IJXCU|5|nice
B003676LXE|5|B  BNM
B000V9ATEW|5|Exactly what I needed at a decent price. Quality item.
B00JAFR1SA|4|Very thin, but will probably serve its purpose.
B00YE5Q182|5|A bit skeptical at first about having a battery that can start a car ... but that feeling soon dissipated.<br /><br />I am impressed with this battery:<br />- It comes with a cable to start the car, another micro USB to charge your devices (telephones, GPS, tablet ...), a cable for recharging the battery and one for the cigarette lighter.<br />- Very easy to use.<br />- It really allows starting a car: I have an old car a bit erratic and I tested the battery to see if it would arrive at the start ... After reading the instructions (! French), simply connect the cable to the battery and then pinching the marks of his car battery. We light the battery then starts his car until you hear his little motor purring!<br />Ultra easy!<br />- Function lamp may seem gadget but can be very useful if you fall down the night. Strong lighting. 3 lighting modes: continuous, intermittent or strobed.<br /><br />During the first use, it takes 4 hours of charging.<br />There are 4 bright blue lights on the box that indicates the charge: as and as you use the battery, it discharges and small lights off to show you it's time to recharge.<br /><br />The storage bag is rigid and protects the battery and all cables.<br />I am very happy to finally have this battery because having a capricious car, I'll be more relaxed for this winter when starting the car.<br />A permanently have in his car!
B00CBKOP7G|5|Deleted the cats in my gtr and haven't gotten codes while using these. If a gtr won't pop codes every car should be golden!
B0065FRBZ6|4|Love this bag on the handlebars of my Harley Davidson Sportster XL883L. It fits tools, rags, extra sunglasses, etc..
B002672U7G|1|should have read the reviews
B003YJJHI0|1|Product started leaking pretty soon after I installed it.  It leaks where the brass unit spins.
B000BYGCXY|5|Truck is purring like a lion again.
B0050D1G1Y|4|I only wish the chain was a bit more decorative. And I can only hope that should the need ever occur, EMTs will see this pendant and will abide by my wishes.
B00D3941HS|5|Received in two days was told 5-7 installation was a little awkward but went Okay, very satisfied with the product...  We'll see how long it last !
B009S954J6|5|Perfect fit love them...
B0007XU4EC|1|Wrong product. Reordered it. Wrong product again
B00CEXKA88|1|I have 150
B00VNJ4BI4|2|I bought this for my 2007 Chevy Cobalt because it stated that it would fit however it does NOT. Now I have to ride without an antenna because I ruined my old one. DO NOT BUY!   UPDATE: i contacted the seller and they handled it very good and quick. It earned them another star however the product is still bad.
B000C5I49C|5|Fixed my leaky valve cover. The original seals looked fine but I always had a little oil on top. These did the trick
B002PQUBQ0|5|perfect fit
B001TFE38A|5|So far I am in love with this sealant. Very easy to apply and last forever. GREAT! product
B00067BXGC|5|What can I say? It is a replacement cover for the one I busted. It fits and is PIAA authentic.
B000TYQB14|5|Great
B00JNEAQIA|5|These lug nuts seem to be of high quality, and the finish is excellent. Could not be happier. As good as nuts costing twice as much.
B0087NB23Q|5|Good stuff!!!
B001AY2WLU|5|Cute, well made device.  Functional fun!
B002300LOU|5|Just installed it and it seems to work very good and easy to install.
B004SJS8XU|5|Great Price. Exactly what I was looking for.
B0036BNBS8|5|Fits perfectly... Looks identical great hubcap..
B005BNP7UO|5|I am very pleased with this product.
B000IYIWAI|5|fits and works great 06 Mazda Tribute
B00065JM8U|1|Decent construction and air flow but really loud. If its running I can't hear my generator. Worst of all the metal blades &#34;ring&#34; adding another layer to the noise.
B00VUFRAZC|1|.<br /><br />This only lasted two-weeks before it started to come apart and leave dust and debris all over the dash and seats.<br /><br />I hope its not asbestos.
B00JE4BIPO|5|Item was exactly as shown....Great for a motorcycle lover!
B00H7QZSOS|3|Took the old plastic silver one off, This is nice since it is made out of stronger material, however it doesn't match up perfectly and needs some super glue to hold it in position.
B008SOQOLE|5|Looks nice on the whip
B000JV4XEO|5|Awesome  !
B002V0CM3K|2|Before installation I noticed tool marks on the inner tie rod ends and minor damage to the threads. I then decided to remove the boots and inspect the tie rods. I found that this company DOES NOT use new inner tie rod ends!  They use re-manufactured tie rods. On top of that, they were poorly staked too the rack shaft.  I also found the hydraulic lines to be corroded, with stripped fittings, crushed o-rings, and simply painted over with cheap black paint. At this point I decided to return the unit but heard NOTHING back from ARC.  Being stuck with the unit I decided to get rid of the inner tie rod ends in favor of a nice set from Proforged.  And for the hydraulic lines, I reused the lines from my OEM rack and pinion which were corrosion free. I also replaced the o-rings with quality Viton.  So far after 500 miles this rack and pinion unit is leak free and provides proper steering feedback with no play.  If the unit holds up with no internal seal leaks, I will change my rating to three stars.  But know this rack is cheap for a reason.
B00RJKB2FQ|5|Work very well. I mounted one on either side and carry 2 tires. Where I fish there is about 40 miles of gravel roads, and I feel a lot safer that way.
B00IPS4APU|5|I heard mixed reviews for this product, but it works beautifully. It filled in a chip and it's not very noticeable, however I would only use it if your insurance won't pay for it.
B00CL6J818|3|1st off they came all bunched up so the sticky strip did not stay. then when i got them hooked up they were yellow not orange. but thry are birght. good for the money you spend
B001R5U7AU|5|Just what I needed for my supercharger on my Dodge Challenger.  I bought a few for spares!
B000GD5FMY|5|Fit is great and keeps wind out of eyes. I can now ride all day with my full face shield up for more ventilation. I also like that the lens are non-polarized so I don't get distortion when looking through the face shield. I thought the foam lining would make these hot, I have had no problems with fogging or heat.  Tint is not too dark where it would make everything look gloomy.
B00LEBLI82|4|very good
B001SIFQN4|3|Doesn't have that white lining stitches as shown in picture thou
B001BDSRTG|5|I can tell the difference in throttle and engine torque. the instructions were terrible, but installing the CAI  was easy.  I am buying the  ram scoop.
B000CSIODK|5|GOOD DEAL
B005JWCPUC|5|Cute it fit my Civic just right! Love the fast delivery! !!
B000CS9Q5K|4|Button sticks but it does the job
B0016I7MPQ|4|Very good product, thanks
B00AM3HD0K|5|Fit perfectly on my car thank you very much
B00P73KWE4|4|I had no issues with the unit. It has been attached to my atv without issue.
B000P6EH1W|3|Not bad -- but loose and thus, noisy, on the both inner and outer sides.  At least it's cheap...
B002JUEGT0|5|I keep all my batteries up with one of these.  So far one of them has gone for 10 years.
B00SLKS8WI|5|Great product easy to install on my 3500 .
B00BLKXW9O|5|I have a 2002 Volvo V70XC. I did not want to pay the ridiculously high price for the Volvo transmission fluid. I researched fluids and found several people on Volvo forums recommending the 3309 fluid. I have used it for approx. 10,000 miles without a problem.
B00533Y5FA|5|Nice sticker
B003175ARM|5|I love this setup. Had trouble getting the tach to work right on my old BMW. finally hooked a 10,000 ohm resistor in series with the tach wire to the coil negative terminal.
B000E35W1K|3|It would have been nice to have directions on how to operate this tool
B00DSD53EO|5|It's awesome! I put it on my computer and it's still there. Plus it's like and he's cute as a button!
B00192JGDU|4|Not an amazing product for the money but if you can pick one up on sale ($45) it serves a temporary purpose. I use it for my Weber Q2000 in conjunction with the outdoor kitchen on my travel trailer and it works good... plenty of room.  Some of my cooking utensils are a bit longer and the hooks on this unit hang too low so the utensils hit the ground - not good. Again, on sale pick it up, regular price, don't bother.
