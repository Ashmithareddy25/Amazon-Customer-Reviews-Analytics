B0093Q9Y7W|4.0|This movie was awesome. If you like historical dramas, this one's for you. Robert DeNiro's performance is to die for.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first of John Green's novels that I've read, but it's now certain not to be the last. The characters make you smile with moments of awesomeness. Truly, Augustus Waters' sense of romanticism and Hazel Grace's harrowing observations upon life inspire awe. They're brilliantly funny too. Of the book's themes, one is that the most horrific and tragic events and aspects of the universe do not make life any less wondrously beautiful and deserving of our appreciation.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|We bought this for our 21 month old and he LOVES it! We've watched it more times than I care to admit and he can sit with me for more than half the movie before he starts getting a little restless. I personally liked Cars better but Planes ain't half bad and since its a kids movie and my kid loves it (makes an airplane sound and motion when he wants to watch it) then it definitely gets 5 stars from me!
006085880X|5.0|I bought this after reading &#34;My Sister's Keeper&#34; - this is just as good!  It's a quick read even though it's long.
B002VWNICW|5.0|My favorite version by far. Loved Matthew in MI-5 (Spooks), so was awesome to see him in this. The whole cast is great, and its wonderfully true to the book.
B000683VI4|5.0|Best movie of all time and at a fantastic price!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|My husband does long distant running and this has been his favorite thing ever!<br />He loves knowing the  mileage, distance, time, etc. after getting this and it really has helped<br />him with his goals now that he can keep track.<br />I'm sure there are bigger and better out there, but this is perfect for someone who is more  INTO their<br />sport than their tec. devices.
B00005JKDR|5.0|bought this for her birthday and she's utterly obsessed with monster's inc. just purchased monster's university for her for christmas (:
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|loved it on facebook and now cannot read my ebooks because of my addiction on my kindle. I actually prefer candy crush on the kindle
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game if you love the minions from Despicable Me. I Love this game it is so much fun! I would definitely get if I didn't have it. It is such a great game!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Loved this cult classic cowboy space cadet sci-fi starring Nathan Fillion. Too bad the series was pulled before the final episodes of the 1st season. Thankfully you can see the season in its entirety on this 3 disk blue-ray collection.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|I was impressed with the work. It was a very exciting read. I only had a bit of trouble with some dialogues where I had to depend on context clues to understand who was talking.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is a fun, mindless game to fill short spurts of idle time. No thought or brain-power is necessary.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Its a good and fun game and its a good game to entertain kids and for them to learn ya
B0029VUV70|2.0|Too slow and very euro for my taste (and I am European). You can see it was adapted from a book because there is a lot that's missing.  It is about feelings and thoughts and those are hard to do in the movie.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie about a truly hard to believe story. Naomi Watts is excellent. The scenes with the water coming in are breathtaking.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This in combination with the Hosa GMP-467 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter makes for a perfect microphone with my Panasonic Lumix FZ200 camera (in video mode).  Just what I wanted.  The microphone filers out the background noise nicely, while allowing clear recording of the subject it is clipped to.  The extra long cord is nice, too -- all the others seemed to come with 6' cords.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I was really surprised at how much the entire family enjoyed this movie. The visuals and action are stunning. We also really enjoyed watching the extras on how much detail went into creating the awesome look and feel of the movie.
B001BANK32|5.0|Mind blowing!  So well written and so complex.  Only half way through but I never want it to end.  I stopped reading &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; to read this first and I'm so glad I did.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Just like all of Grisham's books, this hooked me on page one and I couldn't put it down. My husband, who is a new Grisham fan, read it,  too,  and once he started he could not stop!  We are hoping for a movie, featuring the same actors as &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I have played it a few times before I am addicated to this game ... cant wait to try more games like this
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|This had to be, in my opinion, the slowest and most plodding Bond movie I've seen.  This was quite a surprise to me, as I thought Daniel Craig played Bond quite well in Casino Royale, which is one of my favorites.  I'm not saying not to watch the movie by any means, but I put it a tiny bit below my opinion On Her Majesty's Secret Service (Lazenby had potential...).  Full Disclosure: I have not watched every Bond flick, as I've never been a major fan of Pierce Brosnan or Timothy Dalton.  But I'll get to them eventually!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book , has been one of my favorite series to read . I would recommend this book to teens and young adults .
B00005LOUQ|1.0|My low rating has nothing to do with the actual movie - the rating refers to the quality of the DVD. There are numerous scenes missing from this DVD.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Had some technical difficulties to begin with. Otherwise it was okay for an action movie; little to dramatic in some parts but not a bad movie overall.
0375434526|4.0|My expectation...no fault of book.  I carried the book with me on a long bus tour.  Content too deep for interrupted reading.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Very good action movie.  Would recommend this picture for viewing to friends and family.  I really enjoyed watching this movie..
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Alertness and speed required ! Great graphics, good explanation of various enhancements. Sure requires focus and planning.. I enjoy it til I run out of lives..
0316789720|4.0|So much fun and so many fun ideas to help kids and students make cleaver drawings. It can get kids thinking.
B00G118LYY|5.0|Grandson loves to drive the car around. I M not sure the goal of game but he loves it.. Seems to entertain him.
0897500482|1.0|disappointed too much information cramped into small space-unclear-congested-not able to follow-i cannot say much more about it -would like to return it
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|4 year old grandson does not lie this and is very clear about it. not much of a complainer usually.  don't know exactly what he does not like.  sorry, that's the best I can do.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is an outstanding novel that has you laughing and rethinking stereotypes all the time.  It really lets you see the world from a different, but just as valid, point of view.  The imagination of the author as a person with asperger's is amazing.
B007W4OZ76|4.0|Great app that does so much.  Still learning how to use it, but it categorizes all the files on my tablet for easy access.
0374275637|5.0|Kahneman is a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this area. Rather than parrot all the other reviews, I want to point out that he is not the only (or the first) scientist to work in this area. Even Keynes said similar things in The general Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). Baron's Thinking, Fast and Slow (1988) even has a similar title.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|I found the book rather good, but not so good as the first one (&#34;Only time will tell&#34;).  I'm not quite sure whether I shall buy the next one in the series.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|The soundtrack is perfect listening for people who do not want a whole lot of emotion in thier music. Just the thing to bring you back to a state of relentless not caring about people as you terminate them. I used this as my background music when playing online poker. Put me in the right mindset to bust them out without a bad feelings.
B00GM9Q9U8|4.0|The acting was great and you missed the point of the movie if you thought it was about &#34;action&#34;. As far as I can tell there is a lot of mystery about his life...
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I've read a lot of King, and this is the best book I ever read! Very enjoyable, and you can tell a lot of research went into this book.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Was my favorite show. NBC really pissed me off when they simultaneously cancelled this and Friday Night Lights. After Jericho, I should expect nothing less from NBC. Hey NBC, good luck getting me to watch any of your series again.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Don't be fooled by the high ratings like I was.  This book is a terrible read.  I felt like I was on the stairway at the beginning of the book forever.  The writing is far too detail oriented, the simple act of eating a bowl of cereal, for example, takes far too long to describe.  Other 1 star reviews have hit the nail on the head, see them.  Curious concept in the book, just too hard to get through.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|Big fan of the original Miami Vice. Preferred the original Directors cut beginning. Go Fast. Smugglers Blues. Wish they would make a sequel and keep it going but would probably be tough to reup the cast.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|These are so fun! Me and my son are always have a blast with the sand puzzle. It's a good game for him because it gets him interactive and excited about learning,. He can play around in a colorful, fun way that makes it natural for him to want to do better. I must admit 22learn is a genius at making kids love to learn, even big ones like me :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game keeps me coming back for more. I am an avid hunter and this game is right in line for me.

1452126607|5.0|I love Grumpy cat. I haven't actually used the calendar, yet (it's too early) , but I love the photos.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B00F91H15W|2.0|I was hoping for a silly teen movie about robbing celebrities. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't achieve the dramatic flair that it was going for but also doesn't hit the teen audience they wanted it to either. There is almost no motivation for any of the characters and no subplot or subtext in their actions.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Nolan series gave us three movies that were distinctly excellent. I'd like to think this was the best of the series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|very misleading in your ads  it is showing that all that is necessary is to plug in into your TV and it will work off your laptop or PC<br />I ha to buy a tablet to make .it work
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is an awesome game...if you're a hunter..this game is for you.You are hunting different wildlife..love it...love it..love it..love it..
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having access to facebook when all we brought with us is the kindle. This is a great app to go with all the countless others
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It's a great thought but you can't buy things to help you see what you should click on and it goes too fast. This is 2013 going into 2014 . Who still plays bingo for nothing.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Amazon has a great assortment of free games for Kindle for both kids and adults alike. Makes the times your stuck in the house or car go by quick!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book!! I loved it so much! The book is very detailed and lovely , made me.think.about life and its worried momrnts
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome. This app has some flaws but all games do. Because its free the game is always asking you if you want to buy tokens.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I like most anything by Susan Boyle.  This is a great Christmas CD.  Her duets with Presley & Mathis only added to it.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|My daughter loves the Panda games.  They are simple and entertaining.  She would want them all if I would be willing to buy them.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Honestly the best game I have ever owned. Really fun will keep people up for hours only problem is the multiplayer feature doesn't seem to work fix that and ill be even more happy
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Did not get the movie yet, but bad it on VCR and it wore out. Good decent family entertainment. Fun to watch this time of year!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is awesome.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because you can't have anything.  But otherwise it a really, really great game.  Buy it, I recommend it for all ages and for creative minds.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I think that this is a very challenging game when you get to a high level . But I t is still a fun enjoyable game:)
0446556726|5.0|I give it six stars, actually. Bosch the man here is shown as a clumsy, loving father and an intense detective who comes to the surface from time to time realizing he may be too blunt in dealing with his fellows at work. It isn't that he means to be rude, he simply doesn't think of the niceties when focused on a lead. And that lead is pure Bosch-by-Connelly as he tracks down the killer of Anneke Jesperson, a Danish freelance correspondent whose body is inexplicably found in the middle of the historic 1990 Los Angeles riots.<br /><br />Despite orders from his lieutenant to stop, Bosch forges on and gradually opens a foul conspiracy involving veterans of the Gulf War. There seems to be not one extra word in the telling in this deeply thoughtful tale.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|This Episode is sad, It shows the human nature when given to lust and a unforgiving Spirit. One Man caused many to die
B00ESNE696|5.0|This is a great show, and now things are changing and very fast paced in the story line, making it very exciting to watch each episode.  This show has become a chess game between Forrick-Agos and Lockhart-Gardner. I can't wait for the next episode to come out!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I liked the author's ability to put the reader in the moment, she continues the story while describing surroundings and  facial expressions.  I wish she had shortened the book some especially toward the end.  A good read.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|This is a great show. Is has locks of action and drama, and does actually portray a fairly correct depiction of wolves and the way they hunt. Of course the end is quite dramatic and shocking as well.
0452289963|5.0|A powerful book that really gets you to look at and understand who and what you really are, well all of us really. All about being in the present moment. Something you will go back to again and again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is a beautiful story, haven't finished yet, but it's been a great read. I'll finish before watching the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|After learning how to use it it has become a part of me. I cannot go a day without checking IN.
B00742H26M|1.0|Amazon has an Android player but they don't release it for general use.  Only available on their flagship Android kindle products.  When will there be a player for Android?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is everything! The way Suzanne writes makes you want more. I love this book and the series! I've read the book before, this definitely will not be the last
B005QYKD4I|5.0|My Nephews love the movie! It Is great I can just pull movies up anytime with Amzon Prime! Use the service often.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It is a great movie. Even if you not have read the book, this is still a must watch. Yes!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Wow, I absoltly loved it. I couldn't put it down. The romance with some humor was a great combination. Best read!
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal is my absolute favorite novelist, and this is the book that got me hooked on his work. Its quite obvious he pulled some inspiration from the always brilliant John Green. Truly a work of art.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Sam Rockwell's best performance ever. This is the part he was made to play, I have not seen him live up to this hilariousness in anything else.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|With this app, I can bookmark my pdfs. It's wonderful! Without it, I'd be lost in my pdf file. I wouldn't be able to save my spot.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|Great Movie.  I've watched it more than 5 times.  I recently watched it again because I listened to the book 'Gates of Fire' by Steven Pressfield.  The movie is not based on the book, but based on the story of the battle at Thermopylae, the book so greatly tells.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Flawless performance on program download.  Seamless integration with existing Kindle dowloads.  Thanks for an excellent program for &#34;on the go&#34;.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have nothing but praise for Mr. Zusak! He captured not only subject matter but characters who exploded with his poetic words. Death - my favorite character was almost given a conscience; but definitely given story-telling ability. If you are into flowery description and orthodox expectation in a book - don't bother with this one. The pages tremble with brevity, death's honor and a time of dishonor for German despots. I loved this book. The movie has an impossible task to align the story with the powerful and brief analogy of war-torn lives.<br />DrC
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Loved the book. It was great to revisit the time period and Stephen King did a good job with it. I thought he did a good job with the Cuban Missile Crisis.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|A French Girl in New York by Anna Adams was a great read! I was intrigued by the title and could not put the book down once I started to read. I would definitely recommend this book to girls 9-12, or to anyone looking for a quick and sweet romance story. I rated A French Girl in New York a 5/5 because of the great character development, reserved romance, and the great plot twist. I cannot wait to read the sequel!
B000HF6XKO|2.0|Good actors but you  get lost in the sequence of events in this flick.  Kind of hard  to follow. Good for a $1.00 rental, that's it.
B0063M22QO|3.0|lots of configurations to choose from. levels are a little hard but the game lets you shuffle as many times as you want
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is killer! !!  Great game when the sea hag is bitchen in your ear eh?  Excellent graphics and once you start you'll have a difficult time stopping.  Enjoy
B00FYZNPSA|5.0|My daughters ages11yrs, 10yrs, 3yrs, and 2 yrs. enjoyed the move. And I had peace and quiet for an hour. Five stars for me ;&#62;).
193700788X|3.0|I love the entire Sookie Stackhouse series, as well as Harris's other books. This book was just as good as the others, until I got to the end. To me it was a disappointing ending to the series.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|I loved the first Despicable Me and I love this one  even the more because he finally gets a wife. My girls love it too.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Good game, I'm glad it was the free app. Not sure I'd pay for it but I'm a cheap skate.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Heartwrenching and occasionally hard to watch but a great movie.  Great acting. You can't help but think of all the people who didn't have the same ending...
B0067TGSOK|4.0|I wish I could give it four and a HALF stars because it just about hit the mark. I only had a small complaint but for the most part, this book is excellent.<br /><br />I appreciated the plethora of examples but wished that there were more details. Actually the real meat and potatoes of this book are contained on the website, with the tools and resources that Chris provides free. I would recommend that anyone &#34;on the fence&#34; about getting the book go to the website first and see the value there.<br /><br />One last thought: would like to echo what others have written... beside that there are a lot of examples but light on details, it's the details about what challenges some of these solopreneurs have faced, then overcome. I wanted to have an underdog or a hero to root for.
B000I9X67W|4.0|Kind of a cheesy storyline but we love to see the amazing drumline(s) in action. :-) We love a good marching band.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Such a wonderful book, it was very interesting, I can't wait to read the next book! #amazing #missperegrineshomeforpeculierchildren #love #book
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|The keypad is great that it works as both a standalone calculator and a keypad for a Surface computer.  And the price is a great benefit also.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Not a great book, but not bad either.  It's interesting but never gets into detail with any of the characters or the details of the zombies.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The most incredible and moving story. This book stripped my emotions raw and left me in a breathless sobbing mess.  There is no way possible the movie can ever do this piece of work justice. One of the best books I have ever read. Period.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great acting along with a great story line. Kept me engaged at all times. I plan to finish the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicting! I can't put it down but thankfully the built in limits let me get other work done.  At night it is great as my final day hurrah.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great acting along with a great story line. Kept me engaged at all times. I plan to finish the series.
0345803493|5.0|This book earned my 5 star rating becasue it had a good story line. Above all the obvious intimacy, it was a good read with believeable characters. I am patiently waiting to afford book three before the holiday rush! Thanks E.L. James and Amazon!
031623480X|5.0|My doctor told me to read this and am I ever glad she did. Apparently the #1 fear is no longer death - it's dementia, and here's the fix. The bonus: Improved quality of life before old age arrives! I was reading the library's but ordered my own copy before I was half way through. I'll be ordering more for my beloveds. It's a great follow-up for Wheat Belly, another life-changing/improving fav.
B00GNL96H8|5.0|If that were the title it would give Wong Kar-Wai fans a better context for what to expect from this film, and serve as a warning to Martial Arts enthusiasts that this is not your typical Ip Man movie. A lot of the advertising in the US invokes names like The RZA and Martin Scorscese and there's even a trailer with some Wu Tang music underscoring the action. This is nothing at all like what those trailers suggest.<br /><br />The Grandmaster is moody, epic, romantic, esoteric, and gorgeous. Everything one would expect from Wong Kar-Wai. It just so happens to have some excellent martial arts scenes throughout as well, which is made all the more impressive by knowing the lead actors did their own fight choreography for the film.<br /><br />This is not a movie for people who like high octane martial arts gorefests. This is a martial arts movie for people who like art house Chinese cinema. Be warned, and seriously, give it a chance if you're skeptical. Just know what you're getting into up front and you may be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Expect \\"Man With the Iron Fists\\" (which is also a great movie!), and you will be sorely disappointed.
1594202273|5.0|A fascinating history of nuclear weapons and the issues surrounding their deployment.  It actually foresees the problems with our ICBM force that we are seeing today.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun movie. Good to rent when you are tired and don't need to follow a plot. Everyone in it is having a good time so, you can too!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the slow build of the relationship.  Loved the emergence of the personalities of will and louisa.  Recommend to all lovers and caregivers.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Amazing voices, the best! I heared it while putting up my Nativity Scene and Xmas Trees.<br />Really inspirational for this time of the year.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This game would not work on my Kindle.  In fact, the Kindle froze up and wouldn't let me do anything, not even shut it down!  I had to wait quite awhile before I could delete this game.  Wonder if anyone else has had the same kind of problems?
B00EUUJID6|5.0|I love their renditions of these Christmas carols.  I listen to it all the time!  I have all their albums.
159463176X|1.0|I loved Hosseini's first two books and so was prepared to love this.  Which I  might have, had it been marketed as what it really is--a collection of short stories.  Since I was expecting a novel and NOT a collection of short stories, I was profoundly disappointed as I reached approximately the two-thirds point of the book and realized I was not going to get any sort of continuity or resolution regarding multiple characters I cared about.  There simply are not the words to say just how disappointed I am in this book.  I was hoodwinked, and I don't appreciate it.  Fool me once, Khaled, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  You've lost one of your most vocal fans--me.
B008Y6WESI|4.0|Actually I would give it 4 1/2 star rating. Catherine Zita Jones deserve the Oscar. She did a great job. I love all the music and the dancing.  Plus the cast was great.  I feel like Richard Gear should have won an Oscar for his performance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the hunger games movie and I'm not much of a reader and I gave this book a try and I read this book in a matter of few days. It is amazing!!!
B009RRIP86|4.0|I fell in love with this case at first sight.<br />Its an 11 on the 1-10 cool scale.<br /><br />Now for the nuts and bolts of the review. The functionality is fine, but structurally this little beast is a tad lacking.<br />The cool looking screen front panel droops on the right side when in either the lowest position or the mid position using the prop.<br />The slide in 5-1/4 bay tray system latch is a bit wobbly, but if treated carefully will likely be OK.<br /><br />The plastic power supply retainer clip was a joke, and broke the first time the PS was installed.<br />The case comes with two PS clips (maybe the mfg was hoping at least one would survive)<br />I ended up designing an aluminum angle clip that fastens to the PS and drilled the case and added two screws to take care of the issue.<br /><br />I installed a slide in HDD tray in one 5-1/4 bay for my main HDD and so far use the hot swap trays for extra storage only.<br /><br />As far as a &#34;Gamer&#34; case, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, this case is huge and takes up a ton of table space, and is extremely awkward to move around.<br /><br />The huge front fan is quiet and the LED'S look sweet in a dimly lit room.<br /><br />Aside from the few caviats, this case is still waaaaaaay cool looking and is a breath of real fresh air after years of nothing but &#34;EGG SHELL&#34; colored boxes.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, would I buy it again????  &#34;In a heartbeat&#34; This thing is just COOOOOOOL LOOKING.<br /><br />A word to prospective buyers, handle it with care and plan on making your own clip to hold the PS in place, ENJOY
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|What in the heck was that? I want the 2 hours 15 minutes of my life spent watching this back.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|excellent duets, so smooth, fun and very surprising at the pairing of excellent voices and styles.  I have played this DVD many times and really enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I like how the author developed the characters. She conveyed the fear and horror of the whole situation really well.
0061906220|5.0|A favorite among preschoolers and moms!  We love reading this book every night, it never gets old.  The song is catchy and cute.  A great way to learn and have fun!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I had to read this book as I had read the first two. I have to admit that I had not thoroughly enjoyed the other two books.<br />I must say that I like how this one ends. There's that twist at the end that makes it anything but standard teen reading. Sad yet that is how real life can truly end up.<br />Read and Be Brave.
0671449028|5.0|Love all the Sandra Boynton books, this one included! The rhymes are catchy and humorous for kids and adults alike. I never grow tired of reading this over and over.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Love the plot and especially the scenery in Venice.  Never thought the water would be so beautiful!  Jonny Depp is always good, but I really liked this character.  Also loved the twist ending.
B00ECLU346|5.0|Very funny movie... enjoyed watching it very much so. Never gets old just watch over and over=) Thank you for easy transaction
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addictive, hard to stop once you start. Something I play and my kids enjoy as well.  Would defiantly recommend.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|The novel is too long. It has too many scientific references. If you like biology and plants A LOT then this is the book for you.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Simply put, I think this box set is the best investment a Beatle fan can make!  The sound on each CD is brilliantly remastered, it is like listening to The Beatles for the first time-- the way they were meant to be listened to.  I cannot say enough great things about the sound quality, but the art and pictures and DVD extras make it that much more wonderful. In closing, all I can add to this review is, YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. It has heart and soul. It's about a kind individual who is ostracized for being different. There is an important sub-plot about pollution and not caring for our resources.<br />Then there is the music, the laughter and the love. I saw it the first day it was released. I wanted so badly to stand up in the aisle and dance with Mumble.
0062073192|5.0|The book was really awesome. I enjoyed reading John's personal notes. It has a lot of lore information. However, it does get repetitive after a while. &#34;Anniversary&#34;, &#34;Dean's birthday&#34;, &#34;Sam's Birthday&#34;, etc. The one thing I really did love to see was John's decent into obsession and madness.<br /><br />It is only canon up to season 6 though.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I will not see the movie though This story is too sad Interesting to hear the German perspective. I am of Polish heritage My Dad was forced into the German army and was sent to the Russian front and survived. Therefore this story was very intense for me
B0058UXHHK|5.0|funny,enteraining, loved it. i bought the next one in the series,and i am going to buy the rest of them.
B00ESNE696|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show. Each season gets better and better! I actually spend money on here and pay for an episode if I happen to miss it or DVR fails to record it.... I'm cheap, so that says a lot!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think coins should be given more frequently for less important stuff seriously....I'm catching my royal a** to win something
0316322407|5.0|Honestly, clearly told story revealing the world of conflict from the OTHER side....  The girl who stood up to the terrorists, took a bullet, and came back stronger than before.  the side of the story you want to champion.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love the show and now have the xbox game to go with it. The action and story are great.
0547848412|4.0|I bought this book to clarify my  experience of the movie.  While the movie followed the book accurately, I understood the meaning of the story much better after reading the book.. It's worth the price of a paperback.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Have subtitles in Portuguese? I need this DVD, but wanted to know if he's subtitle, is urgent. Thank you :)
1452110581|4.0|A fun book to read.  I gave it to a friend with a beloved cat as it fit so many things she's said about her cat.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|An enjoyable book. Very fast paced though. An easy read would recommend it to a younger audience. Was also rather short.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This would not download on my Kindle Fire. Dont' know why, just wouldn't. Too bad. I was hoping to have a YouTube app.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|An unrealistic story about the legal process, judges and attorneys--they just don't act this way or follow these procedures--even in Mississippi!. Grisham uses &#34;legal buzz words&#34; and misapplies them.  Putting these fantasies aside, in my opinion the story and dialogue were boring and tedious.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|We liked this one so much after watching it that we had to buy it on DVD! Great movie to watch over and over again as it has a great plot and lots of action!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Gifted....but as far as ordering,price, shipping quickly, receiving in good condition, and it being a favorite for the person we are gifting... this has been a positive purchase experience.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Fantastic sci-fi movie...one you can re-watch over and over and it never seems to get old. Definitely one of my favorite remake movies!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|EXCELLENT QUALITY OF STREAMING VIDEO!<br />CLEAR AND PERFECT IN EVERY WAY....<br />WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING IN THE MOVIE ON LARGE SCREEN!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great series! Not all about the gore either...really makes you wonder what you would do to survive in the same situation.
B008602KQI|5.0|EXCELLENT QUALITY OF STREAMING VIDEO!<br />CLEAR AND PERFECT IN EVERY WAY....<br />WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING IN THE MOVIE ON LARGE SCREEN!!
B003V5ED7W|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times throughout the years and it was a great family movie night rental. Good plot and clean for the kiddos to watch. Still makes me chuckle 15+ years later!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|EXCELLENT QUALITY OF STREAMING VIDEO!<br />CLEAR AND PERFECT IN EVERY WAY....<br />WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING IN THE MOVIE ON LARGE SCREEN!!
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|It was an okay Disney movie but it was pretty predictable and not much in the way of laughs. The kids seemed to enjoy though.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|kept you busy and very hooked into playing the game. it takes your mind away from everything else. really relaxing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Is there going to be a update for the kindlefire I got the update for my kindle hd but have not be able to update on my other kindle.plz put some infromation out for us on the kindle update.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Knock  on wood ! A fabulous game , just hope this one doesn't do what another game did to me !!!! Not going to say might jinx myself
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Great movie with a great theme.  There is a lot of action and the details of the film are outstanding.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|i love fantasy shows. this has got it all. action,romance ,adventure...perfect actors for each roll in this series. worth the money
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game has its ups and its downs but overall i think it is a good enjoyable game. It has good solid controls that work and the multiplayer is really good. The multiplayer consists of free for all, team deathmatch and co op. There is alot of in game items you can purchase with real life money to help you beat the game but you don't need to buy anything with real life money to beat the game and enjoy it.<br /> and enjoy it.hi
B00756GRUE|5.0|Great watch and I like that it is solar so no battery is needed!  If you are looking for a nice present this is one as I purchased this for myself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is extremely addictive, but sometimes can be a bit frustrating. Very fun th  only thing that gets on my nerves is when your stuck it can take a while waiting  for you lives to regenerate but still a great game.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|I got this game when it was the faotd.  I LOVE the game.  I just don't know why Amazon doesn't provide the entire game.  If you go to the Google app store, there are 5 islands.  Amazon app store only provides 4 islands, and the 5th one just says &amp;#34;coming soon.&amp;#34;.  I'm thinking about emailing the devs to see if there is a way to get the entire game.  The game is worth 5 stars, but 1 deducted for Amazon not providing the entire game or updating to the full game.
0385311400|5.0|The best book series ever. Anyone considering the purchase of this book reeeaaally should buy it. It's wonderful, life changing, and worth it.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I bought all three of the books in the “Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” series as a single Kindle book, and that’s how I read them. There are some obvious advantages to doing this: You save a couple of dollars, and everything is available to search if you want to refresh your memory about something you read 1,000 pages ago. More importantly, I can’t see reading “The Girl Who Played with Fire” and “The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” on their own or out of sequence.<br /><br />The books are well worth reading if you’re into crime/mystery stories. The writing is good (with the reservations noted below), and the characterization, personal relationships, action, and plot twists are more than enough to hold your attention for the time it takes to read the equivalent of 2,200 paperback pages.<br /><br />Some things you should know before starting out:<br /><br />The books were written in Swedish. The translation is surprisingly good, but there are times you’ll vow to only read books in English (or whatever language you claim as your mother tongue).<br /><br />Swedish surnames are hard to pronounce (especially if you’re not familiar with the three extra letters in the Swedish alphabet).<br /><br />Swedish place names and street names are longer and harder to pronounce than Swedish surnames.<br /><br />You will read more about the Swedish police and intelligence services than you ever wanted to.<br /><br />The girl with the dragon tattoo is the main character in the books, but not by much.<br /><br />Sweden is not just a bunch of tall, blonde, decent, morose Nordic types a la Bergman. Except for the unpronounceable names, it sounds very much like the United States. And, for those of you who don’t live in the United States, you can probably substitute in the name of your country.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a great John Corey story. One of Nelson Demilles best. I had read most of his books and truly enjoy his style.<br />A very good read.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. See them in order. They're sweet, romantic, and beautifully done. I hope there's more.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I really like this game but the only thing i didn't like about it was that you don't have bows or crossbows in the game
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have this game on console and I love. If you like DC and fighting games then get this app.
0316204366|5.0|Gladwell gives you a completely different perspective on the underdog in this book. As usual, he presents his stories from a unique view that we may have never thought.
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|Too many times the protagonists leap to conclusions that are not supported by the thread of the story. It is a very different plot which made it interesting.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Love the movie and definitely the game. Play it everyday. Brings a lot of entertainment to me and my family
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Action packed. Heck it has so much action in this movie ( as they all do) left my mouth opened a few times.
1250004217|4.0|Well written historical fiction, with solid character development all around. Recommended for those who don't mind reading with a tissue nearby.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Great Old Bob Segar...plain and simple ! The only problem I have with the downloaded MP3 version is all songs won't burn on to a cd so I can listen to them while I'm driving. Other than that most of Bob's ultimate hits are contained in this one.
0307476073|1.0|I couldn't finish this book, simply could not relate.  I felt sorry for her and the hardships she faced in life, but truly could not appreciate the descriptions of how difficult her journey was based on the fact that she was [admittedly] completely unprepared for it. For this reason, I found it boring.
B0081KTHEQ|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe was really great, interesting story<br />Loved that it keeps you on your toes.<br />Special effects were very well done
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl provides some great modern day feminist food for thought in Lean In.  A must read for working women, stay at home Mom's and everyone who believes in workplace equality (for men too!)
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Good comedy , love the sarcasm. Unusual team up that work<br />great cast<br />would love to see a second one
B003G4W49C|5.0|great story, it makes you want to pick up the next book right away. Sad that humans behave the way they do, we always get it wrong.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom is such a fine storyteller!  Service and delivery went off without a hitch, am engrossed in the story.  Albom never disappoints!  Theme is the essence of time, and we take it all so for granted.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's okay. Soon need to buy acorns to get anywhere....or be very very patient!!  Graphics aren't anything special. Would enjoy more interaction with Scrat.
B00C5R8364|4.0|I realy liked the author's writing style. Everything was clear. Great word pictures and descriptions of things and places I had not personally experienced.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best Bond Movies ever made. Truly, Daniel Craig is the mkst lved Bond, comared to Sean Connery.
1401312853|4.0|“The Time Keeper” by Mitch Albom is a quick “Hallmark” movie book. I enjoyed it. The story starts long ago with a man named Dor. His wife becomes ill and that is where the story progresses. We discover where Father Time came from, then the story takes us to an old rich man named Victor and a young emotional girl named Allie. All of the three main characters (Victor, Allie and Dor) lives become intertwined and lives are revolved around time . It was a great story for the Holidays and I’ve actually never read a book by Mitch Albom before. It really did remind me of a Hallmark movie though, with the theme being very family oriented and I could picture Hallmark buying this story too, like they have with Mitch Albom’s “The Five People You Meet In Heaven.” If you want a quick read for the Holiday about life and time, pick up this book!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A modern classic. Complex but not prohibitively so. Optional clues egg you on just enough that you feel like a genius when you delve deeper into the game's mysteries. Keep it up Fireproof Games! Btw... is there a PC release on the horizon?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It was impossible to put it down.  I felt as if I was a part of the story myself. No movie can ever do it justice.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book and the writers style.  I felt lost at times but came back to enjoy the story.  Although, the underlying message was difficult to at times for me too grasp,<br />I concluded its meaning is not necessarily the same for everyone.  The message I took from the author was, life can seem impossible, hard and extremely unfair but beauty and meaning can only be had through strong moral convictions.
0613181468|5.0|One of the most amazing people to ever have lived. Yes, Mr. Feynman is that extraordinary. I wish I could have attended one of his lectures.
B0086700CM|5.0|Aye yo this game is pretty punk rock do ya feel me gaming world? Like you go creator dudes! Woot Woot
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game for kids, but adults too! I love that I can take it with me, but it is not the full version. but I still love it
B0034G4P80|5.0|Great introduction to the Thor character.  You must see this movie before watching &#34;The Avengers.&#34;  I'm looking forward to the second Thor movie.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Not one of her best, but still a good read.  Has most of her best elements. Would recommend to all.
B000V63BN6|1.0|It will not work on my device. I tried to reload it but nothing work please send me a new link.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is a sad, sad commentary on the state of health care in the USA.<br /> To be fair, it is slanted. It is a one sided account of all that is wrong with our health care system and<br />does not address anything right about it.<br />But it opens your eyes to the fact that we must make changes.<br /> It is appalling  and shamefull that these situations exist in our country.<br />We have to change our system.
B008602KQI|3.0|This is an average movie, nothing more. For a science fiction movie it was better than average. Elizabeth Banks is not easily recognized.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was introduced to this series by my 14 year old grandson. Had he not explained the story line to me, I probably would not have ever watched it.<br />It is a story of life and survival in a futuristic  world.<br />Certain youths are choosen to fight to the death iin a style that is reminescent of the Roman gladiators. The contest is brutal and it's done for the  entertainment of the governing powers and  upper classes. The winner of the games superficially unites the &#34;haves&#34; and the &#34;have nots&#34; by means of a natioinal hero<br />It also reminds the.&#34;have nots&#34; that they have no control over their lives.<br /> What is different is that the playing field is cyber controlled  and can be manupulated at the whim of the governing powers. They can also change the rules of the game, at will.<br /> Itt has everything  we want in a  good story....: characters you love to love,  those you love to hate  and those  you can not decide  on.<br />Suspence, excitement, romance, courage, rebellioin.. It is a believeable story, for the most part, and I am hooked.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|A very interesting approach to the story of a modern young woman in the throes of cancer, surrounded by her support system consisting of those suffering from varieties of the same death sentence.  It is a young adult novel, which I don’t often find myself reading save for this being a choice in a community-wide read that I am on a committee for.<br /><br />The best part of this book is it’s semi-sweet cynical humor found without - a very morbid, realistic view of life at the end of life and at the beginning of life, the young narrator brings us along her journey of love and self discovery, all the while trailed by the expiration date they all must face eventually.<br /><br />I liked the pacing and the friendly language, but the true art in this piece is Green’s portrayal of the narrator and how she tells the story.  Brilliantly written and engaging for young audiences - and I could easily see how this did (and continues to do) so well.  I have a few complaints about the believability of a few things - namely the way the characters used profanity (didn’t seem as natural where it occurred to me, for some reason) and also the author’s work who is a centerpiece to the novel.  He was a believable character, but the work wasn’t for some reason - i.e. as a writer I don’t see someone writing a book that doesn’t have an ending even getting published, and the plot outlined in the book is significantly less believable in the language it is written, even though the one in your hands as you read is believable.<br /><br />While I saw the ending coming from a mile away, I could see how everyone who read it reviewed it as an absolute tear jerker.  There were some gorgeous lines interspersed in the overall piece of popular fiction, but it was a good read, and I will be recommending it to the rest of the committee.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|will not keep going overnight. Take it off before going to bed in the morning its stooped. I expected better from Seiko quality
159514188X|5.0|my girlfriend lovea this book. shes already looking at other titles from this author. it was a good deal and we are both happy with the quality
B008JFUPZI|3.0|This movie is based on a comic book and it also feels like a retelling of that other comic-to-film franchise Men In Black. Ryan Reynolds is a corrupt cop with second thoughts when his partner and co corrupt buddy Kevin Bacon kills him.<br />He teams with Jeff Bridges channeling Rooster Cogburn as two paranormal cops in New bodies hunting Deado bad guys who are messing up stuff.<br />It's far from a perfect movie but if you revel in awful popcorn cinema like Expendables, Transporter, Transformers, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters or Van Helsing portrayed by Wolverine, you will like this movie as well. I'm not saying films like those are bad things but they aren't high brow and are films at their dumbest and entertainment onliest, as opposed to films that try to stretch the action genre.. so grab a bowl of popcorn and shut your brain off while having dumb fun!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Harry has so many complications in his life, but he seems like such a regular guy. I love reading about him.
B00G3P6VA4|1.0|Thanks for the politically motivated movie Matt. Now I'm even less likely to support Obamacare and/or amnesty for illegal Mexicans.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally worth the  DL.... syncs with all devices to keep you current in your game play .. a real time eater when you're waiting and waiting did I say waiting. It's like a real good book that you just can't put down
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Story line could have been fleshed out a little more.  Annunciation of words needs a little work too.  However, it's really not too bad if you want to just kill some time.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Goonies is a classic in my eyes. I Love Love Love this movie.  :)<br />Movie arrived in perfect condition in perfect time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|First, I don't think that I have ever read a trilogy of 1500+ pages.  This was in many ways a love story that I related to on a very deep level.  The transformation of Christian from a tragic childhood, to a magnate and finally to a sensitive loving husband is something I have seen enacted in real life.  The power of just one person to raise the esteem and aspirations of another is without bounds.  E. L. James must have had some real earth-moving experiences to write such a novel.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|We're the Millers was funny. When I rent a comedy, all I'm interested in is laughing a little bit. Just make up a fresh joke, or rework an old one in a new way, and I'm happy. We're the Millers did both, and we really enjoyed it, so much that we watched it twice in the time we had it rented!
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|I am watching it now and really enjoying it. Canadian show from the Sci=Fi channel That was recommended to me. After the first 8 shows, I ordered the second season. Like Murder She Wrote, this is set in a small town in main. Here at least there are some reasons given for all that is going on from the long term point of view. Cabot Cove just seemed to heve to many people being murdered each episode. The show started to take place elsewhere after awhile wich was a good move to keep the show moving forward.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|It's simply unconscionable that a developer would sell an app for money then expect more money on top of that.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Another of my favorite shows. Lots about the to lead characters living together and raising a daughter. Some interesting new twists with the other cast members as well. A very full season.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|It was well made and kept our interest throughout the movie.  We liked seeing the different doctors and different time periods it covered.  Look forward to many more Dr. Who episodes!!
B0036G1T78|4.0|This is a great old classic movie. Robert Redford never fails to deliver in these kinds of films. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app and I enjoy getting points, but sometimes the weather is pretty far off. I wish that wind gusts were measured and reported.
B001EBWIRW|4.0|Funny and very entertaining.  The actors and music was very entertaining.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a quick laugh
B001G7HKZ4|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. Can't stop watching it. I definitely recommend if you like movies that are Romantic and heartfelt this is definitely a movie you should watch. Miss Pettigrew grows on you from the first scene. It has been a long time that I could watch more than once. I want this one part of my collection.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love to play this.  You can start with a 5x5 or go up to the challenging 15x15.  Can keep you occupied for hours!  Look forward to more being made!
6303289479|5.0|LOOKING FOR THE FULL SERIES OF THIS VIDEO PRODUCTION FROM MANY YEARS AGO.<br />SO FAR ONLY FOUND THIS ONE.  HOWEVER THE VIDEO CASE WAS DAMAGED ON ARRIVAL. SO NOW I HAVE TO<br />HAVE IT TRANSFERRED TO DVD.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The holocaust is never easy to read about,neither is death of innocent people.  This book makes both seem a little lighter.  You fall in love with the characters and Death being the narrator is often comforting.
B000N2HCM4|1.0|I read it for perspective.  I got perspective.  I hate the perspective but I achieved what I sought.  If you want to understand where Mr. Obama wants to take America and understand why he's doing what he's doing, read this.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This book is a very good second part of the chronicle — but I hope that the third part will be at least as thrilling as the first part.
B005LQ6UE8|1.0|This story has been sold as true.  It has been questionably false and those accusations have never been reputed.  I couldn't put the book down, it was that great of read.  However, when I discovered it most likely wasn't true, I was so sad because the story, if true, was so great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's another Grisham smash hit. I don't understand how he can devise such interesting and diverse plots for his stories. This one had my head spinning as I tried to anticipate the final ending. I was wrong on all counts but I liked the ending.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This DVD provides good, clean entertainment. I would recommend adding it to your collection, to be watched over and over.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this movie. It gives an interesting twist on the Cinderella story that could actually be believable. There are lots of funny scenes too. Its probably my favorite movie with Drew Barrymore other than 50 first dates.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I absolutely love this movie but you can tell it was pirated and the cover was printed out and poorly done!  Do not buy!  Not original anything!
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|The instructions has some errors. I buy it for my daughter (7 years old) and she love it. Its fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was amazed at the details she write through without it being drawn out. The chain of events, how people think through them and react to their own realities was so realistic. I am going to read her other books now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept me engaged.  By the time I started reading Part 2 I couldn't put it down.  I felt it was coming to a spectacular climax, and it never happened.  I kept looking for an epilog that wasn't there.  I was very disappointed.  Up to that point I felt the book was done very well.  I found it to be an unusual story with many twists and different plots.  I felt I was left flat!
1476727651|4.0|Book Club Review<br />Doctor Sleep<br />Stephen King<br /><br />Our book club's book for November was &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; by Stephen King. We had read &#34;Full Dark, No Stars&#34; a few years ago, and as a group we enjoyed it. Interestingly, that book was a turning point for many of us, who had given up King more than a decade ago. The consensus was that he had been overexposed and underedited, and that a lot of his mid-career books are dull, long, or plodding. But &#34;Full Dark, No Stars&#34; turned it around for many of us, who also went on to read 11/23/63. So, &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; being the sequel to one of the great horror classics, &#34;The Shining,&#34; we decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />The book begins shortly after the end of &#34;The Shining&#34; and takes place over a period of about two decades. Having read &#34;The Shining&#34; will help readers of &#34;Doctor Sleep,&#34; but King provides enough details within the book to help you, if you haven't. Note, though, that you must have read the book, not just seen the movie, because the movie ends very differently from the book, and &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; picks up the events of the book. (Interesting side note, which the film buffs in the group talked about: King did not like the Kubrick movie at all and doesn't understand why it's considered a classic. He does sort of allude to this in the book's afterword, but apparently there was no love lost between King and Kubrick.)<br /><br />In a nutshell, Danny Torrance, the little boy with the shining, grows into the tormented Dan Torrance, who has ended up a serious alcoholic, just like his father. Meanwhile, a baby girl is born in New England. Her name is Abra and her shining is extremely powerful. She reaches out to Dan even as a baby, and through the next ten years, their psychic connection becomes stronger. The villains here are the members of the True Knot, a group of quasi-vampires who live by locating children with psychic abilities, then torturing and killing them to drink in their &#34;steam,&#34; which is what they exhale upon death. The members of the True Knot also feed on human misery and thus are drawn to the NYC area just before 9/11 (as they have their own psychic abilities as well). Eventually the True Knot discovers Abra and they see her as a source of plentiful steam, and she becomes their target. The book then follows Dan and Abra as they take on and try to outwit the True Knot.<br /><br />As a group we were agreed on the book's strengths. First, even though it's somewhat long, it is involving right from the start. We were amazed and impressed with King's imagination and with the way he seamlessly writes about the psychic links among the characters. We also thought that &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; shows off King's plotting talents. In other words, even though the book is long, the story keeps moving forward, and there's almost always something interesting happening. The writing is good (&#34;mature&#34; is the word some used, though not to universal agreement) and the characters are sympathetic. At its core, the book is the archetypical battle between good and evil. And, as a group, we can say we enjoyed it.<br /><br />Now for the negatives. Probably the key criticism was the way King overdoes Loving Family Schmaltz. There's a lot of gooey, lovey-dovey, cutesy talk among characters. It did grate even on those who enjoyed the book the most. There's also a tendency for schlocky emotional indicators to take over conversations between friends, which focused our discussion on whether King writes real relationships or whether he writes only the most stereotypical of relationships: loving parents and child, teacher and student, doctor and patient, and so forth. Because all of the relationships are pretty predictable and &#34;Hollywood.&#34; Some found the book to be slower than they would have hoped for, but were glad they stuck with it. Finally, and I don't say this in a judgmental way, the book seemsa little like Stephen King working out his problems with alcoholism in a novel. There's a huge amount of detail, and time spent, in AA... it just went on and on, and it did drag down the book's pace.<br /><br />The best part of the reading experience for many of us was feeling that this was a worthy sequel to &#34;The Shining,&#34; a &#34;realistic&#34; account of what happened after the events of that earlier novel. For those who are fans of &#34;The Shining,&#34; &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; also offers more information about (and background on) what happened in that book, which was a nice bonus. So, overall, we do recommend it if you are a King fan, and if you like a supernatural thriller (it does feel more like it deserves that description rather than just &#34;horror novel&#34;). My own opinion is that I liked the book quite a bit and am glad that I read it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|just love face book and all the things you can do on it. Specially the games and reading all the things my friends have to say.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book hoping for a signed copy from the author Holt McDougall only to find some joker scribble in the name John Green. Fix this,  Amazon!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good sci-fi ... J Lawrence does great work as Catniss... Also, the film offers some insights into where ever-expanding, Big Government can lead... killing off selected youth for entertainment purposes in order to control the masses. As long as you're on the inside of the controller [i.e. the benevolent government] ... you're promised great TV and entertainment. As long as it's not happening to you, just sit back and enjoy it! ... after all, your Government loves you! :-]
B00FXEL00W|4.0|It was surprisingly good. Cute without vomit, smart without getting lost and intense enough to hold your attention<br /> Good read
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Good book.  Great quick read.  This was a nice mix of ancient Druidism and modern day.  Good fantasy genre book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My four year old just loves this game I even find my self enjoying this to.if you enjoy the movies you'll love this
B00881VLCE|1.0|I enjoy the puzzles and find it relaxing. It freezes and I have to uninstall it and then install it again. When I do that any saved puzzles are gone and the puzzles I paid for are not there so I have to install them separately.  Then I may get an error that the website isn't available and I should try again later. Too bad it doesn't work better. Then I would give it five stars.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I kinda suck at the console version so this is a whole lot more fun for me. I love it.
B00F91H15W|1.0|This movie, in my opinion, lacked direction.  The acting was not horrible, however the way the story was told was much like a made for TV movie.  Instead of making a movie about these teenagers an hour documentary would have been enough. They added news feed as transitions which I found were a poor choice.
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train was one of the best books I read all year .  Keep a box of tissues nearby while reading.  To think that these things really happened is heart wrenching.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show captures the lives of the family and the house staff in intimate and entertaining detail. I mourn the coming of the end of season 3 on Prime and hope for new episodes to become available.
0375836675|2.0|Well I must be fair to Mr Zusak and say that I unfairly compared this book to THE BOOK THEIF and that's where my disappointment came from.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Well made. It seems to work well, finds satellites quickly. I have used it with a HP Net-Book and MS Streets & Trips. I must say I like my dedicated Tom Tom Navigator better. I find using my net-book a little cumbersome and distracting in the car. Maybe it would be better if I had a mount.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|What's up buy it.. it's worth at least taking a look at whY do you have to lose take a chance you will love it
B00B2DSK06|5.0|One of the best animations I've seen.  Perfect for all ages.  My 3 year old grandson loved it.  Great story line.  Great comedy lines, especially if you remember video arcades.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the beach and the mall locations &lt;3 I love the movies &lt;3 and I just love this game &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|Felt like this season falling off. Knew the Gov didn't &#34;change&#34; but it was all a set-up to get me bawling like a baby more than once near and @ the end of &#34;Too Far Gone&#34;. As a 44 year old mean man it takes a lot nowadays. KUDOS to the producers for a freakin brilliant episode. FYI this is all based on a true story !
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Well written as usual, the story is breathtaking. However, a bit disappointed that some characters seem to turn around. Arya's part was a bit dull. Yet, I'm looking forward to reading the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's the most annoying game ever but you will get addicted to it right away. Then you have to buy more levels or get Facebook friends to give them to you. I hate this game but I can't stop playing it. Help!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Growing up a child of the 80's I remember living under the threat of an inevitable nuclear war with the USSR.  This book is so riveting from page 1 onwards, I found it difficult to put down.  The level of detail is remarkable, the storytelling is genuine, and the plot is riveting.  I'd highly recommend this for just about everyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's fun. I like all the new things I can find on there. I am a very creative person and Pinterest is a great place for idea's for everything from Anniversaries to Weddings!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I realize that this is a book intended for younger readers.  However, I wouldn't have liked it even when I was 9, let alone 59.  Cliché plot, one dimensional characters, flat descriptions.  I usually envision the people and scenes when I read a book; I literally saw this in Saturday morning cartoon animation.  I read it up to about 70% then skimmed the rest only because a book has to be insulting in some way for me to quit reading it.  Even though it's free right now, I wouldn't bother.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game. I can see why everyone is so addicted. I have to temper my time on it though...it's easy to sit for hours.
038533348X|5.0|I read this only recently, and was sorry to have missed out all these years.  A perfect Vonnegut novel. Captivating, unpredictable, wholly enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's ok. It's not real user friendly for someone that has no idea what they are doing. But then, being a grandma I am not one for games anyway. My grandkids I'm sure will be playing and they love the Minions. :)
0375842209|5.0|I find it difficult to read anything about the holocaust, so I was reluctant at first, but from the first pages I was hooked.  The first read is magnificent.  The second read is also magnificent, the pre-knowledge of the story and characters enhances the experience, rather than detracting, you know to pay more attention to certain details than on the first read-through, and the characters remain fresh and real.  I know for certain there will be a third, and fourth, and fifth read, with a few years in between.  It is a book that shouldn't be missed.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It is simple and efficient. Very easy to use.  I love it.  I'll try the other games by Brainium soon.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|from the soundtrack to the actors to the beautiful back round I highly recommend this beautiful movie. Love is a many complicated thing .
B000QCS8TW|1.0|After about 200 pages this book still hasn't managed to make me want to read more. I don't understand why it's become such a huge deal.  The plot skips around as there are like 6 different POV's at least. There's rape, child marriage, incest/adultery, attempted murder of a child and it's not an enjoyable book. I didn't particularly like any of the characters and just didn't really want to read more.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Hours of fun and recommend for kids of All ages!!! Easy to customize with your favorite picture as background!! Worth your time!!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I had this game... but it deleted itself and when I go to reload it, it says I already have it... SERIOUSLY??!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Different concept by the author. The story of a German foster family in Germany during WWII  and the narrator is &#34;death&#34;. Mostly about this young girl and her thoughts during those years. I feel it will make a better movie then a novel. But it's not to say I didn't enjoy reading it.....but there are better books out there. Janet B.
1400069289|5.0|Love this book. It helps you to be the best person you'd like to be.<br />If you're trying to change one thing, teach one thing, learn one thing<br />This book is worth it
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game is great, but consistent ads for Facebook and charging fees for extra minutes is disgraceful. I would gladly pay a one-time charge to avoid both.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I was unable to purchase this item at Best Buy, Staples and Wal Mart.  They recommended I purchase a new camera.  The camera I have works just wanted a new picture card.  I was pleased to find at amazon.com and receive it within a few days.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|seemed rushed, the characters were underdeveloped. Tris' and<br />Tobias' voices had no difference between them. The end SUCKED. I looked so forward to this book coming out, and my expectations were blown to bits. Terrible book, overall.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Very good app.  I have Rosetta stone and like this app as much or more than it.  Since this is free and the other is hundreds of dollars I wish I had found this one first.
031250926X|3.0|Ok item. I bought it because my girl friend recommended it. Maybe it's just my baby does not like it that much.
B0007KTBIU|1.0|I received two dvds in this package and only the second (with special features) worked. The first (the feature film) couldn't even start.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Kept me reading until I almost finished it.  Thought provoking .  Will be a great discussion for our book club.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I first read this as a teenager and didn't much like it - on reading it again some 20 years later I find it my favorite of his books after Salem's Lot.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Superb book.  I am actually slowing down while reading it to make it last longer.  It is SO good -- anyone who likes Secret History or Dickens -- tho not as obscure as Dickens.  Really a delightful read -- easy to read and interesting and suspenseful.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Informative and engrossing.  Goodwin makes these amazing men come alive.  One can't help but read the book in the context of our current political stalemate and make comparisons.  Despite many oversized egos, these were people who still put the good of the country as a high priority in making decisions and commitments.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Entertaining , first time to view this series was pleasantly surprised and will continue to watch and Update at later date.
B00457WZEI|5.0|A truly heartwarming story which gives the reader a feel for the horror of war and the beautiful bond between man and animal.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Happy 113th to Hitch... In spite of a studio having been compelled to do a shot for shot COLOR remake, it holds up perfectly well on it's own, although Janet's brassiere may date the film somewhat, there's no denying its still a classic (the brassiere & the film), although like Sixth Sense, you can't reproduce the first time experience for a screening and it's hard to avoid spoilers for it (even Happy Days has em). This is one of Hitchcock's most elegant and perfect films (in my opinion), exploring a fascinating array of characters, some gone too soon, or not even present, come to that. Food for thought: young Tony Perkins here is a twin for Amazing Spidey's Andrew Garfield.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app has helped me with Bordem and I can keep all my secret safe with a password. I can put all my creative ideas in one spot
B002DQLGHU|5.0|\\"You're a WIZARD, Harry.\\" The beginning of a fairy tale of a coming of age story crossed neatly with Joseph Campbell's Hero cycle. It's truly hard to imagine the characters today as separate literary entities from their long-time screen counterparts introduced here, much less without the great John Williams ubiquitous film score. Seriously, it's a strong first outing for the Wizard franchise, thanks in no small part to Williams' perfect score. Overall, a fairly true adaptation of the novel (but no mention of Hogwarts' Quidditch Cup, only the House Cup and some classes missing that I'd have enjoyed a glimpse at, like History of Magic.) I only wish  Terry Gilliam had actually gotten to direct it (imagine the swarms of CATS & OWLS at Kings Cross). Casting perfection across the board with the kids and adults, Robbie Coltrane (who I totally thought of as Hargrid after that bit as the Ghost of Christmas past in Blackadder), Maggie Smith rocks it as Prof McGongall,  the late great Richard Harris is my second dream-casting choice,  I wanted Peter O'toole for Dumbledore, I wish Alan Rickman had kept his 80's signature Die Hard beard for Snape, too. Warwick Davis' Prof Flitwick make-up seems too much, but it doesn't hinder an excellent performance in the Levitation lesson. Chris Columbus directs here, notice the similarities between this and an early project he wrote: Young Sherlock Holmes, I believe JK may have found inspiration there.
B00BWQW73E|1.0|I am a current employee at Amazon, working in the AWS division. &#34;Employee&#34; is technically accurate, but I feel more like business owner. Jeff and team have created an organization where truly innovative individuals can contribute to an exciting marketplace at a very exciting time. I love going to work every day, working in an organization that innovates, reinvents, and thinks outside the box on every aspect. This book gives a very negative view of Jeff and team in my opinion. It's missing all the awesomeness about why I love to go to work every day. It shows Amazon and Jeff as being a tyrannical evil empire, destroying everyone in its path. But Jeff demands the best from everyone, keeps everything data driven, and pushes us to really innovate in our respective businesses. That is inspiring and makes work awesome. In my mind, Stone missed the boat on what Amazon is really about.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|Good Book, I sometimes find the backstory stuff a bit slow. When the Sofie is at sea, that when the novel is at its best.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|Love the Arduino.  I decided to try the Due because it had more memory and I was maxing out my Unos.  It is not a trivial conversion but I think it will be worth it.  Some of the libraries need to be upgraded (or are in the process of being upgraded).  I needed to rewrite my SW serial to work with the new HW ports.  I have not totally figured out which of my shields can run at 3.3v on the Due whereas everything was 5v with the Uno.  My RTC is definitely not compatible at 5v only.  The SD slot on my Ethernet shield works, though I have not yet tried the Ethernet itself...  All in all no major surprises.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Just love this show! At the end of each show, I can't wait to see the next. The actors are great. I'm watching season 6 now. Not for young people! A lot of T & A and violence.
B000LJ9ZWO|4.0|I remember this movie back in the day when it first came out. At the time it was like the virtual reality technology of today.<br />I never would have thought a version of this type of programs could actually occur many years later. Although in the film, the program goes haywire. I liked it back then and i liked it now.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is fricing amazing I played this game for more than 20 hours this is an epic game worthy of 5 stars
B00B935SUY|4.0|Too bad it is not this simple anymore in the music world. The free spirit of the musicians of that time which created Classic Rock and hit songs that will last forever just does not exist anymore. This film is about a studio that began with humble roots but grew to be one of the most beloved music hit makers of it's time.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was a well written very funny book.  I've read lots of humorous books before but this one actually made me laugh out loud as I read it.  The author is one of America's gems.  (Full disclosure obligates me to admit that I have a crush on Ms. Fey but I have to say I am getting tired of waiting for her to leave her husband for me.  Still waiting but getting frustrated that it seems to be taking forever.)
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Everything is wrong with this movie. Except the actors. It is not dark enough to be of interest or light enough to excite . It is just suspended in between.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Nice product with a great price. Needs to work with more applications. Limited to Netflix, Hulu, You tube for now. I am sure Google will introduce more apps on CC in the near future.
B000ZELISO|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another excellent book from John Grisham! Quite a few unexpected twists and turns. Even better, it brings back some of the memorable characters from &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34;
B0042MEQVG|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|While I enjoyed the book, it seems to be unfinished.  The third part is a disappointing finish to what should have been a tale of enlightenment and struggle to make things right.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Aside from the beginning of the movie where it was a little slow, this was a really good movie.  Lots of action and how can anyone not like Captain America, the only mortal superhero. You can't go wrong.  Just make sure if you have any little ones watching that they know wjho/what RedSkull is and what he looks like - my 6 yr old at the time was scared the rest of the movie after seeing him.  Now she knows and at 7 had no problem with it.
B003FCMAS0|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is interesting to find so many things one one ap.  I think I will use it more in the future.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very entertaining and a good read.  Look forward to reading the sequel and other works by Jennifer Lawrence.  Well worth the time to read.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|Good, sound advice but a little too heavy on the anecdotes aimed at convincing the reader to follow the advice.
B00FLNQBTK|4.0|If you go into the movie with the right expectations, it is really funny. You won't walk away with any profound insights into deeper human thoughts and emotions, but you will laugh and have fun.
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|I love this movie!! No matter how many times I see it, I fall in love with the characters all over again.... I'm not a big fan of Kevin James, but he is just adorable in this movie.... you can't help but love his shy, quirky character....
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is addicting, fun, and way cool! I love it!!! My dad showed it to me and I was instantly hooked!
1455525839|3.0|I enjoyed this. Its an easy read and although not as layered as the best of the Pendergast books it held my interest and moves right along.<br />The mountain ski resort setting is fun and the Baker street irregulars ( and a 'new' Conan Doyle story ) woven into the plot add some interest.<br />That said, or heroine (SPOILER ALLERT) is just sometimes to stupid to live. That kind of made the whole book less enjoyable for me. I would prefer a strong & smart heroine.<br />All the same, its a welcome return back to Pendergast and away for the awful Gideon novels.<br />I hope they keep going in this direction.
076115678X|5.0|Hair is healthier than it has been in many years. Even my husband is using the advice of dumping the shampoo for cowash and we're both very happy with the healthier, more natural approach. Added bonus is that we both have dry skin and normally in winter our scalps get itchy, but not this year.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun and very easy.  I don't like having to purchase items in order to move along in the game and you will definitely need to make purchases through  the in-app-purchasing option almost at the start of the game.  Fun until that point.enjoy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham came through as always. Love his writing style. Has a way of getting you hooked until the end and then wraps it up completely.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was a great novel set back in the time of nazi germany to the present. It was a truthful look back at a time in our history that was horrifying. I would recommend!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|No spoilers--but this is a VERY different book than &#34;The Shining&#34;. To me, it is almost as if he melded &#34;The Shining&#34; with &#34;The Stand&#34;, made it shorter, and added a sprinkle of &#34;Salem's Lot&#34; in. Certainly, this a mature King--post Green Mile and Hearts of Atlantis. His scares are minimal, although when he delivers it is classic King. Unfortunately, most of this is at the beginning of the book, so if you are expecting the heightened scares of The Shining, go elsewhere. However, this book delves into some things that are quite special. As The Shining was autobiographical for King in his depiction of Jack on alcohol, the post-recovery King sorts it all out through Dan, the kid (now grown up) from The Shining. He, now, has to become a mentor to the young Abra, someone MUCH more powerful in The Shining than himself. It becomes an army of dead Shining against live Shining, which was way more sci-fi than I expected. Some scenes are the only thing a mature author could lend sensitivity too--his scenes with Dan, aka &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; helping his hospice patients come to grips with their death was simply masterful (makes me wonder if he is scared of his own death, since that is a theme in his books post his accident and post Rose Madder). Danny working the 12-steps was great and an insight into his own mind. My concern is that the novel rambles a bit--it reads more like a confession than anything else. And while that is best (the author should write about what he knows) I never felt scared in this book other than its opening. And I feel like *I* am lacking because of that. Because &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;, if taken on its own, is a REALLY GREAT novel. But.....and I mean this MOST sincerely....it is NOT really a sequel to The Shining. It is difficult, though, as the novels are SO different. It really is the logical conclusion (in a way) to the story. But The Shining is my favorite novel by him. I'm confused......I loved &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;but I felt disappointed as it being a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;. I was hoping, I think, for some earlier King.....King when he just wanted to scare the crap out of you and didn't really care about the heart of it all. I mean.....he is really a better author now. &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is actually masterful. I just....miss the OLD King. The younger and more cut-throat King. He has become the better author, but I miss Pet Semetary and Cujo (which he barely remembers writing because he was so drunk he didn't remember) and Carrie and......The Shining. OMG....The Shining was the best for me. Nothing ever scared me like that book. So, while a superior novel, &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; never really satisfied that haunted house/ghost story side of me which I was hoping for. Instead, I got a fantastic novel. A sequel to The Shining, yes. But far different than I wanted at the time. He has matured. He has become a great. But he lacks his earlier sadistic vigor in wanting to make us scream. I don't know if that is good or bad. Just different, I guess. For me, a 4/5 for a great book, but 2/5 for what I was wanting and expecting. It was thoroughly satisfying, but if you are looking for the scare of the original, you need to not read this. But if you do, you are in for a great read. Just don't expect &#34;The Shining, part II&#34;. It doesn't happen.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I LOVED this book, it was so interesting. I would definitely read it again, I believe it would make a GREAT motion picture!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I record music from my XM account and play it back later.  I frequently don't know what artist I'm listening to and used to hunt the lyric search engines for a clue.  Shazam has yet to be stumped.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story. I do believe in fate and this book only reiterates that. A beautiful simple story of the full circle of two peoples lives, their similarities, experiences and ultimately their endings.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie!!  Storyline is original and the acting is good.  Followed the book fairly closely.  Good choice of actors for the parts.
068817776X|5.0|Got this for my GF. She loved this book and was so happy when i got it. We were in the book store and they were asking for a lot of money for this book. She got it and read it in no time.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Lots of fun puzzles, and none of the looking for hidden objects boredom. Nice graphics too and easy to navigate.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Downloaded this for my wife.  She loved it.  It downloaded very quickly.  My wife, now, wants the second season.  Good download.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Very upbeat and just love the sound of her voice.  The melodies are nice.  I love to put her CD's on when working around the house.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King is back. This is classic King--a twisted mind-bending, time-folding story perfectly constructed ans cleverly knitted together. You'll enjoy this one
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app runs flawless on my Droid HD Maxx.  I have this game on my laptop but as much as I love the game, I just can't find the time to play it.  Having it on my phone allows me to sneak in a game wherever I am.  Well worth the .99 cents!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great story, great cast, great imagery, great dialogue.  I'm obviously a big fan.<br />This show has a continuing cult following, it was much better that it's original ratings.<br />One of the few (I think) Sci-Fi shows to be loved by as many ladies as men, showing it's broad appeal.<br />Only season one (partial) exists, it ran for 16 episodes before being cancelled by Fox Studios, mostly due to internal politics.<br />Enjoy it, best in HD of course.  Follow up with the related movie Serenity.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|Somewhere between 5 &amp; 10 moves it would start acting up. For ex  I could not put blacklist 7 on red 8. Kept insisting I use a wrong card from the free cells and wouldn't let me do it correctly.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's helped me enormously with keeping my kindle fire hd running smooth and clutter free. Every time it gets to a certain limit I'm reminded, junk files are tossed or apps I don't want anymore are uninstalled.<br /><br />It does everything it says it will perfectly plus its free!<br /><br />This is one app I'll be hanging on to for a long long time. :)
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun game, takes forever to build up..lately game is having issues saving my progress which is beyond frustrating. Otherwise a fun time killer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love  this game.  It made me feel like I could escape captivity in a Saw movie. Challenging yet doable.  Definitely enjoyable. I can't wait for more levels!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I was disappointed to begin with but episode 8 &#34;too far gone&#34; was one of the best yet. it has me wondering about what comes next. I would give episode 8 a five star all the way!

B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|downloaded this free Monkey Boxing game for my 6 year old grandson. He loves it and it's part of the games that he likes to play when he comes to visit me and hm my Kindle Fire.  Also you don't need to be connected to WiFi which is great so you can bring it with you in the car and still be able to play the game. That's a plus for me enjoy.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|wow so happy that Amazon finally allowed this game to go on the Kindle Fire: I love it thank you. It needs wifi and connects to your facebook game if you also play online. So happy that I can play this on the go and not have to have my laptop with me. Make sure it's the real Candy Crush:King this is the one that is on facebook. Have fun oh do you need friends? Susan

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Made you feel like you were really there in the middle of the story. Grisham is a gifted author.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|My whole family loves it. It's hard to say if its a better season than other ones.  To me every episode is so hysterical.
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|I have never read a book quite like this before and it will not be my last.  I enjoyed every second of it.  It was action packed and it had some very steamy scenes that I found myself rereading just to absorb all of the information.  The story flowed well and the characters were awesome.  They were all connected in some sort of strange way and after being apart for so long, fate or Parliament at its finest.  Can't wait to see how it all plays out in the end.  Great book and a must read!
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good but the &#34;buffering &#34;  the site was extremely annoying and disruptive to the flow of the movie.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Good movie, has it's over the top moments like you would expect.  I did enjoy the first one more as there seemed to be a bit more character development.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliance brilliantly drawn, brilliant average, brilliant again, silly, brilliant brilliant again, brilliant.  Then it was somewhat hyperbolic.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Good, catchy song. Basic pop music that's easy to listen to in the background. Nothing too special about it, but I enjoy it nonetheless.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Excellent Bible study tool! The best available on the internet or anywhere! I highly recommend this app and the JW.org website also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love to play this game on their Kindle Fires...Great for long trips or whenever they have a little downtime from all of their activities.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|It was a terrible movie. The acting was the worst. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. Blahh, Blahh, blahh.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love to play this game on their Kindle Fires...Great for long trips or whenever they have a little downtime from all of their activities.
B000T412OU|5.0|High packed action, excellent plot, well known names.  High-jacking Air Force One, a unique idea.  An overall great action movie.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My kids love to play this Uno game on their Kindle Fires...Great for long trips or whenever they have a little downtime from all of their activities.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|first impressions its the single greatest feeling joystick that stays on the perimeter of being not too small but insanely tiny at the same time. pros: the controller works exactly as expected on jailbroken phone using emulator. but the appstore doesn't really support this controller, jailbrake is a must to use it. another pro, it pairs with my phone in half a second cons: the built in recheargable battery has displaced itself from inside the joystick and i can hear it rattling around in there... I had to open the controller and slap a piece of tape on it, but that should have been part of manufacturing job BIGGEST CON: if you have iOS 6 this thing is useless as there are so few and so s***ty games that it supports. i do not know for iOS7 if it is supported. con: none of the developers making their games compatible to work with this device... if you want to try it on pc games, the analog sticks dont work well at all with most racing games.  only if you have a specific game that you love to play and need a joystick but you also know forsure this joystick is compatible, then buy it. or else its entirely useless (except for playing with it on jailbroken devices its quite handy there/or android)
B00A757EFW|4.0|My kids love to play this game on their Kindle Fires...Great for long trips or whenever they have a little downtime from all of their activities.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Information is excellent but style of writing is too textbooky.  Should take this very fascinating subject and make the telling of it excellent!.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|This group is an American treasure. I have been a fan for over 40 years. They are up with the Beatles in my opinion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is such a great book. Suspenseful with a surprising ending. Although it's a long book, King holds the reader's interest from beginning to end!
B00004TWZF|5.0|This is one of my favourite movie of all time. If you are tired with the same, tired pattern of current Hollywood offerings, this is the movie to refresh you! I was lucky. I got hold of the Director's Cut version very cheap afew years ago, during a video store's  closing-out sale :-) Jean-Marc Barr is definitely a thinking girl's actor; enigmatic, unbearably handsome and in real life, he is a brainy guy as well. Try to get this movie for your collection, you will not regret it. Important: Do not get the American cut -- get this one! (The Director's cut).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like the best ever.....the minions are cute and puts you in this super fly mood whooooooooooooooooo!!!!!! Goo minions I know some of you wished for a minion your self
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|There were moments when I felt like I was in the cockpit with him.  When have you ever seen a bad performance from Denzel Washington?  I'd see GIGLI if he was in it.
0307743659|5.0|Absolutely brilliant.  It's not just another horror novel, but a journey into the mind of a man coming unhinged.  King uses alcohol and Excedrin as his metaphors for evil, and as Jack, the recovering alcoholic, slow drinks and medicates more, so does he grow crazier and crazier.<br /><br />King somehow manages to make topiary animals and fire hoses scary.  A very difficult trick, but effectively pulled off.<br /><br />Recommended for any reader above age 8 or 9.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Just what you expect from a 007 movie.  Action, suspense, and wit.  The new characters introduced should be a fun addition in the next Bond movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple run 2 is very fun even tho I don't get a high score but it's the s****... you should try!!!
B00000DD35|5.0|This release here is a rare and out-of-print japanese remastered 2 cd set of New Jersey.<br /><br />This is the 1988 number #1 album that cemented Bon Jovi as rock superstars!<br /><br />After Slippery when wet, the bands next release is a true gem! Nothing on this album falls short of it's reputation as being Bon Jovi's finest album in the late 80s pop metal era. Songs such as blood on blood will really touch you and who can forget the number 1 smash hit 'I'll be there for you.'<br /><br />Jon Bon jovi 's voice on this album is so classic..by listening to the songs homebound train, i'll be there for you and living in sin, there are vocal parts of those songs where i believe he was doing some very high falsetto vocals. This is his voice at his finest or vocal peak.<br /><br />As for this listing, i always thought that these bon jovi 2 cd japan releases were only available as used cds, i was wrong! i bought this here in amazon from a great seller and got this album totally brand new even though it is very rare and out-of-print.<br /><br />Disc 1 we have the remastered version of the album.<br /><br />Disc 2 we get the bonus cd of these tracks; 1) Bad medicine (Live Wembley 1988),<br />2) Bad Medicine (Live Keep The Faith Tour), 3) Blood On Blood (Live Wembley 1988), 4) Born To Be My Baby (Acoustic Version), 5) I'll Be There For You (Live Lakeland 1989), 6) Lay Your Hands On Me (Live Giants Stadium 1989) & 7) Love Is War (Studio Outtake).<br /><br />Disc 2 is a keeper! Get this because it is one of the most essential albums you must have in your collection especially if it is a japan released version!<br /><br />There are only a few left being sold, so what are you waiting for?? Buy It!
B00FHB7398|3.0|This game is slow going. Moving from place to place within the game requires sitting through a &#34;loading&#34; screen. The game did freeze up on me once, but after shutting down the Kindle, the game decided to work again (at the point in the game at which it originally froze - thankfully)
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I put off watching this movie until recently.  I could not figure out how a medium-length book was going to require three movies.  Well, at least half of the movie contained material that was not in the book, most of it violent fighting scenes, over, and over, and over again.  My husband and I found it very tedious.  I fell asleep in the middle.  &#34;The Hobbit&#34; was, I believe, originally meant to be a book for young people, and this movie, with its gratuitous violence, is anything but.  I will not be watching the next two movies.<br /><br />I loved &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy, but not this movie.  Sorry.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Pretty good. They seem to lack a bit of warmth and presence but the sound is very flat with no booming bass. Not perfect but for the price I would buy again. Very sturdy construction as well.
0804162727|5.0|I'm a big fan of strategy guides.  It's not that I need the help to finish the game, I just like making sure I get everything found in the game.  I also love to read background information on the game's creation, maybe what the team was thinking when they did certain things, and any extra goodies that can be stuffed into a book.  A Link between World's is a big game for being on such a small system and this guide provides everything you need to not \\"go at it alone.\\"  Every collectible, heart container, etc. is documented in a very readable fashion with some nice images so you don't get lost.  The hardback version is a really attractive cover as well that looks awesome under the coffee table in the living room.  Finally, with the hardcover version you get a nice framed lithograph that looks nice hanging on the wall next to my game stack.
B005JJCMN0|5.0|Classic film and one of my all time favorites. Haunting story that foreshadows the disaster at Fukushima power plants melt down!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love this game and it works great on my 1st edition kindle fire! I put 4 out of 5 stars because it can be hard to earn the money to complete tasks in the game.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun and easy and free. Can't beat that. Hate all the pop-ups to help. Should be able to turn them off. Not all of us are dummies
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun!! Warning: it's extremely addicting! If you love the movie and especially the minions, this game is most definitely for you!
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|Was able to play through this entire game in one day.  Fun but WAY to easy.<br />Glad it was free.  I've liked other Fire Maple games and I was excited with the FAOTD was from this developer.  But Bleah, just way to easy.
0060555661|5.0|This is with out a doubt the Bible on investing.  Why use anything else? All you need to do is just follow his logic.
1607102110|5.0|I gave this as a gift. It is beautifully bound. The picture does not do it justice. The illustrations are also beautiful.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The 11th hour may be my favorite Matt Smith episode. I was instantly convinced he was The Doctor. The opening scenes with young Amelia Pond are brilliant. I am so glad I watched this season on Amazon Prime. When I found BBC America had heavily edited both the opening scenes and The Doctors speech near the end of the !!th Hour (whyohwhy?) I watched the entire season on Amazon Prime Instant Video.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Game is easy to use and very intuitive.  Terrific graphics.  Able to pay for equipment upgrades if you don't want to wait until you have points for them.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really liked Chris Eccelston as The Doctor. He seemed truly ancient, alien and kind. I liked that he was also conflicted between what he had &#34;done&#34; and his kinder nature. Eccelston brought a gravitas to what is essentially a silly character and made me care.
0393088804|5.0|Sacco's  vision is quiite extraordinary and his graphic skills demonstrate a complex view of the battlefiled and literally thousands of individual soldiers. This is the work of an immensely powerful and visually intelligent artist. It is a work of graphic genius.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved it !!! I really enjoyed reading the hunger games trilogy !! I love that you can download on kindle and read the same day !!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's the best because they have so much super heroes and upgrades and so much places to beat i recommend this game you will love it its addicting get it you wont regretted this
B00821OX98|4.0|It is fairly family friendly, no sexual overtones/content. Some violence obviously killing aliens and humans being killed by aliens. Decent show, good story line.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Awesome book to movie conversion. Peter Jackson's detail pays off. Must watch! Definitely worth seeing on bluray as long as you have a 1080p tv. Eyecandy
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Of emotion that I wasn't prepared for, but it was beautiful and I enjoyed the tears. I will hold this story in my heart always.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Amazing little thing. Works great, I've had mine for over a year now and it's still purring away. I use it to convert optical out of my Xbox360 to my surround sound speakers and for other audio conversions. It works great.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|awesome game I'm happy I got it I do wish I got it sooner considering I got it yesterday but I recommend getting it
B000E9910W|5.0|i didn't have any cd's of the doobies.  All my music was on vinal.  Nice to revisit and reqauaint and to have so many tunes in one place
B0076DELIG|5.0|his characters always have depth,,,always a moral dilemma.  and you get to love the history that goes way back..  first book i bought w/my brand new kindle.  i would buy anything this author writes.
B0024RID6U|5.0|always wanted this lp on a cd.  nice traveling music. the variety of the songs is nice and get's up started up
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|i always think i am going to like grisham,,,,and i am always disappointed.  his characters are cardboard.,,,and plot line predictable  i always hope that the legal aspect will carry it along,,,but not on this one
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Book club selection.  I adored this book from page one right up to the ending(at which point I went through handfuls of Kleenex). A refreshingly unique protagonist, flawed to the point where you are engaged from the start, involved with her struggles all along the way. Even the language of flowers was fascinating. The ending was as true to the character as the entire story, and (for all the tears), left me feeling cleansed and happy. Truly, one of the best reads this year.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's really cool because they're robots, it would be different if it was like human wrestling, but robots, c'mon that's pretty darn amazingly you ask me...
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I loved this movie.  I can not afford the HD cost but I loved the movie.  I have watched several times
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This is one of the greatest bands ever! Cd was in perfect condition and we played it all night long! Cd was shipped very quickly.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It was great.  Good adventure for the family during the holidays.  There is a great need for more movies like this for family time.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This game will not disappoint. The graphics are primo. I love all the different choices you have with the food that you can have on the belt. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!
B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset does occasionally produce great sound.  The headset is constantly plagued with resetting itself.  It will buzz, cut out and you will be left with no Mic and no audio for 30 seconds at a time.  This occurs at any battery level, with or without it being plugged in, and (despite suggestions on the forums indicating changing wifi channels) with or without Wifi interference.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I love this game is very fun and addictive... i recommend this game to everyone  in da world you wont regret playing thi  game....
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I think I liked this better than 50 Shades!  There were still steamy sex scenes, but it showed two different characters, each with demons of their own...which more closely mirrors that of real life people.  I loved it!!  I will be reading it again!  I can't wait for the 4th book to come out!  Nicely done, Ms. Day!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Wonderful book! I'm close to the end but not looking forward to putting it down. Wouldn't be surprised to see someone attempt a movie from this book.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is fantastic!  Yes, the sex scenes are steamy, but there was an actually storyline to it as well that doesn't get near enough recognition.  I loved watching these two deal with their inner demons and come together in every way.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game !!!! I love despicable me I have seen both movies! ! make a third movie please!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A great adaptation of the book.  Exciting, action packed and evocative. You don't have to have read the book to enjoy it.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|This was the most puzzling read I've encountered in quite awhile.  I have never read anything by<br />Donna Tartt before - have wanted to.  Tartt's writing captured me immediately, and I found her writing - in the first person voice of Theo, an adolescent, just excellent.  I felt like I could really feel all that Theo was describing.  Let me say - no spoiler here - that Tartt sets up a tragedy in Theo's<br />young life.  The book is long, but it seemed like a the plot was set up and so well through what I'll call &#34;the first two phases&#34; of Theo's life - in Manhattan, and subsequently, in Las Vegas.<br /><br />I found the story so compelling until about 3/4 of the way through the book; at that point, I honestly felt like Tartt got up from writing - left the room - and some other author stepped in.<br />I was just that puzzled by the final portions of the book.  It seemed as though Tartt set up an arc that could have been such a compelling and excellent story - that somehow came off the tracks towards the end.  I would still say - read it, but I have to say I was so very disappointed.  Several other reviews I read on my Kindle said they started just skimming towards the end - and I can surely see why.  There were loose ends that needed to be resolved, I thought.  So -<br />just a troublesome puzzle as this could have been great, it seems to me.<br /><br />.
B009O2XY12|5.0|fun game that keeps you coming back for more. Great after a busy day. This is an easy to use game.
B00847KFDS|2.0|This guy really did put out an incredible body of classic work, and the concept of this album could have worked, but it failed in execution. I saved a couple of mildly interesting cuts and threw the rest out.  Too countrified in an MOR way for my tastes.  Also some plain bad musical decisions that don't make sense, like the Foo Fighter style guitar solo on Fortunate Son that just wrecks the song for me, and I have nothing against the Foo Fighters, that solo would sound just fine on one of their songs but it's a WTF moment here, one of many unfortunately.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|fun game that keeps you coming back for more. Great after a busy day. This is an easy to use game.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|You turn a corner and you can not stop turning pages. Mr. Clone sets up a world class read.....cyborworld that is.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As with all wars,  the details are often so graphic and violent that they lack the ability to be explained.  An  those who live through them rarely see themselves as heroes.  So katniss finds herself living a nightmare,  and hoping that there is still a future , even if it's for someone else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game! Challenging and keeps you thinking ahead.  Nice to be able to send requests to your friends on facebook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Let me say something. Soooooooooooooooooo much better than temple run. In temple run you don't even know why the gorillas are chasing after you. Here it is clear. So much better than temple run. Buy it now. It also has fast download and when it's done you should go play with it right away. You will love it.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter - I did buy extra rubber bands and know she will love being creative with this.
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal is one of my favorite authors and this is his greatest work to date. You can find Holt on tumblr at fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com because he is an avid fisherman.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is my second Chromecast, I love the device, and would recommend to others.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />I have found that no matter what we do, if I try to stream video from a non supported site to the chromecast from my pc or laptop it bogs down the network on the Chromecast only and isn't view-able.  I have &#34;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band WiFi Gigabit Router (R7000)&#34; router and have used it wired with the Chromecast device in the same room and still the network bogs down on the Chromecast when viewing videos from a non-supported site.<br /><br />From Netflix, YouTube, or just a website it casts perfectly.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It was an ok movie but not a lot of suspense. I am glad it was a free movie and not one<br />I had to pay for.
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|We went and saw this in the movie theater and now that it's on sale at Amazon just had to buy it for my daughter this Christmas.  She just loved the move.  My wife and I thought it was alright which is why I am giving it 4 stars, wasn't as funny as Shrek.  With the all star cast we expected more.<br /><br />All in all its a good family movie with some decent humor.  My 10 year old just loved it which is also why it got the 4 stars.<br /><br />Amazon shipped fast as always...Ordered Wednesday it arrived Saturday.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like this game. It's a little different then how I grew up playing it but it's still fun. I would give it a five star except between every game is an ad. Gets a bit annoying.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|This is a great and wonderful 50th anniversary special!! 2 Doctors we know and cameo by Tom Baker,returning stars and an awesome story!!  Can't wait for the next new episode of Doctor Who!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I suffer with chronic pain and CCS is a super way for me to busy myself when i need to. My only wish is that I could buy the game outright...and not have to purchase additional turns!!
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Different take on a famous historical figure but quite enjoyable nonetheless. Especially good to watch in 3-D as the special effects really come to life in such mysterious ways. Worth checking out.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was an amazing book. I read it all in three days. Every free moment I had I read. I felt the need to keep reading. I was so involved with each character.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|One of the greatest Disney classics ever made. And even better in 3-D. Love watching this over and over again as the special effects are so great. Well worth buying this in Blu-Ray!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I just wanted to play bingo without all the blitz. I guess I should've chosen a different game. If you play more than one card, the cards are really small to read and no, I'm not 70 years old. I will search for a better, simpler bingo game.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|Great insight to behind the scenes  politics between both political parties. It shows that bipartisan cooperation can get things done
B004WOH19S|5.0|An exciting book spanning the lives of 2 power-hungry media moguls and the risks they take to outdo each other.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious. Nothing groundbreaking, but a whole lot of fun.  I liked that the actors all seemed to be having a good time with their roles too.  Just what I was looking for.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Disappointment was most definitely not an emotion that was felt during the viewing of these. For the actual 50th anniversary special, &#34;THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR&#34;, The amount  of excitement that was created in the making of the film was directly translated to the actual movie. Once again, Steven Moffat lived up to his expectations by forming this clever storyline with brilliant twists (though it might have been slightly hard for him to resist killing a main character). Either way, I cannot express my enjoyment and encouragement to view this, and I must say that mere words are nowhere close to being a direct expression of my happiness!
B00F2362IE|5.0|I first tried to download it and it did not work but I came back in a second and it said installing what the hay I am a girl and I love tmnt plus I am on a kindle fire that was off for a bit about a month or two so a glitches here and there
1401216676|5.0|Want more insight on the Joker and who or what he is? Pick this graphic novel up now.<br /><br />What happened to make him so inhumanly insane, so obsessed with smiles and death? In this way, but also many others, why is he such an antithesis to himself?<br /><br />It's all in here.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugely enjoyed this saga,, will be reading more from this authour...  Only thing that bothered me was how she knew how to swim in silo 17, since there were no swimming pools in the silos
1417776358|5.0|This is where it all started, where Bruce Wayne dies and a hero much bigger than himself rises from the ashes and being a part of it was more than rewarding.<br /><br />Most DC comic people know Miller is a god when it comes to writing comics (with the exception of &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again,&#34; perhaps) and this is one of his crowning achievements, but oh no the whole of the story doesn't just come from Miller's cold and brilliant take on a preventive Batman. The art of David Mazzucchelli fits Miller's Batman almost too well. It's brutal, cold, grey and bleak like Gotham should be. The art is dark and clever, like our Dark Knight.<br /><br />This is a must read if you are a fan of the Batman Mythos in any small part, I guarantee you wont be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loving this game, easy if you have patience for energy refills. Dialect in the dialogues is great and makes me laugh.
0143142364|5.0|Ken Follett what else is there to say??<br />I am a very big fan of historical fiction and history books in general. Barbara Tuchman, James Mitchener and Wilbur Smith all feature on my best buy list. Ken Follett is the king. I recommend this as a superb follow up to The Pillars Of The Earth which I am overdue to read again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A story that will touch and stay with you for a very long time. It's beautiful and painful at the same time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book left me in tears. My mom had cancer so it reminds me of her. This book deserves 5 stars.<br />So sad at times but at other times funny like when Hazel said You are paying a company to get cancer again tell you not being able to breath sucks. Those are not the same words.And when they egged Isaac girlfriends house and Augustus said get back inside or I will call 911.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|A beautiful, thoughtful, well-made film ...! The idea of getting a second chance, and whether you would take it... The idea of making amends, and what happens when you don't...Loss and hope ... It's a great, moving film !
141694737X|5.0|I discovered this book for my third child, and wished I had done so earlier.  What a delightful book this is!  It is on my top 10 &#34;must have&#34; books for toddlers.  You won't be disappointed.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Very informative, well written, not boring and easy to follow.  What's not to like?  Any history buff would enjoy this.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I'm not a Muscle Shoals native but have lived here for the the past 36 years.  I was familiar with some of the music history of the area, but this movie was very informative in filling in the back story.
B00GNL251C|2.0|English C.C. translation was so fast you could not read it and by trying to keep up with the translation you missed the cinema shots
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good story - excellent narratives and interesting characters - not overly preaching or lecturing - great for adolescents and their parents
B000LPS47U|4.0|Classic Cheesy Horror Movie, from B Movie Director Extraordinaire and the mind of Horror God HP Lovecraft. From before Zombies became a Cliche.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I've tried a few driving games and this is my favorite for the Kindle.  It's very easy to get started and there's a variety of courses and challenges.  I don't make in-game purchases and it hasn't stopped me from opening new levels, which is a function I appreciate.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|love it watch every season do not miss a season and i buy every season that comes out. the best
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book kept my attention and I read it in one day. Wrapped up the plot and the ending in too pat of an ending made the book seem shallow.
B005LAII0I|5.0|this is a good movie so it deserves this rating , i like fansty movies and this keeps you going though out the movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie, but as it turns out I loved it!<br />Very uplifting without being sappy.  Also my teenage daughter enjoyed it very<br />Much, and that's pretty good when you ting a mover both a parent and teenager<br />Agree on
1567184855|5.0|Adored this book. Lending to Mom. Will read again in a few years. You want this book. S'pretty dang rad.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I can't get it to work! I followed all the directions, but just not working' not sure if its the app<br />Or the User.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is our families favorite Christmas movie. We love watching it every holiday season. A movie recommended for all ages!
B008KE3960|5.0|Great time killer. Lots of fun to play but time flys when you're into the game. That's why I call it a great time killer.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Clarke reminds me of Harkins &#34;Brief History of Time&#34; only in fiction. Arthur was far ahead of his time, an inspiring writer.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|Possible spoilers!!!<br /><br />This show just does not let up. I think a large part of the tension arises from the knowledge that any character, no matter how important, can die--a MAJOR difference from most TV series.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this episode concerns the tank. Here we have a group of people made hyper-paranoid by the lifestyle they've been living for the last year or so, and yet they're so lackadaisical when it comes to camp security that no one hears a freaking TANK clank up?<br /><br />Still: 5 stars.
0823003590|5.0|I am an art teacher and love to recommend this book to all my student and friends. Have had at least 50 friends and students buy it so far! I also give it as a gift sometimes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey is full of surprises! TV Drama at its Finest! The first 2 seasons of Downton were great but Season 3 is outstanding. The series starts with great scripts from Julian Fellows. The show is perfectly cast from the head of the Crawley household to the lowest chambermaid.  The setting is in the Highclerc Castle, a working estate managed by a real Earl and his family.<br /><br />I could share more comments but I might slip up and reveal a surprise from Season 3.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00GME9AJK|2.0|Not a good movie of Job's life. Felt sort of rushed. Read the book by Walter Isaacson instead. Much better look at him as a person.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|Loved it even more the second time around! I watched this with a group of friends, some not even Whovians, and had an absolutely rousing time.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is the most amazing movie aboit Parent/Child LOVE Ever written, A Must for Every Film Collectors Library. Blah Blah
0525478817|5.0|Whether you think of him as Holt McDougal or as John Green, one thing you can be sure of is his talent. Gus and Hazel's story is amazing, and you will not be disappointed. (Though you may be disappointed that you bought it via Amazon.)
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is by far the best game I've ever played, I'm addicted to it! The controls are a little weird, but otherwise endless fun for hours and hours, making houses, mining underground, fighting mobs, exploring and soo much more! If you like Minecraft, I think you would really enjoy this game too!
0802473156|5.0|Why did it take me so long to read this? I should have read this a few years ago. Married for 27 years and will benefit from the direction in this book. My husband has the book in his hand. There will be discussion and changes in our household. I will give this to my children when they find a spouse. Such a simple concept, one many of us knew, but it is reinforced and validated now.<br />Thank you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends told me about this game 2 years ago and I've been playing ever since! If you play for a long time, it starts to get a little boring, but when the 0.8.0 update comes, I think it will be a nicer and even more enjoyable.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Really time consuming game I mean it is great I would've given it 5 stars if it didn't load so slow
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it most entertaining game for adults and kids!! Took a while before I tried it, now i am hooked!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I was unhappy that my friends who have an ipad play this game and I don't =,( but now am happy and I told amozon app store to make this game come out fast as possible so thanks amozon app store :-)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|downloaded the game for my grandson and he loves it, has a new favorite for now. Was angry birds star warz
B0055SWM08|5.0|It was very relaxing and fun to play.  It's difficult on some levels, but interesting to play.  I had fun playing it with my friend, even though it is not a 2 player game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works like it says it does.  Setup was simple. Worked flawlessly on my Android phone and my Wife's iPhone.<br /><br />For me, it's like a neat idea in search of a problem to solve.  What you can watch is extremely limited. That may change, so I'm not getting rid of it, but still...<br /><br />Issues:<br />You still have to fumble with the remote for the TV in order to turn it on and adjust the volume and change the input.  You might as well just get a Roku and a programmable remote.<br /><br />Should allow for headphones through the smart device instead of routing the sound to the TV.<br /><br />If you can play it on your smart device, using headphones or not, why not just do that?<br /><br />Tried to set it up on my desktop computer, but it wouldn't work because it said it needed WiFi.  WTF? My computer is 2 feet from the router and is hardwired to it for speed and convenience, but apparently if I want to send something from it to the Chromecast, I need to buy another USB WiFi adapter to transmit the 2 feet at a much slower rate just to make this work.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I bought the book hoping it would be uplifting but found the book depressing me as I read the chapters in the second half of the book.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Great first season. It had me sucked it with all its craziness. Sooo good I finished it in 2 days now I want to watch the others
B007CHUPHC|5.0|This book keeps me up all night even when i need to sleep  love to see how katiss grows as a character.
B00371XIJE|5.0|a really surprisingly good movie for the entire family --- no bad language, no violance and just a plain good old story told in a very nice way
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|It is a great movie to watch with the kids. You will laugh all the way though. It will not disappoint.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Yahoo Mail,<br />I find it very annoying when I  have to follow all previous messages. I also don't care for the &#34;me&#34; instead of my name when trying to see who got my messages. Some of my messages don't get sent when I click on send.<br />Very unhappy with the new format.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was very excited to read the last book in this trilogy. I really enjoyed the first two and had good expectations for the last, but ended up in disappointment. Somewhere between the pages of the second and third books, what could have evolved into a great love story and characters who were strong and fought for something worth fighting for became a recipe for disaster. The alternating perspectives in the storyline were comfusing and irritating. No real explanation was given for why Tris was so different and resistant to the different serums being used. Finally, Tris became broody and selfish until evolving into a character I really couldn't like, and the horrible &#34;Bridge to Terrabithia&#34; ending was just a stupid way to end a series.
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|I actually prefer this Goldfrapp to that of Supernature and Head First. I loved Seventh Tree and this reminds me of that. This album has cemented them as one of my favorite all-time bands. The music is gorgeous, Alison's voice is amazing, and her vocals just radiate through every song. I especially love Alvar, Annabel, Thea, and Jo. I love this album so much!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Exciting futurist adventure with surprisingly effective performances especially by Jennifer Lawrence. Make sure to see this before you go to see the second in the trilogy, Catching Fire.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|See title. The twists and turns for season 2 were great. I hope this show keeps going the way USA shows typically do.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|Cool take on the feasibility of myths and gods. Three stars should be taken as really good! Five is saved for the classics.
0439023491|5.0|I love this series soooooo much. Its a quick read but that was a benefit since I was trying to finish it a few days before the 2nd movie came out.
0525478817|5.0|I was hesitant picking up Mr. McDougal's &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; as I am not a big reader of Young Adult Fiction. However, I read his first work, &#34;Looking for McLaska&#34; when I was younger, and I couldn't resist &#34;The Fault in Our Stars.&#34; TFiOS (as the members of McDougal's internet McCult call it) is a tremendous McCess. I really McDug it. Holt McDougal is truly one of the greatest Young Adult Fiction authors of our time. Remember that name, Holt McDougal. You're going to be hearing it for years to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I 're-read this before going to see the movie. Now I'm not sure I want to see the movie because my expectations are so high. The book was amazing the second time around.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I am somewhat of a geek and appreciate all of the information I can get. After reading some of the reviews, I am concerned that battery life doesn't seem as long and may temporarily uninstall to see if there is a difference.
B003OBJV5W|5.0|Great!<br />Long concert- covered all hits from Disco and some from the 60's Surprised at good quality DVD. Enjoyed 100%
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I love this movie! Me and my husband pretty much have it memorized, it is SO FUNNY!!! The scenes with the neighbors and with cousin Eddie are classic!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This a great series. I loved it from the beginning of season one.  There are three seasons.  Many stories within the kingdoms, and exciting to watch.  Season four comes out this April, so recommend you watch or buy the series.  You will get hooked on it.. Fantasy, with dragons coming up in season 4, and similarities to English history in the &#34;Winterfell&#34; kingdom.  There are 7 kingdoms trying to get the 'Iron Throne'.
1423124960|2.0|The pages separated from the binding after only a week of use by a gentle 4 year old. The stories themselves are good, but the quality of the book is terrible.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I rated this book a 5 because i could not put it down!<br />Was written so well, an unbelievable story,  Im still asking friends &#34;what would you<br />have done?&#34; you are truely trapped in the characters heads and arent quite sure who<br />you should feel sorry for. This book shows how powerful the mind can be when words aren't spoken but kept trapped inside your head.  A great read, would refer to anyone.
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|I was not too impressed with the book. It seemed to go around in circles. Did not impress me.<br />Borrow from library.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|On of his best.  I could hardly put the book down.  Excellent writing very intriguing. About time he cam out with a really good book.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Like the older bond films better.  The new trend is far too serious.  I loved the lighter air of the older bond movies
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great site and app, however, sometimes it freezes for no reason at all. If you can fix that bug I would give it 5 stars!
B00GINENG0|5.0|The game is highly adictife game great for kids highly recomend for.anybody who does not want a pet but a family member does tom is so cute in the game!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting. Get this app because it is awesome. GET IT NOW. Then you'll think it is addicting. NOT KIDDING
B008JFLWLE|3.0|Basic math functions work fine, but errors always occur when using it for trigonometry or complex algebra. Not too bad, and kind of fun to use.
145210655X|4.0|got two books instead of one, is that how it was supposed to be? dont know if I was charged more or is $11.81 the cost of one.<br />@jeffrey brown
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|I loved this book. Beautifully written, and well honed characters. My father was a Japanese POW, and a times this book had me in tears.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME ITS FUN AND A GOOD BRAIN TEASER ALSO YOU CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE LEVELS AND DONT HAVE TO PAY TO GET ALL THE LEVELS THIS IS A GREAT GAME U SHOULD DOWNLOAD IT
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|It was a bit confusing at the beginning, because it is not a simple narrative with a beginning and an end, happy or otherwise.  It is beautifully written and every character (there were many!) is brought to life in an absorbing, gripping manner.  It is a tapestry of New York City woven skillfully.  The reader should continue reading; you won't regret it.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|The version works for me. I love this comic. Also it provides a preview for another story printed through Image. If you're a fan of the show, at least read the first issue and see the correlations!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Cool game and a lot of fun just needs more bearable equipment
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My rate is a 5 because I love this game soo much, Thu  game is the best. I'm am only on level 87.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I'm finally able to get my mail. Prior to this app, I couldn't receive email. I would recommend this to any gmail users.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is by far the best game I have ever played in my life I would totally recommend this game it's extremely fun to do when your bored but I wish there couldn't be a certain amount of energy you have until you have to wait until it recharges
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game it's so fun to play. REALLY, this game is very addicting I would play it all day
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It did not work or load at all. I kept trying to use the app and it really started to irritate me
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What more to say. Grisham at his finest. A huge fan of legal thrillers. He nevers disappoints with legal thrillers. Bought to read on my kindle and love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for bringing it to the Kindle App store. Ya'll should consider more Google Play titles to bring, show what these Kindles can do.
B003B02O0A|5.0|What more to say. Grisham at his finest. A huge fan of legal thrillers. He nevers disappoints with legal thrillers. Bought to read on my kindle and love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|We all have secrets and this book shows how people deal with those secrets and how sometimes those secrets effect their later life.  Great story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What more to say. Grisham at his finest. A huge fan of legal thrillers. He nevers disappoints with legal thrillers. Bought to read on my kindle and love it!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Watch the 3-D version of this movie instead of the two-D (which we rented).  The whole movie is a 3-d rendering demo - would be good for selling televisions as it is very colorful backgrounds.  Franco's oz was sleazy enough, but somehow his good-guy image made me think he was miscast.  The drama between the witches and figuring out which one was good and bad was the only intrigue in the movie.  A good twist on the original story, but not good enough to make it &#34;a movie worth buying&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I think this series is amazing.  It caught my attention from the very beginning.  I was a little upset about the ending but then when you think about it, the way Allegiant ended is what made everyone talking about the books.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Great performance, Michael Jackson was the greatest performer.  His music will always be popular. This CD collection was superb. I would recommend it to my friends.
B00E9ZATTY|3.0|It is a good pre-quel to Monsters Inc and has a number of tie-ins to the original.  I didn't find it as entertaining, but the first movie was very original.
145160713X|5.0|This book was explained to me as being &#34;like a very smart friend explaining physics to you over a beer.&#34;  That piqued my interest and I picked it up.  It turns out that's a perfect explanation.  Concepts are explained in a way that assumes the reader is intelligent but unfamiliar with physics, and with an exuberance that is totally contagious.  You aren't going to walk away from the book having learned complex concepts.<br /><br />The book is a joy to read, and gets the reader excited about science and the natural world.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Also, I recommend watching Walter Lewin's lectures on MIT's Open Courseware site.  His in class enthusiasm is even more inspiring than his writing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the limited usage experience I have had with this tool, it has done what I have expected of it.  It is small, handles everything I needed it for and is inexpensive.  When I don't have a better sharpener, it works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is fun for kids and adults. I have been playing for a few days. The minnions are hilarious and gaming is fast paced. Nothing bad to say really. Good time. Characters are a little pricy but for a free app they gotta make money somewhere. If you play long enough you could probably get some of the lower minions for free. It is still an awesome game!
B008JFUR10|3.0|Combo Godzilla meets Transformers.  Lots of eye candy and CG FX to fill-in for plot and acting.  The question is, if the Jaeger's weapons is what finishes the monsters, why not lead with what works instead of standing toe-to-toe and taking huge amounts of serious damage then using what works?  It is also odd to nullify the advantage of distance weapons by using them up close.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Will watch it several more times :)<br />Very confusing but still good. Must be all the timey wimmy parts.<br /><br />Spoiler: Bad Wold Rose!!!!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|If you are into zombie movies, this is very entertaining.  There are a few hiccups in story consistency and nature of the zombies, but it if you don't over think the details (hey, it is a zombie movie), it is a terrific ride.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I tried playing this on my slightly outdated smartphone and it wouldn't work. We bought a Kindle Fire and I was so happy to CastleVille on the apps list! I'm enjoying this game!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does everything I wanted it to do and then some.  Its a simple calculator, don't be expecting to work out calculus with this one.
B008ENA74E|5.0|How the mighty have fallen. Goldman Sachs is so greedy it`s ad sad ad it gets. Thanks Greg Smith for this.
B00BPQYWSO|4.0|Soulful album and voice with modern-day electronic accompaniment. This is a great album for long and cold winter days. I recommend the buy.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|i glad this series is as good as it is. i got done with sg1 and had a big hole in my tv life and this series has been a joy to watch
B002SRQ214|2.0|This product was extremely flawed by the mounting of the accompanying heat sink. In the past AMD used a lever action to hold the heat sink in place. That lever action required a simple easy twist to lock in place.<br />On this product some &#34;genius?&#34; replaced the simple twit with a movement requiring a push and twist. That added pushing caused the CPU to slip from its mount and bend pins. Voiding the warranty. To bad AMD does not stand behind its design flaws.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I like the idea of this diet. I'm just not sure I can do it but will try.  The book is easy to read and makes a great case for the success of the 2 day a week fast.  Gives a lot of information to help you through the process.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I love this song!  It's on heavy rotation in my ipod, especially when I'm exercising. Just a great feel good song.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|It starts out really slow and boring and didn't improve much.  Certainly not like the other Gilbert books that I've read...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great Stephen King novel!  It's more than I had expected, but so typical Stephen King. Picks up where The Shining left off.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I am the mother of an 11 year old who calls this her favorite book. In preparation for the Broadway musical, I decided to read in. I was so surprised! Matilda is a very charming story. It empowers children to believe in their talents and to read. I highly recommend it.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|My brother loves this cd. Sad thing is the case came cracked, it wouldn't have been a bad thing if this wasn't a gift.
031236198X|5.0|Almost any book by John Kotter is a good book to have. This small book is informative and breaks down change management into small easily understandable chunks. There is a lot of change knowledge packed into a small space within this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham is always a good read. I liked this story, although the plot became rather transparent as the characters were introduced.
B001TMCBI2|3.0|It was a gift. Not vey doable, I was told. It does have good information, and advise. But the average person can not afford the treatment.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I git the audio book first and it was good so I bought this on sale. Even at 20% into it I had gotten more stories than the audio version. I also already had voices in my head for most of the characters from listening before. Very well put together a lot of the stories intertwined even if the people in them didn't realize it. I highly recommend this book.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Disney movies are by far one of my favorites, and with Planes they have gone above and beyond.  I purchased this for my baby daughter's collection and we ended up watching it over Thanksgiving with the entire family.  Everyone from my 7 week old daughter who loved the noises to my 80 year old grandparents love the movie.  Quite a few adult humor moments but all of which are clean and lots of fun for the kids.  The maker's of Cars outdid themselves with this one.  A humorous underdog story that's fun for all ages.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|The Matrix is one of the best movies of all times! I honestly don't like Keanu Reeves but even he couldn't ruin this story and he actually fits the character quite well. I wish I could be badass like Trinity! :)
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This game is very funny my childs play It too, and enjoy it! I like games that helps develop lateral thinking.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Not their best season so far (I'm on episode 6) but I still want to keep watching the show to see if it will still pick up the pace.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Exciting and suspenseful, but the comedy aspect of the movie is out of step with the violence and killing depicted. This must be the new generation of action comedies. It could only receive five stars from someone over 30 with the mentality of a 12-year-old. The four-star rating is mainly for respectable acting jobs by the entire cast, otherwise two or three would be appropriate.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|What a pleasant surprise. One of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Laughed my butt off quite a bit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good read and very intense. Could use some better writing. Katniss is the best and she saved peeta. Best of the books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The hardware is impressive.  It does a lot for a little piece of hardware.  I use it for Netflix, HBO Go, Youtube.....<br /><br />If you have an Android phone or tablet, this is a must have accessory for your TV.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Can't rate a game that won't install. Never encountered this problem. Note 3 and game won't download? Very odd. Zero stars.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|I love the gutsy heroine and the sassy horse. It's about time children's movies had more great female role models!
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Full of action and good story behind it all. I enjoyed it and sat on the edge of my seat several times.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This version of injustice allowed me to play one of my favorite games on the PS3 while traveling. Was a blast fighting through these battles on the plane knowing I was unlocking additional features on the console version.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|A classic that I have watched twice in eager anticipation of the next season.<br />You won't be disappointed wit this purchase!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great but needs more content. what else can i say? Great price and does what it is supposted to.
B00CNFBT3C|3.0|BAD DVD: Disappointed in a couple of dvd's had distorted images & sound, thus missed valuable context. Quality control lacking.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This one was brutal - dark and chilling - and nerve wracking. Very well constructed and the twists will leave the reader gasping for more. The winter is truly coming...
B009ZNU15C|5.0|This is a spectacular movie. Robert De Niro plays the good guy for once and has to deal with a son who has been corrupted by the local mob. Movie is definitely one of my favorites all time! Definitely recommend getting it if you love all the classics like: Casino, Goodfellas
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Very nice entertainment.  If you like action packed fantasy, this one is for you.  The HD effects are awesome.  Enjoyed this a lot.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|This is Drake's third and best album yet! As an avid music listener Drake is really changing the game with his singing AND rapping and really makes the music hit close to the heart. Cannot wait for the next album, and all his new music in between!
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This movie is a classic.  You don't need me to tell you that.  There are very few movies that I will watch twice.  This I could watch twice a week and still laugh.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Daughter absolutely loves this movie and wanted to add it to her movie collection.  She says this is one of her all time favorites.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I love TripAdvisor, it's has been so helpful when planning a couple vacations.  Buyer beware....be sure to read all of the reviews before making judgment based on the rating.  Because what some people think are important wouldn't be a problem for me...there are professional complainers out there.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing and suspenseful.  Makes you think through out the whole movie.  There are some sad moments.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love love love Dexter. I have all the season's and enjoy them all.  During those long winter month's....  it is one of my go  th to series I pull out to watch...
0804161380|5.0|Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the &#34;upside&#34; based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol
B00393SFU2|5.0|&#34;M&#34; is a German expressionist film directed by the auteur Fritz Lang. It's the story of a child murderer, played brilliantly by Peter Lorre, and the people who are trying to track him down.<br /><br />Visually, the film is stunning. Lang uses shadows, and sound (or the lack thereof) to add to the tension created in the film.<br /><br />People who are serious fans of cinema DEFINITELY must see this.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good story and very good acting from Jennifer.  Watched again before seeing second one at the theatre and thought it was better than the first.  (12/1/2013)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must watch. Great cinematography, characters, writing and quotable lines. If you've enjoyed Breaking Bad, this is right next to it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two books. This one fell completely flat. The characters became less relatable, and I could not even tell the difference between Tris and Four's voices. The ending was anticlimactic and gave no sense of closure to any plotline in the entire series. Very disappointing.
1591843065|3.0|Fine - but there were several pages (10-20?) folded together (clearly by accident; maybe the book was dropped edge-down at some point) which made the whole thing seem _very_ used; not quite what I was expecting.  I *like* books with individual page corners folded -- I like seeing what other people found interesting.  Big clumps of bent pages is an entirely different matter.  I wish the condition ratings included this information.
147676459X|5.0|Beyond its hilarity, which I knew going into it, H and 1/2 in book form is very well produced. The images are vibrant and enticing, and flipping through the prose is actually quite enjoyable, I dare say more so than the blog. Many many thanks to Allie and her editors that forced her to do this. This book makes an excellent present for anyone with insight and a great sense of humor.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|&#34;Planes&#34; is a Fun movie, but too much like &#34;Cars.&#34;<br />Some parts are very funny while others are direct rip-offs.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Worth watching for all adults. G.I. Joe is one of those movies you just can't get up from. Definitely a great watch for a family that likes great action movies.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I absolutely love it! It always puts me in a better mood when I watch it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Love the movie. One to watch if you like great action. This movie is definitely worth the watch. I don't usually set down and watch an entire movie, but I did with Iron Man 3.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am addicted to this game. I haven't had any technical problems or any problems for that matter. I recommend it if you love hidden item games, it can be challenging.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If you have to use profanity to make your point, it wasn't a very strong point. Each page makes the point weaker and weaker.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is amazing. I think anyone can enjoy the storyline and the closeness to the actual book. Must see for everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you know how to play Temple Run this game is for you.  It's just like Temple Run but you don't have to turn your divce to turn.
0385528787|5.0|Everything I've read by Margaret Atwood has been good reading.  Her novels are well thought out and easy to read.  MaddAddam: A Novel was the third in the MaddAddam series.  Each of the three can be read alone, but if you read them in order, each novel builds on each other with information that is helpful in understanding what you are reading.  MaddAddam:  A Novel is set in in near future after society has collapsed and how mankind survives is well written and is fully fleshed out so you can follow each character.  A very good book.
B00GQ7OZR0|1.0|This seems to have been thrown together piece by piece. Stitched together with barely believable connections. With all the secret stuff they do, it never occurs to  Dexter and Hannah to disguise her? Like that federal Marshal won't figure it out right away? Is Dexter still a killer up north? What happened to the code?<br /><br />Did they switch writers for season 8? Did they drug test the writers? Seriously, this was a disappointment.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent book.  If you've seen the movie, the book is very different.  I prefer the book to the movie (I suppose that's often the case) and enjoyed the first person perspective as the zombie infestation spread globally.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|5 Year old loves it. Worked exactly as advertised. No problems with this item at all, I would recommend this item. Not much else I can say....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game with a bit of a challenge Super fun for all ages to help with.  We play it as a family game.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter had this app on her iPhone and i gave it a try.  I bought it for my Droid and I don't see any difference in play.  It is a progressive game and does require some intuition and medium brain work.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love this game wish it loaded better.  I tend to play this online for that reason and it tends to crash often and not sync with my FB account.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is is the best!!!! Trust me I had it for 5 months! I like finding the hidden caves the best.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Quick reading, I enjoyed some of his other books, so have gone back to his first and will follow through with his others. Its a fun book, not believable , but it is not supposed to be
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of the best shows ever. No cheesy zombie horror here. This feels more like what a real zombie apocalypse would actually look like.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book within a total of two days where I used every ounce of my free time to read. I can honestly say that it was well worth the read. It was sad and romantic and funny at times. It was also true...a messed up story about what an illness such as cancer can really cause. Needless to say, it's a wonderful novel! (Even though there were times where I wanted to throw the book at the wall...)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not normally much of a game player, but find this game pretty irresistible.  Lots of fun and quick rewards.  I changed from resisting games to enjoying. Candy Crush Saga.
1426308469|5.0|My 2 yo son sleeps with this book under his pillow. It is his FAVORITE book by far! He will spend hours flipping pages and already knows the names of so many dinosaurs that it boggles my mind. He has also learned size categories (small, big, giant and gigantic), that some dinosaurs are meat or plant eaters, and he likes looking at the map in the back, too. Great book for inspiring little readers to engage in books with simple text and colorful pictures. He is even learning numbers so he can find specific pages! Did I mention that he is only TWO?!! I love this book!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|7 yr. old loves it, but so will every Star Wars fan or Angry Birds fan!  Great price too!  :-)
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ivan's latest escapades. It is refreshing to read some of the secondary characters story lines because we(the readers) love them too
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I ordered this as a birthday present, and it came in plenty of time for the party. The disc was perfect --no scratches or skips. I highly recommend this seller.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Thank you, I enjoy it. It is very nice and easy to use. Nice way to spend some time working the puzzles.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Very touching love story.  Many who did not like this movie are able to get past the singing and see what the story is about.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app teaches a language using the same technique as Rosetta Stone, which is very effective! I love it! It's fun and very easy to use, with currency obtained by completing lessons and a store to buy objects that help with your learning.  Everything needed to learn a language is here!  Not a beginner? No problem!  Domingo allows you to take a test to start you at the correct level. And if a lesson is too easy, skip it by testing out, saving you time to learn more of what you don't know. I highly recommend this app for anyone looking to learn or practice a new language.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Awesome puzzle game ....really like that you can choose how many pieces you want your puzzle to have<br /> And the puzzles are awsome
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book it is a continuous suspension of wonder and it questions your perspective and what the author wants you to think it a perfect book for anyone. Trust me this book is for anyone that is looking for something to talk about nonstop and that will keep you on the edge!!!!! If you don't end up reading this book then you are missing out on SO MUCH !! ( P.S. you will never know the real truth behind it in the movie) AND THANKS SO MUCH JAMES DASHNER!!!!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This video was excellent for instructional usage in a college class on the topic of Autism.  The students were engaged and able to identify learning tips from scenes depicted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Because it's fun no matter what the age of the player. I love playing this a fan  with my kids
B00005ASOC|5.0|This was an excellent video for usage in a college course.  There were lessons regarding the differences in schools in underprivileged neighborhoods versus thoses with financial means, prejudice, motivation, integrity, effective teachers versus bias ones, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome and challenging and you have to act fast. It is fun and I love playing against my family and friends.I love to complete missions and daily challenges and collect mystery boxes,trophies,eggs,Christmas trees and so on based on the holiday and where you are. Subway surfers is for everyone of ages and even fun for adults. The setting of where you are at changes once in a while. Sometimes it could be intense but that is good. Trying to beat a high score can be very intense.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|The dialogue is formulaic in places, there's some weak acting in spots, but I enjoyed the heck out of this.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Cute game however earning coins verses buy... I prefer to earn them.  This is ok for passing time...really nice for kids
B005NS0VNU|5.0|This CD has the classic REM songs as well as some that are new to me. If you are an REM fan, you must have this CD, as it is a great compilation of all your favorite tunes. I'm very glad I bought it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is a good adaptation of the book.  Loved Jennifer Lawrence. Well directed and produced. Looking forward to the next movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Things are not ever how they appear. No one ever knows the truth about a marriage unless they are in it. This book is a prime example of both truths.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I used to drag a white noise machine with me when I travelled. Now I just take my KF and this app. works like a charm.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|The script or plot was just average at best, actually a little disappointing. In hindsight it was not worth my time, wish I had watched something different. If you have lots of time on your hands and nothing else to do, then watch it.
B00FMZ22CM|1.0|Does not work at all on my Kindle Fire HD. Comes up blank.  Looks like I've lost my 199 &#34;coins&#34; .
B00B5HQL50|4.0|The action, story and acting were completely intense and intriguing. Skyfall provided more background to the enigma that is James Bond.
B008OE05IG|5.0|The film  reveals the joy that comes from working hard and producing a product of perfection.  The viewer also gains a great appreciation for the care that goes into the making of excellent food.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game! Its fun addicting satisfying and easy to play,  I am constantly trying to grow my village.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game for kids and adults.  My grand kids love it and I play when they are not here.  Download for some fun play time for everyone.  Very good graphics.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The ending killed me! Like, WHYY!?? I mean I guess it makes it better.<br />I still recommend the book. Overall the series is a good one!
B005LAII8A|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|READ IT! Like OMG This series is sooo addicting! Like, I keep buying book after book.<br />I'm sad because I'm almost finished! Its that good of a series!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Excellent sequel.  Great cast with end to end action.  A movie that allows one to just sit back and be entertained in spite of multiple characters
B00A83075M|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was great I really enjoyed it and the movie was super could not put it down was you strated it I listen too it and read it
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Have not seen this one, but knowing my child she will love this as well. Can't wait to see her eyes at Christmas.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I heard many people talk about  this final book before I finally read it myself. Like George R.R. Martin, Suzanne Collins is not afraid to take her characters where she feels is natural to the storyline.  Some dreamers want everything wrapped up in  neat little package but life isn't always like that. The author makes us see this dystopian future for what it was meant to be, full of love and heartbreak, a story of the human condition. It's well worth the read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent storytelling!  Khaled Hosseini always writes to bring you into the story and make you feel like you know the characters and locations.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was a bad blood bhhbh ft th vfh f h th high/ gunfight high by bc f th r Bryn c.f.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is an EXTREMELY handy app to have on your phone or tablet.  In meetings, I can just click with my phone and save important information from a piece of paper when making copies is difficult or impossible.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Very good acting.  Excellent story (although not quite traditional).  Loved the fact that this movie provided more up front information on Krypton.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|Boring.  Many others out there are far better than this one.  I will be uninstalling it.  It was OK for the FAOD but I certainly wouldn't pay for it.
B00DG86ARK|5.0|What a great band, what a sonically beautiful concert.  I love all these songs, but in this concert they just sound so much better.  These guys truly love what they are doing and what they are playing.  The brotherly love that you get from these three, they must of beat on each other when they were younger.  LOL  Just a great show!  I highly recommend this one on Blu-ray!!
B008469DGY|2.0|This have very little to do with the game of golf.  There are far better golf games out there than this one.  It is essentially a driving range, but is timed and eventually, it turns your view away from the hole so you have to spend precious time re-orienting the target.  A waste of time and precious tablet/phone resources.
B00FWB5G1K|5.0|The best Flower Kings album in years.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  I love everything these guys do, but this album just kicks butt all the way through from beginning to end.  Great sounding, excellent mastering and great song writing.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It isn't bad. I have a feeling the whole use real money thing is a pain in the butt. Don't recommend using real life cash.
B005MRXS78|1.0|I wish it had worked because I need a unit that I can control from behind.  I have order and received and sent back three units because they were defective. :( fast panning and such would be no issue in my situation.  I am operating a webcam used for broadcasting a church service and I wanted to change to have only one webcam and to move it to two basic locations which are far less that the 180* range (actually less than 90*) but the other Logitech cam I had bought to do the job you must be standing in front of the camera and there is no computer interface.......  Aggravating.......
B005KDWUFA|2.0|I prefer their earlier CDs. They were  formulaic--starting with one singer and adding the others and always ending in a huge crescendo, but the music was just prettier and less edgy.
B001NBEWN6|5.0|I had wanted to read The God of Small Things for a long time, based on the excellent reviews and awards it had received.  I was not disappointed. The reason I finally stopped putting off reading it was that a few weeks from now I will actually be in Kerala, where the novel is set.  The book accurately portrays the political context of Kerala, which was unique in that it was the first place a Communist Party came to power through democratic elections.  But many of its followers found that parliamentary power did not translate into the social change they had demanded, leading to a split from which arose a rival Communist Party that did not shy from armed struggle.  Arundhati Roy's use of language is poetic and beautiful, but what gives her novel its real power is her social consciousness.  The story she tells is in many ways a beautiful one, but no socially conscious account of Indian society can avert its gaze from its repugnant aspects. Low-caste and out-caste people in India suffer not only from impoverishment but also—and perhaps more so—from outrageous injustices in the face of which they are helpless.  A central incident of the novel focuses on one such injustice—a small one in the greater scope of things, but horrible nonetheless.  A friend said that the account of the injustice rang so true that he found it painful to read, and therefore wished he hadn't.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|I love The Offspring and this CD is another great sampling of their music.  If you like The Offspring then this is a definite buy.
0385474547|5.0|I used to teach a standard world history survey course.  Its scope was so broad that it was jokingly labled the &#34;Plato to NATO&#34; course.  The curriculum was set by the university, but I was able to choose the books I wanted to teach from.  For the most part I used textbooks, but I could find no textbook that was anywhere near as effective as this novel, Things Fall Apart, in making the reality of colonialism in Africa comprehensible.  Relatively few works of literature really merit the much-overused adjective &#34;great,&#34; but this one certainly does.  A few years ago the New York City Public Library put on display what it called the 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written.  Alongside the Bible and the Koran, and works by Isaac Newton and Shakespeare, was Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe—a richly deserved honor.  I want to also recommend a sequel to Things Fall Apart that Achebe wrote entitled No Longer At Ease.  The sequel does a brilliant job of depicting the social reality of post-World War II neocolonialism, and does so as powerfully as its predecessor had depicted the earlier form of colonialism.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game better than most out there. Great graphics. Takes more skill than most games out there. I enjoy playing it.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|&#34;The Goldfinch&#34; is a page turner.  While the events in the novel demand suspension of disbelief, it is, in Marian Moore's words, &#34;an imaginary garden with real toads in it.&#34;
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|A new twist with an aging Bond.  AND a reboot of the MI6 characters--what's not to like?  Only 4 stars because the villian has been done before.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|a great Kindle app. I use it as an alarm and when I am not reading or playing games it is on my screen
0316322407|5.0|One of the best books that I have ever read.  I feel that I know so much more about an area that I really did not know much about.  Malala is fantastic in her endeavor to get an education and to educate.  Our world is better for having her.  I highly suggest that  you read this book.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This is my second time I've watched this and I liked it just as much as the first.  The acting could have been a little bit better; however, it was entertaining.
007174889X|5.0|It's more of a medical encyclopedia really -- comprised of 2 volumes each with well over 2000 pages of fine print!  However, it is an excellent reference tool over the course of your studies and is a must-have for anyone pursuing primary care/ internal medicine.
B0055SWM08|4.0|We have had a very good time playing this mind tease. The overall game is great but when you very first start the tutorial could be work on a little. Maybe by adding a key you could go back to for easy reference.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It makes me crazy just when I think this is nice &amp; easy bam it gets wakey again.<br /> You don't see it but the solution is right in front of you, and then it's gone.<br />  Crazy.......right ?
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I adore the music!  Beautifully performed by the entire cast, especially Lea Michele (Rachel Berry)!!!  I bought all three of the Christmas albums from the Glee cast, and love every minute of them!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Well written and riveting from the first episode.  I watched all of the first season in one day.  Cant wait to see the other seasons.  A little dark, but seriously well done.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like this game a lot. It starts out fairly simple, but each level ups the ante. Requires changing up your strategy in order to progress.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved the book, but some of the cinematography was a little hokey. I was not a fan of Peta's casting, though by the second movie he's much better, so it makes sense now.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very good story great acting and lots of drama. Hope that prime picks up all the episodes so I can watch them all even the current season
B002N5N4M6|4.0|LOL funny, has me cracked up every time I view it. A real slapstick funny series to get hooked on
0307352153|5.0|Very well written!<br />Subject matter is fascinating and explains in a simple way some the social issues experienced in different settings.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Very funny movie and totally worth buying! Lots of language and graphic parts. Not suitable for kids. Would recommend for any adults that love comedy movies!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Was skeptical to watch it after the terrible pg versions of Xmen that preceded it but was pleasantly surprised at how close to the comic book origins it used. Great use of the classic story and adaptation of the meetings of the beginning characters.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well done and exciting story.  Was able to get outstanding deal on Amazon, as well as showing up free in my &#34;prime&#34; because I took advantage of the &#34;deal&#34;.
B00CBT048Q|5.0|I usually order blu ray movies only when they come with the Blu Ray, DVD and digital copy for my iPod/iPhone. Wish I could get the whole set like this in one box but buying the other two won't be that hard. Seen some decent prices for the other two movies in the same package on Amazon.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Never saw it when it first came out, but when part 2 came out, my wife insisted we watch the first one.  Can't believe I waited so long to see this.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is easy to learn and different each time you play. All ages can play & it is not exceptionally competitive.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Book One had all the excitement, Book Two was the continuation of the story-Now Book Three was so predictable that 1/2way thru I was hoping it would end!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This book was pretty good it was about an old guy in Mississippi leaving money to his housekeeper, a black woman named Lettie Lang instead of giving his wealth away to his children. The book had some interesting characters, a good plot, and finished with a somewhat surprising ending. You could probably see how it would end about half way through the book but you'll like it.<br /><br />I've never read a &#34;legal&#34; book before and it was a good new read. Try it if you've never read a book solely focused on a legal case.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Great background on what happens prior to the first Halo game. Ending wasn't phenomenal, but still a good read. Recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Its ok as it streams Youtube videos easily...unfortunately very limited use other than what this device offer...pretty much just use it to stream Youtube as I dont have or use netflix. For what its worth...I think Roku is still better (its just they dont stream Youtube anymore)
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The watch quit working after 4 months of use and can not return it.  It has a return policy of 1 month.  It should be atleast 1 year.
B00ENYCQX8|1.0|It was working good for a few days then it just stop working.  The book was at s good part goo.
6305882592|5.0|My favorite movie of all time.  If you haven't seen it you should, if you have, you know you want a copy.
B0073COMKW|1.0|I bought a EVER 10 Watt 60 watt bulb and it was just what I wanted, bright and a nice color. Because I liked the first one, I ordered another. The second bulb was dead on arrival. $10 per bulb is too much to pay for a bulb that might work.
B00008S7KC|1.0|This DVD does NOT work in DVD players. It will work in your computer or laptop just fine, but does not work in any real DVD players. Makes me suspect this is not a real version of the DVD.
B003M70O5O|5.0|The show has good dramatic writing--assuming you ignore the errors concerning modern forensics.  Too many times the MC's club-members spit in the face of an enemy they've killed for any of them to be riding free.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This film  was SO CUTE and I would watch it again and again. Can't do without any Monsters Inc. movie! :D A+++
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Goes everywhere with me.  I have used this bag for well over a year now.  It has taken several international trips with us and has held up great.  I love the fact that it has customizable compartments.  Would buy it again if I had to.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I was totally entranced into the year 1927. I had no idea how much happened of significance  during that year. Well written and interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Can't wait for more content to be added to this device.  For only $35 it takes your dumb tv and makes it a smart tv.
B006TLZNDI|5.0|Just an amazing movie. I am not one to watch a movie more than once, but after renting this movie, I plan to buy it so that I can watch it again and again! Has become one of my all time favorites.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As I read this book I found that I definitely hold myself back in my professional life.  I even read passages to my husband and he agreed that I don't &#34;lean in&#34; enough.  This book is a true motivator and is a must-read for all women.  Men will benefit from reading this as well!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I haven't been able to make it work satisfactory with my windows laptop and not at all on my Ipad except individual sites that are providing support. I'm hoping Apple and Google will get together to allow this to work from the browser so I can use my Ipad with my TV. My desktop running Ubuntu and Google chrome works flawless but it is in another room so not as convenient. Picture and audio quality is excellent.
B004132HZS|4.0|Love the tv show.  Going to get season two for a gift for my husband.  That will put a smile on his face.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I'm playing this on a kindle fire hd, the games is awesome and I love the graphics!!! I can't stop playing :)
B006AX6ONI|5.0|If you expect the attitude from Shark Tank, you will be surprised. Mark remembers where he came from and is pretty honest about traits do success.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read.  Like he says, it is a get fired up to work read, not a step by step guide.
0545128285|5.0|This was purchased to go with my collection of the Harry Potter Series as a collection item for me.  It put me in the mind of something along the lines of Aesop's Fables.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Really works very well. I was a bit hesitant at first but it's a very simple connection and pops off easily if you catch it on your foot.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This was bought for a Christmas gift and has not been opened yet.  I presume the DVD will play okay.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you love John Grisham, you'll love his latest, which is actually a sequel to A Time to Kill. For us, it's twenty years later, but for Jake, it's only three years after he shook the little town of Clanton, MS. I loved the how this story comes full-circle, and you will, too. Great read.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|this was bought for a Christmas gift and has not been opened.  The plastic seal is in tact and I am presuming that the DVD will play fine.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I really enjoy this game i would recommend it to the people who haven't got the chance to down load it.
B00003CX96|5.0|It's worth watching just to see Dennis Quaid playing a teen-ager.  While this movies is somewhat dated, it's one of the best &#34;triumph of the human spirit&#34; movies ever made.  It can be viewed on multiple levels and I wonder if some psychology classes have used it as an example of family dynamics.  The relationship between the main character and his father is quite interesting to watch evolve.  This is a movies beyond the story. You can watch it again and again, and still see something you didn't quite see before.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Chase scene made me woosy!  McQueen plays a supper cool and controlled cop.  Great scenes from SF too.  Must see.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have been a loyal fan of Cornwell for many years owning all of her books, but this is the last book I will read. It takes forever to get through the first 1/3 of the book. It's loaded with lots of words and non connecting verbiage making it very hard to stay with her story.  I struggled too hard to get thru this one which is why I won't get another one of her books. The story is good but not the way the story is told. I'm very disappointed.
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|Fun, classic movie.  Good acting (in the style of the 60's) with the notorious car chase scene in the Mini's.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I just got my kindle for my birthday and this was one of the first apps I got. I play it ALL the time. Great game
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's easy to use, and anything that offers a free learning experience is a good thing in my opinion. Would recommend. 10/10
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My son absolutely loves this game!! For me it's a little confusing but I enjoy playing it!! He sits on the potty and plays it and it helps with potty training!
B000RLFJQ2|1.0|Amazon stopped allowing me to watch amazon movies on my android tablet. Not good at all for membership people. I pay the monthly subscription.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE TO PIN THINGS!! I have tried a few pins out and some have turned out great!! I can't get enough of this site!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Great movie and soundtrack. Dicaprio is excellent, as is Tobey Maguire! I love the modern twist on this movie and it's so much better than the original with Robert Redford!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a bit confusing for me to play it but I really do enjoy trying to learn how to play!! It gives me something to do when I'm sitting in the car for a long ride!
B003VXMMTK|1.0|So depressing!! I really liked Tess but everything that could go wrong did go wrong for her. I hated that I wasted four hours of my life on such a depressing (and non-redeeming) show.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love playing bubble witch saga on my tablet so much more than on my laptop or desktop! It couldn't get any better!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|use this a lot great idea. Now when there is grief from PSE&G i can easily find my lantern using my cell!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive. I can't stop playing this game. It is so fun I also got my sisters and my boyfriend playing this game.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I haven't finished reading this one yet. Malala writes a fascinating story of life in her part of the world, which has given me much more insight to her country and its people. She is not making excuses, but rather a timeline of events that plague the area.
B00EKHE1JA|3.0|This one is rough! The paint isn't very well, and joints are not very strong. Overall, it just looks not fit its price!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the game for xbox and the mobile one is pretty good as the xbox version. I play with my brother all day so fun.
0618871713|5.0|Needed this book for a college course I was taking and I must say that it isn't something for everyone. Prompt shipping and very nice care for the book. I'd recommend it to anyone who is wanting to try reading comic style books. Thank  You!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I liked the story but more of a ladies book but I liked it I have now read all three
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is the best game ever! It's my favorite game to have on any device! The ways that they use to battle my favorite super hero's are amazing!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|If you're a treckie then you have to own this collection also.  You can see these on TV and get via Amazon Prime for now, but not sure how long this goes on for - now we own the collection and can watch whenever we want.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awsome you can get a unicorn I would highly recommend it to all who likes horse's. :) I love it .
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I frequently travel across the globe for my work. With this app on my kindle fire tablet I can keep track of time in multiple time zone. This make calling home to the family much easier when I'm abroad. I would recommend this app to others.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|WHOA, BABY, Hey, Who are those Guys ????? GREAT!!! Great  location photography,good plot,Catherine Ross is a pleasure for the eye,to see.and the tongue in cheek humor between butch and sundance keeps the whole film chuggin along, I think it's a 10
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It is great to have a software applications at and affordable price. FREE<br />Just what on the go users need today.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Part of what you speak of was revealed to me in a vision. To be able to learn more from your experience has given me hope and deep peace. Blessings and many thanks for your brave action in writing this for others to read.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A little more difficulty would be nice, but all in all its a Great game with great graphics. Lots of content.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Fun game, simple interface. I like the achievements...something different for a card game. Now I have to write a few more words.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It was, as the other books, really good and easier to read because the author focused on some characters instead of all, but I still missed them. Ready to start the next book!
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Having lived in Chicago for many years, and now living away, Blue Brothers brings back the nice memories of that enjoyable and someone illogical city's residents.  I'm a fan of John Landis as well.  Cleverly done.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Minecraft PE is an amazing game, but the upgrade still haven't come for the kindle fire. I would give 5 stars if the upgrade came out for the kindle.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Tells a great story. Also super informative about the amazon culture and work environment. No doubt bezos is a visionary.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|The game was fun. I liked that there were several different games not just hidden objects. The graphics were nice and clear. The only thing I didn't care for was the dialog, to much to read between games. I would suggest it to others.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Great graphics and story line Fun to play!  When I got confused there were hints to help but they did not ruin the game
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book had me on edge on whether she was going to choose Aspen or Maxon. In my opinion this book is simply amazing and should be continued for more books to come.
0316322407|5.0|Fantastic book... Incredibly insightful and very inspiring! I just finished reading and am encouraging my wife, 13 year old daughter, and 11 year old son to read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book about Chris Kyle shows the real story of an American hero. It's also full of... Adventure. This book is no bad book. Not by a long shot. But when you finish, remember the. Name, Chris Kyle.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It works ok but I have not been able to sharpen any thing very good using this product. I will keep trying and maybe I'm not doing it right. We will see.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I finally got sick of the Candy Crush Saga ads so I decided to download this game. It was really fun and addicting at first but then right in the middle of my fun, the app said that I had to wait twenty or thirty minutes for new lives or else I would have to buy them. I NEVER buy apps or in-app purchases and only get things when they're free, so naturally I deleted the game. I have zero patience when comes to over 2 minutes of waiting. I'm glad I deleted it. Overall, it was fun for thirty minutes.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I LOVE Lady Gaga's new album. All of the songs are catchy and very good! Thank you Lady Gaga! You are awesome!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It was very realistic and seemed to amuse my 9 year old cousin but for me it wasn't that exhilirating and plus you had to buy fancy hairdos so as soon as she left two hours later I deleted it and she didn't miss when she came back another time.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Even though a lot of these Beatles' classics have been reworked and in some cases stitched together, there is enough of the classic sound for any Beatles' fan to really enjoy this album and at the same time, a different enough sound that you don't feel like you're listening to the same old songs all over again.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|Vevo is wonderful and trusty on computers, but there was a glitch when I tried to play it on my Kindle Fire. I don't know if it's just my 1st Generation Kindle Fire being too old or the app but for me it did not work. I still use Vevo on my TV and computer, though!
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Cut out a couple times with an error on Xbox One, otherwise perfect. Good quality, may have been my wonderful Time Warner Internet that made it cut out...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got this app and was thrilled at first. I played it 24/7 back when it was very, very popular. I had for about a year but after not playing for 4 months I decided that it was wasting space so I deleted it. It was really awesome at first, though, so if you like action games then this is for you!
1451666179|3.0|I really want to give 5 stars since I'm such a fan of Allie Brosh.  I LOVE her work- her stories and illustrations make me laugh and smile.  This compilation is no exception.<br /><br />However, I'm giving a lower rating solely because of the format.  In my opinion, the awesome content Allie has created does NOT work well with the small & heavy paper book format it comes in.<br /><br />There isn't much content on each page (only a few illustrations and some lines of text), meaning I read through each page VERY quickly.  The story is supposed to flow, so there's an awkward interruption ever time I need to turn the page.  The book is heavy and stiff, making it difficult turn the pages quickly. The pages are also bleeding with color which feels a little wasteful.  It's enough of a chore to read that I haven't picked it up since last week.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to either convert this to a much larger book (to fit more content on the page), or offer a convenient way for people to view the content in website format.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Awesome  app, love it!  Wish it had an alarm clock feature, then it would be perfect.  Do like the full weather forecast
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is very interesting and it make can't put it it down... you will not be disappointed for downloading this game...download out now! Today! :)
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Reading Scalzi is like an excellent way to while away the wee hours of the morning. As well as the evening, afternoon, and any other time you can sneak away to do so. This book is starship troopers as written by Kurt Vonnegut.
1451624468|2.0|I am an agnostic and am mostly into the Buddhist concept of Nirvana which is eerily similar to the concept of \\"nothingness\\" this book espouses. Nevertheless, I found the book boring and for the most part involved in desecrating theologians in a very condescending manner. The premise of the book is simple - Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle can be applied to energy and time and that leads to the conclusion that energy can spontaneously arise from nothingness for a short period of time. Presumably that's how the universe began. This is covered only in the last couple of chapters. The rest of the chapters deal with history of quantum mechanics and the last century. All the while, Krauss inserts himself in the prose needlessly and mentions again and again how people who believe in a God are foolish while scientists like him have \\"dedicated an entire life in the search of truth knowing fully well that it may lead to nowhere\\" and how they deserve accolades for this bravery. I found his tone dripping with superiority, which unfortunately is typical of most of such cosmologists who write books for the laymen. Theologians can be accused of behaving \\"holier-than-thou\\". People like Krauss behave in a \\"superior-than-thou\\" way. What really irked me was the afterword by Richard Dawkins where he claims that this book is to cosmology what Darwin's \\"Origin of species\\" was to biology! Really?!!<br /><br />Readers who are truly interested in this interesting idea of something coming out of nothing can find a wealth of information by googling it on the internet. Better still, you can probably find videos on the topic on YouTube to better understand it. This book is mostly a waste of time.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|There are some misspelled words in the dictionary. Please correct them for me so what u doin today words scatter every where. TI the converter to do so bye go ho.e<br /><br />Zhzdtjidykydokydykydoogdgoxgkkgkydkgxgkxoyxogxogdgkdlgdkgdkydkgdlucked
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Engaging story and well written. Enjoyed it immensely. A real page turner with poignant moments and theme. Bravo John Green.
1401937519|5.0|The book is meaningful on so many different levels; I really enjoyed reading it.  I applaud Ania Moorjani for writing this book and sharing her experiences and what she has learned.  The world needs to &#34;hear&#34; it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game for mahjong lover's like me!  You can pause if you need to, beat your high scores and unlock new chests.  Smooth app with no glitches on kindle fire!  Much appreciated!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book!  What a great experience it was to read this book!  Hard to believe that Death could narrate a story in a way that sounds as if a friend was telling you the story, but most definitely is the case.  The book has the feel of a true story in its alignment with the history of WWII and the holocaust.  The concepts of the deadly power of words, the danger of not conforming with the group, the pain of regret, and the bravery in making moral choices are all superbly addressed through the lives of the very realistic characters of this story.  Just as people we meet in real life, my first impressions of some of these characters were not always positive.  Some, which I was prepared to dislike from the very beginning, were developed into much more complex and genuine personalities that compelled me to reach a better understanding and eventually love them.  At times I found myself wanting to research these characters and then I would remember that they are fictional characters.  From beginning to end I had a sense that I was reading about the lives of real people.  This book was very hard to put down and when I did, I could not wait to get back to it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this game sooo much I use it during my FreeTime it's amazing haha everyone should play this game
1781162646|3.0|Not Stephen King's best work, but it's hard even for the master to live up to his own amazing work.  Definitely worth a read!
B00340ESIS|5.0|This was one of the most fascinating pieces of &#34;homework&#34; I was given by a new writing mentor, as I begin to bump up my game for 2014. I am indie-multi-pubbed (over 20 books) but want to come up with a couple of exciting manuscripts to reel in an agent and  NY contract next year. Save the Cat is an amazing way of looking at crafting a novel, by way of crafting a screenplay.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Only basic is free. They keep asking you to upgrade to get any features. Screen looks great just wish they had described what is free before I downloaded this.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Everytime I play this game, I lose my connection and therefore, I lose my credits! It's very frustrating!! Please fix this issue and I will up my star rating.
140123755X|4.0|This is the intro to a very imaginative series of graphic stories that has lasted a long time, and it clearly shows the appeal of the author's writing. At heart, it's an old-fashioned hard-boiled detective story with surprising plot twists and the classic parlor scene, although it doesn't end there. This is wrapped in a premise that made me smile most of the way and laugh out loud sometimes.<br /><br />Drop you pretensions and give it a try: you won't be sorry!
B0035V35P8|5.0|Suspenseful, stressful and not necessarily a happy ending. I love the acting by South Korean actor Rain (aka Bi aka Jung Jihoon)
B003UYUP58|4.0|Very informative and useful in understanding where the medical community is on this. This will never end.  Cancer, like viruses, are microscopic humans who will always find temporary solutions to their life ending threats. And guess what  they have out thought us, as I learned elsewhere, as in their DNA they already have dormant mutations just waiting for us to catch up.<br /><br />I would have loved it but the author is clearly in love with his vocabulary and letting the world know how extensive it is. Added pages and pages to the  book and caused those of us not as bombastically endowed to constantly go to the dictionary. It hurt clarity in some cases I think.
0812974611|5.0|Fascinating. A must read before and after visiting the actual place either in person or in a comfortable chair. Robert Harris is a terrific author.
B000FC1D0O|2.0|Very hard to follow - brain twister. So is Clinton reading this all these years to try to understand it or am I just not a audio learner. I am sure it has got some good stuff but I got a life to live.
B0031GUR44|1.0|The Amazon search indicated that this blade was the correct replacement for the OEM blade for a 2008 Porsche Cayenne. When I received the blade not only did it not indicate on the package that the blade was meant for a Porsche Cayenne, the blade turned out to be two inches shorter then the OEM blade.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I like  it because it has a little bit of crazy adventure and a little bit of exciting, fun action.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved this book and didn't want it to end.  Now I begin to read all the books by Mr. Flynn.  I love Mitch Rapp - he is the best of all - can't wait to start the next one.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Excellent soundtrack, beautiful costumes and scenery. Casting is wonderful; Leo never looked so good. The action and story line moved fast, not too fast.
0553582011|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Great series, I'm just a little impatient for the next installment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best series ever---story-line, casting, characters, cinematography, costumes, PERFECTION! I began by watching the 3rd season finale, am now re-watching all episodes from 1st to last.
0553579908|5.0|It's a great series. I bought this for a friend so I could get my copy back. She's hooked now.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I knew this book was going to be different then Harry Potter so I dove in with an open mind.....Wow very disappointed. Even if I didn't know the author I would not have enjoyed this book. There were very few likeable characters and I felt depressed reading this book! I read a lot of books, at least one or two a week and am usually very lenient. I did finish the book but did not feel any better by doing so. I do not recommend this book. If you are debating do not waste your money, if you feel you must read go to your library. It was not worth the money I spent.
1451683405|1.0|Started promising and then his argument unraveled. He starts to contradict himself with points like:<br /><br />&#34;Getting behind our conscious thoughts and feelings can allow us to steer a more intelligent course through our lives&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Few concepts have offered greater scope for human cruelty than the idea of an immortal soul.&#34;<br /><br />By the end I found myself reading more to find support for the compatibilism argument than anything about the determinism argument.<br /><br />Short book than can be skimmed in about 30 minutes. Garbage.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I nanny for twin boys and they love this game! I bought it when they were 2 and they are now 3 1/2. They continue to still play it. At first it was a fun challenge for them, with me hand over hand helping them, now they are pros! I also bought the car version of this and they switch back and forth between them
081297381X|5.0|This is the most thought-provoking book I've read in years.  I have thought about some of these issues myself, but not at the great depth that Taleb expresses. He is truly one of the leading intellectuals of our age. A practitioner and scholar in one. Taleb clearly studies like a scholar, and then translates his insights into language that practitioners and mere mortals like me can understand. Be warned: you will not be able to listen to the predictions by &#34;experts&#34; the same ever again. You will also be much less boastful about your own predictions too.<br /><br />I have re-positioned my investment portfolio to take advantage of positive black swans, but the intellectual stimulation from this book will far out-weigh any possible financial return. One of the very few books that I'll read twice.<br /><br />Michael Beitler, Ph.D.<br />Author of &#34;Strategic Organizational Change, 3rd Edition&#34;

B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is an awesome & captivating character.  An Ex-Army MP Investigator using his gifted talents in the civilian world.  He’s not looking for a crime, but he always seems to drop into a crime scene unintended. When faced with the injustice, Reacher can’t ever seem to walk away.  I mostly enjoy his analytical thinking as the plot unravels.  He’s a little cocky in his physical abilities, his size is intimidating, and he’s a lethal street fighter.  When face with an overwhelming odds, the bad guys always lose.  He’s definitely a vigilantly and when Jack Reacher is involved, there’s usually no waste of court expenses at the end of the story. I’ve read at least 99% of Lee Child’s series and found them all to be excellent reads including this one!!!

B005LAIIGM|5.0|Gravity pulled me in right from the start!! The cinematography of Earth and space is stunningly breathtaking!!! The CGI was flawless, lending the impression of actually being there. I can't remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly.<br /><br />Gravity is a film that takes place in space, but it is SO much more than just a space movie. I identified with Sandra Bullocks character on a couple levels and I felt like I was in her place at the final scene.<br /><br />Gravity. It pulls us down. It places us solidly where we are. It defines us. There is no escaping the reality...although sometimes we try. Sometimes all we need to do is let go and let gravity bring us home...<br /><br />Questions that the film conjured in me:<br />Where do we escape?<br />What causes us to awaken?<br />How do we pick up ourselves against the weight of the world and learn to walk again?<br />Who are we really when we are stripped down to our core?<br />To feel the pain, the fear, the loss of dreams amidst each breath.<br />To try again.<br />To never give up.<br />To heal.<br />To dare embrace life.<br />To love.

B0055SWM08|4.0|Pretty good game. Like a maze, but with deadly obstacles. Takes a bit of strategy. Few permissions. An added plus is you can play it OFFLINE so you don't have to be annoyed by ads. All in all it's a good game.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler at the peak of the bands commercial creativity.  Truly a classic rock requsite album.  Live version is good too.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|For $30 it's o.k.  I primarily wanted it to be able to stream a video content from a webpage using a notebook to my HDTV.  That works, although the sound is less than desired.  So it meets the primary objective - barely.  It's works fine when 'casting' from both Windows 7 and MacAir.  However, highly disappointed when trying to stream a webpage (using Chrome app) from iOS (iPhone 5 or iPad).  Basically, you can't do it.  The cast extension is not available for the iOS devices .... booooo.  For $30 bucks, I'll keep it.  Not super excited about it though.
B000002KXV|5.0|Sonically amazing.  Songs have been better but still better than most of what is out there is this genre - my opinion only.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found this novel harder to follow than the first two by Khaled Hosseini. I enjoyed the smaller stories inside of stories and how everyone fit together in the bigger picture. I was dismayed at how little impact the difficulties of each of the individual's  life had on others. Although there always seemed to be a need for people to meet or join up, they never did which seemed to leave an emptiness for me. Even when Pari finally met up with Abdullah, he never really knew she was there. I did love the story about Thalia and Markos and think that was the biggest love story in all.  I still love the style of writing and am pulled into the everyday lives of afganistani people which would not be known to us without these novels.
B00004T9UF|5.0|My wife loves this and must admit it is infectious to the musical mind.  One never knows, does one.  Whoda' thunk it'?
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this book, and the movie did it justice. They chose a fantastic actress, and the script stuck to the plot from the book, something I'm happy to see is becoming more the norm. I recommend this to anyone, male or female. My husband agreed to go see this movie based solely on the poster with the flaming mockingjay pin. He ended up loving it and read all three of the books afterwards.
B001NERPHS|5.0|My wife LOVES Dylan.  She loves it all.  Has books and video.  I am a early days and 'Slow Train Commin' fan.<br /><br />She says she love me because I look like him.  I'll take what I can get.  :o/
B0067AC5KA|5.0|What an awesome trilogy.  The characters are developed.  The story keeps you hooked.  I could read this a few more times in case I missed anything.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good solid story lines and characters, very enjoyable show. Strong female protagonist in a questionable marriage makes this one a four-star rating, along with the interesting subplots.
B00AAQVSDW|3.0|Too much of the same thing, I would like to have seen FGL branch out from what we have already hears.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|An okay movie. Lots of action and fight scenes. Some connection to a real superman movie. Amazon HD version did not come with 5.1 DD. Maybe that is extra??
B00000IQW5|5.0|my favorite movie of my 58 years so far. this is a cast that should have done more movies together
B001P06GX4|5.0|Wow!  this really is a must have family game and is perfect for any occasion.  Buy it. Heaps of replay value.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|No need to check the site for new sounds, the notification is on my Kindle already. This app is a great, portable, way to experience those long mixtapes.
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|The unit I received is not very well built; the dual internal contacts for the USB cables are so tight that the USB-male end of the cable pushes them down. These detail makes it difficult if not impossible to connect your devices to the hub's ports.<br /><br />This an update: 2014-01-16<br /><br />Short after my original review for this item was posted, I was contacted by AnkerDirect Customer Support. They were extremely helpful and offered to replace this item by another product of their line Anker AH430 Bus-Powered USB 3.0 4-Port Aluminum Hub, which is better constructed and to which all USB cables connect without issues.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The updates on this app have really cleared up some of the problems from before. Has been good so far.
B00EO10M54|5.0|It's a wired album, you can find deep songs (Wrecking ball, I adore you, My Darlin') and find great dance &#34;twerk&#34; songs, like We can't stop, SMS (Bangerz) & 4 X 4. I was skeptical about her singing, but this album proved me wrong.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Anything with Judi Dench is a winner with us.  However, she is delightful in this movie and the womenfolk of Cranford give this story life and humor.  We only wish there were more Cranford sequels.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|This app is great for my daughter, who absolutely LOVES it. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the repeated music goes on forever and just won't stop. If there were three or four different songs instead of 30 seconds of looped music, I would have given this five stars. All in all, if that's the only thing bugging me, then I'm pretty satisfied. 4.5 stars for good measure.
B0073Q0DZG|3.0|It was OK.  It's an interesting movie.  Not really a knee-slapping comedy.  If you like birds, you would probably enjoy this movie.  The scenery is excellent.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play, but no directions.  Frustrating when I can't get beyond a level, but hard to put down.  Great.
B003G4W49C|3.0|It felt like a book that I would have loved if I had read it when I was 12 years old, but being nearly 30 it did not seem to capture my interest.  Well written and a good story, but felt pretty predictable
B002N5N4M6|5.0|One of the funniest shows ever! The cast is great together and I never get tired of watching!!! Love love love!!!
B001BANK32|4.0|Entertaining book!  Would definitely recommend it even to those who have seen the movie as they are quite different.<br /><br />This was my first Stephen King read and I will definitely continue to read his works.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Love this show, one of the best seasons!!! Characters are great! Great writing and so funny! a classic show that is fun to watch
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but I hate waiting for lives.  I won't pay .99 for three lives but I would pay a one time fee for endless lives. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
B003YCIE68|5.0|a classic and such a wonderful story! The characters are wonderful especially Santa! He's so real! I am so happy to have found this!
B005K8QIS0|5.0|great show, subtly acted, beautifully written, perfectly cast. Big, big crush on Jason Isaacs, the man is SEXY. The stories are intelligent, moving and come beautifully full-circle by the end. I don't know why American mysteries are never this good, but they aren't. Well, not since Columbo and Rockford Files anyway and those had a very different feel. This is Scotland, stony, wet and boggy...very romantic and the accents are really charming. If you like crime dramas, but are tired of commercials, gore, unsexy sex, unnecessary gun battles and car chases, you'll probably love this series.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Hilarious great movie! All ages will love this heartwarming funny story! Cannot wait for Finding Dory! Love that character, she makes the movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I seen most people were upset there were going to be more books and it left us hanging. I absolutely loved it! The book was great! It left me hanging but I guarantee you I'll be buying the next one. And hey 5 is better than 3 any day right?
B002D0L0R2|5.0|John Travolta is hilarious as is Amanda Bynes! Love Zac Efron as Linc! The music is amazing and its so fun!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game and if you have a wb account you unlock exclusive rewards for the console version and also the mobile to and as a little hint if you get a player card that you have all ready you can upgrade your super hero's or Vililins to.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Big Bang is my favorite show and I love the characters! The shows are all funny, I could watch this show all day!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Just keep j puppy hush house John no how his  need help in love with sponge Bob square pants and dumber than that you have to work with sponge Bob square pants
B001FB4VXU|5.0|fun fun fun!!! Sheldon is my favorite, he makes the show!!! All the characters are great and make it a fun show!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Overall great series on the beginning stages of Iraq. I got the series 2 days after ordering it and it was packaged very well. Nothing to complain on ever when I buy something from amazon.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|This movie is one that I love to watch! It's funny and entertaining! Bruce Willis and Justin Long are awesome together!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Had I read the authors note first, I might have skipped this one, after reading the inspiration for it. Entertaining enough to read through, although quite predictable. For the REAL Stephen King, please read Gerald's Game, The Shining, and Thinner, among others.
1423113454|5.0|Lovely upbeat read!  Full of imagery and interesting Egyptian Gods.  The adventure experienced from two perspectives, the brother and the sister, makes for a great fun read.
0694011479|4.0|My son seems to enjoy the pictures...especially all the colors. However, the story is not the most enthralling or well-written.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is my favorite type of game.  It's challenging but not impossible, and passes the time very quickly.  Highly recommended, especially for free game.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|It's Star Trek, the original series including seasons 1-3.  In Blu Ray.    My original review was about the price which was insanely cheap at the time. Regardless, the original series looks simply amazing on the remastered BluRay.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|The author is a very good storyteller. Packed with useful information, quirky mnemonics and characters that you won't easily forget.
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing! i love it. but the author is John green and not that holt mcdougal guy, they need to change that!!!
B00130VLZ4|5.0|It is by Canon. It fits the camera nicely. It seems to be made quite well and both feels and looks good. Simple.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|No spoilers but it changed the way things happened while still keeping the integrity of the main stour line. Funny and witty this is both a movie and an episode. I loved see David Tennent back in his box. Even if you have never seen an episode of Dr Who this will explain everything you need to know without being redundant for the hard core fans.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Never played the PC or console versions (though I've seen videos on YouTube), but man is this ever addictive...<br /><br />The controls take a little getting used to, there is a virtual joystick when you tap/hold on the lower left corner and contextual virtual buttons at the lower right depending on what item you're using.  Once you're used to them they're actually pretty intuitive (though I'm guessing it takes a bit more of an adjustment period) and you can get chugging along mining, fighting bosses, crafting stuff, etc.<br /><br />There are a few little things that are kind of annoying (when crafting you have to craft each indvidual item/block you can't just make all you can in one go, or hold down the craft button to continually create things, which is only really a pain when you're making a building or a lot of one item - torches/planks).  Another &#34;annoyance&#34; for me at least, was how if you get smudges on your screen, sometimes the virtual controls will take that as an input so you'll keep running or doing an action.<br /><br />Ultimately what made me take the plunge on this is that I bought it on sale ($2 I think) and that's a great investment, and even at the normal price I think it's a great value for as much time as you'll spend with it.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The game is fun, but after you get to higher levels, it just quits on you. I haven't been able to gain access for over a month. I've checked online comments and this sounds to be very common. Don't vet started. It's not worth it.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I love this, it lets me use my phone or tablet as a baby monitor/security cam viewer which is awesome.  I can honestly say I feel much better that I can be at work and pull this up on my phone and check in on my family.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Slow load, when it does finally the graphics flicker and the app locks.  Many reviews on Play report same problem.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Not bad for free, so there's that.  Honestly it's biggest flaw is the flaw of the Kindle Fire HD, which is only having a forward facing camera.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|Because i'm expected the same quality of the previous two concerts, i really feel very disapointed....... Maybe it was designed to hear with some specifications in some specific equipment, the audio is really bad..........!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This trilogy was the best sci-fi I have read in a looking time. I'm trying to find a book to read that's at least half as good.
B00A3AU1U6|2.0|For all of you Brian Eno nerds out there - you too can be Brian Eno w/ these iPad apps. Just sayin'.<br />Trope, Bloom, Air. All designed be Eno.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Just kept me turning the pages, not only the plot, which was fast with plenty of twists and turns, but to see the outcome of all those wishes!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This StarTrek  issue is a delight for an old &#34;treky&#34;.  Very satisfying experience.  I got accustomed to the new (old?) characters and would like to see a new series with them.
B009SS9632|5.0|I love it! :-) Great story but phenomenal author. He did it again and proved that sci-fi is not unfamiliar to him at all, au contraire! This is really thrilling story with quite interesting features and technologies, it is coming together very well with legendary Martin's ability to draw his characters with plasticity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You listened to all of us who wanted Candy Crush Saga and got it for us. You rock!!. It is everything I imagined it to be. Exciting, relaxing, fun, addicting, and frustrating at times. Thank you for making it available to us. It has been worth the wait!<br />Faith
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Upsides<br />- easy to setup<br />- it's Google<br />- will be expanded in future<br /><br />downsides:<br />- Very few options for content<br />- No freedom for developers<br />- has an annoying, bright blinking light when it's powered and have to take it out at night to sleep
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|You don't judge Grisham novels by the standards of great literature.  Even using less demanding standards, &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; struggles to capture between three and four stars.  It's a bit too much of the same:  Beleaguered sole practitioner attorney takes on the establishment and Old South values, is flummoxed at one point in the trial, but ultimately prevails.  While there's some symbolic symmetry that you don't usually get with Grisham, there's also a bit of padding, especially in the person of a firebrand black attorney from Memphis whose sole purpose seems to be to add pages to the heft of the book.  Jake's wife and daughter are so incidental to the plot, one wonders why Grisham pokes them forward here and there.<br /><br />This isn't a bad read--it's a perfectly fine airplane read.  And it's a break from some of the overwrought &#34;great&#34; contemporary fiction I've been slogging through lately.  Just not Grisham at his best.
B008JFUS5A|2.0|they spend a freaking hour and half talking about the hunger games. the whole movie you are like can we get on with the killing. Yes i'm a gladiator/wrath of the titans like fan. but c'mon toooooo much talking. I know this is a teenage book turned movie so expect the loving cutscenes all the time. but the thing that gets me just like part 1 they spent too much time just talking and not enough in the hunger games. on top of that the ending was more of can we all just get along and end the whole hunger games annual thing..... So no mercy here, show me more of the games and less of some cry baby crying over the village being treated bad.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Max Brooks' book &#34;World War Z&#34; worked as a book because like all good science fiction it showed a dystopian future to highlight the failings of the present:  Zombies became a threat because of the trappings and failings of globalization, modernity, and humanity.<br /><br />In the film adaptation, the ideas, themes, and motifs that made the book such an interesting read have been filtered out, and the residue is a competent if all-too-conventional thriller.  Gone are the hard truths and slow horrors of fighting a total war of extinction and entropy -- what's left is a slick video-game-friendly easy-to-shallow story of a man who solves the zombie puzzle in less than two hours.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Here me  out before you get huffy on me...........first i didn't pay any attention to this movie until 2 just came out recently so i said i'll watch this one, my GF was telling me oh it's a great movie and blablabla(hyping it up) so im like ok let's watch it sugarcoat. so I'm looking at the cover which has the chick with the arrow(like part 2) and it sets you up to believe this movie is all about hunting/games. NO!!! hell the first hour and 15 mins is all about chatting and whats to come. I'm like hurry up and get to the hunger games activities. to make a long story short what happen was they spent a lot of time talking and about 20 mins of actually action. and it was PG action at that. this is a let down if you're thinking you going to see a lot of epic battles and &#34;cool&#34; kills.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Works well--even if there's a radio station at/near the same frequency (I heard some products like this get interference which is something I wanted to avoid).  I deducted one star for a couple of things.  First, the odd order it plays the music:  it's not alphabetical--my guess is it's in the order it finds the songs in the usb stick.<br /><br />Second, it did mess up the first time I used it.  I put it in some weird endless loop where it would try reading the songs (getting the list of them), then when it was ready to start playing it would go back to reading the songs.  I unplugged it and plugged it back in--worked fine.  I've never been able to reproduce it.
0452282152|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down!  I also appreciated that the author delivered an adult story that was real but not unnecessarily graphic.  It is built around the life of Vermeer the Dutch painter who lived during the 17th century.  Very interesting!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|When I first started This book I didn't like it. It seemed boring. Then I started taking notes and comprehended the book more and it became more and more interesting.I really enjoyed this book!
B00BVVA138|5.0|Finally! The return of the expected greatness. Love the original singer and glad (Howard has his strong points too, no worries) he's back. The album rocks. Always is my favorite by far.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fine if you want to kill some time waiting for the bus or waiting in line but some of the levels can take a few days to complete if you don't buy the special candies or extra lives. I just cant justify spending real money on fake candy lol
0803730470|5.0|Get this book. The rhyming is genius and it is so fun to read to your kids.You almost start singing it to them just because the flow is so good. At first I thought the Gruffalo might scare my kids just from the cover, but after reading it, it really is quite the opposite. So much fun, a must have!
B00GLX0Z8C|2.0|Mediocre movie. I feel sorry that such a good actress as Jennifer Aniston played in this patchwork of cliches and platitudes...
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I am a firm, committed believer in the Whole Bible with this in mind. I think this is one of the great movies around and needs to be watched for a litany of reasons.<br />Creatively it is a winner. Acted, and directed to get the biggest punch for the scene.<br />The moral lessons are very strong; keep committed to a cause and you will have results ( this goes for the warden too, he was the worst example of a christian ever, so take that with a grain of salt).<br />The language is harsh, rude, and vile. just like prison, so I do not recommend this to a child. Maybe a 15 year old with life experience. The rawness of the movie makes me cringe, but then that is also the acting done so well.<br />So if you want a well acted, directed and timely movie, then this is a winner.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by John Grisham.  I really enjoyed it.  It was hard to put down.  Any one who reads this book will want to keep reading to the end.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Very addictive series. Great acting. Great themes. My sister said I had to watch this series and she was right!
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain tells it like it is. I have battled with trying to make my self more extroverted only to realize after reading this book that it's physical and not something I can change. She does give you the tools & resources to help you deal with being an introvert in an extroverted world. Once you come to understand it's not to change but to learn how to work with your own personality you can move forward and use it to your advantage or at least understand why you do things the way you do. I love the examples and interviews with other introverts and to listen to some of her interviews is very helpful.  I highly recommend this book to any introvert and extrovert that will read it.  I loaned a copy to my therapist after working with her on social anxiety issues that I now realize are really mostly introversion issues I have come to realize and hopefully will help in our progress to overcome some of the real SA issues that go beyond introversion.<br /><br />Read a copy today and then give it to your extroverted spouse, therapist, or co-workers to read so they will understand what your mind goes through on a daily basis.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|Love this dvd. Fun for the kids and educational for the parents! It is interesting and explain more and more about these creatures.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just a good quality show.  Not a soap. Good characters and actors and actresses - wish it were on many more weeks each season.
0307719774|5.0|Excellent concept (takes the will to complete the task though). Great quality materials and interesting content (topics). I find myself skipping days or weeks at a time. I do notice my stress reduces when I'm on schedule with it though. I have purchased a few as gifts for friends. They loved it (or so they told me they did).
B00EUS9IBU|5.0|Awesome! Paul McCartney still sounds great after all these years. I even heard the title track in Despicable Me 2 and knew that it was Paul right away.
B00005JN4H|5.0|I was offered a great price for this dvd, one of my favorites... The dvd was mailed in great condition... I received it in the mail quickly... Very cool...
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't like the constant attempts to lure the player into buying more lives so they don't have to wait the 30 min. to play again.  When I have some time to play I want to play and not sit and watch the clock.  As far as I'm concerned, a &#34;Free&#34; game does not involve paying for anything.
B0053O89IS|5.0|The dvd's are always in great condition... Mr. Boreanaz says they are in his brief descriptions, and I am always satisfied... The dvd's are expedited quickly, meaning I find them in the mail quickly... Thanks again for making these purchases painless and easy...
0143124544|5.0|I rarely ever write reviews but for this book, I couldn't resist. It was absolutely incredible. So much so, it is actually difficult to put into words!<br />Not since reading classics like Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre have I felt so connected to characters and their relationships.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|great fun but stupid you need to actually spend money to get some characters otherwise just long and good time killer
0316017930|5.0|Simply one of the most eye opening and informative pieces of literature I have ever read. It's about time we had a powerful and well defended critique of rugged individualism and an exposure of how little we do to nurture our successors.
B0064BWDRW|3.0|Jo Nesbo is a great read and to date I've loved the Harry Hole series. I've also bought the latest novel &#34;Police&#34; but haven't read it yet. This story was well constructed in many ways, with the level of detail that we all love. Lots of twists and turns, as usual. I'm rating it &#34;okay&#34; because it didn't grip me the way that earlier books have. Readers who are a lot more avid Harry fans than me will probably love this book, and not be put off by Rakel and her son (who re-emerge in this novel). Their love story seems a bit mediocre to me so that I wonder &#34;why bother?&#34; I like Harry when he's doing the job he does so well, with his police colleagues, some of whom are really engaging characters. I suppose if you've come this far, like me you will read #7. Our experiences however will be mixed and I don't know that I'd call it a &#34;must read&#34;. The novel is for people who have read the other 6 in the series; I think you'd struggle to understand and enjoy if you picked up this book as the first Nesbo read.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Great story lines and the acting ain't half bad either.  Hope the producers continue to produce the show with all the quality the first season.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Well acted, but very episodic, not a lot of drama carrying from one to the next, like Damages.  Maybe that will pick up, I'm just in the first season.
B00FOU1O3S|2.0|Nothing too exciting about this game, and you have to wait for the bear to do his sledding around after each throw of the ball.  I had been hoping for something with a bit of uniqueness........
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I LOVE SLENDER GAMES. I purchased the app on my kindle and never stopped playing it there is also a free version but this is worth the darn money. If you can not beat easy mode you are such a noob.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Better than the first and I liked the first. Lots of action and very entertaining. Hope they make a 3rd one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I own this on my kindle and on my PC , the version at the moment is 0.7.6 updating on to the big mother of all updates , 0.8.0 which includes much more than what was supposed to included. However minecraft is very popular just read the other reviews!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Good game but I have noticed some of the levels get repeated, I do hate when I got stuck in one level for weeks and no way to pass. Don't like to spend money either, it should be free. Other than that it is entertaining and addictive.
B00F880BWG|4.0|The season so far has been pretty solid despite the Governor-centric episodes. Last night's mid-season finale was tense, heartbreaking yet satisfying...it was the war that the season 3 finale failed to give!<br /><br />February can't get here soon enough!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Really a pretty good Stephen King novel, but not as great as the shinning or some of his other great great books. Much better than the gunslinger series though. All in all not a bad read.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app rocks u all should try it  its free another good thing yahhhhhhhhh It does Rock TRY IT<br />Its awesome it has good grafics and everything
B000005RUV|5.0|Most definitely recommend this CD to any Wham! fan. Has all the great hits of all time. Brings back memories from the '90's
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Injustice like the game and I have been wanting to make It mobile game to kindle fire . tech n9ne something else
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really slow starting, the middle was awesome, edge of my seat, couldn't put it down, ending - ehhh, not so much. Maybe they'll finish it better in the movie.
B00G1YAD42|2.0|Clock faces do not display correctly on my Kindle - double images on the last city/time zone entered.  The features do function…it just could be better.  My iPhone clock is far superior
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game. Goals keep it interesting by giving you tasks to complete. The crops and animals never expire/wilt so you don't have to worry about not getting back to the game in time or not having internet access. It will be waiting when you get back. The more neighbors you have the more it benefits you by getting more coins and gifts and help on Goals.I do wish there was an easier way to get neighbors. (I don't do Facebook) There is not really any posting board other than to write a review to get your ID out there. Please add me FAUVWKJ.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device will not work with time warner ubee modems. After you've purchased the product, then they give you the details that Chromecast is only compatible with certain wireless routers and incompatible with many.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This film was a lot more entertaining than I expected it to, it also had a good cast and a good story.  This movie reminded me of the movie Independence Day but different enough to hold it's own in this genre.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This will keep you on the edge of your seat from the very first paragraph.  This is an earlier Dan Brown book.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This is a fun game that's not overly challenging and that'll occupy a few hours on a gloomy late-fall day when you just don't want to go outside and do yard work.  The puzzles aren't complete head-scratchers, and I found that I only needed to use hints (the magnifying glass) a few times.  If you want a really challenging adventure-type puzzle game, move along and pick another one.  But if you're feeling a little zombie-like and want to be entertained, this is a good choice.  I gave it four stars only because it would have been nicer to have a longer adventure.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|AMAZING ALBUM! This is NOT a pop album. It is very R&B. Her voice is really great and she has so much room to grow. I've heard the comparisons to Mariah Carey, but i don't think she's there yet.
0071752854|5.0|This book gave me great insight into social interaction and by extension business interaction. It is effective because it is about more than just the pitch. It about putting yourself in the right position to succeed. Insightful and different than what I expected. Most books give me a couple points to think about, this gives me an entire framework worth revisiting.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|The author's scrupulous attention to detail, of clothing, mannerisms, quirks of habit, fabrics and furnishings, distinctions of speech, make the multitude of participants come to life as authentic mid 19th century characters in an authentic period and place in history. Her pattern of introducing them each one, and placing them in the panorama of a West Coast goldfield under a cosmic scheme of revolving planets, stretches credulity but does not spoil the intrigue. This is the best book I can recall reading for many a decade. Its range of language is rich and mind-stretching, its variety of personalities convincing and credible.<br /><br />My only concern is the suspension left hanging in the form of questions raised in the story which one waited to see answered, but went unrequited.  Who killed Francis Carver? How did Emery Staines come to be behind the drapes when the shot was fired? What was the importance of Adrian Moody to the sequence of events?<br /><br />Is there to be a follow-up sequel? Perhaps with the locale as the Thames goldfield.
B0041H18MM|4.0|This is truly a comprehensive overview of Part's work. My only complaint is that the mp3s in this collection are clearly set to a level lower than that of your average mp3 or CD. I'll have to try Mp3Gain to adjust the overall volumes.
B004V7EW66|1.0|I'd forgive you for crying blasphemy for a one star rating of a Paul Simon album. Until I heard this, I would have done the same. I never thought it possible, but I've finally found something by Paul Simon that I don't like.<br /><br />I love Paul Simon. I think Graceland is probably the greatest album ever written. Rhythm of the Saints is almost as good. I like just about everything he did with Garfunkel.<br /><br />It isn't just that this album feels rushed and unpolished (it does). It is like he didn't even try. It doesn't have the narrative style that his other albums have, the lyrics are repetitive, boring, and and impersonal. The music is is poppy and jingle-ey.<br /><br />I think this is a bad album, and not just a bad album by Paul Simon standards, a bad album period.<br /><br />Don't believe me? I don't blame you, so let's do a little comparison, shall we? Here are the first few lines from Boy in The Bubble (the first track of Graceland).<br /><br />&#34;It was a slow day<br />And the sun was beating<br />On the soldiers by the side of the road<br />There was a bright light<br />A shattering of shop windows<br />The bomb in the baby carriage<br />Was wired to the radio<br />These are the days of miracle and wonder<br />This is the long distance call<br />The way the camera follows us in slo-mo<br />The way we look to us all<br />The way we look to a distant constellation<br />That's dying in a corner of the sky<br />These are the days of miracle and wonder<br />And don't cry baby, don't cry &#34;<br /><br />A few lines into the first song of the album, and you can see, hear, smell and taste the setting. You are already sad, pissed off, excited and hopeful. The rich, descriptive, and powerful lyrics are what makes Paul Simon so great. That those lyrics are backed by some astoundingly good music is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Now let's do the first few lines from So Beautiful So What:<br /><br />&#34;From early in November to the last week of December<br />I got money matters weighing me down<br />Well the music may be merry but it’s only temporary<br />I know Santa Claus is coming to town<br /><br />In the days I work my day job<br />In the nights I work my night<br />But it all comes down to working man's pay<br />Getting ready I’m getting ready ready for Christmas day&#34;<br /><br />No, this isn't a joke. The album starts with a poppy Christmas jingle and goes downhill from there. It isn't like the non lyrical portions of the album are much better either. Don't expect the beautiful rhythms from Graceland or the incredible complexity of the music from Rhythm of the Saints, the music on this album is typically reminiscent of something you'd hear in a 1960's laundry detergent commercial.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Love this book series. Spend an afternoon reading this book and you will be hooked. This is a series of books that starts with outlander. It is historic romance with time travel. Love it! Looking forward to the new books to tv series out next year 2014.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This was about the third &#34;Camel Club&#34; book that I have read and I thought it was very good.  Definitely a page turner with a lot of twists and turns.  It was hard to figure out what was going on and why.  Great to the very end.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book totally shifted my perception of how success happens. It helped me to realize that there are a multitude of factors at work in the manufacturing of success.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome  so much fun to play on a boring day.<br />I love this game I..can't  get enough of it. So suggest playing it
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A lighter look at older-than-usual characters finding their ways through post-retirement.  Some embracing the freedom of new experiences, some finishing previously unfinished business, and some shrinking away from change to the security of the known.  Endearing.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Funny, sad, funny, funny, funny. I love Allie and I love how she expresses through words and MS Paint some heartfelt emotions and some downright ridiculous (and embarrassingly relatable) stories.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install, met our needs .Easy to use .We just love it.Recommend it .The price is right. Just click and buy.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm enjoying playing.  It has nice graphics.  I'm still in the learning process.  Frustrating a little when you have to wait to be recharged.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found myself lost in this book. I had to read it slow because as long as I was reading he was still alive to me. I learned MANY things I never knew about him. To me he was amazing. I can only imagine what he could have come up with if he had had twenty more years to live. Walter Isaacson did a tremendous job with this book. I seldom ever read a book twice but I will definitely be reading this one again.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love it best seek game ever don't want to stop playing ever play it you won't be able to put it down
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great transaction and delivery. Once again I didn't know an English paper was required to give a rating to a selled.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Give me more!!!  What a genius!  Enjoyed each story so much.  Will read this book again and again.  Required reading!
B004GNFSO0|2.0|too dry for me - lost interest and could not get past the first chapter - hate to do that to a book but after three tries I gave up
B00EFFVZIM|5.0|This is just my personal opinion but I love this band. They produce catchy tunes that are hard not to sing along with and I have yet to receive an album from them that I don't like every single song on. This particular album stays in my car for long road trips (which I take often) as the upbeat music makes staying awake behind the wheel a lot easier. : ) I particularly like the use of a sweeping orchestra accompaniment in the song 'Show Me Love (America)'. It's by and large my favorite track on the album. I also quite love the track 'Demons'. Good job, The Wanted! I look forward to your next album release and will likely add that one to my car collection, too.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you liked the first two books I can't see how you wouldn't like this one.  The characters, the plot, the messages.... all well developed.  The back and forth perspective with Four and Tris was maybe a little different approach than the other books, but it worked just fine.  I was a little worried going in, with the relatively low rating of this book, but just like the other two I read it in a couple days.  Quick read, great little series!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|As long as you have an internet connection, Evernote is a great app. I wish I could freehand my words instead of having to type them.
0896898288|2.0|Sorely disappointed in the patterns. There are no dimensions shown on the pattern pieces, so you have to actually print one. Furthermore, you have to print each pattern piece separately. You should be able to print several on one page for each pattern.
0316204366|5.0|Excellent and engrossing book. The author keeps the chapters pivoting around the title of the book, keeping the chapters in perspective.
B00947N6UG|4.0|My children, ages 3 and 4.5, are nuts about this movie!  I don't remember Jack Frost being a thing when I was a kid, but my daughter is really into him and to find him at the center of this movie is a real treat.  From my point of view, this movie just teeters on the line of being too scary for young kids, but my children handle it well enough.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the characters are portrayed--Alec Baldwin as North is probably my favorite.  I don't know if this is going to be a franchise or not, but my kids just want more of it!
055358202X|5.0|I noticed several people rated this book in the series lower than the others. It did go off the main characters a lot... but I have a feeling it is background information that we will be needing in the next book :)<br />Plus, I like Cersi even less than I did before<br />I, for one enjoyed reading about the Dorn area - we did not know a whole lot about them before - and I think they are an important part of the story<br />Samwell has come a long way and I could tell that he was being set up for a bigger role in the future book<br />I think the people who did not like the book as well  - are just impatient to get to the &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; instead of learning about the different areas that will later play a more integral role  :)<br />5 stars for me<br />I have ordered book 5 - but it has not arrived yet<br />When is book 6 coming out?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. So glad it's finally available for the Kindle!!  Now it's on my phone, kindle and laptop - entertainment on the go!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this stupid game. when I was introduced to it, I couldn't imagine getting addicted to a silly game but I'm completely hooked now!
1419702238|4.0|My sons loved to read the book like the previous ones. I am not very impressed by the book though.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use Google regularly for searches - nice to have it availble on the Kindle Fire.<br />Google is easy to use and provides high quality searches.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|EMINEM 's sequel to 2000'S Marshall Mathers LP.<br />This album is outrageously good, and he's stepped up his game alot.<br />I didn't find a song on it that i didn't like.

B0042JTDXK|4.0|My wife loves Josh Groban, not as good as his earlier work but still very nice to listen to .
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Alright read...first one was better but the second is still enjoyable. It's cool when u r in the mood for something not too heavy
B005MMY9A8|5.0|One of the best super hero films made. I can't wait to get the second movie when it is released.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Country, mixed with rock. Three of each. Sound quality good. I bought this without really looking at the content; however, I can skip to the good parts and enjoy it while I ride. I will wait for the release of the later discs and hope they have more long songs and guitar work. Still a fan and always will be.  6 December: Upon further review, the final cut, \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\", is a SMOKIN' hot number with all the great guitar work that Mr. Young is known for producing! This makes it all worthwhile.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for showing what all it takes to rake care of a horse. It is a fun app that any age can enjoy. It is educational and wonderful especially if you are considering getting a horse. Highly recommend this app!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandson loves this game! He would play it all day if we let him. I'm pretty amazed at the quality of the graphics.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Protects my Kindle Fire device, but I would like it to have a larger and more stable stand as well as a place for a stylus.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Absolutely inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.  This book will make you want to be a better person!  God Bless his family.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a very good book containing some insights for me.  I have a new understanding of each of these men.
B00F9F1G4U|5.0|Simple and effective WIFI speed test tool. Ridiculously easy to use! It looks great on my Kindle Fire.It's nice to be able to compare the WIFI performance of various devices with this free tool.
159463176X|5.0|After months of waiting for it, And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini finally came in from the library!  And it was worth the wait for sure!<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed is a story about family and connections, about having and loss, about remembering and forgetting. . . It's amazing.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini really did it again with this one.  I loved The Kite Runner, enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I have to say that And the Mountains Echoed lived up to the author's fabulous reputation as a writer.<br /><br />This book should be on your to-read list.  And so should his other novels, especially The Kite Runner.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this author is how much he reminds me, as an American, that the Afghani people are people, people who need help, who struggle, who are good inside.  I'm not saying I didn't know this before, but based on the news, sometimes it's easier to forget about all of the innocent people in a country.  Hosseini reminds readers of humanity.<br /><br />Have you read anything by Hosseini?  Have a favorite?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a easy to play game. Hasn't had any problems.  My wife plays it all the time.  Would buy again from MobilityWare
B00D1VKZ3M|3.0|Bridget is back in true form, a little older and the world has moved on as she tries to adapt to the new dating rules. Enjoyed it immensely.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I have been meaning to read this book for years! I am not disappointed although I found the India part a little uninteresting and long but I guess it was an essential part of her journey. E. Gilbert's writing is very honest and touching which makes this book a great read. Her evolution as a person is incredible and very inspiring.
B00D555BBU|5.0|It worked perfectly the first time and was easy to set up. I could never get the Kindle email handler to work with either of my email accounts.
B00C49H3WI|1.0|I guess in England, they haven't discovered forensics yet. Assuming someone's identity isn't that easy.<br />----<br />All the evidence collected at a scene must be transported to a facility where it can be described, photographed and labelled under secure and confidential conditions. Any human remains go to a medical facility, usually a morgue, for an autopsy (Greek for ‘seeing for oneself’). Also known as a postmortem, an autopsy is normally performed by a pathologist, a medical doctor who specialized in the study and diagnosis of diseases. Other professionals like odontologists (dental specialists), anthropologists (if the body is decomposed), or radiologists may also be asked to examine the remains. Any obvious medical conditions will be recorded, and radiographs of the mouth and body are taken. If possible, they will collect fingerprints and samples for DNA analysis.<br />---<br /><br />I had high hopes for this series. After the first 20 minutes, I can't wait to get it over with. Sad, very sad. The  minute that body hit the coroner the identity would have been immediate right after running the prints. Shoddy and epically fail.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|We have watched the entire 8 seasons now! Thoroughly loved them!! I wish he was back! We don't get cable or dish so we only have regular channels. We watched 24 during those &#34;lulls&#34; in regular programming! Well worth it!
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is one of the best storytellers out there.<br /><br />The best part of reading King’s book is that he takes into a new world about which you had not idea and then he makes it real for you.<br />Sure all of us have been to amusement parks but have we ever thought about day to day life of young workers (greenies).<br />This book explores the ‘summer job’ of a young man in an amusement (not theme) park with a background of mystery and some supernatural aspect.<br />The aspects of mystery and supernatural are so faded in the background that they seem not to be part of the story.<br />This is one of those coming-of-age stories which once again prove that King is not exclusively a horror writer.<br /><br />Highly recommended for King’s fans.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app! It is very easy to use, has a lot of options and features, my pictures turn out great! I would recommend this app for simple and quick fixes to any picture! Thanx Photo Editor+!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a story of tragedy, loss and the insane desire for power and dominance!  God forbid our world would ever come to this... so little regard for human life... especially that of children!
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Nyland was crippled by grief when her mother died at the tender young age of 45. Barely a woman herself, Cheryl had no clue how to go on with her life without her rock, the one person who had taken care of her during all the tough times they’d encountered. Without her mother around to bond them together, Cheryl’s relationship with her family—her brother, sister, and stepfather—disintegrated. She singlehandedly destroyed her marriage with a series of one-night flings with random men who meant nothing to her. When the meaningless sex no longer comforted her, she turned to Heroin in an effort to ease her pain. Four years after her mother died, desperate to save herself from her own self-destruction, Cheryl quit her job, sold all her belongings, and began an eleven hundred mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />When Cheryl divorced her first husband, Paul, the state of Minnesota gave her the option of choosing the surname she would use going forward. Instead of returning to her maiden name, she created a new name for herself, a new identify for her new life. She felt the word “strayed” defined her lifestyle. Not only did she consider herself a stray, a homeless waif, she also had strayed from her journey in life.<br /><br />Cheryl was totally unprepared to hike eleven hundred miles on the PCT. She bought plenty of gear, so much that she couldn’t lift her backpack, but she did absolutely nothing to get into shape physically. Despite her aching muscles, the blisters on her body, and her toenails that turn black and fell off from wearing too-small boots, she never gave up. She hiked through rain, snow, and scorching summer temperatures, making friends with all sorts of interesting people along the way. At times she only had pennies to her name, not even enough money to buy a bottle of Snapple Lemonade, the thing she craved the most while she was on the trail. A group of men, the three young bucks as they were known on the trail, dubbed Cheryl the Queen of the PCT, because people were always offering her free meals and places to shower and camp along the way.<br /><br />From the start, Cheryl was never afraid to be alone. In some ways, her journey reminds me of a wilderness programs for troubled youth. With her life stripped of all modern conveniences, Cheryl was forced to live off the land with only the bare necessities to survive.<br /><br />I admire the courage it took for Cheryl to go it alone on the PCT, but mostly I admire the courage it took for her to be so brutally honest in writing about the darkest years of her life.the Queen of the PCT, because people were always offering her free meals and places to shower and camp along the way.<br /><br />From the start, Cheryl was never afraid to be alone.

0744014956|5.0|I usually get strategy guides after I beat the game, but with a GTA game, I get them for checking out all the vehicles and weapons. This guide is very helpful and only have a couple things I wish would have been added, one was info about online play, just the simple stuff and also more on the specific vehicle upgrades, yes the show some, but not all. Like I said though, not a big deal and is a very good guide. I bought the guide for around $12, but worth $20, wouldn't pay the full price of $37 for it though.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a good book. I loved it and cherished it. It's sad but funny and romantic. It made me cry in the end a good book
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|No problems renting and enormously enjoyed that it was part of the Prime program since my cable provider wanted to charge me to see the movie.
0393317552|1.0|This &#34;analysis&#34; will only be compelling to you if you already believe in its conclusion: The &#34;west&#34; was just lucky. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. For instance, China had it all. But why did they throw it all away? Culture. Culture matters and is not just a dependent variable. In any case, this book is naive in the extreme, from the very beginning. Author asserts that natives don't strike him as primitive. Anecdotal observation is sufficient? Scholarly works like &#34;IQ and the wealth of nations&#34; suggest otherwise.
B00CMQX84A|3.0|Where to begin.....First I thought this movie was a knock off and pretty bad one at that of the Movie Grease!!!! I loved Ross although the tap dancing scene was well ouch to his acting.... OH and the ACTING are they acting or are they really that stupid back in the 60's???? Tanner was handsome but wow all beauty no brains and Maia was a super bad actor I well never buy any more movies with her in it that is for sure... though I would buy a cd from her she has a beautifull voice but baddddddddddd actor!!!! I bought this movie because although it was really bad it made me laugh at how dumb they played their parts the only believable actors was Ross and one of the suffers SeaCat really liked him he was so real....anyways my advise if you are just a ross fan or love to laugh because its so stupid get it like I did but if &#34;acting&#34; stupid is not your things and you want to watch a believable movie then this isn't for you &#34;Your pretty smart&#34; says Maia to Tanner he replies &#34;yeah but more pretty!&#34; =0 wow so dumb and there are a lot of this going on in this Disney movie Don't get me wrong I bought it after waiting two and a half months on Disney I bought it anyways but that is because Im a die Hard Ross Lynch Fan!!!
B00133KFGW|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Excellent acting and story-telling.  Greatly enjoyed.  Child stayed true to himself despite others trying to get him to deny himself.
B001N09BDS|5.0|What a life! What a story! What an amazing movie!!!<br />Definitely one of Leonardo Dicaprio's best movies. Martin Scorsese is King in making movies. That's for sure.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Easy set up.  Works without a hitch  The perfect addition for mobile devices to add storage at a very reasonable price.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Some features do not work properly and I keep getting android alerts to update but the Kindle version is not the most current.
141694737X|5.0|My two year old grandson never tires of this book.  The story is simple, but the pictures teach so many different labels and concepts (e.g., prepositions, size descriptors, etc.).  I love to read it with him, focusing on a different concept with each read.
B000T433CO|5.0|This has to be one of my very favorite movies.  After seeing it in the theater, I purchased it for a friend for last Christmas.  I still need to purchase one for myself as it is definitely a &#34;keeper&#34;.
B005HHSYMW|5.0|This is a book that gives us both understanding and hope in humanity.  I think I like our race better after reading it.  Astonishingly wel backed up by research and data, I hope more books were written this thoroughly.
1603427244|4.0|I like this book. I am new at knitting and this book makes learning pretty easy. It got to me very quickly, too.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|Fantastic walkthrough of what we know of the universe, going into enough detail for the fan, but not so much to put the layman off.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|My daughter and I downloaded this to play and it didn't keep either of our attention for too long. We played through the games to open new ones but there comes a point where you don't understand what to do, it becomes too hard and you eventually have to stop playing. I liked that there were a lot of different kinds of games, but you get little to no direction on how to play any of them and just have to figure it out. If you can't figure it out, or aren't good at it, you're screwed. This game has to be for the right person, not for us.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although a bit too simple and perfect story, Card presents a believable word with very good characters and fantastic epic scenes and situations.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book within a matter days! I loved this book. Just as good as I thought it would be and definitely kept my interest to the end. I'm glad I bought and got to read it. I will probably re-read it soon and recommend it to others I know. I would highly advise reading this if you're looking for a new book to keep you interested.
0525478817|5.0|&#34;McDougal, the always wonderful and talented, brings us yet another great book. Completely jumping away from his earlier work of writing about mathematics, he takes his knowledge of infinities and applies it with a very clever and steady hand. Also, the wonderful twist of having another author's name on the cover is a brilliant ploy and actually a hidden code. [Check the forums to catch up on the attempts, thus far.]<br /><br />I would love to know if anyone can point me in the direction of his infamous &#34;McDougal Donut&#34; shirt. Everywhere I seem to look hasn't received it, and everyone I ask hasn't heard of it.&#34;
B00AFROVQC|1.0|It was cringingly clichè, it had a pathetic storyline. Unbearingly predictable, this is indubitably the worst book I've ever read.
1933952806|5.0|Young pens as good a book as anyone. Its much better than reading the manual, and has helpful pictures. Anyone buying a modern DSLR should order a dedicated guide at the same time, and this book is as good as any and better than most. (I've bought a few with different cameras) Digital Darrell knows his stuff and will get you up and running in an evening....
B0094K1MH2|4.0|exciting thriller, great writing, captivating... great animation.. no bad language.  This is a must see for 10+ boys.  Highly recommended and worth your time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I'll admit it was hard to read at first. But as a required read in school I decided to read it many times to grasp its concept. On the second and third way through pieces seemed to fall together. By the fourth time through I began to love it and understand the dark humor. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Germany during the holocaust and to those looking for a unique read.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Must see for everyone, possibly as good a tv gets. great cast great story. after a year i need to have another weekend of West Wing
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Has every episode, well sectioned off into six sections. Great quality of sleeves and case. The discs are gorgeous. As far as the DVD content goes, it has every episode plus commentary and special effects sprinkled within. There's also a special features disc at the end which I would not recommend watching until you've seen every episode. All in all, a high quality set for the best show on television.
B006O6F932|5.0|I could not have asked for a better price on this item.It is truelly wonderful for little girls that love Monster High. My daughter is so happy with this and has the best time playing with it.
B00GP3NCYC|5.0|GREAT. I loved it at the theatre with the kids so we put it on our shelf at home and enjoy here as well. When it's good, real good, we call it a &#34;SHELF MOVIE&#34;.  &#34;:{D
0689835604|5.0|Just what I wanted and it was delivered on time and on target, it is what it's suppose to be. So what more can I say
B009GEEMLY|5.0|i just loved this movie. it was funny and entertaining its one of those movies you could watch over and over
B003CSV7TK|4.0|Good movie and is in black and white or color.  One of my favorite holiday movies that you can watch during Thanksgiving weekend since it starts with the Macy's parade.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out!!! I seen it in theaters when it first came out and then purchased the DVD (not something I normally do).
1439153663|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book - made history come alive for me.  Cannot wait to discuss with my book club!  Dark material for sure but this is a dark time in our history.  I found it to be thought provoking and enlightening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun time killer that doesn't cost anything unless you're a dork lol. I havent psent any money and it is still fun
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Wow!!! Beware!<br />Like normal I buy all seasons cause I hate commercials. I had heard from soooooooooo many friends that it just sucked. Terrible ending to a wonderful series. Son friends just thought your gonna hate this season. So, maybe in a year if there is not anything to watch as the price comes down, I will watch it, or see if it is as bad as it has been described. Appreciate those that came out to warn me!!!!.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome I was looking for fighting games saw real steel and I'm like isn't that a movie but it is awesome and so addicting
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This movie was terrible.  Why does it have to be made contemporary?  It would have been fine being a period piece.  I turned it off 1/2 hour in.
0385351399|4.0|Certainly an intriguing premise to ponder....  I think that some who rate this poorly ignore it's importance in the message.  The technology exists (or could be developed within the next 10 years) to provide most of the functionality portrayed in the book. Anyone who has watched Futurescape (with James Woods) should be able to figure that out.  Concentrated in the wrong hands, it could be used for the wrong purposes. This is truly the dark side of technology.<br /><br />The characters were shallow - regardless of whether they were the good or bad guys.  The ending was somewhat predictable. Are people in their 20's really that shallow? Somehow, I doubt it.<br /><br />However, it earned 4 stars from me for it's implications and parallels. Combine Amazon, Google and Facebook - add some more functionality - combine it with a centralized one-payer healthcare system and then sell it to the government and ......
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|Not available to customers in the U.S.? Is this an error? If not, for which countries is this free version of the game intended?<br /><br />Thanks!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had a Nnetgear ptv2000 and I foolishly upgraded my computer to Windows 8.1. The Netgear device stopped working and no one could get it to sync, although my computer found the device it would not connect. Dell kindly upgraded me to a Netgear ptv3000 which Netgear assures me is 8.1 compatible. It might be, but not on my computer. After days of tech support from Dell and Netgear I threw in the towel and bought the Chromecast. Setup took perhaps five minutes total and it works flawlessly. If you use it through the Google Chrome browser, you can mirror the internet and you don't even need to use the app. I haven't tried the apps yet, but I am so thrilled to get something up and working without hours of tech support.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So, for obvious reasons this book has gotten very mixed reviews. As depressed as I was, I really appreciated reading a writer who had the guts to end a series like that and stay true to the characters and story she developed. If you really sat and thought about it, Tris and Tobias were never going to have a &#34;happily ever after.&#34; They were not that kind of couple, people! Their lives and relationship were full of tragedy. No Disney-fied ending here and the book was better for it.<br /><br />As far as dual-viewpoint narration goes, I typically find it very annoying, especially in the final novel in a series. That being said, this one wasn't SO bad (though that is why I took one star off). Some reviewers thought Tobias sounded &#34;whiny&#34; but the insecurities and issues he has are what drive him and make him the person Tris sees in the first two books. I thought there was a good distinction between their two voices telling the story as well.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a fitting end to an excellent trilogy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|His main characters were interesting and the plot kept moving directions.  Enjoyed the tricks played on the FBI who deserved it.
1439199388|3.0|It's really exciting that someone has written a book for laypeople about our symbiotic relationships with micro-organisms in our guts and such. I know the author is a respected science journalist contributing articles to newspapers such as the New York Times, and it's clear that he has done a lot of research for this book, but unfortunately I think that his journalist writing style is a little bit too sensational and lacks the organizational structure necessary for a non-fiction book of this type.<br /><br />The book would have been more useful to me and more persuasive if the author had organized the book like an essay, with an introduction that lays out the point he is going to make and the supporting arguments. Then there should be one chapter on each of the supporting arguments.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!!!!!! I really like the goals that you can complete! I also like that we can change. Dave's outfit
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You can't go wrong with a John Grisham book - and this one didn't disappoint.  Enjoyed every chapter - very well written.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|This flick should've been a comedy. Ridiculous. I laughed  out loud several times during silly situations. Don't waste your time or money.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of those albums that I can't listen to enough.  I enjoy everything Mumford & Sons puts out.  This is a must have for any music collector!
B00ANY7V8M|3.0|This is much smaller than I expected.  It came in a bag instead of a box.  It goes with Lego's &#34;Friends&#34; series.  I am sure my Granddaughter will like it.  Time will tell on Christmas.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The app itself has good graphics but to advance you have to keep upgrading your rifle, ie...buying more specialized equipment for it or eventually you can't kill anything.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book left me wanting more. I cant believe there are only 3 there is no way that this is story is going to answer all the questions that i have. Very excited for the next installment.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|Very well done and with a lot of nice extras including a 2008 reunion of some of the extras in the party scene!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great young adult read. i recommend reading these before seeing the books cause the movies just do not compare! I'm super ready for the second one.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I have the original DVD that I bought around 2003 or so and this version with the blue ray is much more colorful and with even better sound quality!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My hear is broken that this is the last installment. I want more! I loved the books and this finished of the story line so well that i am appeased. if you read one and 2 this is a must!
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|This is my very first blue ray audio disc and with the 5.1 mix it is superb!<br />I started out with 4.0 Quadrophonic 8 Tracks in 1973 so 40 years later we have come to this. I had the vinyl record of Moondance in 1970 when it first came out. Then I got a CD of it around 1988 or so.<br />I have a good collection of super audio and DVD audio Multi-Track discs.<br />This is one of my best to say the least.<br />The mix is fantastic and created by one of the best.<br />I grabbed it for a great buy too as I noticed that it went up right after I bought it.<br />It's still worth the money if you are a fan.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is really cool! If you don't have it, you should get it. If you are looking for a cool game, get this.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I have a fairly good collection of Blue Rays and this is now one of my best! I actually added two speakers to my home theater to get the 7.1 surround mix and I am so glad that I did!<br />I watched all of the extras and about the restoration and what a surprise in the sound quality and depth and also the picture quality is just wonderful! I also love the plot and the music.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is the best novel I read in 2013, and certainly one of the best I've read in the past decade. As you probably are aware, it was recently awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.<br /><br />It's rare that a novel containing such horror, tragedy and sadness could be considered so engaging, but Johnson has managed to pull it off. We follow the life of an orphan in North Korea who has survived a harsh upbringing full of dangerous work assignments, starvation and abuse and now, as a young man, is put to work by the state doing various nefarious tasks. We see right away that he and the majority of his countrymen have little actual choice when it comes to participation in such acts. This man, who has never known parents, never known love and has only known faint glimmers of hope endures a journey that takes him from the lowest of lows to the only highs that he's ever experienced in his short life. Along the way, the reader gets a glimpse of North Korea from the suffering masses in the gulags to the privileged in Pyongyang. The result is a work of fiction from which it is difficult to turn away and which will definitely leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />Johnson does an incredible job of showing the humanity in the North Korean society amid the seemingly hopeless situation in which they are trapped. It becomes an exercise in thought about self determination, free will, freedom, opression and redemption. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough. In fact,if I could only recommend one book this year, it would be The Orphan Master's Son.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I personally didn't like it. Everyone was &#34;raving&#34; about it so I read it, but I didn't personally like it.
